40|$|Chicken eggs {{represent}} {{an important source}} of protein to the growing human population and also supply repositories of unique genes that could be used worldwide. The inheritance of <b>shank</b> <b>feathering</b> trait is dominant upon non-feathering shank trait in chicken which is based on two factors: pti- 1 L and pti- 1 B that are located on Chromosomes 13, 15, and 24. Using 185 fertile eggs collected from two genetic lines (<b>shank</b> <b>feathering</b> and non-feathering <b>shank)</b> of White Kurdish chicken, we found that egg weight highly (P < 0. 01) correlated with yolk weight (r 2 = 0. 520, 0. 704, respectively), albumen weight (r 2 = 0. 918, 0. 835), and shell weight (r 2 = 0. 626, 0. 225). The first two principal components explained the greatest variance in both the White with <b>shank</b> <b>feathering</b> (85. 6 % of total variance) and non-feathering shank (76. 5 %). Therefore, differences in the component traits of the eggs between the two genetic lines may be influenced by the same gene actions as <b>shank</b> <b>feathering</b> trait. According to these results, the two genetic lines of Kurdish chicken yield significant differences in the internal traits of eggs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{degree of}} {{asymmetry}} in bilateral morphological characters may reflect genetic and en-vironmental stressors. Shank length and diameter, weight {{and length of}} the first primary wing feather, and distance between the junction of upper and lower mandibles and auditory canal (face length) were used to classify bilateral types and measure relative asymmetry (RA) in six genetic stocks. The stocks were the S 23 generation of White Leghorn lines selected for high or low antibody response to SRBC, sublines in which selection had been relaxed for eight generations, and reciprocal crosses of the selected lines. Differences were found among all stocks for the traits measured. Rankings among traits for RA in descending order were face length, <b>shank</b> diameter, <b>feather</b> weight, and <b>shank</b> and <b>feather</b> lengths. The RA of <b>shank</b> and <b>feather</b> lengths {{did not differ from}} each other. An overall RA composed of mean RA of the five traits showed that the two selected lines exhibited greater RA than the crosses between them. The RA of the two lines where selection had been relaxed was similar to that of selected lines. This research suggests that an overall RA created as a combination of RA of several bilateral traits can be a valid measure of genetic stress in chickens and provides a method of comparing developmental stability among populations. (Key words: chicken, bilateral asymmetry, genetic stress, homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Fifty game {{pheasants}} {{were kept}} to 8 weeks in confinement housing and later maintained outdoors in a partially roofed aviary. Pheasants received commercial feed mixtures ad libitum. Body weight and dimensions were determined every 4 weeks. Ten pheasants {{were selected for}} slaughter {{at the end of}} 18 and 20 weeks each. After slaughter, their heads, <b>shanks,</b> <b>feathers,</b> blood, inedible viscera and major internal organs were weighed and digestive tract separated and measured. The carcasses were dissected. Higher body weights and daily gains were found in males than in females on all test days during rearing to 20 weeks of age. Compared to females, males had significantly longer keel from 4 weeks, longer lower thighs and shanks from 8 weeks, and longer trunk with and without neck and greater chest circumference from 12 weeks of age. Older pheasants had a significantly lower proportion of feathers and blood, and higher content of inedible viscera, with significantly relatively shorter (cm 100 g b. w. − 1) small intestine, caecum and rectum in males than in females. With advancing age, there was a decrease in the proportion of gizzard (significant) and liver, and in males {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of testicles...|$|R
40|$|Finding {{the genes}} that {{underlie}} variation in production and developmental traits has important economic applications. Incubation behaviour represents a loss of production in conventional breeds of chicken adapted to local conditions and was what motivated this thesis. The Mendelian traits of comb type, crest, Silkie and normal feathers, feathered leg, fibromelanosis, comb colour, skin and <b>shank</b> colour, <b>feather</b> colour and patterns are of interest because of the insight they give to genes and development and were also investigated in the thesis. We used White Leghorn and Silkie lines of chicken to detect the genetic loci controlling incubation behaviour and Mendelian traits using linkage based analysis in an F 2 cross. The evidence for QTL affecting incubation status over the whole period on chromosome 5 was strong (P< 0. 05). After the addition of 218 new informative SNP markers across the genome including chromosome 5 the 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a series of experiments conducted to study developmental stability of various genetic stocks at different stages in the life cycle. The primary measures of stability were type and degree of asymmetry of bilateral traits and heterosis. Higher relative asymmetry (RA), which was defined as (|L-R| / [(L+R) / 2]) x 100, was observed in lines of White Leghorns selected 23 generations for high or low antibody response to sheep red blood cells than in their F 1 crosses. The bilateral traits were 39 -day shank length and length and weight of the first primary wing <b>feather.</b> <b>Shank</b> length was again measured on day 49 while body, heart, shank, and lung weights and ceca lengths were obtained on day 56. Heterosis was positive for organ sizes and negative for degree of RA. Shank length and diameter, weight and length of the firs...|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} {{characterization}} of local chicken eco-type for functional traits and production system {{was conducted at}} Fogera woreda of the Amhara National Regional state. Fogera woreda {{is one of the}} eight woredas bordering Lake Tana and it is predominantly classified as woinadega ecology while the annual temperature ranges form 22 ºC to 29 ºC. The survey report based on 72 household having chickens revealed that the flock size rage from 1 to 39. The nutritional management practices in the study area were of scavenging (main practice) and supplementary feeding. Wells and tap were the major sources of water. Most of the respondents (59. 7 %) used separate houses constructed exclusively for poultry. The flock management was without separation of sex or age groups and mating was random and nonseasonal. The prices of live chickens were affected by plumage color, comb type and seasonal demands (holidays and fasting seasons). Disease and shortage of supplementary feeds were the two major production barriers of expanding poultry production. Out of the 100 birds studied, the following plumage color pattern was observed in their respective proportions: complete white (Netch) (23 %), complete black (Tikure) (7 %), complete red (key) (39 %), white with black or red tips (Netch Teterma) (4 %), grayish mixture (Gebsima) (5 %), red with white trips (key teterma) (2 %), black with white tips (Tikure teterma) (2 %) white with Brest part golden color (Libework) (8 %), multi color (Anbsema) (2 %), white with red strips (seran) (4 %), and red brownish (Kokima) (4 %). In term of body shape, most of the chicken population observed had a body shape of wedge and a crest (Gutya) head profile. Almost all of the male chicken had spur, while only half of the female chicken had spur. No <b>shank</b> <b>feather</b> was observed both in Male and Female chicken. For mature hens and cocks, the average shank length was 7. 25 cm and 9. 32 cm, respectively. The average body length was 17. 75 cm and 21 cm for female and male, respectively. The ratio of cock to hen was found to be 1 : 3. 21. On the other hand, the effective population size (Ne) and rate of change in inbreeding coefficient (F) per year were 3. 9 and 1. 95, respectively. The monitoring data revealed that average number of eggs laid per clutch per hen was 13. 19, while the average number of eggs incubated was 12. 97, average number of chicks hatched was 10. 23, the average number of chicks weaned was 7. 63, the average of hen’s age was 19. 20 months and average weight of hens was 1. 21 kg. The performance of egg production characters egg weight, yolk color, yolk weight albumin weight, shell weight and shell thickness were, 44. 89 m, 9. 06, 16. 28 gm, 22. 13 gm, 5. 52 gm, and 0. 45 cm, respectively. On the other hand, the dressing percentage was found to be 58. 5 % for male and 49. 38 % for Female. All these findings indicated that the local eco-type, despite the relatively high temperature (it goes up to 30 ºC) and the swampy (wet land) Fogera plain have good potential for egg and meat production. Thus they could be used in other places with similar weather and environmental conditions. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|R
30|$|At {{the end of}} the experiment, four {{randomly}} selected birds’(two males and two females) with body weight close to the average of the group were taken from each replicate, starved for 12  h, weighed immediately before slaughter, exsanguinated by severing the neck, and dry de-feathered by hand plucking. Birds were eviscerated and carcass cuts and non-edible offal components were determined according to the procedure described by Kekeocha (1985). Dressed weight was measured after the removal of blood and feather and the dressing percentage was calculated as the proportion of dressed carcass weight to slaughter weight. Eviscerated carcass weight was determined after removing blood, <b>feather,</b> <b>shank,</b> head, kidney, lungs, pancreas, crop, proventriculus, small intestine, large intestine, caeca and urogenital tracts. The eviscerated percentage was determined as the proportion of slaughter weight. From eviscerated carcass weight drumstick, thigh, breast meat, heart, gizzard and liver were separated, weighed and calculated as a percentage of slaughter weight. Fat around the proventriculus, gizzard, against the abdominal wall and the cloacae were separated, weighed and expressed as a percentage of slaughter weight.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In this study, we {{investigated}} the differentiation of five different chicken ecotypes - Center, North, South, West, and East - of Saudi Arabia using discriminate analysis. The analysis {{was based on}} nine important morphological and phenotypic traits: body color, beak color, earlobe color, eye color, shank color, comb color, comb type, comb size, and feather distribution. There was a strong significant relationship between the phenotype and effect of geographic height in terms of comb type and earlobe color in males as well as body, beak, eye, and shank color. In particular, the comb type and earlobe color differentiated the ecotypes of males. Among the females, the beak, earlobe, eye, <b>shank</b> color, and <b>feather</b> distribution had more differentiating power. Moreover, the discriminant analysis revealed that the five ecotypes were grouped into three clusters; the Center and the North in one cluster, the West and the South ecotypes in the second for males, and the East ecotype in the last cluster. The female dendogram branching {{was similar to the}} male dendrogram branching, except that the Center ecotype was grouped with the North instead of the South. The East ecotype was highly discriminated from the other ecotypes. Nevertheless, the potential of recent individual migration between ecotypes was also noted. Accordingly, the results of the utilized traits in this study might be effective in characterization and conservation of the genetic resources of the Saudi chicken...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{chickens}} in Kenya {{are about}} 22 million and are kept by 90 % {{of the rural}} communities in small flocks of up to 30 birds mainly under free range system. The industry is flexible and {{does not require a}} lot of space. When people retire or are retrenched they easily start poultry keeping. Distinct indigenous chicken ecotypes have been identified and named. The names are phenotypic descriptions of the birds. The names used to describe the common phenotypes in Kenya are-frizzled feathered, naked neck, barred <b>feathered,</b> <b>feathered</b> <b>shanks,</b> bearded and dwarf sized. The local ecotypes of the chickens vary in body size, conformation, plumage colour and performance. The birds are hardy and thrive under a harsh environment with minimal inputs. They get most of their feed from scavenging and may occasionally benefit from kitchen and other household wastes. Eggs and chicken meat contribute to the protein nutrition of the rural population thus alleviating malnutrition. Sales of eggs and meat earn and diversify incomes for rural households especially among women and children who control benefits accruing from the enterprise. It has also helped those affected and infected by HIV Aids because it does not involve a lot of hard work. Indigenous chicken in Kenya are about 76 % of the total poultry population and produce about 55 and 47 % of the total meat and eggs respectively. Productivity is low due to factors which include genotype, poor nutrition, diseases and management. Feed supplementation, provision of housing and disease control was found to improve growth rate and egg production...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenotypic}} characteristics, {{level of}} production, management system and {{contribution of the}} local chickens to household studied in the north central Namibia. The study involved both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather the data. The questionnaire was used for survey while phenotypic characteristics and egg production forms were used to collect the actual data. The findings revealed that farmers {{in the study area}} regarded chicken production as their primary source of domestic animal protein, with the domestic fowl being the most widely kept poultry species. Other uses are participation in socio-cultural ceremonies, selling for money and gifts. The average number of eggs per clutch ranged from 10 to 15. The hatchability ranged between 50 % and 60 %). Phenotypic characteristics measures revealed the absence of pure white plumage colour that can be associated with the introduction of White Leghorn to the flock. Generally, normal feather cover was the main feather morphology of local chicken populations in north central Namibia. However, features like crested heads, naked necked, frizzling, and <b>feathered</b> <b>shanks</b> occurred sporadically among local chickens in the study area. Fifty-seven percentages of chickens in the surveyed region had single comb, while 29. 6 % and 13. 8 % had rose and pea combs respectively. The most frequent shank colour was black followed by yellow, whitish, orange, and reddish shank. The wing span had positive correlation with body weight and chest circumference at (r = 0. 994). Other researchers discover the strong correlation of chest circumference with length shank at (r = 0. 827). The current study attained the mean body weight of 1. 7 to 2. 1 kg of both sexes combined which falls within the range of 1. 6 to 2. 18 kg reported by (Alabi et al. 2012). In conclusion, the current study revealed large variation of phenotypical characteristics with poor correlation to their productivity due to lack of record keeping although production forms were made available to the farmers. The part of productivity according to their identified phenotypic characteristics is not accepted nor rejected due to poor records, but recommended for further study with training on record keeping by farmersCollege of Agriculture and Environmental SciencesM.
