5|$|Albany Highway commences at The Causeway, a river {{crossing}} that connects to Perth's central business district. The highway heads south-east through Perth's metropolitan region, and continues through the southern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions to Albany {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. Albany Highway is generally a two-lane single carriageway road, but with additional lanes and dual-carriageway <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> Perth and Albany. The highway is allocated State Route30, except for bypassed <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> Perth, and the southernmost portion in Albany. The part bypassed by Kenwick Link is allocated Alternate State Route30, and a short length in Arthur River is concurrently allocated State Route107. Albany Highway also carries sections of Heritage Country Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive205) and Great Southern Tourist Way (Tourist Drive356).|$|E

5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential element of the system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Between Lake Michigan Beach and the {{northern}} terminus south of Mackinaw City, most of US31 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between the main highway and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

Derrick's platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.|$|E

5|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in finding a}} producer willing {{to take charge of}} the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed to head up the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks. Shinoda's rapping <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christener, {{who took part in the}} 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track “With You”.|$|E
5|$|From 1878, Fauré and {{his friend}} and ex-pupil André Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walküre at Cologne Opera; the {{complete}} Ring cycle in Munich and London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal. They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth, written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring. It consists of five short <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms. The manuscript (in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris) is in Messager's hand.|$|E
5|$|Highways in {{the state}} {{maintained}} by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane freeways. In addition to the Interstates, other trunklines are built to freeway standards. Sections of US10, US23, US31, US127 and US131 have been upgraded to freeway standards. All or part of several state trunklines are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, M-5, M-8 (Davison Freeway), M-10 (Lodge Freeway), M-14, M-39 (Southfield Freeway), M-53 (Van Dyke Freeway), and M-59 have such <b>sections.</b> <b>In</b> {{the rest of the}} state, M-6 near Grand Rapids, Conn. M-13 near Bay City, M-47 near Midland, M-60 near Jackson, and Bus. US131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways, for all or part of their respective lengths. Sections of US12, M-20, M-37, M-46, M-55, M-66 and US223 have been routed to run concurrently with other freeways as well.|$|E

5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels {{where this is}} the case, significant <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> Decay are dedicated to working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after Opposing Force, no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E
5|$|M-140 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-140 were the 10,176vehicles daily near in Watervliet; the lowest count was 1,536vehicles per day along Pokagon Road, on average. All of M-140 is a two-lane, undivided highway, except <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> cities like Watervliet which may have up to four lanes.

5|$|Segments of {{the road}} were {{upgraded}} in 1956 between Coopersville and Marne, Portland and Eagle, and Brighton and Farmington. By 1962, freeway construction allowed motorists to travel between Muskegon and the Lansing area on a freeway, bypassing the old Grand River Avenue route. The final connection between Lansing and Brighton was completed in late 1962. At that time, the US16 designation, which had been applied alongside the I-96 and I-196 designations, was decommissioned. Segments of the old highway were retained in the state highway system under different numbers. Sections through Portland, Lansing, Howell, Farmington and Detroit were given Business Loop (BL) or Business Spur (BS) I-96 designations. The section between Lansing and Webberville became part of an extended M-43. Other <b>sections</b> <b>in</b> the Detroit area became parts of M-102, M-5, or unsigned state highway.|$|E

Regular enemies are defeated by slide attacks and punches, while bosses requires the player to fling projectiles at them. Players earn combos by overthrowing enemies; almost hitting an obstacle or going through a ring also increases the player's combo count. <b>Sections</b> <b>in</b> which Spider-Man swings through streets, climbs the sides of buildings and free-falls from buildings are interspersed with the running portions of the game.|$|E
