Mylod also directed the previous episode, [...] "The Broken Man", for the sixth season. Mylod stated {{in an interview that}} the most physically challenging scene to direct was the chase scene, while the scene he was most scared to shoot was the conversation between Jaime and Edmure, stating that he felt the writing was [...] "so freaking good that I was <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> fucking it up." ...|$|E
500|$|When Paul is {{tormented by}} a group of {{homophobic}} men, Ivan steps in to rescue him. Brocklebank told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Ivan tells the men that if they have a problem they should take it out on him, not his boyfriend. This is the first time Ivan [...] "actually vocalises it" [...] and he is shocked because [...] "he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before". Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not ready to come out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conan Smith, a businessperson {{quoted in}} a 2012 article by The Ann Arbor News, stated the most {{significant}} reason Washtenaw County, including Ann Arbor, is not often included in definitions of Metro Detroit {{is that there is}} a [...] "lack of affinity that Washtenaw County as a whole has with Wayne County and Detroit or Oakland County and Macomb". Ann Arbor is nearly 43 miles by car from downtown Detroit, and developed separately as a university city, with its own character. Smith said that county residents [...] "just don't yet see ourselves as a natural part of that [...] region, so I think it feels a little forced to a lot of people, and they're <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{being tested}} for {{competing}} British television programme Top Gear, first broadcast on 11 November 2007, a floor panel came {{loose from the}} test vehicle as it was being driven at speed by Jeremy Clarkson, after he had already made a play of being <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> driving the car because of Plato's experience. Afterwards, {{there was a problem}} with the car's petrol injection system. In the same review, Clarkson mentioned two more incidents, one at the press launch, when [...] "some aspect of the front suspension came adrift" [...] while a Dutch journalist was driving, causing him to veer off road, and one at the Goodwood Festival of Speed when the throttle stuck open.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur is {{diagnosed}} with terminal cancer. Arfwedson {{said that her}} fictional counterpart cannot cope with his illness. She feels like a [...] "spectator" [...] watching on and unable to solve his problems. It really effects Zosia and she keeps her feelings hidden because she is so <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> Arthur's health. Having lost her mother and being unaware how advanced her cancer was, Zosia feels unequipped {{to deal with his}} prognosis and does not support him enough. Arthur's condition deteriorates and Zosia begins to unravel and it effects her work. The actress explained that Zosia is left fearing Arthur's illness will trigger a bipolar episode. She worries that if she fully acknowledges her best friend's condition then [...] "she'll spiral out of control." [...] Ostlere said that his character's death would create an interesting story for Zosia.|$|E

2500|$|Ward {{himself had}} {{been the subject of}} {{controversy}} in the past, and the riot became a cause to reflect on the negative aspects of his record as Commissioner. [...] After 10 people were shot in Brooklyn in 1984, nobody could find him for days. [...] He appeared drunk at a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association convention in 1984; under his watch in 1985, officers in Queens used stun guns on suspects and in 1986 officers in Brooklyn stole and sold drugs. [...] He was lambasted in 1987 for telling African American journalists that most crime in New York City was committed by young black men and later told black ministers in reference to that remark, [...] "our little secret is out." [...] He told a woman who was <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> a series of rapes that she was the type of woman a rapist would go after.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the label}} is usually applied in {{anticipation}} of the tournament rather than in retrospect. Simon Burnton comments, [...] "Inevitably, one of the big teams involved gets so <b>scared</b> <b>about</b> being in the Group of Death that they play really badly, meaning not only that they go home in disappointment and disgrace, but that the group turns out not to be so very troublesome after all.". David Lacey said, [...] "Draws may nominate a group of death but results decide its real mortality rating. [...] France and Argentina found this out in Japan." [...] Lacey also said, [...] "There are groups of death and groups of death wishes. In Euro 2000 Group D looked daunting but was shrugged aside by the Netherlands, the co-hosts, and France, the eventual champions, with the Czechs, runners-up in 1996, and the Danes, winners in 1992, offering scant resistance. Group A {{turned out to be the}} killer." ...|$|E

"I winna {{be called}} the deceased," [...] cried Agnes hotly, {{but she had to}} do as she was bid, and when she emerged, from behind the tree she was the very image of the ill-fated Gavinia. Stroke showed her a plan of Miss Ailie's backdoor, and also gave her a kitchen key (when he {{produced}} this, she felt in her pockets and then snatched it from him), after which she set out for the Dovecot in a <b>scare</b> <b>about</b> her own identity.|$|R

50|$|Kuran and Sunstein {{observe that}} {{availability}} entrepreneurs - activists who aim {{to control the}} content of public discourse - engineer availability cascades to further their own agendas. Their availability campaigns may do great harm. Many popular <b>scares</b> <b>about</b> innocuous products and insignificant dangers have been driven by campaigns that combine the spread of misinformation with the intimidation of doubters. Once public discourse turns {{in favor of the}} initiated agenda, fear feeds on itself, as expressed perceptions of danger shape the perceptions of others, and doubters silence themselves. Episodes of mass hysteria have lasting consequences for public policy and the law.|$|R

5000|$|Several <b>scares</b> <b>about</b> the {{increasing}} {{ability of the}} Soviet Union's strategic bomber forces surfaced during the 1950s. The defensive response by the United States was to deploy a fairly strong [...] "layered defense" [...] consisting of interceptor aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, like the Nike, and guns, like the Skysweeper, near larger cities. However, this was a small response compared {{to the construction of}} a huge fleet of nuclear bombers. The principal nuclear strategy was to massively penetrate the Soviet Union. Because such a large area could not be defended against this overwhelming attack in any credible way, the Soviet Union would lose any exchange.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that. I'm all right. There's {{nothing for}} you to be <b>scared</b> <b>about.</b> Things are going to turn out just as we have planned. As soon as I'm rested we'll make a break {{to get out of the}} country. Only now, right now, I must know the truth about you." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{general strike}} {{was called by}} the United Trade Union of Guinean Workers (the USTG) {{in an attempt to}} force the {{president}} to resign. Strike leaders said that Conté, who had ruled Guinea since seizing power in a 1984 coup, had become increasingly erratic. They cite repeated <b>scares</b> <b>about</b> his health, sudden and chaotic cabinet reshuffles and his recent personal intervention to free from jail two former allies accused of graft. [...] The two main opposition parties in the nation, the Rally for the Guinean People and the Union of Republican Forces supported the strike, as did the National Council of Civil Society Organisations group of NGOs and the newly formed Civic Alliance.|$|R
5000|$|He {{has been}} called [...] "the best known Presbyterian controversialist in the Restoration", and {{advanced}} a presbyterian position that was both royalist and anti-episcopal. He began a controversy with Bishop John Gauden respecting the solemn league and covenant, for the defence {{of which he was}} committed to the Tower of London. The date has been debated; he is recorded as sent to the Tower on 23 March 1661 (New Style). Daniel Neal's History of the Puritans states that this controversy took place before Crofton's ejectment, and that he was turned out of his parish despite his support for the Restoration. The arrest of Crofton came after mail was opened in a <b>scare</b> <b>about</b> presbyterian sentiment in the capital.|$|R

The branch then heads under the tracks east and under McCowan Road, before joining the west branch at [...] The entire length of the branch is artificially channelled and straightened, and much of it lined with a concrete bed. This was done in the 1970s after a <b>scare</b> <b>about</b> mosquitoes carrying encephalitis breeding in stagnant creek water (see also [...] "Threats from Development" [...] below). The total length is approximately 3.4 km.|$|R
