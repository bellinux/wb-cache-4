50|$|The tunnel will {{shorten the}} travel {{time for the}} Stadtbahn through the {{pedestrian}} zone and {{the stability of the}} timetable will improve. In addition, the platforms of the station's tunnel will have pedestals that are about 15 metres long with a height of 55 cm above the rail so that the first two doors of Stadtbahn trains will have <b>step-less</b> entry. This will make possible stepless entrance on lines S 4 / S 41 and S 5 / S 51 / S 52 in Karlsruhe for the first time, reflecting a trend that has long been standard elsewhere. The platforms cannot consistently have a height of 55 cm, because the tunnel will be used by trams and DC services of the Stadtbahn, which have an entry level on the modern lines of 34 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Electro 35 {{was introduced}} in 1966. It has a [...] "cold" [...] accessory shoe and the meter accepted film speeds from 12 to 400 ASA. Light levels are measured using a cadmium sulphide (CdS) photoresistor and powered by a mercury battery. The film speed adjustment is not implemented electronically; instead, a simple twin-bladed diaphragm closes {{in front of the}} light sensor as the film speed is reduced. The light metering electronics works by accumulating the measured light level and only releasing the shutter when it has determined enough light has fallen on the film. This system allows the shutter speed to be completely <b>step-less</b> and to adapt to changing light levels. SLRs would wait many years for a similar capability with off-the-film metering. The metering system can keep the shutter open for up to 30 seconds. Without a battery to power the meter, the shutter defaults to its top speed of 1/500 second.|$|E
5000|$|Glasgow's last Titan was {{its only}} PD3A; {{it was shown}} at the 1961 Scottish Motor Show, {{alongside}} the low-height derivative of the Titan designed for the Scottish Bus Group, the Lowlander. This was designed at Albion but production versions were assembled in Glasgow from CKD kits supplied by Leyland; it used the front-end structure of the PD3A almost unmodified but had a complex swept-down frame allowing a <b>step-less</b> forward entry. Three variants were built of four offered, all being air braked, and most had the GRP front. The exceptions were two full-fronted batches built for Ribble. In general those sold to SBG were badged Albion, and those sold in England were badged Leyland. Advances (on the Lowlander only) were an uprated [...] "power-plus" [...] O.600 developing 140 bhp and a dual-circuit braking system. Air suspension was optional on the rear axle, which was of the drop-centre type. The last large order for vacuum-braked Titans was from Edinburgh, which took 50 PD3/6 in 1964; the following year all vacuum-braked Titans were discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|All Lowlanders {{featured}} a ‘Power-Plus’ {{version of the}} Leyland O.600 diesel engine rated at 140 bhp at the same 2,000 rpm limit as the Titan’s 125 bhp; the Lowlander also {{featured a}}s standard a dual-circuit air brake system, which latter did not appear on the Titan until 1968. However, {{from the front of}} the [...] "St. Helen’s-style" [...] glass-reinforced plastic bonnet assembly, to the aft spring-hanger for the front axle, the bus was closely derived from the Titan PD3A, with the driving position only marginally lower. The frame design allowed a <b>step-less</b> front entrance and a central sunken gangway on the lower deck: all lower saloon seats were on a higher level than the gangway to allow the transmission, fuel tanks and other ancillaries such as brake chambers and batteries to be sited. The cross-members, like the side-frames, were of complex shapes, a mixture of tubular, box-section and I-beam members being employed. Like the Lodekka FLF, bodywork was to be cantilevered from the frame aft of the rear axle. An unusual facet of the design, adapted to take steel-framed bodies from any open-market UK coachbuilder, was twin fuel tanks, offside mounted between third and fourth and fourth and fifth cross-members, and linked by a balance-pipe, with the fuel-filler attached to the forward tank. During the development programme Sir Henry Spurrier, chairman at the time of both Leyland Motors and Albion Motors, drove one of the prototypes and asked for a more progressive brake action.|$|E

40|$|TutorialHerrmann Foettinger as an {{alternative}} to a regular speed changing gear for shipboard propulsion. At that time, mechanical reduction gears for such high power applications were not available. The core idea of hydrodynamic torque converters and fluid couplings is to provide wear free power transmission using a hydraulic closed pump and turbine cycle. In the following decades, hydrodynamic torque converters experienced significant improvements driven by the automotive industry, and their use spread into various applications. Today, torque converters are commonly used in cars, busses, locomotives, construction equipment, and gas compression as a means of (i) smooth power transmission, (ii) to provide torque amplification during startup conditions, and (iii) to act as a damper for driver and driven equipment torsional disturbances and shock loads. In the oil and gas industry, torque converters are often used as integrated components in drive transmissions for electric motor driven compressors or pumps trains. They provide <b>step-less</b> speed variation along with progressive torque increase towards low speed. For example, torque converters and hydraulic couplings can be used to drive a variable speed centrifugal compressor using a fixed speed electric motor without the need for a variable frequency drive. In recent years, torque converters in combination with planetary gearboxes have been successfully demonstrated as a viable technology for variable speed electric motor driven centrifugal compressor applications. Torque converters are also used as soft starters between generators and gas or steam turbines. The unique power transmission features of the torque converter make it an option for equipment that requires start-up torque assistance and speed control. Modern torque converters up to 65, 000 kW have been designed and are widely in operation...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{laminar flow}} {{is one of}} the {{challenging}} aims of the current aerospace research. Main reasons for the aerodynamic transition from laminar into turbulent flow focusing on the airfoil-structure is the aerodynamic shape and the surface roughness. The Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems at the German Aerospace Center in Braunschweig works on the optimization of the aerodynamic-loaded structure of future aircrafts in order to increase their efficiency. Providing wing structures suited for natural laminar flow is a step towards this goal. Regarding natural laminar flow, the structural design of the leading edge of a wing is of special interest. An approach for a gap-less leading edge was developed to provide a gap- and <b>step-less</b> high quality surface suited for natural laminar flow and to reduce slat noise. In a national project the first generation of the 3 D full scale demonstrator was successfully tested in 2010. The prototype consists of several new technologies, opening up the issue of matching the long and challenging list of airworthiness requirements simultaneously. Therefore the developed composite structure was intensively tested for further modifications according to meet requirements for abrasion, impact and deicing basically. The former presented structure consists completely of glass-fiber-prepreg (GFRP-prepreg). New functions required the addition of a new material-mix, which has to fit into the manufacturing-chain of the composite structure. In addition the hybrid composites have to withstand high loadings, high bending-induced strains (1 %) and environmentally influenced aging. Moreover hot-wet cycling tests are carried out for the basic GFRP-structure in order to simulate the long term behavior of the material under extrem conditions. The presented paper shows results of four-points-bending-tests of the most critical section of the morphing leading edge device. Different composite-hybrids are built up and processed. An experimental based trend towards an optimized material design will be shown...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{relatively}} new class of robots which use cables instead of rigid links is investigated. As cable can transmit only pull forces, cable robots make high demands on the control. The cable robots investigated in this thesis have more cables than degrees-offreedom of the platform and, thus, belong to the class of redundant robots. The redundancy allows to tense the cables agairrst each other. A control approach for synchronaus control of the platform position and the cable forces is proposed. For this purpose, system identifications for dynamic models of the robot are carried out and the forward kinematics is expanded to deal with non-linear cable stiffness. The proposed approach for calculation of the desired cable forces allows for <b>step-less</b> adjustment of the internal tensions. The investigations show that with change of the internal tension the eigenfrequencies of the robot can be influenced by 15 - 30 %. By choice of a minimal tension Ievel, the energy consumption of the robot can be decreased by up to 20 % while {{the performance of the}} robot remains on the same Ievel. For the proposed control scheme, extensive investigations of the positional accuracy are carried out. As reference approach, the control assuming a rigid robot model without closed-loop control of the operational space position and cable forces is used. The two approaches delivered comparable results in the workspace centre. The position accuracy with a payload of 80 kg amounted to roughly 70 mm and 2. 5 °. Using the proposed controller at the workspace border, almost the same accuracy could be reached as weil, as the cables are kept under tension. For rnachining processes like grinding, the well-known hybrid position and force control approach is incorporated on a cable robot. With the control approach, the robot can apply a contact force in a programmable direction, while the platform can be position-controlled in the Iasting directions. For the human robot cooperation, an admittance controller is proposed. The platform simulates a virtual spring-mass-damper system which enables for the implementation of a virtual workspace. With the demonstrator, a bandwidth of 13 Hz is reached...|$|E
40|$|As a {{starting}} point GIS (geographical information systems) seem intuitively to be a practical tool for biologists performing ecological research. GIS conveniently stores, explores, analyses and visualizes biological/ecological/environmental observations. A thorough exploration of the opportunities offered by GIS was made in twelve different Norwegian ecological studies. These studies span scales from the regional at which biogeographical patterns can be studied, to centimetre-scales at which the fates of small (bryophyte) individuals may be followed. They encompass different ecosystems – marine, freshwater and terrestrial. They target animal, fungi and plants. More than 300 vascular plant species, 150 bryophytes species, 50 lichen species, 150 fungi species and 100 zooplankton species {{were included in the}} studies in addition to two species of butterflies and one seal species. GIS was an efficient tool for handling variation in data properties in all studies that opened many new opportunities. The most promising new scientific results from the GIS analyses were perhaps the least-cost path modelling for actual movement and dispersal of organisms in a landscape, the development of objective, <b>step-less</b> models for biogeographical variation and spatial prediction modelling of species occurrence and diversity patterns. However, concern is raised that the rather high user threshold of GIS software [and the recurrent needs for data programming (scripting) ] prevents many scientists from using GIS in their own ecological research. The importance of being able to address different spatial and temporal scales in all kinds of ecological research is also discussed. Scale is easily handled in GIS. Most notably, two of the most critical questions in spatial pattern analysis can be analysed through geostatistical GIS tools: determination of the appropriate scale to conduct the analysis; and to assess the nature (and strength) of the spatial structure. A two-stage strategy, comprising biogeographical analysis of the distributions of species by use of sampling units that span the main regional gradients, and a local ecological approach to the abundance variation of the species, seems to be a most fruitful analytic strategy. This study also underpins the everlasting need for including baseline investigations (identification of patterns of variation in species composition, followed by ecological interpretation) in ecological studies irrespective of scale, environment and species. The included monitoring approaches showed condiderable variation occurs over short time periods, even in apparently stable ecosystems. Monitoring projects are therefore important for the understanding of important processes and present condition in ecosystems. Both baseline investigations and monitoring projects is this thesis is thus crucial for be one of the main targets for ecological research in coming years: prediction of what will happen to species and ecosystems under different environmental (including climate) change scenarios. In this context, GIS seems an inevitably important tool...|$|E
40|$|These eleven videos present {{different}} experimental scenarios used to {{test the}} flexibility and functioning of the LULU P colony/P swarm simulator and of the associated application Lulu_Kilobot for controlling robot swarms. Both applications will be published on Github under an open-source license. The input P colony (input) file, swarm configuration (config) file and V-REP scene (. ttt) are available for each video in the associated. zip archive. The LULU simulator was included as a Python module in Lulu_Kilobot in order to test robot controllers based on P colonies, XP colonies, and P swarms for swarms of up to 10 Kilobot robots. In the following sections, we present a small description for each of the eleven attached videos. [...] - 1 _clone_ 10 _circle This video demonstrates the use of the robot cloning function of the vrep_bridge script in order to create 9 distinct copies of the source robot and distribute them on a circle around the source robot. The copies are so positioned by a distribution function that can be adapted to other forms. This cloning function allows one to generate large swarms of robots with ease. [...] - 2 _one_pcolony_for_three_kilobots In this video, we simulate a simple P minus colony using Lulu_Kilobot, on three different robots. At each subtraction, the robots move one step forward. At the beginning of the clip one can see the Robot - P colony association table, where each robot has a distinct copy of the original P colony. [...] - 3 _pswarm_ 5 _robots_ 3 _colonies This video demonstrates the flexibility offered by the config file of Lulu_Kilobot. From the config file we explicitly specify that the first two robots should use the go straight P colony. For the other colonies, we specify the number of robots that should be assigned, go left = 1 and go right = 2. From the Robot - P colony association table, one can see that the first robot that is assigned a P colony uses the original P colony while the others use an independent copy of the P colony. [...] - 4 _pswarm_ 2 _robots_avoid_collision In this experiment, we test the msg_distance agent from the input module, by continuously checking the distance from another robot. If the distance is short, then we stop the movement and otherwise continue to subtract f objects from the environment and move forward. Each of the two robots has a different P colony that was designed to check the distance from the other robot (robot_ 0 checks the distance from robot_ 1). [...] - 5 _pswarm_ 2 _robots_xp_colonies_ 15 _steps In this video we employ the exteroceptive communication rules (denoted by) in order to synchronize the movement of two robots. The first robot moves forward 15 steps and after it stops, it signals the second robot to start moving. At this signal, the second robot starts to turn left 15 steps. This shows the utility of exteroceptive rules that allow XP colonies (P colonies with exteroceptive rules) to communicate using the global P swarm environment. [...] - 6 _ 1 _pswarm_ 10 _robots_disperse_steps_infinite_loop In this video we run a more complex algorithm that involves the use of the following modules: msg_distance, led_rgb, and motion. This video demonstrates dispersion, which is a typical self-deploying scenario in swarm robotics. The robots should position themselves away from one another, so that each robot is at least at a minimum distance from each of its neighbours. All decisions are taken by the command module, {{on the basis of the}} received input data from msg_distance. A new direction of motion (and color) is randomly chosen if there are other robots closer than a pre-set threshold distance. [...] - 6 _ 2 _pswarm_ 10 _robots_optimized_disperse_infinite_loop This video is an optimized version of 6. 1 (10 robots disperse). The optimization consists in only exchanging data with V-REP when a new input request is detected in the input agents or likewise a new command object is detected in the output agents. This results in a <b>step-less</b> movement of the robots and reduces the time needed for a new decision to be applied resulting in a faster overall simulation time. [...] - 7 _pswarm_ 10 _robots_optimized_disperse_infinite_loop_with_intruder In this video we use the previously presented optimized dispersion algorithm (6. 2) and introduce an intruder robot into the scene in order to evaluate the influence that this intruder has over the behaviour of the swarm. One can see that robots that have stopped their movement, restart dispersing when the intruder robot is brought close enough. This can cause a chain reaction and ultimately cause the swarm to reposition. [...] - 8 _ 1 _pswarm_ 10 _robots_secure_disperse_fast In this video we test the proposed security protocol (based on entity authentification and P colony based id check) using the non-optimized dispersion algorithm. In this film we see that the robots ignore the intruder robot even though it is placed in the middle of the swarm. On the other hand, if we bring a swarm member robot close to another swarm member robot, these two will start to disperse normally. [...] - 8 _ 2 _pswarm_ 10 _robots_secure_disperse_infinite_loop_ 2 In this video we present the optimized (see 6. 2 for details) version of the secured dispersion algorithm. As was the case of the secured un-optimized version (8. 1), in this secured version we test the influence of the intruder on the behaviour of the swarm by moving the intruder close to the center of the swarm and also moving the intruder close to the swarm after the dispersion is finished. We also note that if two member robots approach, the algorithm continues to work normally. [...] - 9 _pswarm_ 10 _robots_secure_d_min_disperse_infinite_loop In this clip we show the effects of transparent input data processing. The command agent always requests the smallest distance available from the neighbour list, by using the d_min command. When the intruder robot is the nearest robot (the smallest value in the list) d_min will always return the intruder robot which cannot be processed because it is unknown to the swarm members. For this reason, a member robot that is in this situation will be blocked by the intruder robot...|$|E
