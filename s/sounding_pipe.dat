5000|$|A half set is {{the next}} stage up from a {{practice}} set. As with other forms of bagpipes, uilleann pipes use [...] "drones", which are most commonly three pipes accompanying the melody of the chanter with a constant background tonic note. The pipes are generally equipped with three drones: the tenor drone, as the highest <b>sounding</b> <b>pipe,</b> which is pitched {{the same as the}} lowest note of the chanter; the baritone drone pitched one octave below that; and the bass drone, as the lowest <b>sounding</b> <b>pipe,</b> two octaves below the bottom note of the chanter. The Pastoral pipes had four drones: these three plus one more that would play a harmony note at the fourth or fifth interval. These drones are connected to the pipe bag by a [...] "stock". This is an intricately made wooden cylinder tied into the bag (as any other stock) by a thick yarn or hemp thread. The drones connect to the stock, as do the regulators (see full set below). The stock and drones are laid across the right thigh. This is distinct from other forms of bagpipes, in which the drones are usually carried over the shoulder or over the right arm.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of measuring mass of loaded or discharged cargo by draft survey mass measuring method varies due to both systematic and accidental errors. The paper analyzes an error of draft readings on the calculated quarter mean draft, displacement {{based on the}} calculated quarter mean draft and the final displacement. By analyzing this problem, the authors have reached {{the conclusion that the}} influence of an error made in draft readings can be significant, especially on the draft marks amidships. Optical fibre technology has been suggested as a new option for draft readings. In this paper, the authors propose a liquid level optical sensor for measuring the sea level in the <b>sounding</b> <b>pipe.</b> Draft readings obtained by optical sensors will be entered into ships’ navigational system and load master.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} that the optical fiber technology, because of its advantages, may be applied in measuring different nonelectrical and electrical values in various ship’s systems. One {{of the most important}} advantages of optic technology over conventional is the ability to use one single strand of optical fiber to replace sensors and their wires required for measuring some considerable electrical and non electrical values in ship’s systems. Fiber optic sensors are immune to electrical interference and corrosion and do not require to create electrical pathway. This paper outlines the application of fiber optic in some elements in cargo handling on board a ship. The application of optical fiber technology were proposed by authors based on elements of cargo handling system and associated equipment (longitudinal and transversal strength of ship’s hull, temperature readings at cargo space and reef container, draft readings, liquid level in tanks <b>sounding</b> <b>pipe).</b> Real time monitoring cargo handling elements and cargo carried as well, together with optical fiber sensors, provide the knowledge of the seaworthiness and cargo worthiness of a considered ship...|$|E

500|$|The pipes, action, {{and wind}} system {{are almost always}} {{contained}} in a case, the design of which also may incorporate the console. The case blends the organ's sound and aids in projecting it into the room. The case often is designed to complement the building's architectural style and it may contain ornamental carvings and other decorations. The visible portion of the case, called the façade, will most often contain pipes, which may be either <b>sounding</b> <b>pipes</b> or dummy pipes solely for decoration. The façade pipes may be plain, burnished, gilded, or painted and are usually referred to as (en) [...] {{within the context of}} the French organ school.|$|R
5000|$|The organ {{includes}} {{a number of}} so-called [...] "mechanical aids," [...] though these are actually electronic. According to principal Tabernacle organist Dr. Richard Elliott (organist), these include a [...] "built-in recorder," [...] which allows organists to play a performance, and then {{go out into the}} auditorium and listen as the organ's computer replays the piece by physically <b>sounding</b> the <b>pipes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Water organs were {{described}} in the numerous writings of the famous Ctesibius (3rd century BC), Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) and Hero of Alexandria (c. 62 AD). Like the water clocks (clepsydra) of Plato's time, they were not regarded as playthings but {{might have had a}} particular significance in Greek philosophy, which made use of models and simulacra of this type. Hydraulically blown organ pipes were used to imitate birdsong, and musicologists Susi Jeans and Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume have suggested that it was used to create the sounds of the Vocal Memnon. For the latter, solar heat was used to syphon water from one closed tank into another, thereby producing compressed air for <b>sounding</b> the <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Certain stops called {{mixtures}} contain multiple {{ranks of}} <b>pipes</b> <b>sounding</b> at consecutive octaves and fifths (and in some cases, thirds) above unison pitch. The number of ranks {{in a mixture}} is denoted by a Roman numeral on the stop knob; for example, a stop labeled [...] "Mixture V" [...] would contain five pipes for every note. So for every key pressed, five different pipes sound (all controlled by the same stop).|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the physical structure and the timbre of Chinese Sheng, a physical model of Sheng and its sound synthesis method are proposed. Based on the vibration model of reed tongue, the equivalent circuit of Sheng pipe is constructed by considering the transfer matrices of tone hole and tuning slot. By combining the reed and the pipe, a complete physical model of Sheng is built. An experiment system of Sheng is designed to validate the physical model, and physical quantities of <b>sounding</b> Sheng <b>pipe</b> are measured simultaneously by multi-channels. The performance of this model is analyzed by comparing temporal-spectral features and timbre descriptors of measurement and simulation results. It shows that the proposed model simulates the sounding mechanism of Sheng pipe well, and the synthesized sound is able to capture the timbre-related features of real Sheng sound in an accurate way...|$|R
2500|$|The three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, {{promising}} {{that if he}} remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina. Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens {{when he goes to}} the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as [...] "The Speaker" [...] in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple as a friend. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's <b>pipes</b> <b>sounding</b> offstage, and hurries off to find him.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{dependency}} of tone timbre sensation in the real room on the listener’s position relative to the individual organ pipes. Unlike the other musical instruments, {{in the case of}} organ three incommutable standard listener positions exist. These positions are closely associated with the subjective tone timbre evaluation of the individual pipe and the whole <b>pipe</b> <b>sounding</b> ensemble too. The first one is the organmaker’s position inside the instrument during the pipe voicing, the second one is the position of the playing organist by the console and the last one is the position of the listener in the church or concert hall auditory. The sound of single pipes (for different stops) was recorded in the positions mentioned above using artificial head, which simulates well the binaural sensation and the acoustic field deformation in the listener vicinity. The digital recording of a tone was carried out for additional two head turns. Afterwards the head was replaced by the pair of omnidirectional microphones and the whole recording procedure was repeated. Selected recorded tones were subjectively compared by listening in headphones. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{combination}} of certain pipe voicing parameters, including wind pressure, {{sets up a}} specific feedback cycle operating regime when the pipe is blown. It {{is the most important}} voicing adjustment. In most blowing conditions maximum energy is expected to be transferred to the acoustic field inside the pipe when the jet injects air in phase with the acoustic pressure, the phase delay on the jet then being about half a period and the <b>pipe</b> <b>sounding</b> at its fundamental passive resonance frequency. In this study the relationship between this optimum concept and voicing practices is investigated. A procedure to determine the operating regime of pipes from various registers and organs using data from in situ acoustic and flow measurements was developed. Correlations were sought with pipe scaling, pitch range and tonal architecture. Principal pipes turn out to usually operate at pressures above this theoretical optimum, and acoustic power is traded for spectral richness, leading to different voicing styles. As a general rule, voicers appear to intuitively attempt to put forth the distinctive acoustic features of the resonators. Erratic variations in operating points throughout pipe ranks were also observed, the resulting differences being more or less successfully compensated by other voicing parameters...|$|R
40|$|Musical {{instruments}} provide auditory, {{visual and}} tactile {{feedback to the}} performer. The organist hears the <b>pipes</b> <b>sounding</b> {{as well as the}} contribution of room acoustics, sees the console, smells the air of the room, and feels the key action properties through her fingers and feet. Thus just as perception of most objects and events is multisensory, the sensation and perception of instrument playing are also multisensory. Within the project, “The Organ as Memory Bank”, we investigate the underlying dimensions of haptics in pipe organ playing, focusing on the mechanical manual-key action. This research involves both objective and subjective characterization of the key action. Objective characterization focuses on mechanical construction of the key and trackers and how it shapes the tactile feedback. The dynamic behavior of the keys is measured as a function of key-fall and velocity as keys are pressed using a controllable linear actuator and characterized by objective parameters. The subjective characterization of the haptics of organ playing is initially surveyed online. Semantic differential scales, which are devised {{based on the results of}} the survey, will be used in subjective experiments to reveal the underlying dimensions. Finally the objective (physical) and subjective (perceptual) characteristics will be linked to reveal the salient sensorial key action properties...|$|R
