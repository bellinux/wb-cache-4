50|$|Melaleuca groveana is a hardy species, easily {{propagated}} {{from seed}} and suitable as a <b>screening</b> <b>plant.</b> Unlike most melaleucas, after initial establishment {{it is relatively}} drought resistant plant.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>screening</b> <b>plant,</b> {{which is}} mostly ruined, {{comprises}} a screening mechanism {{resting on the}} ground surrounded by, and partly covered with collapsed wooden beams. The screening mechanism consists of a steel bin with a mesh floor, sitting on a base of steel girders. The bin {{is attached to the}} base by pivots and coiled steel springs. This enables the bin to be rocked backwards and forwards on its base. A partly collapsed steel framed conveyor leads from this plant {{to the top of a}} second <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> and bin.|$|R
50|$|Shewalton Collieries 5 and 6 {{opened in}} 1933 and closed in 1950 with a {{workforce}} of around 150, mining house coal, {{which was also}} taken to the Montgomeryfield <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> and washer.|$|R
50|$|Sticky boobialla is a hardy plant {{which can}} {{tolerate}} salt spray {{and can be}} used as a low <b>screening</b> <b>plant.</b> It is readily propagated from cuttings and grows best in full sun.|$|R

50|$|Melaleuca decora is a hardy plant {{which can}} be grown {{in a range of}} soil types, but needs plenty of water and will {{tolerate}} poorly drained sites. It is a useful <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> and flowers profusely.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a very hardy, fast-growing <b>screen</b> <b>plant.</b> It is able to {{withstand}} permanently wet soil, salt, coastal exposure, shade and moderate frost. Plants may be pruned to maintain them at a more compact size.|$|R
50|$|In 1927 the 6th District {{encompassed}} the Hyde Park and Angeles Mesa annexations and Vermont Avenue {{south to}} 62nd Street {{as well as}} a shoestring strip leading to Westchester, Mines Field and the Hyperion sewage <b>screening</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{population}} increase, {{the amount of}} sewage became a major problem to the beaches, so in 1925 the city of Los Angeles built a simple <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> in the 200 acre the city had acquired in 1892.|$|R
5000|$|... 1925: At {{that time}} the {{district}} encompassed the Hyde Park and Angeles Mesa annexations and Vermont Avenue south to 62nd Street {{as well as a}} shoestring strip leading to present-day Westchester, Mines Field and the Hyperion sewage <b>screening</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rarely cultivated, {{the willow}} needlewood has {{potential}} as a <b>screening</b> <b>plant.</b> It adapts readily to cultivation and is tolerant of light or heavy soils. Faring better in climates of over 450 mm annual rainfall, Hakea macraeana is tolerant of moderate frosts.|$|R
50|$|This {{species of}} melaleuca {{is a useful}} shrub for damp locations. It {{can be used as}} a <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> if pruned regularly. Seeds are easily {{collected}} from unopened capsules on the plant and grown as tubestock or seeded directly into the soil.|$|R
50|$|Correa lawrenceana is {{suited to}} a cool, moist, partly shaded {{position}} and is known to tolerate frost and snow. It {{can be used as}} a <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> and will attract honeyeaters to the garden.Plants are easily propagated from cuttings, whereas seed can be difficult.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, a new <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> was installed. Contamination of Acland coal {{with foreign}} {{material}} {{had been a}} source of concern to the mine's customers. The new plant ensured the production of cleaner, graded coal. The screen has now been removed from the mine site.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} {{view of the}} City of Los Angeles Hyperion Treatment <b>Plant,</b> North <b>Screening</b> <b>Plant</b> of the Department of Public Works, Sewer and Drain Maintenance division, showing employees with large machinery, ca. 1929. The photo shows five of the ten large "Dorrco" drum screens (the half cylindrical objects in the background) that were housed in the North <b>Screening</b> <b>Plant.</b> Four men, three in work clothes and one in a suit stand at center. The belt-driven machines the men are standing next to are the screening de-watering elevators that take the screenings off of the drums and drop them into a screening pit for disposal. Arched doors stand slung open on the left wall. Sunlight brightens the room from those open doors...|$|R
50|$|The shrub {{typically}} {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 0.3 to 3 m. It blooms between July and November producing white-pink flowers. The shrub has a dense habit with small olive green leaves and is commonly used as an ornamental, windbreak, shelter or <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> in gardens.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{crushing}} and <b>screening</b> <b>plant,</b> punch plates or perforated plates are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars. [...] Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.|$|R
50|$|Correa backhouseana is a hardy {{plant that}} is {{useful as a}} <b>screening</b> <b>plant</b> or along fencelines. It is also used as a {{container}} plant and its flowers and foliage {{can be used in}} floral arrangements. It prefers a position with some shade and will tolerate salt-laden winds and frost.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{commercial}} {{placer mining}} operations employ <b>screening</b> <b>plants,</b> or trommels, {{to remove the}} larger alluvial materials such as boulders and gravel, before concentrating the remainder in a sluice box or jig plant. These operations typically include diesel powered, earth moving equipment, including excavators, bulldozers, wheel loaders, and rock trucks.|$|R
