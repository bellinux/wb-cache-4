The lower section, which is the base, is formed of seven <b>superimposed</b> <b>layers,</b> each layer {{representing}} a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the roundness has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E

40|$|In our {{research}} on superimposed information management, {{we have developed}} applications where information elements in the <b>superimposed</b> <b>layer</b> serve to annotate, comment, restructure, and combine selections from one or more existing documents in the base layer. Base documents tend to be unstructured or semi-structured (HTML pages, Excel spreadsheets, and so on) with marks delimiting selections. Selections in the base layer can be programmatically accessed via marks to retrieve content and context. The applications we have built to date allow creation of new marks and new superimposed elements (that use marks), {{but they have been}} browse-oriented and tend to expose the line between <b>superimposed</b> and base <b>layers.</b> Here, we present a new access capability, called bilevel queries, that allows an application or user to query over both layers as a whole. Bi-level queries provide an alternative style of data integration where only relevant portions of a base document are mediated (not the whole document) and the <b>superimposed</b> <b>layer</b> can add information not present in the base layer. We discuss our framework for superimposed information management, an initial implementation of a bi-level query system with an XML Query interface, and suggest mechanisms to improve scalability and performance...|$|R

40|$|Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an {{important}} parameter in biomedical and cell-culture applications. Several studies have found cell survival and function to be intimately linked to oxygen concentration. Laminar flow, as observed in microfluidic devices, provides an ideal environment to manipulate and control concentration gradients. In this paper we demonstrate the first characterization of integrated fluorescence-based oxygen sensors for DO measurement within a cell-culture bioreactor device. Solid-state PtOEPK/PS sensor patterns were integrated into the PDMS-based bioreactor and calibrated for detection of DO concentration with a <b>superimposed</b> <b>layer</b> of collagen and Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cells. The sensor signal of the layer subjacent to the cells was found to follow a Stern-Volmer model and the intensity ratio was measured to I 0 /I 100 = 3. 9 after 3 days in culture.

40|$|It is {{a common}} human trait to gather bits of {{information}} in one place, and group, classify, and otherwise annotate them, such as {{on the back of}} an envelope or in the margins of a paper. Such “bundles ” of information appear to serve several different purposes, such as creating and maintaining situation awareness, problem solving, and aiding communication. These bundles are often structured via mechanisms such as juxtaposition of items, headings, and nesting. Bundles often repeat or reference information that exists elsewhere, but can contain new information as well. Our observational work in the medical domain confirms that bundles are widely used and reused. We focus in this paper on the challenges of building generic technology that supports the creation of structured, digital bundles, with an emphasis on keeping references that appear in the bundle linked to the referenced information in its original source. Bundles are one form of superimposed information, information placed over a base layer of data. To explore issues associated with bundles, and more generally superimposed information, we have implemented SLIMPad, the <b>Superimposed</b> <b>Layer</b> Information Manager scratchPad, an application for creating structured, digital bundles. 1 Introduction: Wha...|$|R

30|$|In the layered {{interference}} alignment scheme, {{since the}} <b>superimposed</b> interference <b>layers</b> {{need to be}} decoded, random coding is no longer applicable. We thus present a coding scheme with multi-level nested lattice codes in this section. Lattice coding is a structural coding; if there are two codewords that are selected from a lattice, their sum and difference are also within the same lattice. Thus, we can directly decode the superposition of the aligned interferences, instead of decoding the interference signals one by one.|$|R
30|$|In {{general the}} study of the cross {{sections}} shows several <b>superimposed</b> paint <b>layers</b> illustrating a complex painting technique. The paintings often contained an intermediate layer between the ground and the paint layers called “imprimitura” (priming layer) which was made of oils and/or resins or proteinaceous binders and fillers. Their function is to ensure adhesion between the paint layers, to protect the underlying paint layer, and, {{in the case of the}} imprimitura, to fix the underdrawn and reduce the absorbency of the ground layer [10].|$|R
40|$|Many plant {{surfaces}} are water-repellent {{because of a}} complex 3 -dimensional microstructure of the epider-mal cells (papillae) and a <b>superimposed</b> <b>layer</b> of hydrophobic wax crystals. Due to its surface tension, water does not spread on such surfaces but forms spherical droplets that lie only on {{the tips of the}} microstructures. Studying six species with heavily microstructured surfaces by a new type of confocal light microscopy, the number, height, and average distance of papillae per unit area were measured. These measurements were combined with those of an atomic force microscope which was used to measure the exposed area of the ®ne-structure on individual papillae. According to calculations based upon these measurements, roughening results in a reduction of the contact area of more than 95 % com-pared with the projected area of a water droplet. By applying water/methanol solutions of decreasing surface tension to a selection of 33 water-repellent species showing different types of surface struc-tures, the critical value at which wetting occurs was determined. The results impressively demonstrated the importance of roughening on different length scales for water-repellency, since extremely papillose surfaces, having an additional wax layer, are able to resist up to 70 % methanol. Surfaces that lack papillae or similar structures on the same length scale are much more easily wetted...|$|R
