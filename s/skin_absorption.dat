25|$|Healthcare workers {{exposed to}} antineoplastic agents take {{precautions}} {{to keep their}} exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse, since pharmacists who prepare these drugs or nurses who may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs {{during the course of}} their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs.

This study was performed the loading of V. volvacea extract (VV) in niosomes (NV). The physicochemical {{characterization of the}} VV loaded niosomes and gel containing niosome of the extract (GNV) was studied. Rat <b>skin</b> transdermal <b>absorption</b> by Franz diffusion cells at 6 hours of NV, GNV was compared with V. Volvacea extract solution (SV). GNV and NV showed higher chemical stability of total phenolic contents than SV. NV exhibited negative zeta potential values with the mean size of 254 ± 20. 32 nm. Both GNV and NV retarded the cumulative amounts and fluxes of the total phenolic in the extract in the first hour of skin permeation, while enhanced the skin permeation at the 6 th hour in the experiment. GNV gave the highest percentages of the total phenolic content through rat skin to the receiving solution followed by NV and SV, respectively. This study has demonstrated the potential of gel containing niosomes of the V. volvacea extract {{appeared to be the}} suitable system for topical anti-aging application of V. volvacea extract because of the enhancement of chemical stability and rat <b>skin</b> transdermal <b>absorption</b> of V. volvacea extract...|$|R

2500|$|Quicksilver (liquid {{metallic}} mercury) {{is poorly}} absorbed by ingestion and skin contact. Its vapor {{is the most}} hazardous form. Animal data indicate less than 0.01% of ingested mercury is absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal tract, though {{it may not be}} true for individuals suffering from ileus. Cases of systemic toxicity from accidental swallowing are rare, and attempted suicide via intravenous injection does not appear to result in systemic toxicity, though it still causes damage by physically blocking blood vessels both at the site of injection and the lungs. Though not studied quantitatively, the physical properties of liquid elemental mercury limit its absorption through intact skin and in light of its very low absorption rate from the gastrointestinal tract, <b>skin</b> <b>absorption</b> would not be high.

2500|$|There are {{alternatives}} to ethidium bromide which are advertised as being less dangerous and having better performance.

However, SYBR Green I was actually found to be more mutagenic than EtBr to the bacterial cells exposed to UV (which is used to visualize either dye). This may be the case for other [...] "safer" [...] dyes, but whilst mutagenic and toxicity details are available [...] these have not been published in peer reviewed journals. [...] MSDS for SYBR Safe reports a LD50 for rats of >5g/kg, which is higher than that of EtBr (1.5g/kg), but both are many orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations used in molecular biology. [...] Also, many alternative dyes are suspended in DMSO, which has health implications of its own including increased <b>skin</b> <b>absorption</b> of organic compounds.
