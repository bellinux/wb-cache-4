5|$|Due {{to issues}} {{regarding}} his legal {{status in the}} Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o. He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League, where he played his best match to that point. After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the Champions League, his season ended prematurely during the return leg against Chelsea on 7 March 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. Messi worked to regain fitness {{in time for the}} Champions League final, but on 17 May, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. He was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> that he did not celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris, something he later came to regret.|$|E
25|$|The first {{revision}} of the Belgian constitution came in 1893 under Leopold's reign. Universal male suffrage was introduced, though {{the effect of this}} was tempered by plural voting. The eligibility requirements for the senate were reduced, and elections would be based on a system of proportional representation, which continues to this day. Leopold pushed strongly to pass a royal referendum, whereby the king would have the power to consult the electorate directly on an issue, and use his veto according to the results of the referendum. The proposal was rejected, as it would have given the king the power to override the elected government; Leopold was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> that he considered abdication.|$|E
25|$|Roberto Concepcion was reputedly <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{with the}} Court's ruling in Javellana v. Executive Secretary where the {{majority}} affirmed {{the validity of the}} Marcos Constitution despite recognizing the flaws in its ratification, that he retired 2 months prior to his reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. 13 years later, after the ouster of Marcos, the 83-year-old Concepcion was appointed a member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission tasked with drafting a new Constitution. Drawing from his experiences as Chief Justice {{in the early days of}} martial law, Concepcion introduced several new innovations designed to assure the independence of the Supreme Court, such as the Judicial and Bar Council and the express conferment on the Court the power to review any acts of government.|$|E

500|$|Jolie {{began her}} {{professional}} film career in 1993, when she played her first {{leading role in}} the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the film that she did not audition again for a year. Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [...] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top." [...] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} use either Wally West or Barry Allen as the Flash alter ego for the show, but DC Comics would only approve the use of Bart Allen. In DC Comics, Bart typically goes by the codename of [...] "Impulse", but did have a short series in 2006 where {{he took over the}} role of Flash. Kyle Gallner learned through his agent about a superhero role being called for on Smallville, and when he learned {{that it was going to}} be Impulse, he convinced himself that he was going to win the role. Gallner went in for two auditions, but was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> with his performance during the second audition that he believed he had failed to get the role. His fear was unfounded when the producers offered him the part.|$|E
500|$|Montoya {{admitted}} to feeling disappointed after the race, having been leading until his only pit stop on lap 22. He stated: [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> I cannot {{find the words}} to describe how I feel. Up to the pit stop the race was going perfectly for me." [...] Williams technical director Patrick Head was {{not happy with the}} refulling rigs supplied by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). One of the rigs was sent back to manufacturer Intertechnique who said they could not find any issues with the system. Michael Schumacher, placed fourth before his retirement from a fuel pressure problem on lap 23, shared similar feelings to Montoya: [...] "I am not too disappointed as the situation in the championship remains the same and there is one less race to go. It was a shame not to finish the race and pick up a further six points." ...|$|E
25|$|Attendance for {{series was}} disappointing—down more than 50 percent in {{comparison}} with the previous year's series.

50|$|The Armida Rowing Club {{debuted in}} an {{official}} match in 1877. The achieved results were <b>so</b> <b>disappointing</b> {{that it was only}} in 1881 that the club returned to the competitions. The first major victory occurred in the fall of 1884: Gillardi won the first prize in the men's single scull race, Nicola in turn dominated the skiff race.|$|R
500|$|In {{the race}} the early pace was slow, and Barrett {{positioned}} Orme {{near the front}} of the field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme was just leading from La Fleche, but Barrett soon picked up the whip and it was clear Orme was beaten. La Fleche went on to win easily by two lengths from Sir Hugo, with Watercress a further three lengths back in third, May Duke in fourth and Orme in fifth. The remainder of the field, led by The Lover, were at least twenty lengths behind Orme. After the race Barrett said: [...] "I never was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> in my life. He never took hold of his bit as he used to do; run as dead as a stone, and wouldn't make an effort." [...] Other jockeys in the race agreed, saying Orme was [...] "sulking" [...] throughout the race. After the race, some suggested that Orme simply did not stay, the St Leger distance being too far for him.|$|E
500|$|Having {{determined}} {{to obtain the}} highest education she could, Stone enrolled at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1839, {{at the age of}} 21. But she was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> in Mary Lyons’ intolerance of antislavery and women’s rights that she withdrew after only one term. The very next month she enrolled at Wesleyan Academy (later Wilbraham & Monson Academy), which she found more to her liking: “It was decided by a large majority in our literary society the other day,” she reported to a brother, “that ladies ought to mingle in politics, go to Congress, etc. etc.” Stone read a newspaper account of how a Connecticut antislavery meeting had denied the right to speak or vote to Abby Kelley, recently hired as an antislavery agent to work in that state. Refusing to relinquish her right, Kelley had defiantly raised her hand every time a vote was taken. “I admire the calm and noble bearing of Abby K,” Stone wrote to a brother, “and cannot but wish there were more kindred spirits.” ...|$|E
500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I have never felt <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E

A few of these remarkable vehicles have nonetheless survived in the hands of collectors, many without titles for some time as Citroën did not want to recognize the cars.|$|R

500|$|Cousy {{was one of}} six freshmen on the Holy Cross Crusaders' varsity {{basketball}} team in 1946–47. From {{the start of the}} season, coach Doggie Julian chose to play the six freshmen off the bench in a two-team system, so that each player would get some time on the court. As members of the [...] "second team", they would come off the bench nine and a half minutes into the game, where they would relieve the [...] "first team" [...] starters. They would sometimes get to play as much as a third or even half of the game, but even at that Cousy was <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the lack of playing time that he went to the campus chapel after practice to pray that Julian would give him more of a chance to show off his talents on the court. Early in the season, however, he got into trouble with Julian, who accused him of being a showboater. Even as late as that 1946–47 season basketball was a static game, depending on slow, deliberate player movement and flat-footed shots. Far different was Cousy's up-tempo, streetball-like game, marked by ambidextrous finesse play and notable for behind-the-back dribbling and no-look, behind-the-back and half-court passing. Even so, he had enough playing time in games to score 227 points for the season, finishing with the third-highest total on the team. Led by stars George Kaftan and Joe Mullaney, the Crusaders finished the 1946–47 basketball season 24–3.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{photography}} yielded the director satisfactory results critically, {{the rest of}} the production was difficult from the start. The actors and crew reportedly viewed Malick as cold and distant.

5000|$|Mr. Meredith sets at {{defiance}} all ordinary {{rules of}} composition, and indulges in the wildest vagaries of plot-making; but {{the net result}} of his efforts is a work so enigmatical, and with such constant affectation of wit, {{that it is very}} irksome reading, and <b>so</b> <b>disappointing</b> in the end that the reader who has plodded through the three volumes is likely to vow that he will never take up another of Mr. Meredith's novels.|$|R
5000|$|Paxton mismanaged the brigade, caused needless {{casualties}} by halting under cannon fire, {{and missed}} {{an opportunity to}} surround and capture two Union regiments.

Paxton wasted important time trying to wheel his brigade into position without first pinning the enemy in place. Consequently, Paxton's Stonewall Brigade barely collided with the Northerners before the Pennsylvanians escape from the trap.|$|R
2500|$|Obama {{communications}} aide Robert Gibbs, who {{had worked}} for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who care about this stuff. How {{do you say to the}} average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?' Even though you've been <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> and cynical about politics in the past, and with good reason, we can move in the right direction. Just give me a chance." ...|$|E

Valdobrev, together with the director of photography Krum Rodriguez decided to [...] "follow the quest of this man's awkward dream to be named after his favorite football club and by getting close to the life of a Bulgarian builder and his memorable mates to create a moving social portrait of contemporary Bulgaria with its bewildered and confused people, <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the life in the country that they migrate to their own substitute reality. The journey started in Svishtov, a small town {{on the bank of the}} Danube river, told the story of the protagonist’s struggle with the authorities, lead all the way to Old Trafford Stadium, where he met his idol, the Manchester United top-striker Dimitar Berbatov, and ended up back home, raising questions about identity, about who we are and who we want to be".|$|E
2500|$|Pinal was so {{determined}} to work again with Buñuel that {{she was ready to}} move to France, learn the language and even work for nothing {{in order to get the}} part of Célestine, the title character. Silberman, however, wanted French actress Jeanne Moreau to play the role, so he put Pinal off by telling her that Moreau, too, was willing to act with no fee. Ultimately, Silberman got his way, leaving Pinal <b>so</b> <b>disappointed</b> that she was later to claim that Alatriste's failure to help her secure this part led to the breakup of their marriage. When Buñuel requested a French-speaking writer with whom to collaborate on the screenplay, Silberman suggested the 32-year-old Jean-Claude Carrière, an actor whose previous screenwriting credits included only a few films for the comic star/director Pierre Étaix, but once Buñuel learned that Carrière was the scion of a wine-growing family, the newcomer was hired on the spot. At first, Carrière found it difficult to work with Buñuel, because the young man was so deferential to the famous director that he never challenged any of Buñuel's ideas, until, at Buñuel's covert insistence, Silberman told Carrière to stand up to Buñuel now and then; as Carrière was later to say: [...] "In a way, Buñuel needed an opponent. He didn't need a secretary – he needed someone to contradict him and oppose him and to make suggestions." [...] The finished 1964 film, Diary of a Chambermaid, became the first of several to be made by the team of Buñuel, Carrière and Silberman. [...] Carrière was later to say: [...] "Without me and without Serge Silberman, the producer, perhaps Buñuel would not have made so many films after he was 65. We really encouraged him to work. That's for sure." ...|$|E
