40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R

5000|$|Firing trials {{revealed}} that the blast of 'A' and 'B' turrets on forward bearings caused damage to many weather-deck fittings and conditions on the mess-decks became very uncomfortable. When 'X' turret was fired 30 degrees abaft the beam and elevation of 40 degrees, considerable damage occurred to the vertically stacked two rows of bridge windows. As a result, the guns of [...] "X" [...] turret were usually prohibited from firing abaft of the beam at high elevations during peacetime practice firing. Fitting tempered glass in the bridge windows was tried, but gun blast still shattered some of them and filled the bridge with flying debris. The design of the Captain's bridge was altered on Nelson circa 1930-33 to reduce the window area and enclose the upper portion of the previous two rows of glass. A great deal of effort was expended in correcting this problem, and fitting of protective ledges below the new smaller windows proved successful. A new enclosed Admiral's bridge with its requisite reduced windows was built {{on top of the}} Captain's bridge and the forward <b>signalling</b> <b>lamps</b> were moved up one level and towards the aft of the bridge. The Admiral's bridge on Rodney remained stepped back somewhat from the forward edge of the tower, but the Captain's bridge had the same reduced area of glass that Nelson now had, with larger ledges. Blast was also a problem elsewhere; D.K. Brown tells of a test firing that was suspended when DNC observer H.S. Pengelly, who was beneath the foredeck, reported a bright red flash after firing all guns in [...] "A" [...] turret. This was later discovered to be caused by concussion of the observers' eyeballs.|$|E

[54] This project proposes extending the HRI (Human Robot Interaction) of Kivnon Log√≠stica's AGVs with gesture recognition and human localization through depth cameras and with emotion-simulating feedback through a screen. The aim for this technology introduction is to develop a shopping cart like AGV that follows people on gesture commands.

40|$|The use of clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> on automobiles, {{motivated}} {{largely by}} styling considerations, has prompted interest in {{whether there are}} any safety consequences associated with these lamps.

On the other hand, color contrast between the off and on states is greater with clear-lens turn signals. An experiment was conducted to compare the reaction time of drivers to <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> using clear and amber lenses. The results indicate that luminance contrast is the primary characteristic influencing driver performance and that no compensatory advantage appears to be obtained with increases in color contrast.

40|$|A {{recent study}} by Huey, Dekker, and Lyons (1994) {{concluded}} that a difference between two <b>signal</b> <b>lamp</b> intensities of less than 25 % cannot be detected reliably by most drivers. Consequently, Huey et al. recommended that an intensity difference of 25 % {{be used as a}} criterion for inconsequential noncompliance with federal regulations for <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The present study was designed to evaluate just noticeable differences for glare intensities of oncoming low-beam headlamps. The results of this study indicate that, under controlled conditions, just noticeable differences in the low-beam headlighting context are between 11 % and 19 %. In real-world conditions, just noticeable differences would probably be somewhat larger. Therefore, the recommendation by Huey et al. of using 25 % as a criterion for inconsequential noncompliance of <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is also about right for low-beam headlamps, at least with respect to how headlamps themselves are perceived by other drivers (such as discomfort glare). The 25 % value may also apply with respect to how headlamps affect the ability of drivers to see illuminated objects, but further research on that issue would be desirable...|$|R

40|$|Current {{photometric}} requirements for some <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> in the U.

The number of sections {{is used as a}} proxy for area, {{based on the assumption that}} lamps will be constructed with optical units of a certain approximate size, each with a single incandescent bulb of relatively high candle power. However, recently there has been growing interest in, and in some cases use of, a greater variety of sources for <b>signal</b> <b>lamps,</b> including LEDs, neon tubes, miniature halogen bulbs, and distributive light sources. The relationship between number of lighted sections and surface area that could be assumed for lamps with relatively large incandescent bulbs cannot be extended to the new sources.
