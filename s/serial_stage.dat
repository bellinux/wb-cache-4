40|$|In this review, {{the current}} status of search studies in both the visual and haptic {{modality}} is discussed, with an aim to assess the similarity of the processes involved. While recent models of visual search propose differing mechanisms explaining experimental results, it is generally agreed on that the search process consists of a pre-attentive parallel stage and an attentive <b>serial</b> <b>stage.</b> During the pre-attentive stage, basic features are examined and the information is used to guide attention towards salient items during the attentive stage, improving the efficiency of the search process. Using such models, average response times can be predicted accurately {{in a wide range of}} experimental settings. However, modeled response time distributions often do not correspond to experimental data, indicating that many current models of visual search are incomplete. Other points of discussion still remain, such as the cause of asymmetric behaviours with symmetric task designs, and the exact mechanism of top-down control. The haptic modality of search has been studied less extensively than the visual one. Haptic experiments exhibit behaviours similar to visual search, with search efficiency dependent on target and distractor features in the same way as described for visual search. Discrepancies observed between visual and haptic search are often due to suboptimally matched stimuli between the two modalities. Due to the differences in feature dimensions, spatial constrains and experimental methods, such comparisons are difficult, and results of recent studies are not conclusive. There are, however, indications that search data are at least in part exchangeable between visual and haptic processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{involuntary}} {{capture of}} attention by salient visual stimuli can {{be influenced by}} the behavioral goals of an observer. For example, when searching for a target item, irrelevant items that possess the target-defining characteristic capture attention more strongly than items not possessing that feature. Such contingent capture involves a shift of spatial attention toward the item with the target-defining characteristic. It is not clear, however, if the associated decrements in performance for detecting the target item are entirely due to involuntary orienting of spatial attention. To investigate whether contingent capture also involves a non-spatial interference, adult observers were presented with streams of visual and auditory stimuli and were tasked with simultaneously monitoring for targets in each modality. Visual and auditory targets could be preceded by a lateralized visual distractor that either did, or did not, possess the target-defining feature (a specific color). In agreement with the contingent capture hypothesis, target-colored distractors interfered with visual detection performance (response time and accuracy) more than distractors that did not possess the target color. Importantly, the same pattern of results was obtained for the auditory task: visual target-colored distractors interfered with sound detection. The decrement in auditory performance following a target-colored distractor suggests that contingent capture involves a source of processing interference in addition to that caused by a spatial shift of attention. Specifically, we argue that distractors possessing the target-defining characteristic enter a capacity-limited, <b>serial</b> <b>stage</b> of neural processing, which delays detection of subsequently presented stimuli regardless of the sensory modality...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe search task of Luck, Hillyard, Mangun and Gazzaniga (1989) was {{optimised}} to {{test for}} the presence of a bilateral field advantage in the visual search capabilities of normal subjects. The modified design used geometrically regular arrays of 2, 4 or 8 items restricted to hemifields delineated by the vertical or horizontal meridian; the target, if present, appeared at one of two fixed positions per quadrant at an eccentricity of 11 deg. Group and individual performance data were analysed in terms of the slope of response time against display-size functions (‘RT slope’). Averaging performance across all conditions save display mode (bilateral vs. unilateral) revealed a significant bilateral advantage {{in the form of a}} 21 % increase in apparent item scanning speed for target detection; in the absence of a target, bilateral displays gave a 5 % increase in speed that was not significant. Factor analysis by ANOVA confirmed this main effect of display mode, and also revealed several higher order interactions with display geometry, indicating that the bilateral advantage was masked at certain target positions by a crowding-like effect. In a numerical model of search efficiency (i. e. RT slope), bilateral advantage was parameterised by an interhemispheric ‘transfer factor’ (T) that governs the strength of the ipsilateral representation of distractors, and modifies the level of intrahemispheric competition with the target. The factor T was found to be higher in superior field than inferior field; this result held for the modelled data of each individual subject, as well as the group, representing a uniform tendency for the bilateral advantage to be more prominent in inferior field. In fact statistical analysis and modelling of search efficiency showed that the geometrical display factors (target polar and quadrantic location, and associated crowding effects) were all remarkably consistent across subjects. Greater variability was inferred within a fixed, decisional component of response time, with individual subjects capable of opposite hemifield biases. The results are interpretable by a guided search model of spatial attention – a first, parallel stage guiding selection by a second, <b>serial</b> <b>stage</b> – with the proviso that the first stage is relatively insular within each hemisphere. The bilateral advantage in search efficiency can then be attributed to a relative gain in target weight within the initial parallel stage, owing to a reduction in distractor competition mediated specifically by intrahemispheric circuitry. In the absence of a target there is no effective guidance, and hence no basis for a bilateral advantage to enhance search efficiency; the equivalence of scanning speed for the two display modes (bilateral and unilateral) implies a unitary second-stage process mediated via efficient interhemispheric integration...|$|E

In conjunction {{with the increase of}} engine volumetric efficiency, two stage boosting technologies are capable of increasing torque and pedal response of small displacement engines. In two <b>stage</b> <b>serial</b> turbocharges, a high pressure (HP) and a low pressure (LP) turbocharger are connected by a series of ducts. The former can increase charge pressure for low air mass flow typical of low engine speed. The latter has a bigger size and can cooperate with higher mass flows. In serial configuration, turbochargers are packaged {{in a way that the}} exhaust gases access the LP turbine after exiting the HP turbine. On the induction side, fresh air is compressed sequentially by LP and HP compressors. By-pass valves and waste-gated turbines are often included in two stage boosting systems in order to regulate turbochargers operations. One-dimensional modelling approaches are considered for investigating the integration of boosting systems with internal combustion engines. In this scenario, turbocharger behaviour are input in the powertrain models through previously measured compressor and turbine maps in turbocharger gas stands. However, this procedure does not capture all the effects that occur on engine application such as heat transfer, friction and flow motion that influence the turbochargers operations. This is of particular importance for two <b>stage</b> <b>serial</b> turbochargers where the LP compressor may induce a swirling motion to the flow at the entry of the HP compressor.

50|$|Saul Sternberg (1966) devised an {{experiment}} wherein subjects {{were told to}} remember a set of unique digits in short-term memory. Subjects were then given a probe stimulus {{in the form of}} a digit from 0-9. The subject then answered as quickly as possible whether the probe was in the previous set of digits or not. The size of the initial set of digits determined the reaction time of the subject. The idea is that as the size of the set of digits increases the number of processes that need to be completed before a decision can be made increases as well. So if the subject has 4 items in short-term memory (STM), then after encoding the information from the probe stimulus the subject needs to compare the probe to each of the 4 items in memory and then make a decision. If there were only 2 items in the initial set of digits, then only 2 processes would be needed. The data from this study found that for each additional item added to the set of digits, about 38 milliseconds were added to the response time of the subject. This supported the idea that a subject did a serial exhaustive search through memory rather than a serial self-terminating search.

So far, {{the diagnosis and}} prognosis of FSGS rely mainly on the invasive biopsy. Searching for potential FSGS-associated urinary biomarkers representing pre-sclerotic and <b>serial</b> sclerotic <b>stages</b> of FSGS could be helpful to the non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of FSGS. Methods. In the present study, we used a 2 D gel-based proteomic approach to identify urinary proteins at pre-sclerotic and different sclerotic stages of an FSGS mouse model {{in order to find}} FSGS-related urinary proteins. The FSGS mouse model was established in Balb/c mice by a single injection of adriamycin...|$|R
