By 1919, Jevons's four functions of money were summarized in the couplet: ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{corollary}} to Rand's {{endorsement of}} self-interest is her {{rejection of the}} ethical doctrine of altruism—which she defined {{in the sense of}} Auguste Comte's altruism (he coined the term), as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. Rand also rejected subjectivism. A [...] "whim-worshiper" [...] or [...] "hedonist," [...] according to Rand, is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life, but by a wish to live on a sub-human level. Instead of using [...] "that which promotes my (human) life" [...] as his <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> he mistakes [...] "that which I (mindlessly happen to) value" [...] for a <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>value,</b> in contradiction of the fact that, existentially, he is a human and therefore rational organism. The [...] "I value" [...] in whim-worship or hedonism can be replaced with [...] "we value," [...] "he values," [...] "they value," [...] or [...] "God values," [...] and still it would remain dissociated from reality. Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim-worshiping [...] "selfishness-without-a-self." [...] She held that the former is good, and the latter evil, {{and that there is a}} fundamental difference between them.|$|E

60|$|These general ethical {{considerations}} {{are by no}} means irrelevant in considering the practical problems of China. Our industrial and commercial civilization has been both the effect and the cause of certain more or less unconscious beliefs as to what is worth while; in China one becomes conscious of these beliefs through the spectacle of a society which challenges them by being built, just as unconsciously, upon a different <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>values.</b> Progress and efficiency, for example, make no appeal to the Chinese, except to those who have come under Western influence. By valuing progress and efficiency, we have secured power and wealth; by ignoring them, the Chinese, until we brought disturbance, secured on the whole a peaceable existence and a life full of enjoyment. It is difficult to compare these opposite achievements unless we have some <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>values</b> in our minds; and unless it is a more or less conscious standard, we shall undervalue the less familiar civilization, because evils to which we are not accustomed always make a stronger impression than those that we have learned to take as a matter of course.|$|R

The capital was fixed at six millions of livres, divided into shares of five hundred livres each, which were to be sold for twenty-five per cent of the regent's debased coin, and seventy-five per cent of the public securities; which were then at a great reduction from their nominal value, and which then amounted to nineteen hundred millions.
