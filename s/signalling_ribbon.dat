2500|$|Ribbon {{microphones}} use a thin, usually {{corrugated metal}} ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is electrically {{connected to the}} microphone's output, and its vibration within the magnetic field generates the electrical <b>signal.</b> <b>Ribbon</b> microphones are similar to moving coil microphones {{in the sense that}} both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. [...] Also, because the ribbon is much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or Blumlein pair, stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.|$|R

25|$|The ribbon synapse {{is a type}} of {{neuronal}} synapse {{characterized by}} the presence of an electron-dense structure, the synaptic ribbon, that holds vesicles close to the active zone. It is characterized by a tight vesicle-calcium channel coupling that promotes rapid neurotransmitter release and sustained <b>signal</b> transmission. <b>Ribbon</b> synapses undergo a cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis in response to graded changes of membrane potential. It has been proposed that most ribbon synapses undergo a special type of exocytosis based on coordinated multivesicular release. This interpretation has recently been questioned at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse, where it has been instead proposed that exocytosis is described by uniquantal (i.e., univesicular) release shaped by a flickering vesicle fusion pore.|$|R

[...] Buying, wearing, displaying, or sponsoring pink <b>ribbons</b> <b>signals</b> that the person or business cares about women. The pink ribbon is a marketing brand for businesses {{that allows them to}} promote themselves with women and identify themselves as being socially aware. [...] Compared to other women's issues, promoting breast cancer awareness is politically safe.|$|R
40|$|Cone photoreceptors {{depolarize}} {{in darkness}} to release glutamate-laden synaptic vesicles. Essential to release is the synaptic ribbon, {{a structure that}} helps organize active zones by clustering vesicles near proteins that mediate exocytosis, including voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. Cone terminals have many ribbon-style active zones at which second-order neurons receive input. We asked whether there are functionally significant differences in local Ca 2 + influx among ribbons in individual cones. We combined confocal Ca 2 + imaging to measure Ca 2 + influx at individual ribbons and patch clamp recordings to record whole-cell ICa in salamander cones. We found that the voltage for half-maximal activation (V 50) of whole cell ICa in cones averaged − 38. 1 mV ± 3. 05 mV (standard deviation [SD]), close to the cone membrane potential in darkness of ca. − 40 mV. Ca 2 + <b>signals</b> at individual <b>ribbons</b> varied in amplitude from one another and showed greater variability in V 50 values than whole-cell ICa, suggesting that Ca 2 + signals can differ significantly among ribbons within cones. After accounting for potential sources of technical variability in measurements of Ca 2 + signals and for contributions from cone-to-cone differences in ICa, {{we found that the}} variability in V 50 values for ribbon Ca 2 + signals within individual cones showed a SD of 2. 5 mV. Simulating local differences in Ca 2 + channel activity at two ribbons by shifting the V 50 value of ICa by ± 2. 5 mV (1 SD) about the mean suggests that when the membrane depolarizes to − 40 mV, two ribbons could experience differences in Ca 2 + influx of > 45 %. Further evidence that local Ca 2 + changes at ribbons can be regulated independently was obtained in experiments showing that activation of inhibitory feedback from horizontal cells (HCs) to cones in paired recordings changed both amplitude and V 50 of Ca 2 + <b>signals</b> at individual <b>ribbons.</b> By varying the strength of synaptic output, differences in voltage dependence and amplitude of Ca 2 + <b>signals</b> at individual <b>ribbons</b> shape the information transmitted from cones to downstream neurons in vision...|$|R
40|$|The Port Card {{will be one}} link in {{the data}} {{acquisition}} system for the D 0 Silicon Vertex Detector. This system consists of the following parts, starting at the detector: Silicon strip detectors are mounted in a spaceframe and wire-bonded to custom bare-die integrated circuits (SVX-II chips) that digitize the charge collected by the strips. The 128 -channel chips are mounted on a High-Density Interconnect (HDI) that consists of a small flex circuit that routes control signals and eight data bits for each of three to ten chips onto a common data bus. A cable then routes this bus approximately thirty feet out from the detector to the Port Card. The Port Card houses a commercial chipset that serializes the data in real time and converts the signal into laser light impulses that are then transmitted through a multi-mode optical fiber about 150 feet to a Silicon Acquisition & Readout board (SAR). Here, the data is transformed back to parallel electrical signals that are stored in one of several banks of FIFO memories. The FIFOs place their data onto the VME backplane to a VME Buffer Driver (VBD) which stores the event data in buffers for eventual readout over a thirty-two <b>signal</b> <b>ribbon</b> cable to the Level Two Computers and subsequent tape storage. Control and sequencing of the whole operation starts with the Silicon Acquisition/Readout Controller (SARC) working {{in tandem with the}} D 0 Clock System. The SARC resides in the same VME crate as the SARs, and transforms signals from the Trigger System into control codes distributed to the various Port Cards via optical fibers operating at 53 Mb/s. It is through these control codes that data taking operations such as data-acquisition, digitization, readout, and various resets can be carried out. The Port Card receives the control codes and manipulates the SVX-II chips in the proper way to effect proper data taking. There will be a total of about 700, 000 channels, which translates into about 5580 SVX-II chips, 66 to 100 Port Cards, 66 to 100 SARs, and four to eight SARCs...|$|R

40|$|To image {{synaptic}} activity within neural circuits, we have tethered the genetically-encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP 2 to synaptic vesicles by fusion to synaptophysin. The resulting reporter, SyGCaMP 2, detects {{the electrical}} activity of neurons with two advantages over existing cytoplasmic GECIs: {{the locations of}} synapses are identified and the reporter displays a linear response over {{a wider range of}} spike frequencies. Simulations and experimental measurements indicate that linearity arises because SyGCaMP 2 samples the brief calcium transient passing through the presynaptic compartment close to voltage-sensitive calcium channels rather than changes in bulk calcium concentration. In vivo imaging in zebrafish demonstrates that SyGCaMP 2 can assess electrical activity in conventional synapses of spiking neurons in the optic tectum as well as graded voltage <b>signals</b> transmitted by <b>ribbon</b> synapses of retinal bipolar cells. Localizing a GECI to synaptic terminals provides a strategy for monitoring activity across large groups of neurons at the level of individual synapses...|$|R
5000|$|Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie {{became one}} of the most known of these female figures in the {{political}} life of the early age of liberty. During the 1730s, she was a well known public figure, and her salon was a center of the Hats Party, and she wore <b>ribbons</b> <b>signalling</b> her political sympathies. In 1731, she, along with Eleonora Lindhielm (spouse of the Hat party member Daniel Niklas von Höpken), participated in the campaign to persuade Hedvig Taube to agree to become the kings mistress: their task was to convince Taube's mother to agree, a task they apparently succeeded in doing. [...] Taube became an effective method of the Hats to lay pressure on the king. [...] In 1734, when Hedvig Taube was made an official royal mistress and her relationship became public, De la Gardie supported her during the initial social ostracism of Taube: visited her and invited her to visit.|$|R
40|$|Maps of Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) fluxes {{obtained}} from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations revealed a bright structure extending over the sky, subsequently dubbed the IBEX ribbon. The ribbon {{had not been}} expected from the existing models and theories prior to IBEX, {{and a number of}} mechanisms have since been proposed to explain the observations. In these mechanisms, the observed ENAs emerge from source plasmas located at different distances from the Sun. Since each part of the sky is observed by IBEX twice during the year from opposite sides of the Sun, the apparent position of the ribbon as observed in the sky is shifted due to parallax. To determine the ribbon parallax, we found the precise location of the maximum <b>signal</b> of the <b>ribbon</b> observed in each orbital arc. The obtained apparent positions were subsequently corrected for the Compton-Getting effect, gravitational deflection, and radiation pressure. Finally, we selected a part of the ribbon where its position is similar between the IBEX energy passbands. We compared the apparent positions {{obtained from}} the viewing locations on the opposite sides of the Sun, and found that they are shifted by a parallax angle of 0. 41 ^∘± 0. 15 ^∘, which corresponds to a distance of 140 ^+ 84 _- 38 AU. This finding supports models of the ribbon with the source located just outside the heliopause. Comment: 26 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, submitted to Ap...|$|R
