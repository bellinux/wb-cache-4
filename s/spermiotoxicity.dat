40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{sensitivity}} of computerized sperm motility analysis in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus as the endpoint in toxicity bioassays. The tested matrices were pore water samples collected in an agriculture-impacted Mediterranean lagoon, Lake Varano (Italy). Two standardized bioassays were also conducted as controls, the P. lividus <b>spermiotoxicity</b> test and the Vibrio fischeri (Microtoxs) test. VCL (curvilinear velocity), VSL (straight line velocity), VAP (average path velocity), and the percentage of rapid spermatozoa recorded by the Sperm Class Analyzers system showed high sensitivity and discrimination ability, to a degree comparable with the larval development endpoint of the <b>spermiotoxicity</b> test. The test evaluated in this study requires small volumes of matrices, involves minimal sample manipulation, and can easily be extended to many other bioindicator species. It may therefore be considered a promising ‘‘quick response tool’’ following hazardous events that may adversely affect an aquatic ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of using cryopreserved S. aurata semen in <b>spermiotoxicity</b> tests. Cryopreservation is a biotechnology that can provide viable gametes and embryos on demand, rather than only in the spawning season, thus overcoming a limitation that has hindered the use of some species in ecotoxicological bioassays. Firstly, the sperm motility pattern of cryopreserved semen was evaluated after thawing by means of both visual and computer-assisted analyses. Motility parameters in the cryopreserved semen did not change significantly in the first hour after thawing, meaning that they were maintained for long enough to enable their use in <b>spermiotoxicity</b> tests. In the second phase of the research, bioassays were performed, using cadmium as the reference toxicant, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of cryopreserved S. aurata semen to ecotoxicological contamination. The sensitivity of the sperm motility parameters used as endpoints (motility percentages and velocities) proved to be comparable to what has been recorded for the fresh semen of other aquatic species (LOECs from 0. 02 to 0. 03 mg L 1). The test showed good reliability and was found to be rapid and easy to perform, requiring only a small volume of the sample. Moreover, cryopreserved semen is easy to store and transfer and makes it possible to perform bioassays in different sites or at different times with the same batch of semen. The proposed bioassay is therefore a promising starting point for the development of toxicity tests that are increasingly tailored to the needs of ecotoxicology and environmental quality evaluation strategies...|$|E
40|$|In most aquatic organisms, {{especially}} those that have external fertilization, sperm motility is a fundamental parameter {{for the success of}} fertilization. In fact the knowledge of sperm motility can be very useful in the aquaculture and ecotoxicological sectors improving breeding procedures, cryopreservation protocols and <b>spermiotoxicity</b> assays. In this sense, this study aimed to: (1) obtain the basic knowledge on sperm motility of aquaculture marine organisms; (2) propose and optimize protocols for sperm cryopreservation; (3) propose and optimize ecotoxicological tests using cryopreservated sperm. For this we used the Mediterranean native organisms Mytilus galloprovincialis, Tapes decussatus, Paracentrotus lividus and Sparus aurata, the alien molluscs cultured in Italy Crassostrea gigas and Tapes philippinarum and the Brazilian native molluscs Perna perna, Crassostrea brasiliana, Crassostrea rhizophorae and Nodipecten nodosus. N. nodosus, M. galloprovincialis and T. decussatus showed the best performance in the general evaluation of physiological parameters of sperm motility. In general the method of sperm acquisition affected the performance of sperm motility of the studied species. For some species, the stored sperm at low temperatures for a short period has proved viable after activation. The N. nodosus sperm showed good viability to cryopreservation through the addition of EG 7 % for 10 minutes of adaptation at room temperature and freezing gradient of - 6 °C/min. A reduced sperm motility was observed after cryopreservation and thawing of P. lividus, P. perna and C. brasiliana. The ecotoxicological assay through S. Aurata cryopreserved sperm demonstrated a remarkable potential as an universal test in the evaluation of different aquatic ecosystems. The species M. galloprovincialis, T. decussatus and N. nodosus were considered as potentially useful with biological systems in <b>spermiotoxicity</b> tests...|$|E
40|$|Metal {{compounds}} {{have been}} associated with male reproductive toxicity in vivo. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the in vitro effects of 20 metal compounds using rabbit ejaculated spermatozoa as a study model for <b>spermiotoxicity.</b> Five of the metals tested (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury and vanadium) reduced sperm motility and curvilinear velocity. Ultrastructural analyses revealed three types of damage to sperm head membranes in relation to the metal used: acrosome breakage with formation of various sized microvesicles (arsenic, cadmium, mercury and platinum); a large round hole (arsenic, cadmium and chromium), and numerous folds in the acrosome membrane (vanadium). The vanadium compound, followed by chromium and mercury compounds, determined a higher number of damaged spermatozoa. In conclusion, all the studied metal compounds, at levels higher than 1 microM, may reduce sperm kinetic characteristics and probably fertilizing capacity by triggering specific morphological damages to the head and/or by inhibiting motility...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to environmental studies was investigated by the authors, who propose the use of cryopreserved biological systems in ecotoxicological bioassays. The feasibility of <b>spermiotoxicity</b> tests using cryopreserved semen of the sea bream Sparus aurata, with sperm motility parameters as the endpoint, was evaluated. Thawed sperm was incubated in environmental samples (sediment elutriate and dumpsite leachate) and in a reference toxicant (cadmium) at scaled concentrations. Motility was then evaluated by video-microscopy using both visual and computer-assisted analyses. Activation time, sperm motility and velocity and motility duration were assessed on thawing {{and at the end}} of the incubation time, and the difference with respect to the control was statistically evaluated. All the endpoints of the bioassay proved to have good sensitivity even at the highest dilutions of the tested matrices. Observed differences in the sensitivity thresholds of the endpoints were considered to be representative of different aspects of sperm physiology. Therefore the proposed bioassay is a promising starting point for the development of toxicity tests that are increasingly tailored to the needs of ecotoxicology and environmental quality evaluation strategies for aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} different life stages of the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus {{for the assessment of}} the possible risk posed by nanoparticles (NPs) in the coastal water. A first screening for the presence of NPs in sea water may be obtained by checking their presence inside tissues of organisms taken from the wild. The ability of NPs to pass from gut to the coelomic fluid is demonstrated by accumulation in sea urchin coelomocytes; the toxicity on sperms can be measured by embryotoxicity markers after sperm exposure, whereas the transfer through the food chain can be observed by developmental anomalies in larvae fed with microalgae exposed to NPs. The most used <b>spermiotoxicity</b> and embryotoxicity tests are described, as well as the biochemical and histochemical analyses of cholinesterase (ChE) activities, which are used to verify toxicity parameters such as inflammation, neurotoxicity, and interference in cell-to-cell communication. Morphological markers of toxicity, in particular skeletal anomalies, are described and classified. In addition, NPs may impair viability of the immune cells of adult specimens. Molecular similarity between echinoderm and human immune cells is shown and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of two toxicity bioassays (fertilization and embryo toxicity tests) to discriminate sediment toxicity using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was tested in five stations with {{different levels of}} pollution in the Lagoon of Venice. Two stations were located in estuarine sites, two in the industrial zone, and one in a site {{at the top of}} our quality gradient (reference). Elutriate was chosen as sediment matrix to assess the potential effects of bioavailable pollutants in the water column as a consequence of sediment resuspension (dredging and dumping, fishing gear, etc.). An experimental design based on Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures (QA/QC) was adopted in order to set the methodological basis for an effective use of these bioassays in monitoring programs. Results revealed both higher embriotoxicity than <b>spermiotoxicity</b> in all stations and the efficacy of combined use of both toxicity bioassays in discriminating differing pollution/ bioavailability between stations and periods. The good representativeness of the integrated sampling scheme and the standardization of all experimental phases yielded high precision of results. Clear Toxicity Fingerprints were evidenced for the investigated sites through the combined use of both bioassays. A good fit between ecotoxicological data and chemical contamination levels was found, except for unnatural sediment texture...|$|E
40|$|Marine environments are {{continuously}} {{being threatened}} by {{a large number of}} xenobi- otics from anthropogenic sources. The effect of chemical pollution on living organisms are numerous and may impair reproductive success of adults species of marine invertebrate and vertebrate through effects on gamete quality. Echinoderms are characterized by external fertilizzation and gametes, free of any type of protection, may be in contact with toxic substances so the reproductive success depends largely on the environment conditions. The purpose of this work is to assess the effects on the in vitro fertiliza- tion of exposure of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus gametes to xenobiotic substances as CuSO 4, CdCl 2 and TBTCl. The effect of contaminant were assessed by two experimental set in which gametes were treated with different concentration (0, 10 - 3, 10 - 5 10 - 7 10 - 9 M) of different substances as CdCl 2, CuSO 4 and TBTCl. The effects were evaluated as percentage of fertilization. The results showed that the gametes exposure to xenobiotic decreased the percentage of fertilization and that more sensitive to treatment were the sperm cells, propably because the toxic effect affected the motility of the sperm. In conclusion, the absence of fertilization (<b>spermiotoxicity)</b> may submit the toxic effects of these substances to the level of body and may candidate the sea urchis as biosensors for the evaluation of environmental quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{viability}} of spermatozoa {{is a crucial}} parameter to evaluate their quality that {{is an important issue}} in ecotoxicological studies. Here, a new method has been developed to rapidly determine the {{viability of}} spermatozoa in three marine invertebrates: the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis. This method employed the dual DNA fluorescent staining coupled with spectrofluorimetric analysis. The dual fluorescent staining used the SYBR- 14 stained live spermatozoa and propidium iodide stained degenerated cells that had lost membrane integrity. Stain uptake was assessed by confocal microscopy and then the percentage of live and dead spermatozoa was quantified by spectrofluorimetric analysis. The microscopic examination revealed three populations of spermatozoa: living-SYBR- 14 stained, dead-PI stained, and dying-doubly stained spermatozoa. The fluorescence emission peak values recorded in a spectrofluorimeter provide the portion of live and dead spermatozoa showing a significant negative correlation. The stain combination was further validated using known ratios of live and dead spermatozoa. The present study demonstrated that the dual DNA staining with SYBR- 14 and propidium iodide was effective in assessing viability of spermatozoa in marine invertebrates and that spectrofluorimetric analysis can be successfully employed to evaluate the percentage of live and dead spermatozoa. The method develop herein is simple, accurate, rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective, so it could be a useful tool by which marine pollutants may be screened for <b>spermiotoxicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nickel {{nanoparticles}} (Ni NPs) {{are increasingly}} used in modern industries as catalysts, sensors, and in electronic applications. Due to this large use, their inputs into marine environment have significantly increased; however, the potential ecotoxicological effects in marine environment {{have so far}} received little attention. In particular, little is known {{on the impact of}} NPs on gamete quality of marine organisms and on the consequences on fertility potential. The present study examines, for the first time, the impact of Ni NPs exposure on sperm quality of the marine invertebrate Ciona intestinalis (ascidian). Several parameters related with sperm status such as plasma membrane lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular pH, DNA integrity, and fertilizing ability were assessed as toxicity end points after exposure to different Ni NPs concentrations. Ni NPs generate oxidative stress that in turn induces lipid peroxidation and DNA fragmentation, and alters MMP and sperm morphology. Furthermore, sperm exposure to Ni NPs affects their fertilizing ability and causes developmental anomalies in the offspring. All together, these results reveal a <b>spermiotoxicity</b> of Ni NPs in ascidians suggesting that the application of these NPs should be carefully assessed as to their potential toxic effects on the health of marine organisms that, in turn, may influence the ecological system. This study shows that ascidian sperm represent a suitable and sensitive tool for the investigation of the toxicity of NPs entered into marine environment, for defining the mechanisms of toxic action and for the environmental monitoring purpose...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} sources of pollution by triphenyltin (TPT) in marine coastal ecosystems are its employment as a fungicide in agriculture and, {{in association with}} tributyltin, as a biocide in anti-fouling paints. In this study, <b>spermiotoxicity</b> and embryotoxicity (from post-fertilisation to pluteus stage) experiments were carried out to better clarify the ecotoxicological effects of TPT during {{the development of the}} sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Sperm exposed to triphenyltin acetate (TPTA) for 60 minutes showed a significantly reduced capability to fertilise eggs even at the lowest concentration of 0. 1 µg TPTA l- 1. In proportion to increasing concentrations, the percentage of fertilised eggs decreased, falling to 45 % at 10 µg TPTA l- 1, the maximum tested concentration. In embryotoxicity experiments at 48 h post-fertilisation, the length of the pluteus somatic rods was significantly reduced (P< 0. 001) from 1. 5 µg l- 1. Progressive increases in skeletal anomalies were also detected, highly significant (P < 0. 001) at 2 µg l- 1. Embryonic development was greatly slowed at the highest TPT concentrations: embryos never reached the pluteus stage at 5 µg l- 1, and development was blocked at the gastrula stage at 10 µg l- 1. As observed in previous experiments using butyltin compounds, embryotoxic effects on both skeletal deposition and blocked development are presumed to be due to interference of TPT with intracellular calcium homeostasis. Sea urchin gametes are more sensitive to TPT than embryos, this condition emphasising the environmental risk due to TPT contamination...|$|E
40|$|Spermio- and embryotoxicities of Cu, Ag, Cd, and Hg were {{investigated}} in Paracentrotus lividus, the dominant echinoid {{species of the}} Mediterranean. <b>Spermiotoxicity</b> was studied by assessing the effects of sperm exposure on fertilization rate (FR) {{as well as on}} the induction of transmissible damages to the offspring. Embryotoxicity was studied by assessing developmental defects in larvae exposed to the tested metals throughout their development. Sperm exposures resulted in significant decreases of FR, depending on both metal concentration and duration of the exposure. Lowest spermiotoxic concentrations recorded when sperm were exposed for 75 min to the metals were 10 - 7 M Hg(II), 10 - 6 M Ag(I), 10 - 5 M Cu(II), and 10 - 5 M Cd(II). Tested metals did not exert any transmissible damage to spermatozoa that could result in larval malformations in the offspring, even for concentrations that dramatically reduced FR. Single-element exposures of embryos for 72 h resulted in developmental defects whose occurrence and severity showed a steep dose dependence, indicating that once a threshold is reached, any further increase in toxicant concentration rapidly enhances the impairment of target function(s). Those observations suggest the involvement of a saturable protective mechanism. Lowest observed embryotoxic concentrations of the metals were 10 - 7 M Hg(II), 2. 5 x 10 - 7 M Ag(I), 5 x 10 - 7 M Cu(II), and 10 - 5 M Cd(II) and are in the range of concentrations reported in heavily polluted marine environments. Thus, the possibility of impairment of echinoid development actually exists in metal contaminated marine environments, possibly threatening echinoid populations in those environments...|$|E
