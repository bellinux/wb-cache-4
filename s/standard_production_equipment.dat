This capacity is shared across many IC companies, so ramping production volumes of specific ICs, or in this case specific MEMS oscillators, is a function of allocating <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> <b>equipment.</b> Conversely, quartz oscillator factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCeramic Industrial Cluster in Plered, West Java is {{an example}} of a cluster in Indonesia. This cluster {{produces}} a variety of ceramics that is sold to the local market as well as the international market. The ceramic industrial cluster in Plered consists of tiles, decorative ceramics, tableware, and roof tiles. A large contribution towards the supply of domestic needs, foreign exchange earnings, and employment opportunities is due in part to the ceramic industrial cluster in Plered. However, several problems emerged in regard to the sustainability of the ceramic cluster, which are: similar goods that enter from China into the domestic market, a low production capacity caused by the limitation in good and <b>standard</b> <b>production</b> <b>equipment,</b> a low level of entrepreneur and workers’ understanding towards the method and technology in making good quality product, as well as a low mentality and quality of human resources in facing global market challenges. This paper argues for there to be a change in approach to the actors inside the cluster in Plered in order to overcome the obstacles mentioned above. Two of the solutions suggested are: (1) to build a model house/model of a production facility; (2) to introduce a tour of Kampoeng Keramik...|$|E

The process {{production}} tempeh in Indonesia, both in industries or traditional scale are basically similar. The difference lies {{in the way of}} peeling the cuticle soybean seeds. Peeling skin soybeans traditionally have weaknesses, among others, in terms of time this process takes a long time, and in terms of cleanliness and health of the process is very unhygienic. It is necessary to develop technologies and equipment to peeling the husk, clean and hygienic. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the optimum rotation soybeans the cuticle peeler and economic analysis. The design of manufacturing soybean the cuticle peeler using a variable rotation speed (rpm) based on the diameter of pulley: 10, 8, 7, 6, and 5 -inch, clearance space: 2. 0; 2. 25, and 2. 5 mm.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} the recent {{progress}} of {{the evaluation of the}} multi Si PERCT technology in an industrial pilot production of the Chinese cell manufacturer Lu’an. Our technology is an alternative to the AlOx based PERC technology for improving multi-crystalline solar cell efficiencies above 18. 5 % and it is based on <b>standard</b> mass <b>production</b> <b>equipment</b> and wafer quality. An additional unique feature of this technology is the manufacture of bifacial multi-crystalline solar cells with screen-printed finger grid on the rear side instead of a full area Al-BSF. The PERCT cell architecture is based on a “passivated emitter rear totally diffused (PERT) ” cell design for p-type wafers. The totally diffused BSF is realized by a cost effective and short BBr 3 boron diffusion step in a standard diffusion tube furnace - prior to the back side passivation and protection by a PECVD SiNx. RCT's multi PERCT technology upgrade is currently evaluated in an industrial pilot line of a Chinese cell manufacturer. Using the equipment available on site, an average efficiency of 18. 4 % could be achieved (without front side optimization). Accordingly an efficiency gain of 0. 52 % absolute was demonstrated on standard multi-crystalline wafer material. A unique feature of the PERCT technology is the opportunity to prepare bifacial cells on multi-crystalline wafer material. The world's first bifacial multi-crystalline solar cell with a screen printed Al-grid and a front side efficiency of 18 % was realized. Up to 15 % cost savings can be achieved by using the bifacial multi PERCT technology...|$|R
