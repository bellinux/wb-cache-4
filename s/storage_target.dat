We have characterized {{the performance and}} scalability for different levels of storage hierarchy including a single Lustre object <b>storage</b> <b>target,</b> a single S 2 A storage couplet, and the entire system. Our analysis covers both data- and metadata-intensive I/O patterns.

Based on our characterization, we have demonstrated that it is possible, and often prudent, to improve the I/O performance of scientific benchmarks and applications by tuning and optimizing I/O. For example, we demonstrate that the I/O performance of the S 3 D combustion application can be improved at large scale by tuning the I/O system to avoid a bandwidth degradation of 49 % with 8192 processes when compared to 4096 processes. We have also shown that the performance of Flash I/O can be improved by 34 % by tuning the collective I/O parameters carefully. ...|$|E

The ROMIO {{implementation}} of the MPI-IO standard provides a portable infrastructure for use on top of any number of different underlying <b>storage</b> <b>targets.</b> These targets vary widely in their capabilities, {{and in some cases}} additional effort is needed within ROMIO to support all MPI-IO semantics.

These routines require communication internal to the MPI-IO implementation in order to allow processes to atomically update this shared value. We discuss a technique that leverages MPI- 2 one-sided operations and can be used to implement this concept without requiring any features from the underlying file system. We then demonstrate through a simulation that our algorithm adds reasonable overhead for independent accesses and very small overhead for collective accesses. ...|$|R

We assess the impact on natural gas storage due to intermediate processes involved in taking a laboratory powder sample to an onboard packed or adsorbent bed module.

Using data typically found for adsorbent materials that are carbon and MOF based materials, we show {{that in order to}} meet the Department of Energy targets of 180 V/V (equivalent STP) loading at 3. 5 MPa and 298 K at the onboard packed bed level, the volumetric capacity of the pelletized sample should be at least 245 V/V and the corresponding gravimetric loading varies from 0. 175 to 0. 38 kg/kg for pellet densities ranging from 461. 5 to 1, 000.

40|$|Abstract—Performance {{of reading}} {{scientific}} {{data from a}} parallel file system depends on the organization of data on physical storage devices. Data is often immutable after producers of data, such as large-scale simulations, experiments, and observations, write the data to the parallel file system. As a result, read performance of data analysis tasks is often slow when the read pattern does not conform with the original organization of the data. For example, reading small non-contiguous chunks of data from a large array is many times slower than reading the same size of contiguous chunks of data. Towards improving the data read performance during analysis phase, we are developing the Scientific Data Services (SDS) framework for automatically reorganizing previously written data to conform with the known read patterns. In this paper, we introduce a model-driven strategy for selecting the data layouts that benefit the performance of different read patterns. We have developed a parallel I/O model based on the striping parameters on Lustre file system and the block-level striping on RAID-based disks within an Object <b>Storage</b> <b>Target</b> (OST) of Lustre.
