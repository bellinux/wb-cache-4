5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in <b>spattering</b> of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

50|$|A <b>spatter</b> cone is a low, steep-sided hill or mound that {{consists}} of welded lava fragments, called <b>spatter,</b> which has formed around a lava fountain issuing from a central vent. Typically, <b>spatter</b> cones are about 3-5 m high. In case of a linear fissure, lava fountaining will create broad embankments of <b>spatter,</b> called <b>spatter</b> ramparts, along {{both sides of the}} fissure. <b>Spatter</b> cones are more circular and cone shaped, while <b>spatter</b> ramparts are linear wall-like features.|$|R

50|$|<b>Spatter</b> cones and <b>spatter</b> ramparts are {{typically}} formed by lava fountaining associated with mafic, highly fluid lavas, {{such as those}} erupted in the Hawaiian Islands. As blobs of molten lava, <b>spatter,</b> are erupted into the air by a lava fountain, they can lack {{the time needed to}} cool completely before hitting the ground. Consequently, the <b>spatter</b> are not fully solid, like taffy, as they land and they bind to the underlying <b>spatter</b> as both often slowly ooze {{down the side of the}} cone. As a result, the <b>spatter</b> builds up a cone that is composed of <b>spatter</b> either agglutinated or welded to each other.|$|R

2500|$|Bacon is {{distinguished}} from salt pork and ham by {{differences in the}} brine or dry packing. Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite, and occasionally potassium nitrate (saltpeter), but sodium ascorbate or erythorbate may also be added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour. Flavourings such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for some bacon products. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce <b>spattering</b> when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine specifically for ham includes {{a large amount of}} sugar. Historically, the terms [...] "ham" [...] and [...] "bacon" [...] referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.|$|E
2500|$|Pollock {{observed}} American Indian sandpainting {{demonstrations in}} the 1940s. Referring to {{his style of}} painting on the floor, Pollock stated, “I feel nearer, more {{a part of the}} painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.” Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied reliance on [...] "the accident"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and <b>spattering,</b> he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see. As another important influence can be cited Wolfgang Paalen's article on Totem Art of the indigenous people of British Columbia and his Fumage paintings which he had seen at Julien Levy's exhibition of Paalen's surrealist paintings in 1940. Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4-5, 1943), in which the revolutionary space concept in totemist art from the North-West-Coast is broadly discussed from an artist's point of view. Another strong impact must have been Paalen's fumage technique, as it was the surrealist technique with the most magic appeal for those painters who looked for new ways of making appear what was called the unseen or the possible. Fumage was presented also in Matta's workshop about which Steven Naifeh reports: »Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [...] Fumage, Jackson [...] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: ›I can do that without the smoke.‹« Pollock's painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated (hinting at the revolutionary possibility-space of Paalen): [...] "It was Wolfgang Paalen, who started it all." ...|$|E

The metal {{transfer}} behaviors of basic flux cored wire at different arc voltage and welding current {{and the resultant}} welding <b>spatter</b> were investigated by using a high speed camera. Two modes of {{metal transfer}} are found: globular repelled transfer (lower welding parameters) and small droplet transfer (higher welding parameters). The former is accompanied by large granular <b>spatter,</b> large droplet itself explosion <b>spatter</b> and electric explosive <b>spatter</b> of short-circuit, and <b>spatter</b> in the latter is reduced obviously. But if the slag column {{is found in the}} two models, <b>spatter</b> could be dropped evidently owing to its significant guiding role for metal transfer. Therefore the slag column is the key factor of reducing welding <b>spatter...</b>|$|R

40|$|Spot welding is {{a process}} that sheet metals are joined in one or more spot by heating at the faying interface. In this process, the <b>spatter</b> is {{dispersed}} from melted area. It has been reported that <b>spatter</b> generation has adverse effects on weld quality. However, no systematic study has been carried out to find out its effect on weld quality in resistance spot welding processes. In this study, specially designed specimens are used to perform experimental investigation of <b>spatter</b> generation and its effect. Major finding of this study show trends in tensile-shear strength for various amounts of <b>spatter</b> generated during spot welding process. Thus, optimum welding conditions are proposed in view of <b>spatter</b> generation and tensile-shear strength...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Aerosolized {{droplets}} of blood can travel considerable distances on release of intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic surgery. This creates an environmental hazard {{for members of}} the surgical team. This study describes and provides a method of measurement of aerosolized blood contamination dur-ing evacuation of the pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery. Methods: Samples were measured by removing a trocar from the abdomen while a pneumoperitoneum of 15 mm Hg was present. A white poster board was placed 24 inches above the incision to catch the released blood <b>spatter.</b> By use of machine vision, luminol fluorescence, and computerized spatial analysis, data from the boards were recorded, analyzed, and scored based on the dis-tance, size, and quantity of particulate contamination. Results: We analyzed 27 boards. <b>Spatter</b> was present on every board. The addition of luminol to the boards in-creased the amount of visible <b>spatter.</b> Most tests created 1000 blood <b>spatters.</b> Fluids are typically ejected as a fine mist. Every test included at least 1 blood <b>spatter.</b> The range of the average blood <b>spatter</b> size was 0. 53 10 – 3 to 7. 11 10 – 3 sq in. The amount of <b>spatter</b> detected did not show any apparent correlation with the patient’s body mass index, the estimated blood loss, or the type of operation performed. Conclusions: Evacuation of the pneumoperitoneum dur-ing laparoscopic surgery results in consistent contamina-tion. Most blood <b>spatter</b> is not visible to the naked eye. Our results suggest that all surgical participants should wear appropriate protective barriers and conscious mea-sures should be undertaken to prevent environmental contamination during pneumoperitoneal evacuation.

40|$|The keyhole {{which is}} typical for laser deep {{penetration}} welding {{is responsible for}} the highly dynamic process behavior, which results in unwanted pore and <b>spatter</b> formation. This work aims to better understand the dynamic keyhole properties and occurrence of process defects. Therefore, a semi-analytical model is developed and validated by optical emission analysis. <b>Spatter</b> characteristics are evaluated in high speed videos and porosity in x-ray analysis. Correlations between keyhole behavior and <b>spatter</b> and pore characteristics could show that pores can form due to a keyhole collapse and <b>spatter</b> detachment requires more than the momentum from keyhole wall fluctuations. Dynamic behavior and process defects are influenced by the spatial laser intensity distribution...|$|R

50|$|Hornitos {{are formed}} in lava flows and are small {{openings}} that release {{small amounts of}} lava. Similar to <b>spatter</b> cones, Hornitos are rootless, meaning they form {{on the surface of}} lava flows like <b>spatter</b> cones. They are usually created by the slow upwelling of lava through the roof of a lava tube. High pressure causes lava to ooze and <b>spatter</b> out. The lava builds up on the surface and solidifies creating the initial structure. Hornitos can grow and exceed 10 meters in height.|$|R

40|$|Violent crimes often {{result in}} blood-shed events {{associated}} with blood <b>spatter.</b> Bloodstain pattern analysis (BPA) {{serves as a}} good tool and effective approach to reconstruct the events that occur in a crime scene. Among other bloodstain patterns, impact <b>spatter</b> patterns are commonly found at crime scenes. An impact pattern {{is formed as a}} result of an impact force striking an exposed blood source and can be described as a radiating pattern of small individual drops. In most cases of BPA, the reconstruction of the events taken place involve investigating the blood drop flight dynamics and the mechanics of impact <b>spatter</b> generation to determine the origin of the impact. Thus, the discipline of Fluid Dynamics (FD) is also involved in most BPA cases. However, in the cases of multiple impact <b>spatter</b> generation events within a crime scene, it complicates the interpretation and analysis of the impact <b>spatter</b> pattern. There are many variables of blood drop flight dynamics and mechanisms of impact <b>spatter</b> generation in which a blood drop is exposed to and generated from. The variables of blood drop flight dynamics such as drop deformations/oscillations, breakup, diameter with respect to velocity and air/wind currents do affect a drop while in flight which may alter the trajectory curvature of a blood drop. However, it is relatively unknown in scientific literature how the variables of impact <b>spatter</b> generation setup such as the height of the blood source and impact force applied would affect the horizontal distance travelled by a blood drop generated from an impact <b>spatter.</b> Theoretically, there is also limited literature with regards to the correlation of blood drop flight dynamics to maximum horizontal distance travelled by blood drop. This literature review aims to address the effect of blood drop flight dynamics and the mechanisms of impact <b>spatter</b> generation setup have on the maximum horizontal distance travelled by a blood drop.
