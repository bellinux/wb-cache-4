5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> not on the mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor {{out of the ring}} onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Following WrestleMania XX, Sable {{quickly turned}} heel again {{and engaged in}} another short feud with Torrie Wilson. The feud culminated at The Great American Bash, where Sable {{defeated}} Wilson despite the referee not noticing that one of Wilson's <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> not down. On the edition of July 1 of SmackDown, Sable was defeated by Wilson in a rematch. Sable's final appearance in WWE was on SmackDown! when she, Dawn Marie, and Wilson accompanied Eddie Guerrero to the ring in his lowrider. On August 10, 2004, WWE's official website announced that Sable and WWE had parted ways, this time on good terms. Lesnar claimed that she left the company {{to spend more time}} with her family.|$|E
5|$|Jewish legend {{records that}} Samson's <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> sixty cubits broad. (Many Talmudic commentaries, however, explain {{that this is}} not to be taken literally, for a person that size could not live {{normally}} in society. Rather, it means that he had the ability to carry a burden 60 cubits wide (approximately 30 meters) on his shoulders). He was lame in both feet but, when the spirit of God came upon him, he could step with one stride from Zorah to Eshtaol, while the hairs of his head arose and clashed against one another so that they could be heard for a like distance. Samson was said to be so strong that he could uplift two mountains and rub them together like two s of earth, yet his superhuman strength, like Goliath's, brought woe upon its possessor.|$|E

50|$|Anterior {{shoulder}} in obstetrics refers to that {{shoulder of the}} fetus that faces the pubic symphysis of the mother during delivery. Depending upon the original position of the fetus, either the left or the right <b>shoulder</b> can <b>be</b> the anterior <b>shoulder.</b> It <b>is</b> known as the anterior shoulder as it faces the anterior of the mother. This distinction between the anterior and the posterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> important as the anterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> delivered first.|$|R
5|$|The last {{semifinal}} {{match between}} LAX, accompanied by Guerrero and Salinas, and Styles and Super Eric. During the bout, Hernandez lifted Super Eric {{and held him}} upside-down vertically {{for an extended period}} of time before slamming him back-first into the mat with a delayed vertical suplex. Later, Styles held Homicide in a small package pin attempt until Salinas distracted the referee, allowing Guerrero to enter the ring and readjust Styles and Homicide to make the pin in LAX's favor. Afterwards, the referee counted the pin, giving LAX the win at seven minutes and forty seconds, although Styles' <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> clearly not fully against the mat.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from the headlights of oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
5|$|One popular {{hypothesis}} {{suggested that}} pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin. Nevertheless, {{there is some}} dispute as to whether pinnipeds are {{more closely related to}} bears or musteloids, as some studies support the former theory and others the latter. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (mya) during the Eocene. Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of Puijila darwini in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, Puijila had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its limbs and <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> more robust and Puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer–retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that give rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. The researchers who found Puijila placed it in a clade with Potamotherium (traditionally considered a mustelid) and Enaliarctos. Of the three, Puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of Puijila in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.|$|E
5000|$|A hard <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} called an emergency lane or a breakdown lane, {{when it is}} reserved for vehicle breakdowns, and for emergency vehicles. On some congested roads, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> used as a vehicle lane during peak travel hours.|$|R
50|$|Posterior {{shoulder}} in obstetrics {{refers to the}} shoulder of the fetus other than the anterior shoulder. Thus, the posterior shoulder faces the rectum of the mother during delivery. Whether left or the right shoulder becomes the posterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> dependent upon the original position of the fetus. It is known as the posterior shoulder as it faces the posterior of the mother. This distinction between the anterior and the posterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> important as the anterior <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> delivered first.|$|R
50|$|The lateral fibers perform basic {{shoulder}} abduction {{when the}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> internally rotated, and perform shoulder transverse abduction when the <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> externally rotated. They are not utilized significantly during strict transverse extension (shoulder internally rotated) {{such as in}} rowing movements, which use the posterior fibers.|$|R

50|$|When the <b>shoulder</b> <b>is</b> fixed, levator scapula rotates and flexes the {{cervical}} spine laterally. When both <b>shoulders</b> <b>are</b> fixed, {{a simultaneous}} co-contraction of both levator scapulae muscles in equal amounts would not produce lateral flexion or rotation, and may produce straight flexion or {{extension of the}} cervical spine.|$|R

25|$|Originally, {{the bridge}} was striped for two lanes in each direction. In 1988, the four <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> {{converted}} to traffic lanes, accommodating four lanes in each direction. This allowed an increase in traffic flow. By 2004, an estimated 141,000 vehicles crossed the bridge each day.|$|E

25|$|The {{wearing of}} low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was {{considered}} more acceptable {{than it is}} today—with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts. Low cut dresses that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common across Europe until the Victorian period, though a woman's bared legs, ankles and <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> considered more risqué.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} to decorate paintings with clothes or revetment (riza) of precious metals {{may have been}} borrowed from Eastern Orthodox. The clothing of Our Lady is composed of three gilded silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period. The head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> covered in 1670–90; the chest piece was adapted from a different painting in 1695–1700; {{the bottom of the}} painting was completed by the 1730s. The clothes are richly decorated in floral motifs: roses, tulips, narcissi, carnations, and at least six other species.|$|E
25|$|The {{first ever}} Reyes del Aire tournament {{took place on}} Friday June 10, 2005 as part of CMLL's Friday Night Super Viernes show. The tournament format was a torneo cibernetico, multi-man {{elimination}} match with eight participants. The tournament primarily featured younger, lower ranked wrestlers including Alan Stone, Leono, Ricky Marvin, Misterioso Jr., Stuka Jr., Tigre Blanco, Tigre Metálico, Virus and Volador Jr. During the match Alan Stone and Virus eliminated each other when both men's <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> on the mat during the three count. Volador Jr. pinned Misterioso Jr. {{to become the first}} Rey del Aire.|$|E
25|$|Peter grew to be {{extremely}} tall as an adult, especially for the time period. Standing at 6ft 8in (203cm) in height, the Russian tsar was literally {{head and shoulders above}} his contemporaries both in Russia and throughout Europe. Peter, however, lacked the overall proportional heft and bulk generally found in a man that size. Both his hands and feet were small, and his <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> narrow for his height; likewise, his head was small for his tall body. Added to this were Peter's noticeable facial tics, and he may have suffered from petit mal, a form of epilepsy.|$|E

25|$|Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play {{a special}} role. After 566 BC—when the Panathenaic {{celebrations}} were introduced or reorganized—they were {{the prize for}} the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city's main export goods. On the front they routinely bore {{the image of the}} goddess Athena standing between two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a short neck and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC the vase <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> considerably reduced in width and the curve of the vase body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match that}} {{occurred}} was between Rick Steiner and Mike Rotunda for the NWA World Television Championship. Steiner's younger brother Scott Steiner made his NWA debut {{at the event}} and appeared at ringside with Rick to manage him. Steiner and Rotunda exchanged submission maneuvers on each other. Rotunda offered Steiner a handshake but Steiner did not shake hands with him. Rotunda applied an Abdominal Stretch and cheated near the ropes. Steiner countered the hold with an Oklahoma Roll but was in the ropes. Rotunda gained momentum and attacked Steiner in the corner with his shoulder. Steiner performed a Scoop Powerslam to Rotunda. Steiner was about to win the match until Kevin Sullivan distracted Steiner by talking about his dog Spike. Rotunda took advantage and delivered a Back Suplex to Steiner. Rotunda missed a Dropkick on Steiner and received Mounted Punches in the corner by Steiner. Steiner applied a Sleeper Hold on Rotunda. Rotunda's back fell on Steiner and Steiner's <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> pinned. As a result, Rotunda won the title.|$|E
25|$|Lorica segmentata was {{a type of}} {{body armour}} {{primarily}} used in the early Roman Empire, but the Latin name was first used in the 16th century (the ancient form is unknown). The armour itself consisted of broad ferrous strips ('girth hoops') fastened to internal leather straps. The strips were arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at {{the front and back}} by means of brass hooks, which were joined by leather laces. The upper body and <b>shoulders</b> <b>were</b> protected by additional strips ('shoulder guards') and breast- and backplates. The form of the armour allowed it to be stored very compactly, since it was possible to separate it into four sections. During the time of its use, it was modified several times, the currently recognised types being the Kalkriese (c. 20 BC to 50), Corbridge (c. 40 to 120), and Newstead (c. 120 to possibly the early 4th century) types. There is also a little-known fourth type, known only from a statue found at Alba Julia in Romania, where there {{appears to have been a}} hybrid form, the shoulders being protected by scale armour and the torso hoops being fewer in number and deeper.|$|E
