50|$|Dendrocnide peltata is a {{dioecious}} rainforest tree. Although often encountered as a small, subcanopy tree, it {{may grow}} to {{be a large}} canopy tree up to 30 m high. The trunk grows to a diameter of 650 mm, and is usually crooked and lacking buttresses, while the bark is green or grey in colour, and rough, scaly <b>or</b> <b>flaky</b> in <b>texture.</b> The large leaves, which are broadly ovate, usually peltate, rounded at the base, crenate, acute to acuminate, dark green above and pale green beneath, are clustered at the ends of the branches. The small flowers grow as axillary inflorescences. The fruits are about 20 mm long, green or brown, with the seeds about 2 mm in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The Dutch letter (also {{referred}} to as banket letter, almond letter, butter letter, and in Dutch as banketstaven and letterbanket) {{is a type of}} pastry or cookie that is typically prepared using a mixture of flour, eggs and butter or puff pastry as its base and filled with almond paste, dusted with sugar and shaped in an [...] "S" [...] or other letter shape. Marzipan, an almond paste prepared with almond meal and honey or sugar, is sometimes used as the filling. The Dutch letter has a porous <b>or</b> airy and <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pastry is {{differentiated}} from bread {{by having}} a higher fat content, which contributes to a <b>flaky</b> <b>or</b> crumbly <b>texture.</b> A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support {{the weight of the}} filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for yeast bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.|$|R
50|$|The corvina has a {{white and}} <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> and a mild, sweet taste. Cooking methods include grilled, baked, fried, and sushi, {{and it is}} a popular choice in ceviche.|$|R
5000|$|Soan papdi (also {{known as}} patisa, son papri, sohan papdi or shonpapri) [...] {{is a popular}} North Indian dessert. It is usually cube-shaped or served as flakes, and has a crisp and <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{are noted}} for <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> and buttery taste, {{similar to a}} flattened, round croissant, with a salty taste. They are often toasted with jam or butter, or served just with tea, {{although}} the high fat content (partly lard) makes them extremely hot when toasted. Commercial producers use vegetable oils instead of butter.|$|R
50|$|Balushahi is {{made from}} a stiff dough made with {{all-purpose}} flour, ghee {{and a pinch of}} baking soda. One-inch-diameter (25 mm), 1⁄2-inch-thick (13 mm) discs are shaped with hands, fried in ghee or oil and dunked in thick sugar syrup to form a sugar coating. They are sweet, but tasty with a slightly <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Badushahs (also spelled Bhadushah) {{are made}} from a stiff dough made with {{all-purpose}} flour, ghee {{and a pinch of}} baking soda. One-inch-diameter (...) , 1/2 in discs are shaped with hands, fried in ghee or oil and dunked in thick sugar syrup so that there is a sugar coating. They are very sweet, but tasty with a slightly <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{croissant}} ( [...] , [...] ) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry {{named for}} its well-known crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, <b>flaky</b> <b>texture,</b> similar to a puff pastry.|$|R
2500|$|The Aberdeen {{region has}} given {{its name to}} a number of dishes, {{including}} the Aberdeen buttery (also known as [...] "rowie") and Aberdeen Sausage. The Aberdeen buttery is more frequently seen and is sold at bakeries and supermarkets throughout the city. It is comparable to a croissant that is flat and round with a buttery, savoury taste and <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b> It is often toasted and served plain or with butter or jam.|$|R
50|$|Alternative vegetable-based halva recipes {{popular in}} India and Pakistan use beetroots, potatoes, yams, and most {{commonly}} carrots (for gajar halwa), mung beans (for moong dal halwa), or bottle gourds (for doodi halwa) instead of semolina. Prepared with condensed milk and ghee, without semolina to bind it together, {{the end result}} has a moist, yet <b>flaky,</b> <b>texture</b> when freshly prepared. Other examples include the famous Agra Petha- easily available at Taj Mahal, Agra.|$|R
50|$|A torpedo dessert (фунийки с крем, Torpil tatlısı, Külah tatlısı, Трубочки с кремом, Rurki z kremem) is a buttery, flaky {{viennoiserie}} bread roll {{named for}} its well-known torpedo shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, <b>flaky</b> <b>texture,</b> similar to a puff pastry.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} ensure the <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> of the croissant, it is {{important}} to balance the yeast activity with steam production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse. During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other puff pastries.|$|R
50|$|The {{white flesh}} of the {{sablefish}} is soft-textured and mildly flavored. It is considered a delicacy in many countries. When cooked, its <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> is similar to Patagonian toothfish (Chilean sea bass). The meat has a high fat content and can be prepared in many ways, including grilling, smoking, or frying, or served as sushi. Sablefish flesh is high in long-chain omega 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. It contains {{about as much as}} wild salmon.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth step}} is the baking process. Also known as “pastry lift” or “dough lift,” the dough expands as water is {{converted}} to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b> Depending {{on the type of}} oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10-20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165 °C to 205 °C.|$|R
50|$|White crab meat {{comes from}} the claws and legs of the crab and while {{predominantly}} white in colour {{it does have a}} naturally occurring red/brown tinge throughout. White crab is very low in fat and particularly high in protein, it has a delicate, sweet flavour, a sweet aroma and a naturally <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b> White crab meat is versatile and while it is consumed largely in sandwiches, it can be used in pastas, risottos, and salads as well as a canape topping.|$|R
5000|$|Flacourtia jangomas is a small, {{deciduous}} shrub or {{tree that}} grows to {{a height of}} 6-10m. Trunk and branches are commonly thornless in old trees, but densely beset with simple or branched, blunt woody thorns when younger. Bark is light-brown to copper-red with a <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> and the leaves are light green and narrow ovate in shape. It produces small white to whitish green fragrant flowers. The relatively juicy fruits are rounded pink to dark red and about an inch wide.|$|R
50|$|Overworking {{the dough}} is also a hazard. Overworking elongates the gluten strands, {{creating}} a product that is tough, rather than light and crumbly <b>or</b> <b>flaky.</b>|$|R
5|$|The corticioid {{species of}} Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma develop crust-like fruitbodies with a smooth, porous, <b>or</b> <b>flaky</b> surface and grow on tree logs or dead branches.|$|R
50|$|Red drum have a {{moderate}} flavor {{and are not}} oily. Big drum can be tricky to clean; removing the large scales can be challenging. Many fishers prefer to fillet with an electric knife, first removing the fillet from along the backbone, and then using the electric knife to cut the fillet from the skin and scales. Fish over 15 lb can become tough and have a consistency comparable with chicken, rather than the <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> of many species of fish. Younger fish are often indistinguishable in flavor from black drum.|$|R
50|$|Also {{common is}} the {{practice}} of dotting the bread. This creates multiple wells in the bread by using a finger or the handle of a utensil to poke the unbaked dough. As a way to preserve moisture in the bread, olive oil is then spread over the dough, by hand or with a pastry brush prior to rising and baking. In {{the northern part of}} Italy, lard will sometimes be added to the dough, giving the focaccia a softer, slightly <b>flakier</b> <b>texture.</b> Focaccia recipes are widely available, and with the popularity of bread machines, many cookbooks now provide versions of dough recipes that do not require hand kneading.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus largiflorens, {{or black}} box, is {{a species of}} Eucalyptus which is endemic to Australia. It is a tree grows up to 20 metres in height. and has persistent, fibrous <b>or</b> <b>flaky</b> bark which is a grey to grey-black colour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{orthodox}} {{version is}} from the Guangdong-Hong Kong region,where filling consists of candied wintermelon. The candied wintermelon mash is then combined with white sesame seeds and glutinous rice flour. [...] Coconut {{in the form of}} mash or desiccated shreds and almond paste as well as vanilla is also sometimes added. The authentic flavour and <b>flaky</b> <b>texture</b> of the pastry is produced by the usage of pork lard shortening [...] then by glazing with egg wash. Due to its rising popularity in Western countries brought about by immigration, butter is sometimes substituted in place of lard, however the taste is altered. [...] The level of sweetness is mild, compared to Western sweet pastries.|$|R
50|$|Castanopsis costata grows as a tree up to 36 m {{tall with}} a trunk {{diameter}} {{of up to}} 80 cm. The whitish bark is smooth, scaly <b>or</b> <b>flaky.</b> The coriaceous leaves measure up to 15 cm long. Its conical nuts measure up to 2 cm long.|$|R
25|$|The bark {{of mature}} white spruce is scaly <b>or</b> <b>flaky,</b> grey-brown (Brayshaw 1960) or ash-brown (Harlow and Harrar 1950), but silvery when freshly exposed. Resin {{blisters}} are normally lacking, but the Porsild spruce Picea glauca var. porsildii Raup has {{been credited with}} having smooth resin-blistered bark (Hosie 1969).|$|R
50|$|In Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand, shingaras (the East Indian {{version of}} samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. Shingaras {{are easy to}} make, but the folding is a little tricky and many people {{do not know how}} to fold or make shingaras. Shingaras are a bit smaller {{compared}} to those in other parts of India and the filling mainly consists of small pieces of potato and unmashed boiled potato, along with the addition of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin dough and fried. The coating is of white flour, not wheat flour, and it is slightly sweet in taste. What distinguishes good shingaras are <b>flaky</b> <b>textures,</b> almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.|$|R
50|$|Curry puffs are {{commonly}} seen in Singapore's Pasar Malams and other stalls in shopping centres. Additionally, the aforementioned epok-epok {{is a popular}} variation in some of Singapore's hawker centres, usually amongst Malay stalls. Alternatively, the more common type of curry puff has a thick <b>or</b> <b>flaky</b> English-style crust, {{with a mixture of}} Chinese and Indian styles in the filling.|$|R
5000|$|Bing (...) are baked {{wheat flour}} based confections. These are either {{similar to the}} short-pastry crust of western cuisine <b>or</b> <b>flaky</b> puff pastry, the latter of which is often known as su (...) [...] The {{preferred}} fat used for bing is usually lard. Common bing types include moon cake, sun cake (Beijing and Taiwan varieties) and wife cake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dough is}} placed {{into the oven}} under a ceiling of steam or, alternatively, the oven is {{injected}} with steam {{as soon as the}} loaf is loaded. This adds moisture to the body of the bread which delays establishment of the crust and tends to prevent cracking, resulting in a more evenly risen and thinner crust as well as a light and airy crumb. [...] When the steam is gone (sometimes today, withdrawn), the dry heat of the oven bakes the crust, producing its characteristically slightly crisp and <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b> Vienna bread is typically formed as an oblong loaf, but can be baked in other shapes. As a longer loaf, it may well have been the origin of French bread as bakers there attempted to adopt the steam method to produce their baguettes.|$|R
50|$|Melaleuca incana is a shrub {{or small}} tree which grows to {{a height of}} about 5 m and has fibrous <b>or</b> <b>flaky</b> bark. The leaves are in threes, {{sometimes}} rings of four along the branchlets, 3.5-17 mm long and 0.5-3.5 mm wide, linear or very narrow elliptic in shape and tapering to a point. The leaves and young branches are covered with fine, soft hairs giving the foliage a grey appearance.|$|R
40|$|Cookies {{quality is}} {{influenced}} by material and processing. Wheat flour as major component of cookies production has a role on volume expansion of cookies. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of wheat flour substitution with waxy starch or modified waxy starch by HMT treatment and baking temperature effect on physical properties of cookies. Cookies was made by ratio of wheat flour and waxy starch or HMT waxy starch 50 : 50, this research was carried out including the analysis of texture, volume expansion, and color. Substituted HMT waxy starch cookies resulted on the <b>flakier</b> <b>texture.</b> The highest volume expansion was revealed by substituted waxy cookies with baking temperature 140 oC and substituted HMT waxy starch cookies with baking temperature 130 oC. Higher baking temperature and substitution cookies with HMT waxy starch were revealed on the higher intensity of the darkness of cookies color...|$|R
50|$|Cheddars are a {{brand of}} baked Cheddar cheese-flavoured British-style savoury biscuit, having a {{granular}} crumbly texture unlike crackers which are harder, more brittle and <b>flaky</b> in <b>texture.</b> They are manufactured by McVitie's {{as an alternative to}} other snack foods such as potato crisps. They were originally manufactured and sold by Crawfords. Until 2014, Cheddars were marketed under the McVitie's brand, but are now marketed under the Jacob's brand.|$|R
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a <b>flaky</b> <b>texture.</b> Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus grandis, {{commonly}} known as the flooded gum or rose gum, is a tall tree with smooth bark, rough at the base fibrous <b>or</b> <b>flaky,</b> grey to grey-brown. At maturity, it reaches 50 m tall, though the largest specimens can exceed 80 m tall. It is found on coastal areas and sub-coastal ranges from Newcastle in New South Wales northwards to west of Daintree in Queensland, mainly on flat land and lower slopes, where it is the dominant tree of wet forests and on the margins of rain forests.|$|R
