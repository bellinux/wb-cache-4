40|$|Full-duplex is {{the ability}} of a node to {{transmit}} and receive simultaneously in the same band. Ideal wireless full-duplex communication can double the spectral efficiency compared to the traditional half-duplex communication. In this dissertation, we study the challenges in realizing full-duplex communication. We tackle the challenges from two different perspectives: node and network. Node perspective: Simultaneous transmission and reception results in a large self- interference due to the proximity of transmit and receive antennas at the full-duplex node. To establish the feasibility of wireless full-duplex, we develop a wideband real-time physical layer and evaluate its performance on the WARP testbed. Self-interference reduction in our proposed physical layer is achieved through passive suppression and active cancellation. Based on the constraints of the physical layer, we propose a MAC layer protocol which is designed specifically to discover and enhance opportunities to communicate in the full-duplex mode. Experimental evaluation of our physical layer design, as well as several other full-duplex designs proposed in literature, reveal that active cancellation does not push self-interference all the way upto the thermal noise floor. In this dissertation, we explore the bottlenecks limiting active cancellation in full-duplex systems. We show that the amount of active cancellation is limited by transmitter side noise, particularly by the phase-noise in the local oscillator at the transmitter of the full- duplex node. Thus, unlike conventional half-duplex systems where receiver thermal noise is a limiting factor, full-duplex systems are limited by transmitter side noise. As a key by-product of our analysis, we propose a signal model for a wideband MIMO full-duplex system. We use our proposed signal model to study the performance limits of a system where the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> and the start of reception at a full-duplex node are not synchronized. Interestingly, we discover that the bit-error-rate of the communication mode where the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> precedes the start of reception is better than the mode where <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> follows reception of a packet at the full-duplex node. Network perspective: In order to extract gains in capacity from full-duplex operation in a multi-user network, we propose to use full-duplex capable nodes to si- multaneously operate uplink and downlink in a network. Such operation results in a new type of interference in the network – internode interference, i. e., the uplink transmission from each mobile user starts interfering with the downlink receptions at all the other mobile users. We show a physical layer coding strategy that aligns interference over time and extracts gains in degrees-of-freedom of the network. Finally, we recognize that larger gains from full-duplex operation are possible by leveraging the fact that the strength of the internode interference channel is often different from the uplink/downlink channel. By analysing the uplink/downlink capacity of a network composed of one base-station and two mobile users, we show that full-duplex not only out-performs half-duplex, but also recovers some of the degrees-of-freedom lost due to lack/delay of channel state information of the network...|$|E
30|$|We {{can make}} use of the third point to our advantage. Specifically, the {{presence}} of some pilots and slow variation in the channel allows us to get a tentative estimate of the data. If we are able to arrange the data according to its reliability, starting with the most reliable data, then there would be a less chance that we need to backtrack. Since earlier data is reliable, {{there is no need to}} backtrack for this part. The later data might not be reliable, but by the time we start processing this data, the algorithm would have been already converged. However, measuring data reliability requires tentative channel/data estimates. Thus, the blind algorithm can be turned into a semi-blind algorithm to reliably track the channel along with the data detection. The semi-blind algorithm would require a short training sequence of L symbols only at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> to get a tentative estimate of the data and its reliability and no further pilots or channel statistics would be required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a streaming communication system where the source packets must be played back sequentially at the destination {{and study the}} associated average playback delay. We assume that all the source packets are available before the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> at the transmitter and {{consider the case of}} an i. i. d. erasure channel with perfect feedback. We first consider the case when the receiver buffer can be arbitrarily large, and show that the average playback delay remains bounded in the length of the stream provided that the channel bandwidth is greater than a critical threshold. Our analysis involves the application of martingale theory to study the transient behaviour of a one dimensional random walk with drift. Conversely when the channel bandwidth is smaller than the above threshold, the average playback delay increases linearly with the stream length. We also consider the finite buffer case and analyse the playback delay of a greedy dynamic bandwidth scheme. We further show through simulations that the achievable delay with a finite receiver buffer is close to the infinite buffer case for moderately large buffer values. I...|$|E

The time difference (t) between triggering time and signal arrival at the nth receiver is the spread-time between transmitter and receiver along a fixed distance equal to the l = (n− 1) ×  0.1  m (the separation) between neighboring sensors. The wave velocity is then defined by simply dividing: V = l/t. Examples of field records are presented in Fig.  6 d, e.

40|$|Reliable {{transmission}} of video over wireless networks must address both the limited bandwidth {{and the possibility}} of loss. When bandwidth sufficient to transmit the video is unavailable on a single channel, the video can be partitioned over multiple channels with possibly unequal bandwidths and error characteristics at the expense of more complex channel coding (error correction). This paper addresses the problem of efficiently partitioning forward error protected, pre-encoded video data for transmission over multiple channels. The assumption of pre-encoding precludes adjustment of source rates to the channels, since it is assumed that channel characteristics are not known until immediately prior to the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> The proposed partitioning exploits the structure of MPEG video, and frames in each group-of-pictures are reordered based on their decoding dependence and assigned to the channels to maximize the decodable frame rate. To be spectrally efficient, the frames are unequally error protected based on both frame types and channel packet loss rates. This technique is also applicable to scalable coding techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach is effective under a variety of channel conditions and for a broad range of source material...|$|E

40|$|Energy Harvesting (EH) {{is a novel}} {{technique}} to prolong the lifetime of the wireless networks such as wireless sensor networks or Ad-Hoc networks, by providing an unlimited source of energy for their nodes.

On the other hand, cooperative communication with the help of relay nodes improves the performance of wireless communication networks by increasing the system throughput or the reliability as well as the range and efficient energy utilization. In order to investigate the cooperation in EH nodes, in this paper, we consider the problem of optimal power and rate allocation in the degraded full-duplex Gaussian relay channel in which source and relay can harvest energy from their environments. We consider the general stochastic energy arrivals at the source and the relay with known EH times and amounts at the transmitters before the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission.</b> This problem has a min-max optimization form that along with the constraints is not easy to solve.

40|$|Following {{an initial}} test {{campaign}} in June 2013, the GPS Directorate has initiated a pre-operational routine generation and {{transmission of the}} Civil Navigation Message CNAV starting on 28 April 2014. The new message is broadcast by Block IIR-M satellites on the L 2 C signal {{as well as the}} L 2 C and L 5 signals of the Block IIF satellites. The improved resolution and larger number of parameters in the new CNAV ephemeris message offers a notably reduced ephemeris fitting error and largely avoids the discontinuities of consecutive ephemeris messages from the same upload. CNAV data of the Block IIR-M and IIF satellites have been collected since the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> using a small set of globally distributed receivers offering an almost continuous coverage. Based on comparison with precise ephemerides of the International GNSS Service (IGS), a Signal-in-Space Range Error (SISRE) of about 1. 1 m is obtained for the CNAV message whereas it is 0. 6 m for the legacy navigation message (LNAV). This degraded performance is related to less frequent CNAV updates resulting in prediction times of up to four days. For a three week period with a daily CNAV update rate almost the same SISRE is obtained as for LNAV. Complementary to the SISRE analysis, the new Inter-Signal Corrections (ISCs) have been monitored, which enable users to correctly account for differential code biases (DCBs) when using other signals than the L 1 /L 2 P(Y) -code observations in real-time positioning applications. The broadcast ISC values agree with DCBs derived in the frame of the IGS Multi-GNSS Experiment and DCBs from the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe on the 0. 1 – 2 ns level depending on the ISC type. While users of the the civil L 1 C/A and L 2 C signals have, so far, experienced a notably degraded positioning, the ISCs now enable a single point positioning accuracy that is fully competitive with that of semi-codeless P(Y) -code receivers...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} a coder and decoder of fractal signals of comb-type structure (FSCS) based on microcontrollers (MC). The coder and decoder consist of identical control modules, while their managed modules have different schematic constructions. The control module performs forming or recognition of signals, and also carries out {{the function of}} information exchange with a computer. The basic element of the control module is a PIC 18 F 2550 microcontroller from MicroChip. The coder of the system forms fractal signals of a given order according to the information bits coming from the computer. Samples of the calculated values of the amplitudes of elementary rectangular pulses that constitute the structure of fractal pulses are stored {{in the memory of}} the microcontroller as a table. Minimum bit capacity of the DAC necessary for the generation of FSCS of fourth order is four bits. The operation algorithm, "wired" into the controller of the program, provides for encoding of the transmitted information by two-bit symbols. Recognition of the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of each byte in communication channel is performed by the transmission of the timing signal. In a decoder the microcontroller carries out reception and decoding of the received fractal signals which are then transmitted to the computer. The developed algorithm of the program for the microcontroller of the decoder is carried out by determination of order of fractal impulse after the value of sum of amplitudes of elementary impulses, constituents fractal signal. The programs for coder and decoder are written in "C". In the most critical places of the program influencing on the fast-acting of chart “assembler” insertions are done. The blocks of the coder and decoder were connected with a coaxial 10 meters long cable with an impendance of 75 Ohm. The signals generated by the developed coder of FSCS, were studied using a digital oscillograph. On the basis of the obtained spectrums, it is possible to draw a conclusion, that the fractal signals formed by the coder are wideband and can be used in noise-resistant and protected communication systems...|$|E
