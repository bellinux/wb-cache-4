2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started. While they closely resemble miniature Janney couplers, they are somewhat different mechanically, with the knuckle pivoting {{from the center}} of the coupler head, rather than from the side. A <b>steel</b> <b>pin,</b> designed to resemble an air brake hose, allows the couplers to be released magnetically; the design of the coupler head prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a straight pin extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised above rail height when uncoupling was desired.|$|E
2500|$|In July St Nicholas Abbey {{was aimed}} at the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and was made the ante-post {{favourite}} ahead of Cirrus des Aigles, Trading Leather and Novellist. On 23 July, {{four days before the}} race, the horse sustained a serious leg injury (described as a [...] "fractured pastern") during exercise at Ballydoyle, ending his racing career and putting his life in danger. On the following day, the horse underwent surgery at Fethard Equine Hospital aimed at saving him for a stud career. On 25 July Coolmore announced that the horse was [...] "comfortable", but remained in intensive care and had [...] "many bridges to cross before he is considered out of danger". On the following day it was announced that the horse had suffered a [...] "major setback" [...] after contracting colic which necessitated additional surgery. St Nicholas Abbey made a good recovery over the following week. Coolmore released details of the surgical procedures: twenty screws and a <b>steel</b> <b>pin</b> had been inserted into St Nicholas Abbey's leg and a bone-graft from the horse's hip had been used to improve blood supply to the afflicted limb. The Fethard Hospital's Doctor Tom O'Brien described his patient as [...] "a very, very tough horse".|$|E
2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a <b>steel</b> <b>pin</b> that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a hydraulic ram or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{biodegradable}} pin for diaphyseal femoral fracture fixation, polylactide acid (PLA) pins were implanted in the femoral bone of rats. A distal diaphyseal fracture was performed. Union and tissue reaction to PLA <b>pins</b> versus stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pins</b> was studied after 15 days, and 1, 2 and 6 months of implantation. PLA and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>pins</b> induced the same union and a similar tissue reaction during the 6 -month period. Biocompatibility of material was satisfactory. PublishedN/...|$|R

2500|$|Glock pistols are {{designed}} with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated [...] "Safe Action" [...] by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety. The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened <b>steel</b> <b>pin</b> that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure {{is applied to the}} trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released. This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off levers, hammers, or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs. The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments.|$|E

Two (2) angled arms are anchored {{at each end of}} each set of wheels. This setup prevents longitudinal movement along the rails as well as prevents tipping of the crane due to uplift from high velocity winds.|$|E
50|$|Quoiting (pronounced kiteing) was {{a popular}} sport amongst the male villagers. Quoiting greens were found in Renton, Alexandria, Hardgate and many Ayrshire villages. Quoits were heavy iron rings, rounded on one side, flat on the other and weighed 8-12 pounds but could be up to 23 pounds. They were hurled at a <b>steel</b> <b>pin</b> driven into a three-foot square clay bed, with the common length of the green being 18 yards. Renton were Scottish Champions in 1949 and 1986.

5000|$|The marking {{implement}} {{is chosen}} {{depending upon the}} operation to be performed. Some marking gauges {{have the capability to}} allow a number of implements to be fitted, others do not; and a woodworker will often have a number of different types. A <b>steel</b> <b>pin</b> is used when scribing with the grain. A steel knife is used when scribing across the grain. The pen or pencil is used when the woodworker does not wish the surface to be marred. Generally speaking, the pin and knife yield more accurate marking than do the pen or pencil. It is also used to mark parallel lines to the face side and edge side.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{historian}} Diana Muir {{writing in}} Reflections in Bullough's Pond, Root [...] "reconceptualized" [...] {{the making of}} axes. Until his invention, axes were made by [...] "flattening wrought iron, folding it around a <b>steel</b> <b>pin,</b> and forging the two sides together under a trip hammer." [...] Root arranged [...] "a series of dies and rollers that could 'die forge' -or apply pressure to a mold, forming apiece of hot wrought iron {{into the shape of}} an ax, with an eye already punched to receive the handle." [...] According to Muir, Root next automated the tempering of axes by inventing a machine that moved ax heads through a temperature-regulated oven on a rotating wheel. And a machine that [...] "shaved" [...] the axes to give them a sharp edge, so that they needed only a small amount of finishing on a grindstone.|$|E

50|$|Torpedo nets {{could be}} hung {{out from the}} {{defending}} ship, when moored or otherwise stationary in the water, on multiple horizontal booms. Each boom was fixed to the ship at one end at or below {{the edge of the}} main deck, by a <b>steel</b> <b>pin</b> that permitted the boom to be swung against the ship and secured when the ship sailed. A series of such booms was so fixed at intervals along each side of the ship. When the ship was moored, the free ends of the booms could be swung out with the net hung on the outer ends, thus suspending the net at a distance from the ship equal to the length of the boom, all around the ship. With the net mounted, a torpedo aimed at the ship would hit the mesh net and explode at a sufficient distance from the hull to prevent serious damage to the ship.|$|E
