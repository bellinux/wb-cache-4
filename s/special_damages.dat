25|$|On May 9, 2004, Federal Judge Dale A. Kimball heard both parties' {{arguments}} and took both motions under advisement. Judge Kimball denied SCO's motion to remand and partially granted Novell's {{motion to dismiss}} on June 9, 2004, on a pleading technicality. The case was dismissed without prejudice, which allowed SCO to amend their complaint to include properly pleaded <b>special</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Thus, upon {{a review}} of the pre-1977 English and present-day Australian case law, the Court of Appeal {{concluded}} that <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> is not limited to actual pecuniary loss, and it is not required that the applicant alone has suffered damage. An applicant asserting a violation of a public right must show that his [...] "personal interests are directly and practically affected over and above the general class of persons who hold that right". The Court declined to offer more specific guidelines as the <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> requirement is necessarily fact sensitive, dependent on individual cases.|$|R

That being the case, an applicant seeking an interdict against the unlawful operation of a waste disposal site without a permit is required to show that the contravention of the Act by the respondent has caused or was likely to cause him some <b>special</b> <b>damage.</b> The court held on the facts that the applicant had not shown that she had suffered any <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> at all.|$|R

The attorneys representing Deak and the passengers are Gary R. Will and Paul Miller from Will Barristers in Toronto. The plaintiffs sought payments for general and aggravated damages in the amount of $75 million, and payments for <b>special</b> <b>damages</b> and pecuniary damages in the amount of $250 million. A second class action lawsuit was also filed by plaintiffs Sahar Alqudsi and Younis Qawasmi (her husband) for $150 million {{a few days}} later.

2500|$|In May 2016, the Court {{found that}} the {{allegations}} in the Deep Capture articles were spurious and Nazerali was awarded $1.2 million in damages, including $500,000 in aggravated damages, $250,000 in punitive damages and $55,000 in <b>special</b> <b>damages.</b> Byrne was permanently banned from publishing these accusations. The Court found Byrne, his employee Mark Mitchell, and Deep Capture [...] "engaged in a calculated and ruthless campaign to inflict as much damage on Mr. Nazerali’s reputation as they could achieve." [...] The 102-page decision said “It is clear on the evidence that their intention was to conduct a vendetta in which the truth about Mr. Nazerali himself was of no consequence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{noted that}} there is [...] "no {{categorical}} answer" [...] as to what constitutes <b>special</b> <b>damage.</b> The Court considered the view of Peter Cane, an English academic, who had argued that <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> was either damage to the common interests to {{all members of the}} public but suffered to a greater degree by the applicant, or damage qualitatively different from that suffered by the public. The Court also agreed with the High Court of Australia's decision in Australia Conservation Foundation Inc. v. Commonwealth (1980) which equated the <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> criterion to a requirement for [...] "special interest" [...] in {{the subject matter of the}} action. However, special interest cannot be a [...] "mere intellectual or emotional concern". If the applicant's action succeeds, he or she must gain some advantage [...] "other than the satisfaction of righting a wrong, upholding a principle or winning a contest". If the application fails, he or she must suffer some disadvantage [...] "other than a sense of grievance or a debt for costs".|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a [...] "slander of title" [...] suit against Novell, SCO v. Novell. [...] This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO's claim for <b>special</b> <b>damages</b> was dismissed on June 9, 2004 for [...] "failure to specifically plead special damages." [...] However, SCO was given 30 days [...] "to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages". In the same ruling, [...] the judge stated that it was questionable {{whether or not the}} Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights, reasoning that the ASA amendment by which SCO was claiming to have acquired those rights contained no transfer language in the form of [...] "seller hereby conveys to buyer" [...] and that it used ambiguous language {{when it came to the}} question of when and how and which rights were to be transferred.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In liberalised {{electrical}} power supply mar-kets, asset management procedures have developed into a central element of network operation and planning. Asset management methods consider all relevant life cycle cost related to the network equipment and provide strategies for reinvestment, maintenance and fault elimination. How-ever, the methods require information about the compo-nent reliability of the installed network equipment, as well as about costs arising {{in the case of}} damage. Further, the component reliability depends on component age, mainte-nance history and operational stresses – so, a prediction of the component reliability based on the asset management strategies has to be found. Up to now, only rudimental quantitative statements are available. In a current re-search project, data of historical damage events is collected in a <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> statistic to provide more detailed re-sults. In this paper, the approach for a comprehensive, risk-oriented asset management method in distribution net-works is presented and possible applications are illus-trated. Also, the developed scheme of the <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> statistic is described and intermediate results of the com-ponent reliability and their application in the correspond-ing ageing models to derive a prognosis of the component reliability depending on the chosen asset management strategies are presented...|$|R

50|$|A {{personal}} injury claim {{consists of two}} main sections: General damages and <b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> (see Damages), Gratuitous care is a head of claim that comes under <b>Special</b> <b>damages.</b> <b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> normally encompasses expenses that the injured party has paid for (for example taxi fares where he/she {{has not been able}} to drive to places as normal), or of monies he/she would have received but has not due to his/her injuries (for example loss of earnings). However, in the case of Gratuitous care the injured party can claim for the care and help he/she has received by friends and/or family even though he/she has probably not actually paid over any money. The law recognises that this care and help provided by friends and family is necessary and would otherwise need to be paid for, and therefore enables the injured party to claim just as he/she would have done if the care had been purchased from an outside agency.|$|E
