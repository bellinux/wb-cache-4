25|$|Following his arrest, Haneef's family {{claimed that}} any link {{between him and}} the terrorists is only tenuous, and a case of guilt by association, that he was not {{involved}} in the plot, and that he was returning to India to see his wife and daughter. Haneef's father-in-law <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> wanted to take his wife and daughter back to Australia after getting the infant a passport, and so travelled without a return ticket.|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{said through}} his {{attorney}} {{that he did}} not prescribe or administer pethidine or oxycodone to Jackson, but did not say what, if anything, he did prescribe or administer. Los Angeles police <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> spoke to officers immediately after Jackson's death, and during an extensive interview two days later. They stressed that they found [...] "no red flag" [...] and did not suspect foul play. On June 26, police towed away a car used by Murray, stating that it might contain medication or other evidence. The police released the car five days later.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of The Brain of Morbius, the Fourth Doctor was stated to be 749 years old ("something like 750 years" [...] in the prior Pyramids of Mars). In The Ribos Operation, Romana <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> was 759 {{years old and had}} been {{piloting}} the TARDIS for 523 years, making him 236 when he first [...] "borrowed" [...] it. When the Doctor encounters his old friend Drax in The Armageddon Factor, Drax says it has been 450 years since their time together at the Academy, suggesting only that Drax was 450 years younger, but implying nothing about the Doctor's age, since {{it could have been a}} different amount of time for him. Drax implies that the Doctor got his doctorate after that. In The Robots of Death, the Fourth Doctor states he is 750 years old.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{here are}} some of our snapshots," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son, and he brought forth the {{pictures}} the boys had taken on their various outings.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{dangerous}} {{to be in}} the forest during such lightning," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "We might be struck, or caught by some falling tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That pit is {{just beyond}} here," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "We'd better go slow---in case that lion hasn't been caught {{and is at}} large." ...|$|R
2500|$|In other media, more {{has been}} {{revealed}} of the Doctor's early life. In the Past Doctor Adventures novel Divided Loyalties, the Doctor recalls his Academy {{years in a}} dream induced by the Celestial Toymaker. According to this, {{he was a member}} of an organisation called the Deca, ten brilliant Academy students campaigning for increased Time Lord intervention, alongside Mortimus (the Meddling Monk), Ushas (the Rani), Koschei (the Master), Magnus (the War Chief), Drax, a spy named Vansell, Millennia, Rallon and Jelpax. With this group, he learns about the Celestial Toymaker and travels to his realm in a type 18 TARDIS with Deca members Rallon and Millennia, who are killed. This leads to the Doctor's expulsion from the Academy, condemned to five hundred years in Records and Traffic Control. In The Quantum Archangel, it is revealed the Doctor studied cosmic science alongside the Master, taught by Cardinal Sendok. In the Virgin Missing Adventures novel Goth Opera, it is <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> was a frequent prankster while at the Academy, introducing cats into Gallifrey's ecosystem with his friend Ruath and electrifying a [...] "perigosto stick" [...] belonging to his teacher, Borusa.|$|E
2500|$|Doctor Who and the Terror of the Autons, {{written by}} Dicks, gives further clarity {{to the history}} between the Doctor and the Master. When the Time Lord (played by David Garth in the {{original}} serial) comes to warn the Doctor, he states [...] "I've come to bring you a warning, {{an old friend of}} yours has arrived on Earth. These days he calls himself The Master." [...] The narrative states that [...] " [...] had been behind several interplanetary wars, always disappearing from the scene before he could be brought to justice. If ever he were caught, his fate would be far worse than the Doctor's exile. Once captured by the Time Lords, the Master's life-stream would be thrown into reverse. Not only would he no longer exist, he never would have existed." [...] The Doctor asks [...] "Is his TARDIS still working?". The Time Lord replies [...] "I'm afraid so. He got away before it could be de-energised." [...] "Then he was luckier than I" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> sadly. He had never really got used to his exile. The Time Lord replies [...] "Don't be bitter Doctor, your punishment was comparatively light".|$|E
6000|$|... 'There! Take my {{love with}} it,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> {{imprinting}} his upon them; 'and many happy returns of the - the idea! - of the day. [...] The notion of wishing happy returns {{in such a}} farce as this,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to himself, 'is good! Ha! ha! ha!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right, {{and very}} good, {{but if we}} want any game we've got to keep quiet," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son after <b>the</b> song was ended.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{certainly}} coming this way," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son, {{picking up his}} gun. [...] "And I'm afraid there must be {{quite a number of}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hope we haven't missed <b>the</b> way," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son presently. [...] "Seems to me {{we ought}} to be getting to the river or the lake soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is a fine}} healthy young lady," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> Tom gave a brother's ready {{adhesion}} to {{the word}} healthy, but passed over the other epithet as being superfluous. [...] "Now, I'll {{tell you what it}} is," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> [...] "Of course I don't want to inquire into any family secrets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should also,' {{observed}} the doctor, who {{had passed the}} foot-bath on the stairs, 'I should also,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> {{in the voice of}} an oracle, 'put her feet in hot water, and wrap them up in flannel. I should likewise,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> with increased solemnity, 'give her something light for supper--the wing of a roasted fowl now--' ...|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had been}} long alone the servant-maid came in, and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> wanted to see me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonder {{what time}} it is?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son, and felt for his watch. [...] "Why, I declare, my watch is gone!" [...] he exclaimed in consternation.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will give}} the beast {{something}} to eat, in case he is captured," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "We don't want him to starve on our hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are having}} one {{adventure}} {{on top of}} <b>the</b> other," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son with a grim smile. [...] "Well, is it go forward or stay here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As good things. Miss Venetia, as {{strawberries}} and cream,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> laughing; 'and, like them, always best united.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've read of such cases. It's a {{calcareous}} {{enlargement of}} the vascular bony tissue, threatening ossification," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush! hush! hush!' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> himself very agitated. 'Venetia loves you, only you. Why {{should she}} love any one else?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we haven't {{much farther}} to go," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "My father said we'd {{find a good}} camping spot {{less than a mile}} from here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "Anyway, we can't {{get through}} here. We'll ruin our shoes {{and run the}} risk of {{breaking}} our necks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must confess}} I am {{more or less}} turned around already," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "Is our shore over there?" [...] and he pointed with his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{imagine you}} to have excelled in your profession,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> admiring the boy's gravity. 'Do you ever laugh?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shall have}} nothing to think of then,' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> with a smile, 'but my Dictionary; and this other contract-bargain--Annie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, THAT'S {{comparatively}} decent," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> reflectively. [...] "It's only sawdust {{mixed with}} a little gum and formic acid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case, let us {{try to find}} Mr. Ghost," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. Now <b>the</b> {{mystery of}} the ghostly voice was {{explained}} {{he was no longer}} afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{certainly}} a very pretty deception," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> friends--carelessly, however, for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurer's show. [...] "Pray, how was it effected?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{let us go}} to camp first, and see how Giant and Tommy {{are making}} out," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son. [...] "Most likely they'll be {{worrying}} about us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--that is--not yet; I saw him yesterday," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> with {{conscientious}} professional precision, {{looking over}} his list of calls.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> 'two {{things in}} one {{are apt to}} be like Aubrey's {{compromise}} between walking-stick and camp-stool--a little of neither.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From India?' <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> 'Yes. Mr. Jack Maldon couldn't {{bear the}} climate, my dear. Mrs. Markleham--you have not {{forgotten}} Mrs. Markleham?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{certainly}} a very pretty deception," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> friends; carelessly, however, for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurer's show; [...] "pray how was it effected?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There they are, by yonder rocks," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son, {{pointing}} {{with his}} finger. [...] "We can all get good pictures, I think. Let us spread out a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait; I'll take a {{snapshot}} of hauling in the next fish," [...] <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> son, and he succeeded in getting a view that later on turned out exceedingly well.|$|R
