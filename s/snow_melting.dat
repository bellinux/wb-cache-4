5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|A <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> vehicle {{works by}} {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E
25|$|Before the eruption, {{a greater}} than normal amount of <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> had occurred, {{indicating}} the volcano was heating up. Earth tremors began at 8:48 pm {{on the evening}} of the eruption; the largest had a magnitude of 4. The eruption started weakly at 9:23 pm IMT ± 2min before increasing in power. The first pumice fell on Búrfell power station, 15km away, at 9:35 pm causing people to evacuate. The eruption seems to have started in 2 locations at the same time – to the Shoulder crater's south-southwest and below the Lava Crater. At 10:30 pm a crater at 780m was producing a lava column which reached an altitude of around 1000m. During the night a 700m high lava fountain was thrown up from the main crater. A 500m long fissure starting below the Lava Crater opened and lava fountains and other lava flows emanated from it. One hour into the eruption, a new 400m fissure opened to the northeast, producing two main lava fountains, and shortly after another adjoining fissure opened producing lava fountains to a height of 500m. At around midnight, another fissure opened northwest of the Lava Crater, later hurling an over 300m long lava fountain, 200–300m into the air. By midnight lava had already covered over 1km2 and this extended to 7.5km2 by next morning implying a flow rate of around 1500m3·s−1.|$|E
40|$|A <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> {{model is}} {{postulated}} to utilize rawinsonde observations of temperature, dewpoint, and wind speed as input variables. The model is developed around the snow surface energy balance, {{with the energy}} budget components structured to accommodate the upper air data. Some physical characteristics of the watershed are incorporated as parameters in the model. Rawinsonde data from Winslow, Arizona and stream flow data from a small watershed near Flagstaff were used to develop and test the model. The <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> runoff process was modeled by a linear regression equation using the computed <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> values as independent variables. Data from two <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> seasons were used to estimate the regression coefficients and to refine the parameters in the <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> model. Runoff was then predicted for two independent <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> seasons and compared with the observed runoff. An analysis of these independent seasons suggested that the energy balance components could be modified to more adequately utilize the rawinsonde data, and that variable solar radiation term should be included. The utility of the <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> model was not conclusively demonstrated by this study. The short <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> runoff seasons resulting in a limited data base and an over-simplified runoff model are possible reasons {{for the lack of}} verification...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for water in Arizona has caused man to evaluate possibilities for increasing surface runoff from high elevation snow accumulation areas. To date, a consistent method of predicting <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> in field situations, for runoff estimation, {{has not been}} developed. In an attempt to alleviate this demand for water, <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> indices based on median and maximum air temperatures were evaluated using Arizona ponderosa pine overstory crown closure as an inventory-prediction variable. Regression {{analysis was used to}} develop the prediction relationship, with degree day <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> factors as the dependent variables and percent crown closure as the independent variable. The median temperature prediction relationship was non-significant. The maximum temperature prediction relationship was significant, although it explained only 12 percent of the variation in degree day <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> factors. Validation of the maximum temperature relationship indicated it may not be adequate for <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> prediction in field situations. On the basis of this study, crown closure (as an inventory-Prediction variable) {{did not appear to be}} an adequate predictor of median or maximum temperature degree day <b>snow</b> <b>melt</b> factors in Arizona ponderosa pine...|$|R
25|$|Pirin {{forms the}} water {{divide between the}} basins of the rivers Struma and Mesta. The {{watershed}} follows the main ridge of the mountain in direction north-west to south-east. As the main ridge is situated closer to the Mesta valley, the tributaries to the Struma tend to be longer. The rivers are short, steep and with high water volume; the river bottom is rocky or covered with large sediments. The water discharge is highest in May and June and lowest in September. The streamflow is largely derived from <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> and glacial lakes in spring and summer and almost exclusively from groundwater in winter. The rivers and streams form numerous leaps and waterfalls but they are generally {{not as high as}} those in Rila or the Balkan Mountains. The highest one is Popinolashki waterfall, measuring some 12m. Pirin is the source of 10 tributaries to the Struma, including Pirinska Bistritsa, Sandanska Bistritsa, Melnishka reka and Vlahina reka, as well as another 10 to the Mesta, such as Iztok, Disilitsa and Retizhe. Reaching a length of 53km, Pirinska Bistritsa is the longest river in the massif. Pirin has abundant mineral springs, being among Bulgaria's richest areas. Based on the chemical composition they are divided into two thermal groups— in the Mesta and the Struma basins. The springs in the Mesta basin to the east are more alkaline, with lower mineralisation (below 400mg/l) and conductance; those on the western slopes reach higher temperatures, up to 86°C.|$|E

2500|$|This {{particular}} sod {{house had}} several unique features which has helped it to survive until this day, {{nearly a century}} after first construction. [...] The sod [...] chosen were from a dried up waterlogged area or a dried up slough so the grass roots were quite thick. [...] Sods are usually overlapped when made into walls, however, Addison made {{a hole in the}} center of each sod piece so that as the piece of sod dried it would tend to crumble in on itself, rather than outwards. [...] He also made each wall triangular, so that the width of the wall at the base was wider than the top. [...] The roofs which were the downfall of most sod houses was not typical on Addison's Sod house. [...] He departed from using sod for the roof, but made a wooden hip roof with wood shingles eliminating water damage from spring rains, and winter <b>snow</b> <b>melting.</b> [...] Addison also protected his sod walls from the elements, first by growing vines, then by covering the exterior with cedar shingles. [...] With the advent new technologies in home construction, the cedar shingles were replaced with asphalt, then with vinyl siding.|$|E

60|$|And now we {{were seated}} by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse, the same fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the {{beginning}} of this chapter. There we sat, with the <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> out of our hair and beards, and our faces all ablaze, what with the past inclemency and present warmth.

A family of the old Pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely such a fire as this, only, no doubt, a bigger one; and, contrasting it with my coal-grate, I felt so much the more that we had transported ourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that shackled us at breakfast-time.|$|E
60|$|A rather steep {{ascent of}} a mile, through a {{contracted}} {{part of the}} valley, led to another and smaller lake-bed, {{a quarter of a}} mile long and 100 yards broad, covered with patches of snow, and having no lateral valley opening into it: it faced the now stupendous masses of snow and ice which filled the upper part of the Yangma valley. This lake-bed (elevation, 15,186 feet) was strewed with enormous boulders; a rude stone hut stood near it, where we halted for a few minutes at 1 p.m., when the temperature was 42.2 degrees, while the dew-point was only 20.7 degrees.* [This indicates a very dry state of the air, the saturation-point being 0.133 degrees; whereas, at the same hour at Calcutta it was 0.559 degrees.] At the same time, the black bulb thermometer, fully exposed on the snow, rose 54 degrees above the air, and the photometer gave 10.572.

By a strange optical delusion the whole sea appeared to rise upon her in one overwhelming heave of its silky surface, where in one spot a smother of foam broke out ferociously. And then the effort subsided. It was all over, and the smooth swell ran on as before from the horizon in uninterrupted cadence of motion, passing under us with a slight friendly toss of our boat. Far away, where the brig had been, an angry white stain undulating on the surface of steely-gray waters, shot with gleams of green, diminished swiftly, without a hiss, like a patch of pure <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> in the sun. And the great stillness after this initiation into the sea's implacable hate seemed full of dread thoughts and shadows of disaster.|$|E

60|$|Spring {{was rapidly}} {{approaching}} now. Occasionally {{for a day}} or two southerly winds set in and rain fell in torrents, then again the Arctic currents prevailed, and everything was frozen as hard as before. Flocks of geese passed over, flying north, but returned again when the cold set in afresh. Small birds, too, in great numbers made their appearance, crowding on patches of ground that the sun and rain had cleared of snow, fluttering round the tents in flocks, picking up scraps of food that had been thrown out, and keeping the dogs in a state of perpetual excitement. The Ostjaks said that the break-up of the ice might come any day, or it might be delayed for another month; it depended less upon the weather here than on that higher up. It is not the sun or the rain that breaks up the ice, but the rise of the river from the <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> a thousand miles higher up, and all over the country drained by the rivers running into the Yenesei.|$|E

60|$|Insignificant as this stream is, the Jesuit Falconer, whose {{information}} is generally so very correct, figures it as a considerable river, rising {{at the foot}} of the Cordillera. With respect to its source, I do not doubt that this is the case; for the Gauchos assured me, that in the middle of the dry summer this stream, at the same time with the Colorado, has periodical floods, which can only originate in the <b>snow</b> <b>melting</b> on the Andes. It is extremely improbable that a stream so small as the Sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the continent; and indeed, if it were the residue of a large river, its waters, as in other ascertained cases, would be saline. During the winter we must look to the springs round the Sierra Ventana as the source of its pure and limpid stream. I suspect the plains of Patagonia, like those of Australia, are traversed by many watercourses, which only perform their proper parts at certain periods. Probably this is the case with the water which flows into the head of Port Desire, and likewise with the Rio Chupat, on the banks of which masses of highly cellular scoriae were found by the officers employed in the survey.|$|E
