The papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, brokered an agreement between the military orders, dividing the town between them. However, Bohemond remained hostile to the Hospitallers. After he confiscated their property in Antioch, Pelagius excommunicated him.|$|E

5|$|The monks of Glastonbury used {{to claim}} that during the sack of Canterbury by the Danes in 1012, Dunstan's body had been carried for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop William Warham, who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan's relics <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there.

Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|He {{resigned}} the vicarage of Maybole {{through a}} proxy (Patrick de Houston) at the papal court on 16 February 1398, in exchange with Gilbert Adounane {{for the church}} of Kirkcolm in Wigtownshire. Sweetheart Abbey, overlords of Kirkholm parish, dispossessed him briefly of this benefice, but Thomas obtained papal restitution in a papal mandate dated 13 October 1410. He got papal provision on 5 December 1412, to the politically important vicarage of Dundonald in Kyle, but this was unfruitful as the previous vicar turned out <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alive. Presumably in its place he obtained the vicarage of Abernyte in the diocese of Dunkeld on 30 January 1413, but despite promising annates, failed to obtain possession.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but none of them are known <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked.|$|E
5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{the islands}} possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean, which are only found here. A cleit is a stone storage hut or bothy; whilst many are <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There {{are known to be}} 1,260 cleitean on Hirta and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} works were complex, and many contractors {{were involved in}} delivering them. The CTRL Section 2 {{construction works}} had caused considerable disruption around the Kings Cross area of London; in their wake redevelopment was stimulated. The large redevelopment area includes the run-down areas of post-industrial and ex-railway land close to King's Cross and St Pancras, a conservation area with many listed buildings; this was promoted {{as one of the}} benefits for building the CTRL. It has been postulated that this development was actually suppressed by the construction project, and some affected districts were said <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a poor state in 2005.|$|E
5|$|There were {{initially}} no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained {{poor and the}} Redcliff complex was still in limbo as an agreement with Dow was <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system, but the Liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular, so {{they were not able}} to pressure Dunstan effectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite some progress, by 1914 the Citizen Forces {{were still}} incomplete, {{numbering}} approximately 45,915 men, with many units <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised. During the precautionary stage on 2 August 1914 {{prior to the}} outbreak of war, Citizen Forces units were called up to guard key infrastructure and essential points and man coastal forts and harbour defences. Militia fortress companies assisted the permanent artillery and engineers in manning defence electric lights at Port Jackson, Port Phillip, Fort Lytton, Fremantle and on the Derwent River. All coastal defence batteries were activated hours before the declaration of war against Germany (which took place at 9:00 am Melbourne time on 4 August). The next morning the first Allied shots of the war were fired by the garrison at Fort Nepean, which was located {{at the opening of}} Port Phillip Bay, after the examination battery there fired a shell over the bows of the German cargo ship SS Pfalz when the ship failed to stop. In accordance with pre-war plans mines were ready to be laid by the Royal Australian Engineers to protect Port Jackson and Port Phillip; however, the risk of attack was not considered sufficient to justify the establishment of the minefields and their ongoing maintenance.|$|E

5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{character}} of the buildings in the town derives from the use of local stone, much of it from the Town Quarry. Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was Hans Price (1835–1912). Many examples of his work are <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen: the Town Hall, the Mercury Office, the Constitutional Club (originally the Lodge of St Kew), villas and numerous other domestic dwellings. The Odeon Cinema by Thomas Cecil Howitt is notable for fully retaining many Art Deco features both internally and externally, and retaining its original theatre organ, a Compton from 1935. It {{is believed to be the}} only cinema organ in the West Country left working in its original location and is still in regular use. Other organs by Compton in Weston-super-Mare can be found at Victoria Methodist Church and All Saints' Church by George Bodley (modelled on that in Downside Abbey).|$|E

After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished– fans took home a significant proportion as souvenirs– to be replaced {{at the start of}} the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager– but the Main Stand has <b>still</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> modernised.
