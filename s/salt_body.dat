30|$|Since {{the region}} of the Mexican {{exploration}} campaign could contain geological structures and features that are typically challenging for seismic acquisition, such as <b>salt</b> <b>bodies,</b> there were important and pertinent concerns regarding the effectiveness of the new exploration model and the SFD method in unknown geological settings. The comparison studies concluded that the alternative exploration model employed was, indeed, effective in identifying hydrocarbon accumulation targets in different lithologies (carbonates, terrigenous sediments), different environments (onshore, offshore), varying water depths, different geological settings (different types of traps) and over/under/next to different structures (<b>salt</b> <b>bodies)</b> (Escalera et al. 2013).|$|R
50|$|The {{sources of}} salt glaciers are salt deposits. Over time sediments, rock and debris cover the deposit causing layers {{to build up}} over the salt. Due to its {{crystalline}} structure, salt remains at the same density while the sediment above begins to compress and become denser. The density contrast is the mechanism in which salt begins to rise. Diapirs rise and pierce the surface allowing the salt to flow because of gravity. Piercing the overburden is crucial for salt glaciers to form, and can occur in three ways. Active diapirism develops as the rising salt itself pushes and forces the overburden upward and sideways. Passive diapirism occurs when the salt always remains near the surface and the sediment builds up around it rather than over it. Reactive diapirism {{is the result of}} regional extension caused by rifting. The overburden becomes weak and thin which allows the <b>salt</b> <b>body</b> to travel upwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a {{common type of}} salt wall found in extensional regimes which possess the characteristics: cover strata truncated against both flanks; an asymmetric appearance in cross-section caused by normal fault-related growth patterns; {{and at least one}} unconformity and onlap surface separating strata which are tilted in opposite directions. This type of structure evolves by a process known as flip-flop salt tectonics starting with a roller where a normal fault detaches down one flank of the embryonic <b>salt</b> <b>body.</b> The structure grows as salt flows towards the low-stress zone below the crest of the footwall causing it to swell and tilt backwards until it becomes gravitationally unstable, until the cover strata on one or both sides welds out or until the salt emerges at surface. Further growth is then accommodated by switching to a new counter-dipping fault that detaches on the opposite flank of the <b>salt</b> <b>body</b> leading to a flip in hanging-wall/footwall polarity marked by an unconformity and onlap surface. The <b>salt</b> <b>body</b> con-tinues to grow beneath the new footwall, causing partial inversion of the old hanging wall. Additional switchesmay occur, leading to tall flip-flop structures until the source of salt is depleted. Salt structures have been described in detail {{from a wide variety of}} tectonic settings; however, many classic regions of salt walls and diapirs are located on passive margins. Passive margins, such as the South Atlantic margins of Brazil and west Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, are characterized by gravity-driven processes (e. g. Cobbold & Szatmar...|$|E

Here, we apply -wave processing algorithms developed for VTI media to a 2 -D synthetic data set generated by a finite difference code. The model, typical for the Gulf of Mexico, has a moderate structural complexity and includes a <b>salt</b> <b>body</b> and a dipping fault plane. Using the Alkhalifah-Tsvankin dip-moveout (DMO) inversion method, we estimate the anisotropic coefficient responsible for the dip dependence of -wave NMO velocity in VTI media. In combination with the normal-moveout (NMO) velocity from a horizontal reflector [, the argument “ 0 ” refers to reflector dip], is sufficient for performing all -wave time-processing steps, including NMO and DMO corrections, prestack and poststack time migration. The NMO (stacking) velocities needed to determine and are picked from conventional semblance velocity panels for reflections from subhorizontal interfaces, the dipping fault plane and the flank of the <b>salt</b> <b>body.</b> To mitigate the instability in the interval parameter estimation, the dependence o...|$|E

The area in the yellow frame uses the grid of dx[*]=[*] 160 ft and dz[*]=[*] 160 ft; it is the medium velocity zone, and the other area of the salt model uses the original scale of dx[*]=[*] 80 ft and dz[*]=[*] 80 ft. It needs to point that the big scale is an even multiple of small scales which is in accordance with the velocity model in this paper. In general, the relationship of the two velocities is an even number of times the scale of them is also an even multiple, if they are not an even multiple for each other, it can choose the minimum even which is bigger than real multiple. In this example, the velocity of the blue area is 14, 700  m/s, and the minimum velocity is 5000  m/s which is in the red area; the high velocity is almost three times low, so the four times is chosen for the big scale.
