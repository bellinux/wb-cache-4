At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell to blow up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{experienced}} some tax trouble with federal authorities, concerning the financial relationship {{between himself and}} his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company {{for the use of}} his trade secrets in the manufacture of the coffee, and a month later gave a four-fifths <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted.|$|E

25|$|The hegemon (ἡγεμών) of {{the court}} was {{responsible}} for the registration of the suits and complaints. After holding a preliminary investigation, he also had to subpoena the litigant parties and the witnesses before the jury. In the morning of the day of hearings, the hegemon had to determine by lot the jury that would judge the case as well as the place where it would convene. After the formation of the jury, the hegemon had to submit the conclusions of his preliminary investigation, announcing and defining the litigation on which the court should decide. Then it was the time for the plaintiff, the defendant and the witnesses to be heard. The arguments were exposed by the litigants themselves, without the legal support of a lawyer, {{in the form of an}} exchange of single speeches timed by water clock. In a public suit each litigant had three hours to speak, whereas they had much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at <b>stake).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way the judicial cases became a vehement fight of impressions, since the jurors did not constitute a little group of mature citizens, such as the Court of Areios Pagos, which was interested only in the correct application of the law. Additionally, before the Chambers of Heliaia each citizen had to become an effective orator and to act solely in his capacity as citizen, in order to protect his interests and to enforce his views.|$|E

500|$|Davis gained {{international}} attention after her refusal to issue marriage licenses {{and the ensuing}} controversy her actions caused. Many legal experts asserted that Davis had no standing under the law to refuse to issue the licenses. Columbia Law School professor Katherine Franke said, [...] "Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws, {{but they are not}} at <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage, so her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant." [...] Professor Stephen Vladeck of American University's Washington College of Law said that Davis [...] "waived any right to have an objection to issuing same-sex marriage licenses when she ran for the job". Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin and others compared Davis' refusal to follow orders of the U.S. Supreme Court to Alabama Governor George Wallace's futile [...] "Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" [...] protest of desegregation in 1963. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT civil rights group, said, [...] "Ms. Davis has the fundamental right to believe what she likes... but as a public servant, she does {{not have the right to}} pick and choose which laws she will follow or which services she will provide." [...] Attorney and author Roberta A. Kaplan, who argued for the plaintiffs in United States v. Windsor, wrote that [...] "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate, yet she swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. It is laughable that she can then decide which laws to enforce, which is why every decision in her case has gone against her." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{some time}} in the late 1950s, Kahane took on the persona of a Gentile individual, along with the {{pseudonym}} Michael King. At this point, Kahane began openly expressing anti-Communist positions. He and Joseph Churba created the July Fourth Movement, which was formed to counteract widespread opposition towards U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Subsequently, they co-authored the text, The Jewish Stake in Vietnam together, which was an attempt to convince American Jews of the [...] "evil of Communism". The book's introduction states that, [...] "all Americans have a <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> grim war against Communism.... it is vital that Jews realize the threat to their very survival [...]" [...] Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of para-militarism, and they permanently parted ways. Churba went on to pursue his own career, joining the US Air Force, writing many books on the Middle East, and later becoming one of Ronald Reagan's consultants. Kahane chose to fight for Jewish rights, and was willing to use extreme measures. He even attempted to acquire and grow biological weapons to use on a Soviet military installation, but failed. He began using the phrase [...] "Never Again", and conceived the Jewish Star and fist insignia, a symbol resembling that of the Black Panther Party, though Kahane himself opposed the Black Panther party due to anti-Jewish riots they had supported in Massachusetts and their leftist leanings, as he saw it.|$|E
2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part whether we like it or not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E
