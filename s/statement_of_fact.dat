25|$|Misrepresentation means a false <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> made by {{one party}} to another party {{and has the}} effect of {{inducing}} that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages {{depending on the type of}} misrepresentation.|$|E
25|$|A {{misrepresentation}} {{is a false}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> or {{law that}} is relied on by the other party in entering a contract. For example, in Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it was to stop risk to the beads. In fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained. But the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation.|$|E

500|$|The Royal Artillery Memorial {{has been}} the subject of much {{critical}} discussion since its inception. Upon its unveiling, several members of the RAWCF committee and others were displeased by the design and by the dead soldier in particular. Some felt that it was too graphic, or that it would be distressing to relatives and others who should have been consoled by the memorial, while a group of former artillerymen felt that any recumbent figure should be of a man just shot down so as to present a more heroic image. Charles ffoulkes, the inaugural curator of the Imperial War Museum was more impressed, describing the figure as [...] "a poignant and tremendous <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> which unconsciously makes the onlooker raise his hat".|$|E
500|$|These {{separate}} spheres lead Stace {{to reflect on}} both proofs for God and acosmism. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. [...] "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, {{is a direct result}} of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." [...] Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant. Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.|$|E
500|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of A Minor with a time {{signature}} in common time. Jackson's vocal range spans from G3 to C6. The track has a tempo of 114 beats per minute. [...] "Bad" [...] {{was viewed as a}} rived [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] progression. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented on the track's lyrical content while reviewing Bad, [...] "When Jackson declares that 'the whole world has to answer right now,' he is not boasting but making a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare." [...] Sigerson compared the track to material by James Brown, whose [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song. Lyrically, [...] "Bad" [...] pertains to proving to people that you are tough boasting, with Jackson asking [...] "who's bad?" [...] in a repeating lyric in the song's chorus.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gordon v Selico [...] it is {{possible}} to misrepresent either by words or conduct. Generally, statements of opinion or intention are not statements of fact in the context of misrepresentation. If one party claims specialist knowledge on the topic discussed, then it is more likely for the courts to hold a statement of opinion by that party as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{reporters at}} the meeting were not {{satisfied}} with this assessment and continued to press Cockcroft on the neutron issue. After being asked several times, he eventually stated that in his opinion, he was [...] "90 percent certain" [...] they were from fusion. This was unwise; a statement of opinion from a Nobel prize winner was taken as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> The next day, the Sunday newspapers were covered {{with the news that}} fusion had been achieved in ZETA, often with claims about how the UK was now far in the lead in fusion research. Cockcroft further hyped the results on television following the release, stating: [...] "To Britain this discovery is greater than the Russian Sputnik." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{called the}} last area, the purported {{effect of the}} {{questionnaire}} on relations between superiors and supervised, [...] "the defendant's most forceful argument." [...] He agreed it was important, but did not believe, as Connick did, that the mere act of distributing a questionnaire which asked, among other things, whether respondents trusted four named supervisors, was as prejudicial to discipline as a negative statement about those individuals would be. He cited a similar case where a college professor had alleged his contract was not renewed because of his role in disseminating a questionnaire. [...] " [...] not a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> but the presentation and solicitation of ideas and opinions" [...] and thus even more clearly protected.|$|E

2500|$|William of Tyre, {{who held}} Raymond in high regard, {{described}} {{him as a man}} with [...] "much foresight" [...] in both politics and warfare. Nevertheless, he also made some negative statements about Raymond. For instance, he described his escape from the battlefield at Marjayoun in 1179 as [...] "disgraceful". Although William of Tyre, who was made chancellor and archbishop during Raymond's first regency, cannot be regarded as a neutral observer, his chronicle strongly influenced the works of Steven Runciman, Marshall Baldwin and other 20th-century historians. Baldwin emphasized that William's words of Raymond's political and military talent should be regarded [...] "more a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> than an expression of opinion". Lewis refute Raymond's positive assessment, stating that his [...] "career reads as a veritable litany of inconsequential, misguided, or downright disastrous endeavours". Barber also emphasizes that Raymond's [...] "actions were usually driven by his own personal ambitions and needs".|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{opposition}} to the adverts. By 21 January 2009 the ASA had received 326 complaints about the bus adverts, including a complaint from Stephen Green of Christian Voice (UK) who said [...] "It is given as a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and that means it must be capable of substantiation {{if it is not}} to break the rules." [...] Hanne Stinson of the BHA has suggested that if the ASA rule on this complaint, then the ASA will be ruling on whether God exists. On 21 January the ASA ruled that the adverts were not in breach of its rules as the advert [...] "was an expression of the advertiser's opinion" [...] and was incapable of substantiation. They also claimed that although the advert was contrary to many people's beliefs, it would not generate [...] "serious or widespread offence". By the end of the year, the ASA had received 392 complaints about the adverts.|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{was also}} a {{sentiment}}alist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle, famously proclaiming that [...] "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". Some contemporary scholars view Hume's moral theory as a unique attempt to synthesize the modern sentimentalist moral tradition to which Hume belonged, with the virtue ethics tradition of ancient philosophy, with which Hume concurred in regarding traits of character, rather than acts or their consequences, as ultimately the proper objects of moral evaluation. Hume's moral theory maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena, and is usually taken to have first clearly expounded the is–ought problem, or {{the idea that a}} <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what ought to be done. Hume also influentially denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing that we experience only [...] a bundle of sensations, and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of causally-connected perceptions. Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom, and has proved extremely influential on subsequent moral philosophy.|$|E
