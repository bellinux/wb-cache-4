5|$|Anna Mary Robertson Moses (September 7, 1860 – December 13, 1961), {{known by}} her {{nickname}} Grandma Moses, was an American folk artist. She began painting in earnest {{at the age}} of 78 and is often cited as an example of an individual who successfully began a career in the arts at an advanced age. Her works have been shown and sold in the United States and abroad and have been marketed on greeting cards and other merchandise. Moses' paintings are displayed in the collections of many museums. The <b>Sugaring</b> Off was sold for US $1.2 million in 2006.|$|E

50|$|In {{consumer}} marketing, it {{is difficult}} to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and <b>sugar,</b> which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea-salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes and many more. <b>Sugar</b> also comes in many different types - cane <b>sugar,</b> beet <b>sugar,</b> raw <b>sugar,</b> white refined <b>sugar,</b> brown <b>sugar,</b> caster <b>sugar,</b> <b>sugar</b> lumps, icing <b>sugar</b> (also known as milled <b>sugar),</b> <b>sugar</b> syrup, invert <b>sugar</b> and a plethora of <b>sugar</b> substitutes including smart <b>sugar</b> which is essentially a blend of pure <b>sugar</b> and a <b>sugar</b> substitute. Each of these product types is designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. Invert <b>sugar</b> and <b>sugar</b> syrups, for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate and baked goods. <b>Sugars</b> marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments - refined <b>sugar</b> is primarily for use on the table, while caster <b>sugar</b> and icing <b>sugar</b> are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.|$|R

25|$|On 11 July 2012, <b>Sugaring</b> Season was {{announced}} on Beth Orton's official website as the followup album to Comfort of Strangers. It {{was released on}} ANTI-, her first through that label, on 1 October 2012, in the UK {{and the next day}} in the USA. Recorded in Portland, Oregon, USA, the album is produced by Tucker Martine and expanded on the purely acoustic sound of her previous record, with many of the songs written in the open guitar tunings Orton had learned from Bert Jansch in the years previous. The album was largely recorded live, with a band consisting of Brian Blade on drums, Sebastian Sternberg on bass, and Rob Burger on keyboards. Additional guitar work came from Marc Ribot and Ted Barnes, with backing vocals by Laura Veirs and Sam Amidon. <b>Sugaring</b> Season was widely received as a return to form, with many critics calling it her finest album to date.|$|E

500|$|Maple <b>sugaring</b> parties {{typically}} {{began to}} operate {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained [...] "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the <b>sugaring</b> season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.|$|E
