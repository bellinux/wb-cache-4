Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later {{surprised to learn that}} she was Sheila's daughter.

The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had [...] "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order [...] "to ensure the right of Juggalos everywhere to gather together and express their support of the I.C.P. without {{having to worry about}} being unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement". On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any [...] "criminal intelligence information" [...] about Juggalos destroyed. ICP announced in the edition of December 21, 2012 of the Hatchet Herald that they will be releasing a sideshow EP to The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013.

After the release date came and passed, The First Six was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked if {{we would be able to}} get the box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put House of Wax in the box set instead. The First Six was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.|$|E

While constructing the setting of the game, the development team referenced history books to learn about medieval customs and armor. The demons appearing in the game were chosen based on what bosses would be appearing in the scenario; they also included some demons that they thought would grab players' attention, and some based on their popularity. While Strange Journeys dungeon traversal had been designed to be [...] "old-school Megami Tensei", Shin Megami Tensei IV was designed to be similar to that of Nocturne.
