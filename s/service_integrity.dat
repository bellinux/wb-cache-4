2500|$|In 1998 and 1999, Chopra, {{along with}} two co-workers, Drs. Margaret Haydon and Gerard Lambert, testified to the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry that they were {{pressured}} by senior supervisors to approve multiple drugs of questionable safety, including Bovine Growth Hormone (rBST) and Baytril, which {{in the words of}} Chopra, [...] "is even more controversial. It's a critical antibiotic, one that produces cross-resistance against a critical antibiotic necessary for human use called ciprofloxacin. It's from the same class of drugs. When it is used in poultry, beef, turkeys, pigs, or whatever, then it causes cross-resistance in the intestines of those animals. Then those bacteria, like salmonella, campylobacter, or E. coli, get transferred to people and cause disease and death of immense order." [...] Prior to the mad cow disease crisis in Canada, Chopra warned the government that the current handling of feed to cows was inadequate. [...] Following this, Chopra, Haydon, Lambert and colleague Chris Bassude complained to the Public <b>Service</b> <b>Integrity</b> Officer (PSIO) office, a federal investigative body {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Treasury Board of Canada, indicating again that they were pressured by their seniors to pass a number of veterinary drugs, including Tylosin, Revalor H, Synergistin Injectable Suspension, Baytril, rBST, Carbodex and Eugenol, without proof of human safety. The PSIO case was initially dismissed in 2003, but the ruling was appealed to the Federal Court of Canada.|$|E
