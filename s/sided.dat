5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are other reports of certificates of division that were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court.

Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase <b>sided</b> with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood <b>sided</b> with the government. No response from the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E

5|$|The Bone {{military}} leader Petta Panggawae and his Songko' Borrong soldiers invaded Pangala' and <b>sided</b> with Pong Maramba', a minor lord.

Tiku, having <b>sided</b> with the Sidenreng leader Andi Guru, was able to retake {{the remains of the}} capital that night. The war ended in 1890, after Dutch scouts– representing the colonial government on Java– reached Bone. However, the remaining states soon began another series of struggles over the arms and slave trade, where states would exchange weapons for slaves; Tiku also participated in the trade.|$|E

5|$|After the king's {{death on}} June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona.

Kochiyo also patronized Takada school of Jōdo Shinshū, a fierce rival of the Hongan-ji school of which Rennyo was head.
