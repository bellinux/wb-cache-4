5|$|Cabbages are {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways for eating. They can be pickled, fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut, steamed, stewed, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw. Cabbage is a good <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{is a rich}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> K {{and vitamin}} A, and a {{moderate}} source of folate and iron. Contaminated lettuce is often a source of bacterial, viral and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including E. coli and Salmonella.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots {{are also a}} good <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E

5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> B.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver is a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken {{in large numbers}} in some areas, {{such as in the}} Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Many lemurs {{that eat}} leaves {{tend to do}} so during times of fruit scarcity, {{sometimes}} suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86native plant families and 15alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from Ficus (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> C, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity {{have been shown to}} be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.|$|E

25|$|While {{plants are}} {{generally}} a good <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> C, {{the amount in}} foods of plant origin depends on the precise variety of the plant, soil condition, climate where it grew, length of time since it was picked, storage conditions, and method of preparation.|$|E

The performance was evaluated for three cycles of 28 days each, egg quality was evaluated {{in the last four}} days of each cycle and bone strength {{on the last day of}} the experimental period. There was no interaction (p > 0. 05) between the different <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> D and calcium levels in all parameters evaluated. There was a quadratic effect (p 0. 05) in the egg weight and Haugh unit, but there was a linear increase (p < 0. 05) in the percentage and eggshell thickness, in specific gravity and bone strength. The different <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitamin</b> D influenced (p < 0. 05) the egg production rate, feed conversion, egg weight and Haugh unit. Thus, the results of this study suggest that the recommended calcium level for laying on second cycle is between 4. 09 % and 4. 14 % and that the metabolites cholecalciferol and 25 (OH) D 3 improved the performance and egg quality.
