5|$|The Second Republic was {{a source}} of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime {{minister}} of the Republic. The wealthier landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic {{because of the lack of}} any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94. Lerroux became foreign minister. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E

25|$|Social {{documentary}} photography or concerned photography {{may often}} {{be devoted to}} 'social groups' with socio-economic and cultural similarities, showing living or working conditions perceived as shameful, discriminatory, unjust or harmful.

25|$|Sánchez de Lozada pursued an {{aggressive}} {{economic and social}} reform agenda. The most dramatic change undertaken by the Sanchez de Lozada government was the capitalization program, under which investors acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises, such as the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) oil-corporation, telecommunications system, electric utilities, and others. The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> which instigated frequent social disturbances, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare coca-growing region, from 1994 through 1996.|$|E
25|$|The Hindu texts offer a {{conflicting}} view {{of whether}} access to guru and education {{was limited to}} men and to certain varna (castes). The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or on varna. The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state that knowledge is for everyone, and offer examples of women and people from all <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> who are guru and participated in vedic studies. The Upanishads assert that one's birth does not determine one's eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one's effort and sincerity matters.|$|E
25|$|However, {{few of the}} new administration's {{programs}} succeeded. Major {{difficulties with}} the stabilization and reform programs were caused {{in part by the}} superficial nature of many of the administration's actions and by its inability to secure political support. Moreover, the stabilization plan failed because of management errors coupled with defensive actions by <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> that would be most directly hurt by the plan. Confidence in the government was also eroded {{as a result of the}} liquidity freeze combined with an alienated industrial sector who had not been consulted in the plan.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} runs {{a number}} of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as youth in Guatemala do not fully participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and significant numbers of poor children do not attend school. Many middle and upper-class children go to private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala), and fourteen private ones (see List of universities in Guatemala). USAC was the first university in Guatemala {{and one of the}} first Universities of America.|$|E
25|$|In fact, the public-sector disequilibrium became {{virtually}} {{locked in}} {{as a result}} of the 1988 constitution, which created advantages for various <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> without indicating how these advantages would be paid for. Moreover, it transferred large portions of the tax revenues from the federal government to state and municipal governments, without requiring them to provide additional public services. With less revenue and more responsibility, the federal accounts experienced growing deficits. In addition, several subsidies were locked into the legislation. These factors and the financial burden of the public debt meant growing problems of public finance.|$|E
25|$|Batista {{adhered to}} the 1940 constitution's strictures {{preventing}} his re-election. Ramon Grau San Martin was {{the winner of the}} next election, in 1944. Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme Court. Carlos Prío Socarrás, a protégé of Grau, became president in 1948. The two terms of the Auténtico Party saw an influx of investment which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} the British took over {{governmental}} responsibilities of the Dutch East Indies, the European <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> was still strongly Eurasian in nature. Even most Dutch governor-generals had married into matriarchal Indo clans and the European <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> was in fact dominated by Indo culture. The polygot society he encountered spoke Malay, Portugis and other creole languages, as its first language and Dutch or other European languages only as a second or third language. The arts and crafts patronized by the Indo elite were usually indigenous e.g. gamelan, batik, various court dances, etc. Women's clothing was often indistinguishable from indigenous fancy dress and many practices were rooted in ancient indigenous court culture.|$|R
5000|$|Kahn has a {{reputation}} for advocating positions not taken by many others. She was the chief author and advocate of the 1975 Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act, one of the first laws enacted anywhere in the world banning the smoking of tobacco in public places. This law {{has been used as a}} template for virtually all later legislation to protect the public from [...] "secondhand smoke," [...] and was updated and expanded in 2005. In 1989, Kahn proposed reducing the voting age in Minnesota to 12.

25|$|Although he {{remained}} iconic to particular <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> particularly the elderly, Muldoon faded quickly {{as a force}} on the political scene. His biographer, Barry Gustafson, who described himself as not a Muldoon supporter, wrote that he still served as an active MP for his Tamaki electorate, dealing immediately with matters {{from all walks of}} life. He continued to write in international economic journals, arguing that the unemployment that had arisen {{as a result of the}} free market reforms was worse than the gains that were made, a view that came to be popular by the time of the Fifth Labour Government in 1999.|$|E
25|$|DPP {{planned to}} {{discontinue}} the current 18% pension interest rate for civil servants also backfired on the party. The pension reform plan {{had been put}} forward by the Chen administration {{as a way to}} stop a drain on the national treasury caused by paying a favored interest rate to long-term KMT officials who had worked relatively short stints in actual public government. Prominent beneficiaries of the high interest rate included KMT honor chairman Lien Chan and current Taichung mayor Jason Hu. The announcement of the reform plan cost the DPP a huge loss of support among civil service employees without the party winning offsetting increases in support from other <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|The famine {{led to a}} stark {{increase}} in crime, even among those not normally inclined to criminal activity, because people would resort to any means to feed themselves or their family. For the next several decades, after the famine, Europe took on a tougher and more violent edge; it became an even less amicable place than during the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. This could be seen across all <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> perhaps most strikingly in the way warfare was conducted in the fourteenth century during the Hundred Years' War, when chivalry ended, {{as opposed to the}} twelfth and the thirteenth centuries when nobles were more likely to die by accident in tournament games than on the field of battle.|$|E
