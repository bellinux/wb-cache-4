25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur. The <b>snow</b> <b>goose,</b> common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl {{that live in the}} region.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{in roughly}} 30 {{families}} have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most {{of these species}} are either insectivores (preferring hard-shelled prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the coefficient of friction between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird's ability to hold hard prey items. Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter-billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy flower corollas. In some cases, {{the color of a}} bird's tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The <b>snow</b> <b>goose,</b> for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar Ross's goose is pinkish-red, without darker tomia.|$|E

500|$|Singular: tomium. The {{cutting edges}} of the [...] and [...] mandibles. In most birds, these range from rounded to {{slightly}} sharp, but some species have evolved structural modifications {{that allow them to}} handle their typical food sources better. Granivorous (seed-eating) birds, for example, have ridges in their tomia, which help the bird to slice through a seed's outer hull.

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, <b>snow</b> <b>goose,</b> pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilsonâ€™s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the <b>snow</b> <b>goose,</b> the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed.

'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre.

40|$|Two closely-related, different-sized {{species of}} geese nest sympatrically {{south of the}} Queen Maud Gulf (QMG) in Canadaâ€™s central arctic. Following a period of high {{population}} growth rate in both species within the QMG, the population growth rate of larger-bodied lesser <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> (Chen caerulescens caerulescens; hereafter <b>snow</b> <b>geese)</b> has slowed most recently to roughly half that observed in smaller-bodied Rossâ€™s geese (Chen rossii). I focused on factors that influence productivity and recruitment in these two species, to improve our understanding of life history variation associated with interspecific differences in body size, and to test for density-dependent population responses. I used long-term data (1991 to 2008) to compare spring nutrient reserves, breeding strategies, clutch sizes, nest success, and juvenile survival in Rossâ€™s and <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> breeding at Karrak Lake, Nunavut; a large breeding colony located within the QMG. 	 Long-term patterns of spring body condition (i. e., fat and protein reserves) diverged in prospective breeding female Rossâ€™s and <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> implying that differences in food acquisition ability had become more acute. <b>Snow</b> <b>geese</b> displayed larger reductions in protein and fat reserves through time compared to Rossâ€™s geese thereby suggesting a differential density-dependent response {{in the ability to}} store nutrient reserves, a prerequisite for breeding in both species. Decreased per capita food availability influenced the timing of reproduction in both species. Nesting phenologies of Rossâ€™s and <b>snow</b> <b>geese,</b> adjusted for variation in phenology of local spring climate, have become later by 6. 5 and 5. 0 days, respectively, since 1991. Nutritional strategies (i. e., reliance on reserves versus local food) used for clutch formation differed between species. Rossâ€™s geese displayed greater reliance on stored reserves (i. e., capital breeding) than did <b>snow</b> <b>geese,</b> though both used endogenous reserves (> 62 % of yolk protein, > 48 % of albumen, and > 73 % of yolk lipid) for clutch formation. Rossâ€™s and <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> experienced declines of 28 % and 23 % in body masses from arrival to post-laying and also until hatch demonstrating that endogenous reserves are the main nutrient sources for incubation. Still, constraints of small size forced Rossâ€™s geese to use a mixture of local food plants and reserves for incubation metabolism. I then examined differences in clutch size, nest success, and juvenile survival to understand of the role of recruitment in the interspecific divergence of population trajectories. I did not find strong interspecific differences in clutch size and nest success. Overall, <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> had a larger mean clutch size, which was expected based on benefits of a larger-body size. Clutch sizes decreased with delays in breeding and decreasing protein reserves of arriving females, although Rossâ€™s geese displayed larger declines with decreasing protein reserves. Mean apparent nest success for Rossâ€™s geese was 4. 5 % higher compared to <b>snow</b> <b>geese.</b> Nest success showed large declines (11 %) in both species with increasing population size at the breeding colony. However, nest success of <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> decreased twice as fast with delays in breeding compared to Rossâ€™s geese. Last, I found no evidence of negative density dependence in juvenile survival over time. Juvenile survival was higher in <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> (48 %) compared to Rossâ€™s geese (38 %), consistent with a life history prediction based on body size differences. Despite lower juvenile survival, recruitment by Rossâ€™s geese is likely greater than that of <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> because of earlier sexual maturity, higher breeding probability and/or greater nest success. Ultimately, small body size of Rossâ€™s geese may produce an ideal life history schedule under resource limitation at this colony i. e., one that maximizes fitness compared to larger <b>snow</b> <b>geese.</b> Life history characteristics of Rossâ€™s geese (e. g., absolutely lower energy requirement, have a flexible breeding strategy, higher reproductive effort, an earlier age of sexual maturity, a shorter breeding cycle allowing delayed arrival and nest initiation on arctic breeding areas, and shorter time required by goslings to attain adult size), in addition to their smaller bill morphology may allow exploitation of a wider niche space (i. e., one that includes marginal quality and low quantity vegetation) relative to <b>snow</b> <b>geese.</b> Because there were no large differences in components of recruitment considered here, other components of recruitment (age of sexual maturity, breeding probability) may be affected more strongly by diminished spring nutrition in <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> and thus have a larger influence on local population dynamics...|$|R

25|$|For example, {{eutrophication}} initiates top-down control via {{the impact}} of <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> on the arctic marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997). By the 1980s, the <b>snow</b> <b>geese</b> that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in temperate wetlands to feeding in heavily fertilized agricultural fields. Over a period of 30 years, the <b>geese</b> population exploded. <b>Snow</b> <b>geese</b> have since utterly destroyed {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to oxygenate the soil the substrate became anoxic.

Because of the use of artificial fertilizers on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).|$|R
