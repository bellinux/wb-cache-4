30|$|In {{cases of}} <b>samples</b> <b>B</b> and C, {{both of the}} low surface energy and the high {{roughness}} enhance the hydrophobicity of surface. With the increase of density and length of ZnO nanorod arrays, the roughness of the nonwetting film surface increases evidently which results in the enhancement of hydrophobicity in <b>samples</b> <b>B</b> and C. However, the wettability of sample A is not consistent with this regulation. It is supposed that the lower crystalline degree and higher oxygen deficiency of short and sparse nanorods increase the surface energy of sample A, which exceeds the effect from surface roughness. Consequently, sample A turn to a hydrophilic surface.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{research}} {{looked at}} epigenetics of B. dorei {{and were able}} to demonstrate that 1 individual had B. dorei with GATC (gene) methylation while another individual had B. dorei lacking GATC methylation. Scientist took stool samples of two babies and sequenced the genomes of B. dorei in samples 105 and 439. <b>Sample</b> <b>B.</b> dorei 105 had 49,007 total methylation in the genome with 14,322 methylation sites and in <b>sample</b> <b>B.</b> dorei 439, there was 38,203 total methylations with 24,770 methylation sites. The key result is that sample 105 includes a key gene called DamMT (DNA methyltransferase) while sample 439 lacked this gene. In addition, out of 20,554 GATC sites in <b>sample</b> <b>B.</b> dorei 105, there was only had 3 sites that weren't methylated whereas <b>sample</b> <b>B.</b> dorei 439 had 18,908 GATC sites and none of the GATC sites were methylated. Dam methylation and methylation of GATC could be significant factors for microbial colonization and functionality in the gut system and affects numerous gene expressions of transport processes such as nutrient transportation, antibiotic effluxes actions to antibiotic resistance, and movement of energy. The results suggests that Dam and GATC methylation of B. dorei 105 could have highly significant varied gene expression from B. dorei 439 that lacks GATC methylation and could have an impact on functionality of B. dorei in the gut microbiome. Previous research has shown that Dam methylation mutants have increased susceptibility to higher antibiotic concentrations and lower minimum. This suggests that Dam methylation process plays a significant role in up-regulation of antibiotic effluxes, resulting in increased antibiotic resistance. Also, GATC methylation demonstrates important microbial functions such as DNA repair, replication, and LPS composition. Methylation of GATC motif by DamMT in pathogenic bacteria, for example,Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis has been shown to increase virulence and expression of genes towards multiple operations such as, mismatch repair and DNA replication enables pathogenic bacteria to combat against antibiotics. These results show why future research to create antibiotics that prevent the creation of DamMT in pathogenetic bacteria is needed.|$|E

30|$|The current {{stability}} of the samples was monitored continuously {{for a period of}} 4 h at a current density of 0.2 mA/cm− 2. The emission current remained fairly constant for samples A and C. The fluctuation in emission current for sample A was within 4 % and that of sample C was within 1 %. This indicates that there is an improvement in the field emission characteristics upon purification of MWNT. In the case of the other two <b>samples</b> (<b>B</b> and D), fluctuations were very high. Visual inspection of the samples after the current stability studies revealed that the morphology of the samples A and C remain intact and that of <b>samples</b> <b>B</b> and D got damaged. Also, the emission characteristics of samples A and C were exactly reproducible after the current stability studies, which reveal that the average number of active emission sites of the samples remains fairly constant throughout the study. The weak adhesion of CNTs to the substrate due to the absence of the graphitized layer is responsible for the damage of <b>samples</b> <b>B</b> and D. However, in order to bring out the exact dynamics behind the emission process further studies are required.|$|R

50|$|This states that, {{for each}} locus (L) (for which {{there must be}} at least two) the sum of the {{difference}} in number of observed polymorphic sites in sample A minus the estimate of expected polymorphism squared, all of which is divided by the variance. Similarly, this formula is then applied to <b>Sample</b> <b>B</b> (from another species) and then {{can be applied to the}} divergence between two sample species. The sum of these three variables is the test statistic (X2). If the polymorphism within species A, and B, and the divergence between them are all independent, then the test statistic should fall approximately onto a chi-squared distribution.|$|E
50|$|Listening {{tests are}} used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile {{magazines}} and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done {{in such a way}} that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgement. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which the researchers can see the components being tested, but not the listeners undergoing the experiments. In a double-blind experiment, neither the listeners nor the researchers know who belongs to the control group and the experimental group, or which type of audio component is being used for which listening sample. Only after all the data has been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which components or recordings were preferred by the listeners. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and <b>sample</b> <b>B,</b> an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent, a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} time, several {{experimental}} techniques to measure surface stress of materials had been proposed. One was determining surface stress by measuring curvature of a thin membrane {{of the material}} as it bends by gravitation through its own weight. This method {{turned out to be}} difficult since it requires a complete homogeneous single crystal surface. An alternative way to measure [...] surface stress is to measure the elastic extension of the length of the thin wire under an applied force. However, this method had many limitations itself and wasn’t used popularly. While determination of the absolute surface stress is still a challenge, the experimental technique to measure changes in the surface stress due to external interaction is well established using “cantilever bending method”. The principle of the measurement is shown in figure 2. In this case, stress of one surface is changed upon deposition of material which results the bending of the cantilever. The surface wants to expand creating a compressive stress. The radius of curvature R is measured as the change of the gap of a capacitor by [...] Figure 2b shows the two electrodes of the capacitor formed by the sample and a capacitor electrode c. The capacitor electrode is surrounded by a guard electrode in order to minimize the effects of stray capacitances. The <b>sample</b> <b>b</b> is clamped on one end in the sample holder a. The bending can also be measured with high sensitivity by deflection of the beam of a laser using a position sensitive detector. To use this method, it requires that the sample is thin enough. Some experiment measurement values are listed in table 5.|$|E

30|$|According to [13], the In/Al atomic intermixing is {{relatively}} small for this growth temperature, and the Al content in InAs QDs is below 15 %. As one can see from Figure 3, the behavior of LO phonons {{as a function of}} excitation energy in InAs QDs grown on (113)B-oriented GaAs surfaces (<b>sample</b> <b>B</b> 113) is similar to that observed for InAs QDs on (001) GaAs (<b>sample</b> <b>B</b> 001). However, the frequency position of the LO phonon in <b>sample</b> <b>B</b> 113 is regularly lower (on 2 to 5 cm− 1) than that for <b>sample</b> <b>B</b> 001. This indicates enhanced In/Al atomic intermixing that leads to increasing Al content in InAs QDs on (113)B GaAs (up to 20 %). Raman spectra of InAs QDs grown on (113)B-oriented GaAs measured in depolarized geometry reveal additional features near 230 cm− 1 attributed TO phonons localized in InAs QDs. These frequency positions of features remain unchanged due to negligible dispersion of TO phonons in InAs [11, 13].|$|E
