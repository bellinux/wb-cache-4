40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of a research project that had the objective to build a decision support system to categorise customer and <b>service</b> <b>advisor</b> (CSA) within customer contact centre (CCC) environment. We provide the methodology to develop a fuzzy expert system which assigns a new customer or advisor to the pre-defined categories. Categorising of customer and <b>service</b> <b>advisor</b> based on behavioural, demographic and experience variables, was one of the core objectives of the study. In the paper the process of building such a model which categorise customer and advisor through soft computing techniques is described. The behavioural aspects of customer and advisor are not an exhaustive list; but the authors own findings from the case studies at the contact centres. The reported findings and results are very promising, making the proposed model a useful tool in the decision making process, while some of the discussed problems and limitations are of interest to researchers who intend to use soft computing based approaches in other similar real life problems. The framework allows the managers within contact centres to understand the behavioural segments of customers and advisors (CSA) working at the centre and to provide information which would enable them to deliver better customer satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Customer service advisors {{can play}} {{different}} roles and have different level of autonomy, {{but at the}} end they are humans with heart and voice. While product purchases, lifestyle information and billing data provide important information about customers, it is call detail records that describe a customer’s behaviour and define their satisfaction with the services offered. Call detail records describe the transactions between customer and the company. This study looks on different techniques {{that can be used to}} model customer and CSA (customer <b>service</b> <b>advisor)</b> behaviour within a contact centre environment. A brief overview of the contact centre environment is discussed focusing on issues of customer and <b>service</b> <b>advisor</b> and the need to categorise customer and advisor within contact centre environment. The findings from the case study analysis within the current contact centres, provides the authors with understanding of different behaviour observed for customer and CSA’s within contact centres. The study also examines different human behaviour modelling techniques which the authors are interested in using to develop a model which can categorise the human with respect to demographic, experience and behavioural attributes within the context. Through the study it can be seen that soft computing techniques provide a major role in modelling of human behaviour and thus providing better results where this technique can be applied. The authors have also carried out a comparative analysis of all the techniques discussed within the paper and as seen from the analysis that soft computing techniques are widely used to model the user/human behaviour and thus can provide a platform for future research. Soft computing represents a significant paradigm shift in the aim of computing, a shift that reflects the fact that the human mind, unlike state of the art computers, possesses a remarkable ability to store and process information, which is pervasively imprecise, uncertain, and lacking in categori...|$|E
