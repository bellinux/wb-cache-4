50|$|A {{security}} agreement, {{in the law}} of the United States, is {{a contract}} that governs the relationship between the parties to a kind of financial transaction known as a <b>secured</b> <b>transaction.</b> In a <b>secured</b> <b>transaction,</b> the Grantor (typically a borrower but possibly a guarantor or surety) assigns, grants and pledges to the grantee (typically the lender) a security interest in personal property which {{is referred to as the}} collateral. Examples of typical collateral are shares of stock, livestock, and vehicles. A security agreement is not used to transfer any interest in real property (land/real estate), only personal property. The document used by lenders to obtain a lien on real property is a mortgage or deed of trust.|$|E

40|$|The thesis contemplates {{the need}} for Nigerian policy makers to {{undertake}} a reform of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law to meet international best standards, building upon earlier, unsuccessful, efforts by lawmakers, and drawing upon international benchmarks. It critically analyses the Registration of Security Interests in Movable Property by Banks and Other Financial Institutions in Nigeria (Regulation No. 1 2015) 'CBNR' published on 2 February 2015. The CBNR, with a primary aim of facilitating affordable credit, and to modernise <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law {{through the use of}} personal property as collateral, has departed from its previous position which it inherited from England. This thesis has drawn comparisons between the CBNR and prior reform initiatives particularly the Draft Law 2009 prepared by the Centre for the Economic Analysis of Law (CEAL). These reforms, which were not implemented, recommended wholesale changes to harmonise all existing <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law in Nigeria. The CBNR does not follow this approach, but instead, adopts a piecemeal approach to reform. Correspondingly, this forms the framework within which this study has been undertaken with reference to whether a piecemeal or wholesale reform is now required. This thesis has followed the International Finance Corporation (IFC) approach which focuses on a three-stage <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> reform strategy - modernisation of the existing legal framework; establishment of an electronic collateral registry; a concerted effort towards building capacity. With the assistance of international <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> legal frameworks such as the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on <b>Secured</b> <b>Transactions</b> 2007, and its Registry Guide 2014, the CBNR has been benchmarked against these adaptable legal frameworks for the purpose of harmonising <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law, in search of the international best practice which may be desirable for Nigeria. The thesis identifies and discusses at length several problems and inconsistencies associated with the CNBR, and the thesis makes suggestions for a wholesale reform of the Nigerian <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law. This thesis builds on existing knowledge on <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law reform with particular reference, and usefulness, to sub-Saharan African countries and other developing countries that wish to attempt a similar reform of this nature...|$|R
50|$|Generally, a <b>secured</b> <b>{{transaction}}</b> is a loan or {{a credit}} transaction {{in which the}} lender acquires a security interest in collateral owned by the borrower and is entitled to foreclose on or repossess the collateral {{in the event of}} the borrower's default. The terms of the relationship are governed by a contract, or security agreement. A common example would be a consumer who purchases a car on credit. If the consumer fails to make the payments on time, the lender will take the car and resell it, applying the proceeds of the sale toward the loan. Mortgages and deeds of trust are another example. In the United States, secured transactions in personal property (that is, anything other than real property) are governed by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.).|$|E

5000|$|Remnants of {{this common}} law {{doctrine}} exist {{today in the}} United States in the Uniform Commercial Code. Name changes can mislead searchers of official records of titles or liens. Article 9 of the UCC states that a financing statement shall not perfect a valid security interest if a name change would be [...] "seriously misleading.". A creditor may gain priority over other creditors {{in the event of}} a bankruptcy by filing a financing statement. The financing statement contains information relevant to the <b>secured</b> <b>transaction</b> and puts other creditors on notice that the filer has a secured interest in the property. Should the filer use a debtor name that is substantially different from the debtor's actual name, the purpose of filing the financing statement is defeated. On the other hand, if there is a minor difference in spelling or an idem sonans, the error is not fatal, but only if it is not seriously misleading. The actual search results may reveal a debtor with a similar name and address which would put the researcher on notice to investigate further, which is the purpose of the filing in the first place. The legal effect of an idem sonans is that the minor name difference shall have no bearing on the priority of debtors.|$|E

40|$|Although leases, consignments, {{and sales}} of {{accounts}} and chattel paper annually result in commercial transactions involving many billions of dollars, the Uniform Commercial Code, which establishes the legal framework for these transactions, provides only a few sentences of guidance for the practitioner or judge seeking {{to determine whether a}} transaction denominated as a lease, consignment, or sale of accounts or chattel paper is in fact a <b>secured</b> <b>transaction</b> subject to all provisions of article 9 of the Code. In this Article, Mr. Peter F. Coogan, a consultant to the Committee To Review Article 9, examines in detail the provisions of section 1 - 201 (37), which defines a security interest, and develops the history of this section. Concluding that the standards established by section 1 - 201 (37) are lacking in the precision and clarity needed to make the difficult decision of when a transaction is indeed a true lease as opposed to a disguised <b>secured</b> <b>transaction,</b> Mr. Coogan considers whether leases-like sales of account and chattel paper-should be subjected to {{some or all of the}} provisions of article 9 in order to make this determination. The author finds the application of these provisions to leases unsatisfactory; and he consequently turns to the standards of the Uniform Conditional Sales Act, the tax bar, and the accounting profession in an effort to establish useful standards in this area. Finally, Mr. Coogan recommends that, at a minimum, a more direct treatment of this problem should be incorporated into the Code, indicating that the standards and precedents of the UCSA provide the best guidelines for determining whether a transaction is a true lease or a <b>secured</b> <b>transaction...</b>|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the law applicable to <b>secured</b> <b>transactions.</b> It addresses {{in particular the}} codification of the choice-of-law rules for <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> (STCOL rules). These rules address the laws applicable to the creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of security interests (security rights) —a form of legislative or statutory dépeçage. It draws on the 2016 UNCITRAL Model Law on <b>Secured</b> <b>Transactions</b> (Model Law) as well as relevant North American law (Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 and the Canadian provincial Personal Property Security Acts). The STCOL rules {{lie at the heart}} of the emerged and emerging modern principles of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law (Modern Principles) for personal property (movable assets). These Modern Principles are reflected by the Model Law and North American law as well as by various other model laws, other <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> ‘reforms’ over recent years, and laws that are currently being considered by various States. While disagreements exist, debates continue, and strict harmonization is unlikely, there is little doubt that there has emerged a global consensus as to a set of general principles to which <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law should adhere. The STCOL rules and their relationship to substantive legal doctrine remain somewhat underdeveloped and undertheorized. This essay seeks to remedy this situation. It situates the STCOL rules as fundamental components of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and central to understanding the normative principles and factual assumptions underpinning that important body of law. Its principal contribution is to offer a framework for assessing the existing STCOL rules and for the codification of future rules. The framework is based on the interests of stakeholders that participate in or are affected by <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> and the Modern Principles. These stakeholders include third parties in general, assignors and assignees of security rights, third-party obligors on assigned assets (such as debtors on an assignor’s receivables), and the States that enact and whose interests are affected by STCOL rules. This framework also illuminates the factual bases for its application. But it can evaluated only through its application and analysis, which necessarily produces an assessment of STCOL rules and conclusions as to the appropriate rules. While the conclusions reached here may represent only a modest contribution to the literature, the more important offering is the framework for assessment itself—the identification of the questions to be asked and answered...|$|R

40|$|As {{international}} organizations adopt new legal standards to promote {{access to credit}} through the modernization of national <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law, the lack of coordination with regulatory standards for banking institutions thwarts {{the effectiveness of these}} efforts. In recognizing the relevance of the problem, UNCITRAL - {{for the first time since}} its establishment - is currently considering how to coordinate <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law reforms with the implementation of the Basel Accord. In a similar vein, the problem is currently approached by other international organisations. Although efforts at the national level to coordinate legal and regulatory standards are commendable, coordination between <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and capital requirements should be addressed at the highest level of the lawmaking process, i. e. when international soft-laws are defined. To advance this argument, the key functions of <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and capital requirements are isolated and a holistic understanding of the legal and regulatory rules governing the creation of credit is presented. The Article steers away from the idea that banks are mere intermediaries and offers a fresh understanding of the role of regulatory capital in controlling credit creation, through the management of risk. Within this context, the incentives created by <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and capital requirements are examined by comparing the capital charges for different credit protections, including credit derivatives and commercial loans to small business. First, it emerges that the implementation of new <b>secured</b> <b>transactions</b> law and the limited ability of security interests in personal property to reduce regulatory capital under the Basel Accords stimulate the creation of credit outside the banking system. Second, to control this phenomenon, the Article shows that it is essential to reconcile the incentive structures created by international legal and regulatory standards...|$|R
