5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book <b>Scott</b> <b>and</b> Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as The Last Place on Earth).

Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of <b>Scott,</b> <b>and</b> Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E
