25|$|Residents were {{suspicious}} of black fluid that flowed {{out of the}} Love Canal. For years, residents had complained about odors and substances on their yards or the public playgrounds. Finally the city acted and hired a consultant, Calspan Corporation, to do a massive study. In 1977, a harsh winter storm dumped 33-45 inches of snow, significantly raising the water table. The excess water got into the ground water and raised the elevation of the dioxins, which began erupting in residents' backyards. In the spring of 1977, the State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation launched an intensive air, soil, and groundwater <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> program following qualitative identification {{of a number of}} organic compounds in the basements of 11 homes adjacent to the Love Canal. It was also revealed that the standards at the time did not require the installation of a liner to prevent leaching; this became very common among companies.|$|E
2500|$|Most studies only {{sample part}} of a population, so results don't fully {{represent}} the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis</b> were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This {{does not imply that}} the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the frequentist perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a random variable. [...] Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed random variables. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics: this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by [...] "probability", that is as a Bayesian probability.|$|E
