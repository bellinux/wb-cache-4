50|$|The Humboldt penguin (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> (also termed Chilean penguin, Peruvian penguin, or patranca) is a South American penguin that breeds {{in coastal}} Chile and Peru. Its nearest {{relatives}} are the African penguin, the Magellanic penguin and the Galápagos penguin.

Today, listed as endangered, it is crucial to gain an understanding of gene flow and levels of genetic variation between breeding colonies to protect this species effectively. We developed seven microsatellite primers to investigate gene flow and population structure among four colonies.

Overall, this beak-opening occurred in 64 % of the immersions but, in all species, was associated with quick transitions between air and water, such as in porpoising or dives that were initiated rapidly. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this behavior: beak-opening may be a signal that initiates bradycardia, such as is observed in unrestrained diving animals or beak-opening may be associated with chemoreception to help detect potential prey or predators...|$|R

40|$|Although {{they can}} provide {{valuable}} information on at-sea ecology, data-loggers may adversely affect energetics, diving performance, and breeding success of equipped birds. With the aim of determining the effects of leg-attached data-loggers on the activity budgets of Humboldt penguins (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> while on land, we equipped birds kept at the Landau Zoo, Landau, Germany, with such devices. We followed them during sample periods and recorded the occurrence and length of behaviors. Birds quickly habituated to the devices within 1 day of deployment, and mean rates of device-pecking were low (0. 7 – 1. 7 pecks/hr), with device-induced behaviors accounting for < 1 % of the mean daily activity budget. The method of device attachment appears behaviorally less stressful than the traditional tape-based system in which devices are normally attached to the penguin's back. By facilitating the testing of newly developed data-loggers on captive birds, or the development of methods for device attachment, zoos and aquaria may strengthen their role in animal conservation by helping research on free-ranging animals...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} 185 metabolites in 30 adult Humboldt Penguins (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> nesting at the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area, Peru, {{in order}} to examine gender differences in metabolome profiles, particularly those involved in metabolism and energetics. The majority of the compounds identified were fatty (26 % of total identified compounds), organic (19 %), and amino (16 %) acids. We were able to differentiate male and female penguins with 96. 6 % accuracy on the basis of 12 metabolites, most of which are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These included 2 -oxoglutarate, erythronic acid, GABA, mannitol, sedoheptulose 7 -phosphate, and serine and six metabolites present in higher concentrations in females compared to males (2 -aminoadipic acid, O-phosphorylethanolamine, glycerol 2 -phosphate, glycerol 3 -phosphate, pantothenic acid, and creatinine). Of these, 2 -oxoglutarate and glycerol 3 -phosphate were key metabolites distinguishing gender. Our results indicated that male and female Humboldt Penguins were characterized by differing metabolic states.

40|$|We {{examined}} the thermoregulatory behaviour (TRB) of roosting Humboldt penguins (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> in north central Chile during summer and winter, when ambient temperatures (Ta) are most extreme. Each body posture {{was considered to}} represent a particular TRB, which was ranked in a sequence that reflected different degrees of thermal load and was assigned an arbitrary thermoregulatory score. During summer, birds exhibited eight different TRBs, mainly oriented to heat dissipation, and experienced {{a wide range of}} Ta (from 14 to 31 °C), occasionally above their thermoneutral zone (TNZ, from 2 to 30 °C), this being evident by observations of extreme thermoregulatory responses such as panting. In winter, birds exhibited only three TRBs, mainly oriented to heat retention, and experienced a smaller range of Ta (from 11 to 18 °C), always within the TNZ, even at night. The components of behavioural responses increased directly with the heat load which explains the broader behavioural repertoire observed in summer. Since penguins are primarily adapted in morphology and physiology to cope with low water temperatures, our results suggest that behavioural thermoregulation may be important in the maintenance of the thermal balance in Humboldt penguins while on land...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{is one of the}} most polymorphic regions of the genome, likely due to balancing selection acting to maintain alleles over time. Lack of MHC variability has been attributed to factors such as genetic drift in small populations and relaxed selection pressure. The Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), endemic to the Galápagos Islands, is the only penguin that occurs on the equator. It relies upon cold, nutrient-rich upwellings and experiences severe population declines when ocean temperatures rise during El Niño events. These bottlenecks, occurring in an already small population, have likely resulted in reduced genetic diversity in this species. In this study, we used MHC class II exon 2 sequence data from a DRB 1 -like gene to characterize the amount of genetic variation at the MHC in 30 Galápagos penguins, as well as one Magellanic penguin (S. magellanicus) and two king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and compared it to that in five other penguin species for which published data exist. We found that the Galápagos penguin had the lowest MHC diversity (as measured by number of polymorphic sites and average divergence among alleles) of the eight penguin species studied. A phylogenetic analysis showed that Galápagos penguin MHC sequences are most closely related to Humboldt penguin (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> sequences, its putative sister species based on other loci. An excess of non-synonymous mutations and a pattern of trans-specific evolution in the neighbor-joining tree suggest that selection is acting on the penguin MHC...|$|R
40|$|Humboldt {{penguins}} (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> are top predators {{endemic to}} the area influenced by the cold, nutrient-rich Humboldt current {{on the west coast}} of South America. Their breeding colonies span the range between 5 and 42 °S (Williams, 1995). Because of low population numbers (recent estimates indicate a world population of only approximately 13 000 birds), the species is considered to be vulnerable to endangered (Ellis et al., 1998; Bonn Convention on Migratory Species). One of the factors that severely affects the Humboldt penguin population is the recurring El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Breeding populations are reduced by 65 – 72 % during ENSO years (Hays, 1986), when upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold bottom water in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean is depressed. The ENSO is the most important coupled ocean atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on an interannual time scale. The 1997 / 98 ENSO {{was one of the most}} intensive phenomena of this kind since the 1950 s, and its anomalies reached a level only paralleled by the 1982 / 83 ENSO (Wolter and Timlin, 1998). The multivariate ENSO index (MEI), which is based on the six main observed variables over the tropical Pacific (sea-level pressure, zonal and meridional components of surface wind, sea surface temperature, surface air temperature and total cloudiness fraction of the sky), reached peak values of nearly + 2. 9 in July/August 1997 and again in February/March 1998. These values have been surpassed during the last 50 years only i...|$|R
40|$|Humboldt Penguins (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> {{show little}} sexual dimorphism, and {{although}} males are usually heavier and larger than females, sexing by direct observation may be difficult, especially in young subjects. In this paper we evaluate {{the utility of}} the molecular approach, for sexing impuberal Humboldt Penguins from feathers. Firstly, a PCR test was used employing primers that amplify the homologous region of the CHD-W gene, unique in female, and the CHD-Z gene, occurring in the two sexes. The analysis of the PCR products showed a band of 370 bp in males and two bands of 370 and 380 bp in females. Additionally, to confirm these results, the PCR products were digested with HaeIII and Asp 700 for RFLP analysis. Male PCR products showed two bands (310 and 60 bp) after digestion with HaeIII, and a unique band (370 bp) using Asp 700, while all fragments obtained from females resolved into three bands using both HaeIII (380, 310 and 60 bp) and Asp 700 (370, 270 and 110 bp), confirming the previous PCR sex determination. Results from these two different DNA-based tests were in accordance, in all cases, with sexes checked by preliminary cloacoscopy. Thus, {{it was found that the}} PCR method from feather samples alone is sufficient, reliable and without any risks for a rapid sexing in Humboldt Penguin. This non-invasive sexing technique can be useful at any age to verify the sex ratio in field populations and for gender identification in ex situ conservation programs...|$|R
40|$|Multi-zoo {{comparisons}} of animal welfare are rare, and yet vital for ensuring continued improvement of zoo enclosures and husbandry. Methods are not standardised {{for the development}} of zoo enclosures based on multiple indicators, and case study species are required. This study compares behavior and breeding success to various enclosure and husbandry parameters for the Humboldt penguin, <b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti,</b> {{for the development of}} improved enclosure design. Behavioral sampling was completed at Flamingo Land over a period of eight months. Further data on behavior, enclosure design and breeding success were collected via questionnaires, visits to zoos, and literature review. Breeding success was primarily influenced by colony age and number of breeding pairs, suggesting an important social influence on reproduction. Across zoos, there was also significant variation in behavior. The proportion of time spent in water varied between zoos (2 - 23 %) and was used as an indicator of physical activity and natural behavior. Regression models revealed that water-use was best predicted by total enclosure area per penguin, followed by land area, with some evidence for positive influence of pool surface area per penguin. Predominantly linear/curvilinear increases in our biological indicators with enclosure parameters suggest that optimal conditions for S. humboldti were not met among the selected zoos. We propose revised minimum conditions for S. humboldti enclosure design, which exceed those in the existing husbandry guidelines. We present a framework for the evaluation of zoo enclosures and suggest that a rigorous scientific protocol be established for the design of new enclosures, based on multivariate methods...|$|R

En el año 1996 los ítems primarios fueron: Teuthida, E. ringens, N. crockery y O. regia. Se observaron ligeras diferencias en la dieta de S. humboldti interestacional. Los valores de Shannon-Wiener dan un rango entre 0, 07 a 0, 47, y el índice de amplitud de nicho de Levin fue de 0, 04 a 0, 13, por lo tanto, se trata de un depredador especialista. El traslapamiento de la dieta mediante el índice de Bray-Curtis indica que a nivel interestacional por años la diferencia fue de 0, 20 Existieron diferencias en la dieta de S. humboldti en relación a los eventos oceanográficos, observándose una diferencia entre 1992 (evento de El Niño), 1996 (evento influenciado por La Niña) y 1993 (año influenciado por El Niño). This work aimed at characterizing the diet of the <b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti</b> from around Punta San Juan, Punta Caballa and Sombrerillo (Ica, Peru) in 1992, 1993 and 1996. Three hundred seventy-eight stomachs from the incidental catch of Seriorella violacea in subsistence fishing operations using gillnets. The diet of the S. humboldti comprised 27 species. Per the numerical food coefficient, the primary items were the following: Teuthida, Isacia conceptionis, Cheilodactylus variegatus, Sciaena deliciosa, Seriolella violacea, Stromateus stellatus, Eugraulis ringens, Opistonema liberate, Normanichthys crockery, Odonthestes regia, Myctophum nitidulum, Merluccius gayi and Leuroglossus stilbius. The S. humboldti is considered a specialist species with dietary breadth. Differences were noted in the diet of the S. humboldti interanual, since, in 1992, the primary prey items were the following: Teuthida, C. variegatus, E. ringens, O. liberate, N. crockery, O. regia, M. nitidulum and M. gayi. In 1993, the primary prey items were Teuthida, I. conceptionis, C. variegatus, S. stellatus, E. ringens, N. crockery, O. regia, M. gayi and L. stilbius. In 1996, the primary prey items were Teuthida, E. ringens, N. crockery and O. regia. Slight differences were noted in the interseasonal diet of the S. humboldti. The Shannon-Wiener index values result in a range between 0, 07 and 0, 47, and Levin’s niche breadth ratio resulted in 0, 04 to 0, 13. Therefore, it is a specialized predator. The overlap in the diet, determined through the Bray-Curtis ratio, indicates that, seasonally and by year, the difference was 0, 20. There were differences in the diet of the S. humboldti regarding oceanographic events. A difference was observed between 1992 (El Niño event), 1996 (event influenced by La Niña) and 1993 (a year influenced by El Niño) ...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) have been designated to protect marine resources, including top predators such as seabirds. There is no conclusive information on whether {{protected areas}} can improve population trends of seabirds when these are further exploited as tourist attractions, {{an activity that}} has increased in past decades. Humboldt Penguins (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> and Magellanic Penguins (S. magellanicus) breed sympatrically on Puñihuil Islets, two small coastal islands off {{the west coast of}} Chiloé Island (41 ° S) in southern Chile that are subject to exploitation for tourism. Our goal was to compare the population size of the mixed colony of Humboldt and Magellanic Penguins before and after protection from unregulated tourism and freely roaming goats in 1997. For this purpose, two censuses were conducted in 2004 and 2008, and the numbers compared with those obtained in 1997 by other authors. The proportion of occupied, unoccupied, and collapsed/flooded burrows changed between years; there were 68 % and 34 % fewer collapsed burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. For the total number of burrows of both species, we counted 48 % and 63 % more burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. We counted 13 % more burrows of Humboldt Penguins in 2008 than in 1997, and for Magellanic Penguins, we estimated a 64 % increase in burrows in 2008. Presumably, this was as a result of habitat improvement attributable to the exclusion of tourists and the removal of goats from the islets. Although tourist visits to the islets are prohibited, tourism activities around the colonies are prevalent and need {{to be taken into account}} to promote appropriate management...|$|R
40|$|Between 1999 and 2003 we {{collected}} {{information on the}} breeding distribution and abundance of 12 seabird species occurring on nine islands off the coasts of north and central Chile (27 °- 33 °S). The Peruvian booby Sula variegata was the most abundant seabird with a breeding population of ca. 18, 000 pairs concentrated in two islands, followed by the Humboldt penguin <b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti</b> with ca. 9, 000 pairs, the largest colony being at Chañaral Island with ca. 7, 000 pairs. Kelp gulls Larus dominicanus bred at all the surveyed sites in colonies of variable size, ranging from 40 to 2, 000 pairs. Peruvian diving-petrels Pelecanoides garnotii and Peruvian pelicans Pelecanus occidentalis bred at restricted sites, but generally in large colonies. Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, wedge-rumped storm-petrels Oceanodroma tethys, Neotropical cormorants Hypoleucos brasiliensis, guanay cormorants Leucocarbo bougainvillii, red-legged cormorants Stictocarbo gairmardi, band-tailed gulls Larus belcheri and Inca terns Larosterna inca nested at few sites forming small colonies (from a few to 150 pairs). Two new breeding sites are reported for the Peruvian diving-petrel and nesting of the wedge-rumped storm-petrel is confirmed on the Chilean coast for the first time. Despite protective status, most of the islands showed human disturbance, derived mainly from guano harvesting, egging and tourism. On at least five of these islands {{we were able to}} confirm introduced mammals including rats, rabbits and cats. These factors are likely to be detrimental to seabirds and thus demand detailed assessment.

40|$|Humboldt {{penguins}} <b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti</b> {{in captivity}} and free-living Magellanic penguins S. magellanicus were fitted with loggers to determine beak angles during breathing. The Humboldt penguins were also fitted with masks for determining rates of air flow during breathing. During periods of higher gas exchange requirement, Humboldt penguins opened their beaks during inspiration, where tidal volume was linearly correlated with both change in beak angle and maximum beak angle, closed them slightly {{during the final}} stages of inspiration and finally closed them during expiration. Substantial differences were apparent between individuals. Contrary to the condition proposed for most birds, our data suggest that expiration is passive during periods of high respiratory tidal volumes, and that the increased resistance of the respiratory pathway serves to slow air flow so as to maximize gas exchange in the lungs. During foraging, Magellanic penguins at the surface between dives showed similar breathing patterns but maximum beak angles were much higher and breath cycle time shorter, as would be expected for animals attempting to maximize gas exchange. Both maximum beak angle per breath and breath frequency changed systematically over the surface pause; both were initially high, then decreased to a low before rising again to a maximum just before diving. Based on known changes in tidal volume with beak angle derived from Humboldt penguins, a simple model is proposed to examine rates of gas exchange over the surface pause. This indicates that the observed patterns do not maximize the rate of transfer of oxygen over the whole of the surface pause but are rather concerned with an initial rapid accumulation of oxygen in the tissues followed by effective carbon dioxide release.

40|$|AbstractTen Humboldt (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti)</b> {{and eight}} Magellanic Penguins (S. magellanicus) were {{successfully}} equipped with satellite transmitters in March 2009 on Islotes Puñihuil in central south-Chile {{to follow their}} post-moult dispersal. Overall, Humboldt Penguins could be followed for a mean period of 49 ± 18 days (range: 25 – 93) and Magellanic Penguins for 57 ± 12 days (range 35 – 68). Irrespective of species and sex, seven study birds remained {{in the vicinity of}} their breeding ground throughout the transmission period. All other penguins moved northwards, either only a relatively short distance (max 400 km) to Isla Mocha at 38 °S (n= 3) or further north beyond 35 °S (n= 8). However, eight of these birds (73 %) turned south again {{towards the end of the}} individual tracking periods. The total area used by both species during the tracking period was restricted to a coastal area stretching from the breeding site at 42 °S about 1000 km to the north at about 32 °S. The area used by Humboldt penguins overlapped by 95 % the area used by Magellanic penguins, whereas the area used by the latter species was much larger and overlapped only by 45 % with the area used by Humboldt penguins. Overall, our results indicate that Magellanic Penguins in the Pacific Ocean are probably less migratory than their conspecifics on the Atlantic side, while Humboldt Penguins appear to be more migratory than previously anticipated. In general, there was a poor relationship between preferred foraging areas and chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for primary productivity, indicating the limitations of using remote-sensed primary productivity as a proxy to interpret the foraging behaviour of marine predators. In addition, there was also no clear relationship between the preferred foraging areas and the amount of regional fish catches by artisanal fishery...|$|R

40|$|The Scottish National Zoological Park at Edinburgh {{has been}} notably {{successful}} in keeping and breeding penguins. It is happy in possessing {{as a friend}} and benefactor, Mr Theodore E. Salvesen, head of the firm of Christian Salvesen & Co., Leith, to whose interest and generosity it owes the great number of penguins it has possessed. Of the seventeen known species of penguins, seven are represented in the Park, the king (Aptenodytes patagonica Miller), gentu (Pygoscelis papua Forster), ringed (Pygoscelis antarctica Forster), macaroni (Catarrhactes chrysolophus Brandt), Magellan (Spheniscus magellanicus Forster), Peruvian (<b>Spheniscus</b> <b>humboldti</b> Meyen) and black-footed (Spheniscus demersus L.). The collection has risen as high in number as 180 individuals, but at present numbers only about 70. The first penguins received in the Park were three king penguins which arrived from South Georgia in January 1914. One of these three was fully adult and was therefore not {{less than two years}} old at the time of its arrival. I am happy to say that it is still alive. It is a female and was the mother of the first chick hatched in the Park. The other two which came at that time were in the brown nestling plumage and were probably, therefore, just about a year old when they arrived. One of these young ones, a male, was, after it had moulted, much courted by the adult, but in spite of the attention paid to it by the adult female in the years 1915, 1916 and 1917, it showed little inclination to respond and was, I concluded, not sexually mature at that time. In 1918 the female laid an egg which was not fertile. On the 1 st of September 1919 another egg was laid. This egg was incubated by the parents, both birds taking turns with the egg though the greater part of the work of incubation seemed to fall upon the male. The king penguin makes no nest, but holds its single egg on the feet and covers it with the skin and feathers of the lower part of the abdomen. There is nothing in the way of a pouch for brooding the egg and the egg is held between the two feet placed close together and the lower part of the body. The penguin is able to move about in an awkward shuffling manner with the egg held on its feet, and so firmly can it be held that the bird can even climb a rock, or fall from a rock, without losing its grip of the egg. On the 26 th of October the egg was found to be chipped, and on the second day after that the young penguin emerged. The king penguin chick, when newly hatched, shows traces, especially on the head, of a natal coat of white down-like feathers. This disappears within two or three days and the growth begins of a brown nestling coat. This seems to suggest that the king penguin chicks were at one time clothed in a white nestling coat like that of the emperor penguin, but that either a movement to more northerly breeding grounds, or a change to a less glacial climate of the established breeding ground, induced a corresponding change in the colour of the nestling coat. The chick is, like the young of all penguins, fed on pre-digested fish which it takes from the throat of the parent bird. It has been noted that for a day or two before the egg hatches the adult bird is disinclined to feed, perhaps so that there may be a supply of fully digested food available for the very small chick when it first appears. The parent birds soon, however, begin to feed more greedily again. The food regurgitated is at first quite liquid, but in a few days quite large pieces of fish are brought back. The chick has a warbling flute-like call which it utters when it wishes to feed. The growth of the chick is fairly rapid, though not so rapid as in the case of the smaller penguins. By the time the chick was eight weeks old it had attained so large a size and was making such demands upon the parents for food that they seemed to be growing weak, so the experiment was made of giving the chick its own allowance of fish, small herring and whiting being used for the purpose. The chick took very readily to the change and was soon taking its 14 to 20 herrings a day. This enabled the parent birds to recover condition, but one wonders how wild king penguins manage to endure the strain of finding sufficient food, not only for themselves but for the chick, as they must do, until it is about a year old. In due course this chick was reared and it went into its first moult in April 1920, about six months after it was hatched. In the following year, 1920, two pairs of king penguins laid eggs but neither egg hatched. The same thing happened the next year. More adults had been received from South Georgia and in 1922 three eggs were laid and two hatched, but each of the chicks died when it was just three days old. The year 1923 brought a similar experience. I was puzzled to understand why these chicks died so quickly and I reviewed the circumstances and compared them with those attending the hatching and rearing of the first chick. I could perceive no difference in conditions or treatment except one, that while the first successful egg had been laid and incubated in the late autumn, when the weather was bleak and wet, subsequent eggs had been laid in June and the chicks hatched in August when the weather was hot and dry. In order to compensate for this difference I arranged, in 1924, a fine spray in the penguins’ enclosure which kept a portion of rock always wet. When the first egg was laid in June 1924, this spray was turned on and the incubating birds kept pretty much within its range. A second egg also was laid in 1924 and both these eggs hatched and the chicks were reared. I concluded, therefore, that the spray had solved the problem and since then I have a spray in each of the penguin enclosures and keep the spray going whenever the weather is hot. One of the 1924 chicks is still alive although the other, and that of 1919, are both dead. Meantime, in 1925, the male of the original pair had died and there was no fertile egg in 1926, but in the years 1927 to 1932 inclusive, a chick was hatched each year and several of them, but not all were reared. In 1932, a consignment of 16 adult penguins was received from South Georgia and these I have kept in a separate enclosure so that they form a second colony. They also have bred successfully and in all twenty two king penguin chicks have been hatched and reared in the Park. Four of them are being reared at the present time. As many as nine king penguins were incubating eggs at one time in the Park last August, but only four of the eggs hatched. So much for the king penguins...|$|R
