5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. These {{may be of}} the same <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> in sexual selection, or of different <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa {{grows on}} flat or gently sloping ground on deep white or grey sand. It {{is often the}} {{dominant}} shrub in shrubland, commonly found with such <b>species</b> <b>as</b> Lambertia inermis, Banksia pulchella, and B. petiolaris.|$|E
5|$|Each {{hartebeest}} subspecies {{is listed}} {{under a different}} conservation status by the IUCN. The <b>species</b> <b>as</b> a whole is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "typical", early-discovered Vibrio <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> V. cholerae, have {{a single}} polar {{flagellum}} (monotrichous) with sheath. Some <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus, have both a single polar flagellum with sheath and thin flagella projecting in all directions (peritrichous), and the other <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> V. fischeri, have tufts of polar flagella with sheath (lophotrichous).|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{probably}} feed on Apocynaceae <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> Rauvolfia ligustrina, Rauvolfia tetraphylla, Stemmadenia obovata, Philibertia, Cynanchum, {{as well as}} Asclepiadaceae and Caricaceae <b>species</b> (such <b>as</b> Carica papaya).|$|R
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{species that}} have been {{identified}} as having lived in Lake Cahuilla include Cyprinodon macularius, Elops affinis, Gila elegans, Gila cypha, Gila robusta, Mugil cephalus, Ptychocheilus lucius, and Xyrauchen texanus. Lake Cahuilla featured similar fish <b>species</b> <b>as</b> the lower Colorado River.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's IUCN Red List of Endangered Species named 64 species, {{one-third of}} all oceanic shark <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> being at risk of {{extinction}} due to fishing and shark finning.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{is dominated}} by grassland vegetation with <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> huisache, mesquite, nopal, linaloe and shrubland. Typical fauna includes <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> deer, rabbit, hare, squirrel, foxes and badger.|$|R
25|$|In some Muridae the hallux is clawless {{and fully}} opposable, {{including}} arboreal <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> Hapalomys, Chiropodomys, Vandeleuria, and Chiromyscus; and saltatorial, bipedal <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> Notomys and possibly some Gerbillinae.|$|R
50|$|Different {{bioactive}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from Lactarius <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> sesquiterpenoids, aromatic volatiles, and mutagenic substances. Pigments have been isolated from colored Lactarius <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> L. deliciosus or L. indigo.|$|R
5|$|In the United Kingdom, at {{the extreme}} edge of the fieldfare's {{breeding}} range, {{only a handful of}} pairs breed. It is therefore classified by the RSPB as a Red List <b>species</b> <b>as</b> of January 2013.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} whether phoronids have any {{significance}} for humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid <b>species</b> <b>as</b> endangered.|$|E
5|$|Old {{scientific}} {{data do not}} distinguish between the two species, making it useless for determining structural differences between them. The IUCN lists both <b>species</b> <b>as</b> data deficient on their Red List of endangered species because of this issue.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{vegetation}} in the municipality is secondary with decorative <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> geraniums, bougainvillea; trees such as laurel and eucalyptus, and various edible and medicinal herbs. Wildlife mostly consists of bird <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> doves and hummingbirds, various insects, along with some aquatic <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> frogs, fish and crab and reptiles such as lizards, small turtles and snakes. Mammals are all domesticated species.|$|R
50|$|Freshwater fish include rare <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> non-local Nile tilapia, {{saltwater}} eel and Hemibagrus wyckii {{species of}} catfish. Less rare <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> Nieuhof's walking catfish and blue panchax {{are also found}} here.|$|R
50|$|This nature {{preserve}} represents the northernmost extension of some southern <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> bigleaf magnolia (Magnolia macrophylla) and umbrella magnolia (Magnolia tripetala), but also includes more northerly <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> wolf-foot clubmoss (Lycopodium clavatum).|$|R
5|$|Psilocybe {{authority}} Gastón Guzmán, in his 1983 monograph on psilocybin mushrooms, considered Psilocybe semilanceata the world's most widespread psilocybin mushroom <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> it {{has been}} reported on 17 countries.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} mammal have {{particular}} symbolism. The Canadian horse and North American beaver are official symbols of Canada, and several provinces have designated native <b>species</b> <b>as</b> symbols.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} regard other <b>species</b> <b>as</b> valid as well, {{for example}} P.erlenbergensis. Such works, however, ignore Moser (2003), the publication {{that shows the}} type series of P.engelhardti to be diagnostic, and other material to be referable to it.|$|E
50|$|Fauna {{found in}} and around the Broad {{includes}} the white water-lily Nymphaea alba, common reed Phragmites australis and the rarer tussock-sedge Carex appropinquata <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> marsh arrowgrass Triglochin palustris and southern marsh-orchid Dactylorhiza praetermissa. It is surrounded by an area of mature Alder carr woodland with <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> Ash and Oak.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridge}} {{gained a}} following in South Africa {{where it was}} used to hunt small antelope and gazelle <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> duiker, impala, klipspringer, springbok and the Thompson’s gazelles. In North America it is capable of taking small predator <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> bobcats, coyotes and foxes. In Europe, it can be used for small goat and deer <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> the roe deer and chamois where legally permitted.|$|R
25|$|In marine environments {{trolling}} {{is used in}} big-game fishing {{to catch}} large offshore or open-water <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> tuna and marlin. Saltwater anglers also troll for inshore <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> bluefish, kingfish and various jacks.|$|R
5|$|Systematizing, naming and {{classifying}} dominated {{natural history}} {{throughout much of}} the 17th and 18th centuries. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. While Linnaeus conceived of <b>species</b> <b>as</b> unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated <b>species</b> <b>as</b> artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work would influence the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservation}} status of Velodona togata {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>as</b> of IUCN Red List version 2013.2.|$|E
5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, {{in animals}} {{of the open}} sea, {{especially}} those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many <b>species,</b> <b>as</b> well as larger animals such as jellyfish, salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E
50|$|South Africa has an {{emerging}} aquaculture. It consists mainly of culture of freshwater <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> crocodiles, trout, catfish, tilapia and ornamental fish as well <b>as</b> marine <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> abalone, prawns, oysters and mussels.|$|R
50|$|Polygonum douglasii {{is known}} <b>as</b> a <b>species</b> complex, <b>as</b> {{there are many}} {{subspecies}} that may be better treated <b>as</b> <b>species</b> in their own right.|$|R
50|$|Only a few natural hybrids {{within the}} genus {{have been named}} <b>as</b> <b>species,</b> such <b>as</b> Epidendrum × doroteae, Epidendrum × gransabanense and Epidendrum × purpureum.|$|R
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in <b>species</b> <b>as</b> diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such <b>species</b> <b>as</b> Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the natural history of the Borneo shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this <b>species</b> <b>as</b> Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are large}} areas of bog in Boho, [...] typified by <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> bell heather, cross-leaved heath and ling (common heather). Additionally <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> [...] sundew (which are carnivorous) and bog asphodels can be found.|$|R
50|$|Large {{number of}} {{commercial}} fish <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> snappers, sea catfish and mackerels were once abundant in these waters. Their decline {{ushered in the}} appearance of squid, shrimp, and small pelagic <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> herrings and anchovies.|$|R
50|$|These {{protected}} areas are habitats for many globally significant plant <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> rhododendrons and orchids and many endangered flagship <b>species</b> such <b>as</b> snow leopard, Asian black bear, red panda, white-bellied musk deer, blood pheasant and chestnut-breasted partridge.|$|R
