In this paper we compare the performance of existing distributed ad hoc network flooding algorithms indentifying <b>stengths</b> and weaknesses inherent in each mechanism. Additionally we propose to apply the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm in a distributed manner as the basis of an optimised ad hoc network flooding algorithm called Localised Minimum Spanning Tree Flooding (LMSTFlood). LMSTFlood provides significant reduction in duplicate packet reception, average transmission distance and energy consumed. Thus LMSTFlood limits the broadcast storm problem more effectively than existing optimised flooding mechanisms. ...|$|R

The weaknesses and <b>stengths</b> of the student teachers can be evaluated and discussed in the relevant stages.

It describes the common practice of microteaching at this institution as well as its theoretical analysis and research-based analysis in line with finding the better way(s) of running the microteaching at this study program. 	This book is hopefully beneficial not only for the student teachers for enriching their knowledge preparing themselves to be future professional teachers but also for the lecturers who handle the microteaching in line with helping the students learn how teach.

Such an analysis can provide information on the physical characteristics of the coronal plasma. Aims. An extensive target is used in an R-matrix scattering calculation to provide the necessary data for Fe 18 +. The use of the R-matrix method includes the resonance contribution lacking in the distorted wave approach and the large target improves the accuracy of the close-coupling approximation. Methods. The R-Matrix package described by Berrington et al. (1995, Comput. Phys. Commun., 92, 290) as provided by the UK RmaX project has been used to calculate electron collisional data among 342 levels of Fe 18 +. We have used the intermediate-coupling frame-transformation (ICFT) method (Griffin et al. 1998, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt.

40|$|We use a {{combination}} of numeric and analytic techniques to determine the ground state phase diagram of the Bose–Hubbard Hamiltonian with longer range repulsive interactions. At half filling one finds superfluidity and an insulating solid phase. Depending on the relative sizes of near–neighbor and next near–neighbor interactions, this solid either follows a checkerboard or a striped pattern. In neither case is there a coexistence with superfluidity. However upon doping “supersolid ” phases appear with simultaneous diagonal and off–diagonal long range order. Typeset using REVTEX 1 Content-Length: 30634 X-Lines: 647 Status: RO The interplay between different types of order in correlated boson and fermion models is a rich area of current research. One normally thinks of this interplay as taking the form of a competition: In superconducting materials, pairing can compete with structural phase transitions (A– 15 ’s), charge density wave (CDW) order (Ba 1 −xKxBiO 3), and antiferromagnetic order (high Tc oxides). This competition is reflected in theoretical models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian [1] where it is believed that superconductivity and antiferromagnetism occupy disjoint regions of the phase diagram, and in electron–phonon models like the Holstein Hamiltonian [2] where a Peierls–CDW state usurps pairing at large interaction <b>stengths</b> near half–filling. Similarly, in bosonic systems with on–site repulsion, superfluidity competes with an insulating Mott phase. [3, 4] Nevertheless, {{it has been suggested that}} in 4 He the solid and superfluid order might coexist. [5, 6] While there are only somewhat indirect experimental indications for such a phase, [7] “supersolids ” have been extensively studied with approximate analytic approaches.

The aim of our {{study was to determine}} if this concept was true for macroporous and carrageenan beads. The pore structure of the beads was analyzed by environmental scanning electronic microscopy and characterized by measuring  the total surface area and packing density. An increasing toluene content in the first emulsion was found {{to play an important role}} in creating more pores and in determining the pore structure. In addition, heat treatment of the beads was very effective for increasing the cross linking density and reducing the bead volume swelling in saline. However, treatment with steam reduced the bead surface area suggesting a change in pore structure. The cross linked hydrogel beads were stable in the pH range 1 - 13 and in KCI solutions at a concentration over 0. 07 M. The bead size increased with a decrease in ionic strength.
