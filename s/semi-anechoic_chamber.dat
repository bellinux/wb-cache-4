The table below presents their results.|$|E
50|$|Electromagnetic emissions: It is {{possible}} to capture the electromagnetic emissions of a wired keyboard from up to 20 m away, without being physically wired to it. In 2009, Swiss researchers tested 11 different USB, PS/2 and laptop keyboards in a <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> and found them all vulnerable, {{primarily because of the}} prohibitive cost of adding shielding during manufacture. The researchers used a wide-band receiver to tune into the specific frequency of the emissions radiated from the keyboards.|$|E
50|$|Full {{anechoic}} chambers aim {{to absorb}} energy in all directions. <b>Semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> {{have a solid}} floor {{that acts as a}} work surface for supporting heavy items, such as cars, washing machines, or industrial machinery, rather than the mesh floor grille over absorbent tiles found in full anechoic chambers. This floor is damped and floating on absorbent buffers to isolate it from outside vibration or electromagnetic signals. Recording studios are often semi-anechoic.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{instrumentation}} used {{to measure}} NVH include microphones, accelerometers and force gauges, or load cells. Many NVH facilities will have <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers,</b> and rolling road dynamometers. Typically signals are recorded direct to hard disk via an analog-to-digital converter. In the past magnetic or DAT tape recorders were used. The integrity of the signal chain is very important, typically each of the instruments used are fully calibrated in a lab once per year, and any given setup is calibrated as a whole once per day.|$|R

The main application is Random Line-Of-Sight Over-The- Air measurements in anechoic or <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> (i. e., anechoic chamber with reflecting floor). More specifically, the aim is testing the wireless communication systems on automotive vehicles. The aim is to generate the uniform field distribution of a plane wave over a pre-defined test zone containing the car {{or at least the}} part of the car containing the antenna(s).

In the case of testing power tools in the unloaded condition, the tool is suspended by cables and set to operate at full speed.

40|$|Measuring {{the level}} of {{electromagnetic}} interference emitted by electronic devices {{is an important part}} of the process of production and development of these devices. Today, these measurements are performed by specialized laboratories that are equipped with an anechoic or <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> For manufacturers of electronic devices, it would be beneficial if a Gigahertz Transversal Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell would be possible to use for measurements of emitted electromagnetic interference. A GTEM cell may be purchased at a fraction of price of an anechoic or <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> so manufacturers would be able to perform these measurements themselves during the development of the device. In this paper is published the measured levels of electromagnetic interference radiated by the basic set of intrusion and hold-up alarm system in the <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> and GTEM cell. The basic difference in the measured levels of EMI is based on the type of the measured electromagnetic interference.

In this paper, site attenuation of spherical dipole antenna is calculated using wire grid model.

40|$|Abstract—Based {{upon the}} {{standard}} IEEE 1309, a new calibration method for electromagnetic (EM) probes is proposed. The aforementioned method compares the electric field strength measured with the EM probe subject to calibration with the E-field intensity calculated through a linear interpolation of the corrected measurement using a reference EM probe. The corrected measurement results are computed {{by means of}} the calibration factors stated in the calibration certificate of the reference EM probe. The conditions and criteria, under which it is possible to calibrate EM probes inside <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 1 GHz, are presented. The results shows that the calibration method proposed in this paper is characterized by deviations less than 1 dB in almost all the frequencies considered, verifying the reliability of the method. The proposed approach is very useful for registering the measurement drift of EM probes used in EMC testing laboratories. 1...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} importance of EMC problems through the last years {{there is a great}} interest in measurement devices such as GTEM-cells (Giga(Hz) - TEM cells). They promise to allow compact and low-cost emission- as well as susceptibility tests up to very high frequencies. Expensive measurement procedures in open-area test sites or within <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> would become obsolete in many cases. To estimate the quality and reliability of GTEM-cell measurements it is necessary to have detailed knowledge about the processes within the cell and, in particular, about the interactions between the cell and the DUT (device under test). Due to the high frequency and the cell’s dimensions a purely numerical simulation while using standard techniques such as Finite Element Method, Method of Moments (MoM) or the Finite-Differ-Time-Domain (FDTD) method is inefficient and unnecessary since the GTEM-cell is a mostly empty homogeneous TEM-waveguide. Analytical models allow only the investigation of empty cells. As will be outlined in the following, a suitable way to reduce the numerical complexity of the general problem is the use of a hybrid method, such as the combination of a modal analysis with the MoM...|$|R

The system consists on a 12 meters structure where the antenna under test (a L band array of dipoles in this case) is positioned. The measurement probe (another dipole) moves on a linear slide and {{stops in front}} of each element of the array to acquire the electric field. All the system is installed on an <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber,</b> that can be lifted (with two synchronized stepped motors). This <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> covers the top and side parts of the structure. The bottom part consists on a metallic reflector, that controls the reflections from each antenna element.

40|$|Before putting {{digital systems}} for {{information}} technology or telecommunication applications on the market, an essential requirement is to perform tests {{in order to}} comply with the limits of radiated emission imposed by the standards. This book provides an investigation into signal integrity (SI) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems. Topics such as reflections, crosstalk, switching noise and radiated emission (RE) in high-speed digital systems are covered, which are essential for IT and telecoms applications. The highly important topic of modelling is covered which can reduce costs by enabling simulation data to demonstrate that a product meets design specifications and regulatory limits. According to the new European EMC directive, this can help to avoid the expensive use of large <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> or open area test sites for radiated emission assessments. Following a short introduction to signalling and radiated interference in digital systems, the book provides a detailed characterization of logic families in terms of static and dynamic characteristic useful for modelling techniques.   Crosstalk in multi-coupled line structures are investigated by analytical, graphical and circuit-based methods, and techniques to mitigate these phenomena are provided. Grounding, filtering and shielding with multilayer PCBs are also examined and design rules given. Written by authors with extensive experience in industry and academia.

40|$|The {{increment}} {{of the use}} {{of electric}} vehicles leads to a worry about measuring its principal source of environmental pollution: electromagnetic emissions. Given the complexity of directly measuring vehicular radiated emissions in real traffic, the main contribution of this PhD thesis is to propose an indirect solution to estimate such type of vehicular emissions. Relating the on-road vehicular radiated emissions with the driving profile is a complicated task. This is because {{it is not possible to}} directly measure the vehicular radiated interferences in real traffic due to potential interferences from another electromagnetic wave sources. This thesis presents a microscopic artificial intelligence model based on neural networks to estimate real traffic radiated emissions of electric vehicles in terms of the driving dynamics. Instantaneous values of measured speed and calculated acceleration have been used to characterize the driving profile. Experimental electromagnetic interference tests have been carried out with a Vectrix electric motorcycle as well as Twizy electric cars in <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers.</b> Both the motorcycle and the car have been subjected to different urban and interurban driving profiles. Time Domain measurement methodology of electromagnetic radiated emissions has been adopted in this work to save the overall measurement time. The relationship between the magnetic radiated emissions of the Twizy and the corresponding speed has been very noticeable. Maximum magnetic field levels have been observed during high speed cruising in extra-urban driving and acceleration in urban environments. A comparative study of the prediction performance between various static and dynamic neural models has been introduced. The Multilayer Perceptron feedforward neural network trained with Extreme Learning Machines has achieved the best estimation results of magnetic radiated disturbances as function of instantaneous speed and acceleration. In this way, on-road magnetic radiated interferences from an electric vehicle equipped with a Global Positioning System can be estimated. This research line will allow quantify the pollutant electromagnetic emissions of electric vehicles and study new policies to preserve the environment...|$|R

The thesis summarizes present pieces {{of knowledge about}} restricting of disturbing ambient signals and focuses on restricting of test site imperfection influence on the measurement results. Pre-compliance test site “calibration” uses comparison signal sources. There were added up the recommendations for “calibration” steps, too. The <b>semi-anechoic</b> vs. fully-anechoic <b>chambers</b> measurements results were compared. Some methods for dealing with ambient disturbing signals were discussed and high attention {{was applied to the}} test site choice and the minimal dimension geometry was recommended.

40|$|GTEM cell {{appears to}} be a popular test {{facility}} for integrated circuits (ICs) radiated emission evaluations in the past. Since the GTEM cell is a single port test device, the GTEM measurement cannot specifically differentiate components between electric and magnetic fields. Both fields are captured as a global quantity in GTEM measurement. It therefore is a suspicion that the radiated emission measurements using GTEM cell is less precise in contrast to scanning technique i. e. near field probe scan. However, GTEM cell is a cost effective test device that provides good ambient shielding to conduct field measurement in broad frequency. The GTEM measurement usually is associated to <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> (SAC) measurement. Thus, this study attempts to improve the correlation of the GTEM to SAC using a correction factor. In particular, a specific pattern was developed to replicate wide-ranging IC interconnections for the evaluations in GTEM cell and SAC. The horizontal and vertical electric fields based on the GTEM measurements were preprocessed using Matlab code before it is ready to attain the correction factor. Finally, the correction factor is employed to adjust the deviation while correlating the IC radiated electric fields of GTEM cell to <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber.</b> The results indicate a great improvement after regulating the GTEM fields with the correction factor. This implies the GTEM cell measurement is possible to achieve a good accuracy using a correction facto...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that noise-induced hearing loss remains the number one {{occupational}} disease in developed countries, individual noise exposure levels are still rarely known and infrequently tracked. Indeed, efforts to standardize noise exposure levels present disadvantages such as costly instrumentation and difficulties associated with on site implementation. Given their advanced technical capabilities and widespread daily usage, mobile phones {{could be used to}} measure noise levels and make noise monitoring more accessible. However, the use of mobile phones for measuring noise exposure is currently limited {{due to the lack of}} formal procédures for their calibration and challenges regarding the measurement procedure. Our research investigated the calibration of mobile phone-based solutions for measuring noise exposure using a mobile phone’s built-in microphones and wearable external microphones. The proposed calibration approach integrated corrections that took into account microphone placement error. The corrections were of two types: frequency-dependent, using a digital filter and noise level-dependent, based on the difference between the C-weighted noise level minus A-weighted noise level of the noise measured by the phone. The electro-acoustical limitations and measurement calibration procedure of the mobile phone were investigated. The study also sought to quantify the effect of noise exposure characteristics on the accuracy of calibrated mobile phone measurements. Measurements were carried out in reverberant and <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chambers</b> with several mobiles phone units of the same model, two types of external devices (an earpiece and a headset with an in-line microphone) and an acoustical test fixture (ATF). The proposed calibration approach significantly improved the accuracy of the noise level measurements in diffuse and free fields, with better results in the diffuse field and with ATF positions causing little or no acoustic shadowing. Several sources of errors and uncertainties were identified including the errors associated with the inter-unit-variability, the presence of signal saturation and the microphone placement relative to the source and the wearer. The results of the investigations and validation measurements led to recommendations regarding the measurement procedure including the use of external microphones having lower sensitivity and provided the basis for a standardized and unique factory default calibration method intended for implementation in any mobile phone. A user-defined adjustment was proposed to minimize the errors associated with calibration and the acoustical field. Mobile phones implementing the proposed laboratory calibration and used with external microphones showed great potential as noise exposure instruments. Combined with their potential as training and prevention tools, the expansion of their use could significantly help reduce the risks of noise-induced hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a full 3 -D {{numerical}} scheme {{based on}} {{the finite-difference time-domain method}} is used to predict the electromagnetic (EM) radiated interference generated by 42 -V vehicle power electronic driven electrical loads. An experimental setup has been arranged in order to validate the proposed simulation tool. To this aim, the features of a <b>semi-anechoic</b> EM <b>chamber</b> have been exploited in order to operate in a shielded test site for the measurement of near-field radiated emissions. Two different 3 -D geometrical configurations of realistic vehicle installations of the loads are studied. A comparative analysis among measured and computed results is performed. A good agreement between simulated and measured data is obtained. The proposed approach is suitable for the prediction of radiated EM interference generated by dc/dc converters and, particularly, by dual-voltage vehicle electric plants. In fact, due to the presence of complicated layout, the prediction of EM emissions can be a useful task in order to evaluate the EM compatibility (EMC) compliance from the design stage. Furthermore, with the growing market penetration of the “More Electric Vehicle” (MEV) concept in designing new vehicle electrical architectures, low-cost test methods for EMC assessments and suitable technical standard requirements have to be introduced. The proposed simulation tool can be usefully adopted to this aim. As an important advantage, it requires only a current measurement in the time domain.

Material and Method: In the present study, which was done at <b>semi-anechoic</b> <b>chamber</b> of the laboratory in Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The reverberation time, the total surface and the absorption surface of the chamber were determined, before and after the design and also they were compared with the target values. Intersection layout of the rectangular fibrous absorbents were design using graphic design software (AutoCAD and 3 Ds Max). before design, the reverberation time were measured according to ISO 3382 : 2000. The reverberation time in redesigned chamber was also calculated through retention time equation (Sabine). Moreover, Sabin’s formula was applied for determining the absorption surface and the total surface of the chamber, before and after the design.. Result: Before design, the reverberation time in the cut-off frequency of 250 Hz according to ISO 3382 : 2000 was determined 0. 3 second. Moreover, the total chamber surface was 47. 97 m 2.
