2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed {{to be so much}} weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and the fighting is both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that <b>sag</b> <b>point</b> — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to have any kind of take on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season".|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Lac Tio hemo-ilmenite {{ore body}} crops {{out in the}} outer portion of the 1. 06 Ga Lac Allard {{anorthosite}}, {{a member of the}} Havre-Saint-Pierre anorthosite suite from the Grenville province of North America. It is made up of ilmenitite (commonly with more than 95 % hemo-ilmenite) associated with noritic lithologies and anorthosite. The present study compares the magnetic fabric of the ore body, as deduced from anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements, with the crystallographic and shape fabrics, obtained from lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) and shape-preferred orientation (SPO) measurements made using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and 3 D image analysis, respectively. Room-temperature hysteresis measurements, thermomagnetic curves and values of the bulk magnetic susceptibility reveal a magnetic mineralogy dominated by a mixed contribution of hemo-ilmenite and magnetite. The hemo-ilmenite grains display a LPO characterized by a strong preferred orientation of the basal (0001) plane of ilmenite along which hematite was exsolved. This LPO and the magnetic fabric fit well (angle between the crystallographic c-axis and the axis of minimum susceptibility ≤ ca. 15 ° for most samples), and the latter is thus strongly influenced by the hemo-ilmenite magneto-crystalline anisotropy. A magnetite SPO, concordant with the hemo-ilmenite LPO, may also influence and even dominate the magnetic fabric. The rock shape fabric is coaxial with the magnetic fabric that can thus be used to perform detailed structural mapping. Interpretation of the magnetic fabric and field structural data suggests that the Lac Tio ore body would be a <b>sag</b> <b>point</b> at the margin of the Lac Allard anorthosite, deformed by ballooning during the final stage of diapiric emplacement of the anorthosite body...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} the Epping to Chatswood Rail Line project was {{conducted}} nearly in parallel with the initial construction work. The Macquarie Park Station caverns were partially excavated while the {{design of the}} other three stations was still underway. This provided an opportunity to use as-constructed performance to refine the design parameters for the subsequent caverns. Geotechnical monitoring of the initial Macquarie Park Station excavation included inclinometers, extensometers, surface settlement points, endoscopes, convergence <b>points,</b> crown <b>sag</b> <b>points</b> and rock bolt load cells. The geology of the excavation faces was also carefully mapped. On the basis of the mapping, the geological model for this station was refined slightly. The monitoring results were reviewed and back-analysed. The rock mass moduli and the joint stiffness values of the various rock units were varied to “match ” the various monitored behaviour of the excavation. The back-analysis work generally indicated that the original models adopted for design were reasonable. Two “admissible ” combinations of slightly revised geotechnical parameters were identified. Models for subsequent design of the other stations were adjusted to reflect the calibrated parameters. The back-analysis work was also consistent with the relatively high in-situ stresses adopted for the project. This paper discusses the back-analysis work undertaken and demonstrates that appropriate monitoring is a useful tool for verifying and refining design models. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{urbanization}} occurs, {{the removal}} of vegetation, compaction of soil and construction of impervious surfaces—roofs, asphalt, and concrete—and drainage infrastructure result in drastic changes to the natural hydrological cycle. Stormwater runoff occurs when rain does not infiltrate into soil. Instead it ponds at the surface and forms shallow channels of overland flow. The result is increased peak flows and pollutant loads, eroded streambanks, and decreased biodiversity in aquatic habitat. In urban areas, runoff is typically directed into catch basins and underground pipe systems to prevent flooding, however such systems are also failing to meet modern environmental goals. Green infrastructure is the widely evocative idea that development practices and stormwater management infrastructure can do better to mimic the natural hydrological conditions through distributed vegetation and source control measures that prevent runoff from being produced in the first place. This dissertation uses statistics and high-resolution, coupled surface-subsurface hydrologic simulation (ParFlow. CLM) to examine three understudied aspects of green infrastructure planning. First, I examine how development characteristics affect the runoff response in urban catchments. I find that {{instead of focusing on}} site imperviousness, planners should aim to preserve the ecosystem functions of infiltration and evapotranspiration that are lost even with low density development. Second, I look at how the spatial configuration of green infrastructure at the neighborhood scale affects runoff generation. While spatial configuration of green infrastructure does result in statistically significant differences in performance, such differences {{are not likely to be}} detectable above noise levels present in empirical monitoring data. In this study, there was no evidence of reduced hydrological effectiveness for green infrastructure located at <b>sag</b> <b>points</b> in the topography. Lastly, using six years of empirical data from a voluntary residential green infrastructure program, I show how the spread of green infrastructure depends on the demographic and physical characteristics of neighborhoods as well as spatially-dependent social processes (such as the spread of information). This dissertation advances the science of green infrastructure planning at multiple scales and in multiple sectors to improve the practice of urban water resource management and sustainable development. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{incorporating}} linguistically motivated features to ensure correct animacy and number agreement in an averaged perceptron ranking model for CCG realization helps improve a state-ofthe-art baseline even further. Traditionally, these features have been modelled using hard constraints in the grammar. However, given the graded nature of grammaticality judgements {{in the case}} of animacy we argue a case for the use of a statistical model to rank competing preferences. Though subject-verb agreement is generally viewed to be syntactic in nature, a perusal of relevant examples discussed in the theoretical linguistics literature (Kathol, 1999; Pollard and <b>Sag,</b> 1994) <b>points</b> toward the heterogeneous nature of English agreement. Compared to writing grammar rules, our method is more robust and allows incorporating information from diverse sources in realization. We also show that the perceptron model can reduce balanced punctuation errors that would otherwise require a post-filter. The full model yields significant improvements in BLEU scores on Section 23 of the CCGbank and makes many fewer agreement errors. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{beam compass}} {{is used to}} scribe a circle, either by drawing with lead, penning by ink, or {{scratching}} with a sharpened point. The radius can be adjusted by sliding the metal point holder across a wood beam or metal rod, and locking it by turning a knob at the desired location. Some have a fine radius adjustment. The threaded adjustment {{is similar to that}} of a Screw. The only limitation is the rigidity of the wood beam or metal rod being used. Longer wooden beams tend to sag depending on the species of wood used. Metal rods can be used as an alternative, but they also have length limitations. Some trammel sets include a support roller for attachment at mid span of the beam or rod, to take out the <b>sag.</b> Trammel <b>points</b> score a precise line by using a sharpened point, or draw a line using a lead clutch, or an ink nib. When the circular knob is turned, it micro adjusts the radius of the circle. On some, a spring and screw mechanism locks the compass at the precise desired location. Turning clockwise decreases the radius while turning counterclockwise increases the radius slightly.|$|R

40|$|Fully {{converter}} {{wind turbines}} and solar power utilise an inverter {{to connect to}} grid. The inverters are vulnerable to voltage sag in their terminal due to its damaging effect on semiconductor self-turnoff switches. In this paper, a bridge-type fault current limiter (B-FCL) is proposed for low voltage ride-through (LVRT) of the inverters during different types of fault with simple control system. The proposed B-FCL is capable to compensate the voltage <b>sag</b> in <b>point</b> of common coupling (PCC) and makes a safe condition {{not only for the}} inverter but also for any equipment which has been connected to the PCC in the power system. The B-FCL does not affect the normal operation of the inverter. Whenever the fault happens, a limiting resistor enters to the line current pass and decreases the fault current. As a result, the voltage sag on the PCC is mitigated due to limiting the fault current. The proposed B-FCL improves LVRT capability of the inverter, which does not require to changing its control method to ride through the low voltage. Furthermore, the DC input voltage of the inverter will not increase due to consuming the excessive active power by the limiting resistance of the B-FCL. PSCAD/EMTDC software is utilised to show the appropriate performance of the B-FCL during the symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults through simulation results...|$|R

The proposed structure prevents voltage sag and phase-angle jump of the substation PCC after fault occurrence. This structure has a simple control method. Using the semiconductor switch (insulated-gate bipolar transistor or gate turnoff thyristor at dc current rout leads to fast operation of the proposed FCL and, consequently, dc reactor value is reduced. On the other hand, the proposed structure reduces the total harmonic distortion on load voltage and it has low ac losses in normal operation. As a result, other feeders, which {{are connected to the}} substation PCC, will have good power quality. Analytical analysis and simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC software and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of this structure...|$|R

The UPQC {{is one of}} the major custom power solutions capable of mitigating the effect supply voltage <b>sags</b> at the <b>point</b> of common coupling (PCC) or load. A UPQC employs a control method in which the series compensator injects a voltage that leads 0 the supply current by 90. So that the series compensator at steady state consume no active power. However, the UPQC has some disadvantages. First, there is limitation in rating when using upqc for series compensation. Second, there is a phase difference between the input and output voltage in proportion to the severity of voltage sags. As a result, it cannot offer effective compensation for voltage drops. This paper discusses the control strategy of the UPQC with a focus on the flow of instantaneous active and reactive power inside the UPQC.

40|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} {{present in}} the drivetrain excited by turbulent winds or grid disturbances (often manifesting as voltage sags) can produce severe stresses on the components of wind turbines. This study presents a damping method for the rotor side converter of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) -based wind turbine to improve system damping during small grid disturbances. Within the damping strategy, torsional damper is included into the power loop of the rotor side converter to provide damping for the system. During vibrations, a well-designed low-pass filter (LPF) is employed by the torsional damper to extract {{the dynamics of the}} generator speed and to generate a damping signal. To demonstrate the proposed damping approach, the small-signal stability model of a wind turbine connected to an infinite bus system is presented, and the eigenvalue analysis is conducted to verify the damping effect introduced by the torsional damper. In the case study, grid voltage <b>sag</b> at the <b>point</b> of common coupling (PCC) is applied to excite the torsional vibration of the wind turbine shaft. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed damping approach are testified by using the simulation results against theory analysis...|$|R
30|$|A turbidite fan in the Eocene upper Wenchang Formation in the Enping Sag, Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB) {{has been}} studied using seismic, logging and {{borehole}} data. The fan is characterized by parallel progradation on the dip seismic profile and is mound-shaped or lenticular-shaped on the strike seismic profile. The study of the core and logging data from well EP 17 - 3 - 1, which {{is located in the}} front side of the turbidite fan, shows that this fan is a set of normal grading sand beds, interbedded within thick dark grey mudstones of semi-deep to deep lake deposits in the Wenchang Formation. The fan is interpreted as a sand/mud-rich turbidite fan that has an area of over 140 km 2 and a maximum thickness of over 340 m. Combined with a study of the regional geological background and previous provenance analysis of the Eocene Wenchang Formation, the main potential provenances for the turbidite fan are considered to be the Panyu low-uplift and northern fault terrace zone. The Enping Sag {{is considered to be a}} half graben-like basin whose north side is faulted and whose south side is overlapped. Basement subsidence in the Eocene was mainly controlled by boundary faults which dip relatively steeply on the north side, causing the subsidence center of the Enping Sag in this stage to be close to the north boundary faults. Sustained faults developed in the Enping Sag during the Eocene caused an increase of the relative height difference between the north and the south uplift zone in the Enping Sag. Affected by the second episode of the Zhuqiong movement (39 – 36 Ma) in late Eocene, sediments which had accumulated on the Panyu low-uplift zone were triggered and moved toward the subsidence center of the Enping Sag and formed the turbidite fan. The second episode of the Zhuqiong movement is the most important triggering factor for the formation of the turbidite fan in the Wenchang Formation. Seismic attribute characterization shows that the low frequency energy is enhanced and high frequency energy is weakened when seismic waves propagate through the oil-bearing zone in this fan. Amplitude versus offset (AVO) anomalies are observed in the seismic data and abnormally high pressure is encountered. The turbidite fan in the Wenchang Formation has provided important information for sedimentary evolution in deep layers of the Enping <b>Sag</b> and <b>pointed</b> to a new direction for the hydrocarbon exploration in the study area.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of power management control strategies for a direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine (VSWT). Two modes of operation have been considered: (1) isolated/islanded mode, and (2) grid-connected mode. In the isolated/islanded mode, the system requires additional energy sources and sinks to counterbalance the intermittent nature of the wind. Thus, battery energy storage and photovoltaic (PV) systems have been integrated with the wind turbine to form a microgrid with hybrid energy sources. For the wind/battery hybrid system, several energy management and control issues have been addressed, such as DC link voltage stability, imbalanced power flow, and constraints of the battery state of charge (SOC). To ensure the integrity of the microgrid, and to increase its flexibility, dump loads and an emergency back-up AC source (can be a diesel generator set) have been used to protect the system against the excessive power production from the wind and PV systems, as well as the intermittent nature of wind source. A coordinated control strategy is proposed for the dump loads and back up AC source. An alternative control strategy is also proposed for a hybrid wind/battery system by eliminating the dedicated battery converter and the dump loads. To protect the battery against overcharging, an integrated control strategy is proposed. In addition, the dual vector voltage control (DVVC) is also developed to tackle the issues associated with unbalanced AC loads. To improve the performance of a DC microgrid consisting wind, battery, and PV, a distributed control strategy using DC link voltage (DLV) based control law is developed. This strategy provides simpler structure, less frequent mode transitions, and effective coordination among different sources without relying on real-time communication. In a grid-connected mode, this DC microgrid is connected to the grid through a single inverter at the point of common coupling (PCC). The generated wind power is only treated as a source at the DC side for the study of both unbalanced and balanced voltage sag issues at a distribution grid network. The proposed strategy consists of: (i) a vector current control with a feed-forward of the negative-sequence voltage (VCCF) to compensate for the negative sequence currents; and (ii) a power compensation factor (PCF) control for the VCCF to maintain the balanced power flow between the system and the grid. A sliding mode control strategy has also been developed to enhance the overall system performance. Appropriate grid code has been considered in this case. All the developed control strategies have been validated via extensive computer simulation with realistic system parameters. Furthermore, to valid developed control strategies in a realistic environment in real-time, a microgrid has been constructed using physical components: a wind turbine simulator (WTS), power electronic converters, simulated grid, sensors, real-time controllers and protection devices. All the control strategies developed in this system have been validated experimentally on this facility. In conclusion, several power management strategies and real-time control issues have been investigated for direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine system in an islanded and grid-connected mode. For the islanded mode, the focuses have been on microgrid control. While for the grid-connected mode, main consideration has been on the mitigation of voltage <b>sags</b> at the <b>point</b> of common coupling (PCC) ...|$|R
