5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine). In young and otherwise healthy people with overt hypothyroidism, a full replacement dose (adjusted by weight) can be started immediately; in the elderly and people with heart disease a lower <b>starting</b> <b>dose</b> is recommended to prevent over supplementation and risk of complications. Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E

25|$|Since salt {{restriction}} is {{the basic}} concept in treatment, and aldosterone {{is one of the}} hormones that acts to increase salt retention, a medication that counteracts aldosterone should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics such as triamterene or amiloride) is the drug of choice since they block the aldosterone receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be dosed once per day. Generally, the <b>starting</b> <b>dose</b> is oral spironolactone 100nbsp&mg/day (max 400nbsp&mg/day).|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, detailed in guidelines in many countries, repeated surveys show poor physician performance in attaining guideline lipid targets, which is associated with reluctance by physicians to up-titrate statins from <b>starting</b> <b>doses.</b> Data from randomised, double-blind trials comparing common <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> of atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin for 12 weeks in hypercholesterolaemic patients were therefore analysed for achievement of lipid-lowering goals recommended by the England National Service Framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD). In three pooled trials, rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 389) reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol more significantly than atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) (p 30 %) with 84 % patients on rosuvastatin vs. 58 % on atorvastatin and 75 % of patients on rosuvastatin vs. 49 % on simvaststin and 24 % on pravastatin.

25|$|The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium {{recommends}} avoiding amitriptyline {{in patients}} who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk {{for a lack of}} efficacy and side effects, respectively.

A reduction in <b>starting</b> <b>dose</b> is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers.|$|E

2500|$|Like pure µ-opioids, {{the mixed}} agonists-antagonist opioid class of drugs can cause side effects with initial {{administration}} of the drug but which lessen over time (“tolerance”). [...] This is particularly true for {{the side effects of}} nausea, sedation and cognitive symptoms (Jovey et al. 2003). [...] These side effects can in many instances be ameliorated or avoided at the time of drug initiation by titrating the drug from a tolerable <b>starting</b> <b>dose</b> up to the desired therapeutic dose. An important difference between nalbuphine and the pure mu opioid analgesic drugs is the “ceiling effect” on respiration. [...] Respiratory depression is a potentially fatal side effect from the use of pure mu opioids. [...] Nalbuphine has limited ability to depress respiratory function (Gal et al. 1982).|$|E
2500|$|Given {{its high}} {{concentration}} of morphine, opium tincture is useful for treating moderate to severe pain. (The amount of codeine in the tincture is negligible and {{does not have any}} appreciable analgesic effect.) The dose of tincture is generally {{the same as that of}} morphine in opioid-naïve patients, titrated upward as needed. The usual <b>starting</b> <b>dose</b> in adults is 1.5mL by mouth every 3 to 4 hours, representing the equivalent of 15mg (approximately 1/4 grain) of morphine per dose. Opioid-tolerant patients may require higher than normal dosing. For the opioid tolerant patient, doses in the range of 3-6 mL every 3-4 hours would be usual. [...] This would represent an equivalent daily dose of between 180mg and 480mg of morphine. There is a danger of overdose in treating pain with opium tincture; see below.|$|E

40|$|The Registry of Cytotoxicity (RC), which {{consists}} of in vivo acute oral toxicity data from rats and mice and in vitro cytotoxicity data from multiple mammalian cell lines for 347 chemicals, was published in 1998 (Halle 1998). A regression model constructed from these data was proposed by ZEBET, the German National Center for the Documentation and Evaluation of Alternative Methods to Animal Experiments, as a method to reduce animal use by identifying the most appropriate <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> for acute oral systemic toxicity tests (Halle 1998; Spielmann et al. 1999). The regression line, however, presents LD 50 data in mmoles/kg body weight making it unsuitable for formulations and mixtures. NICEATM/ECVAM has performed a validation study to evaluate 3 T 3 and NHK cells in basal cytotoxicity assays with a neutral red uptake (NRU) cell viability endpoint to predict <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> for the acute oral Up-and-Down Procedure (UDP). Linear regression models were determined using the log rat LD 50 (mg/kg) versus the log IC 50 (µg/mL) for the 55 RC chemicals evaluated in this study. This regression line was compared to a similarly derived regression utilizing the RC dataset for these chemicals and {{was found to be}} in agreement. A review of the NICEATM/ECVAM data and the RC data confirms that those chemicals with known mechanisms of toxicity (i. e., cholinesterase inhibitors, etc.) or those requiring metabolic activation are often discordant with the model. By removing these chemicals from the analysis, a newly derived linear regression utilizing the RC dataset of rat LD 50 values (285 / 347 chemicals) in mg/kg body weight may be suitable for estimating the <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> for rat LD 50 determinations for formulations and mixtures using the UDP.

To assess the {{influence on the}} course of these diseases of the clinical symptoms at initial presentation and of the starting dosage of corticosteroid (CS) treatment the data for 210 patients, who were diagnosed as having PMR or TA from 1976 to 1986 and were followed up closely, were reviewed. One hundred and thirty two patients were diagnosed as having 'clinically pure' PMR; prednisone <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> of over 15 mg daily provided more CS related adverse effects without any advantage. The mean duration of treatment was 25. 7 months. Nine patients later developed symptoms of TA, {{and there were no}} predictive features for this. None experienced visual or neurological complications. Seventy eight patients were diagnosed as having clinical TA. Twenty five patients treated with low <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> of prednisone, ranging from 10 to 20 mg/d (mean 16. 2 mg/d), developed less CS related adverse effects and did not have more visual or neurological complications than 53 patients treated with higher doses. The mean duration of treatment was 30. 9 months. Fifteen patients experienced visual or neurological complications and men (10 / 30) developed these complications more frequently than women (5 / 48) (p less than 0. 02). These results suggest that (a) clinically pure PMR is a benign disease requiring low doses of CS treatment; (b) low doses of CS seem an adequate treatment for most cases of TA; (c) a worse prognosis seems attached to the male sex in TA...|$|R

40|$|Background AZD 3514 is a first-in-class, orally bio-available, {{androgen}}-dependent and -independent {{androgen receptor}} inhibitor and selective androgen-receptor down-regulator (SARD). Methods In study 1 and 2, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients (pts) were initially recruited into a once daily (QD) oral schedule (A). In study 1, pharmacokinetic assessments led to twice daily (BID) dosing (schedule B) to increase exposure. Study 2 explored a once daily schedule. Results In study 1, 49 pts {{were treated with}} escalating doses of AZD 3514 (A 35 pts, B 14 pts). <b>Starting</b> <b>doses</b> were 100  mg (A) and 1000  mg (B). The AZD 3514 formulation was switched from capsules to tablets at 1000  mg QD. 2000  mg BID was considered non-tolerable due to grade (G) 2 toxicities (nausea [N], vomiting [V]). No adverse events (AEs) met the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) definition. Thirteen pts received AZD 3514 in study 2, with <b>starting</b> <b>doses</b> of 250  mg QD. The most frequent drug-related AEs were N: G 1 / 2 in 55 / 70 pts (79  %); G 3 in 1  pt (1. 4  %); &# 38; V: G 1 / 2 in 34 / 70 pts (49  %) &# 38; G 3 in 1  pt (1. 4  %). PSA declines (≥ 50  %) were documented in 9 / 70 patients (13  %). Objective soft tissue responses per RECIST 1. 1 were observed in 4 / 24 (17  %) pts in study 1. Conclusion AZD 3514 has moderate anti-tumour activity in pts with advanced CRPC but with significant levels of nausea and vomiting.
