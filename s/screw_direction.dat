40|$|Objective: To (1) {{evaluate}} and compare computer assisted surgery (CAS) with conventional screw insertion (conventional osteosynthesis [COS]) {{for treatment of}} equine abaxial distal phalanx fractures; (2) compare planned screw position with actual postoperative position; and (3) determine the preferred <b>screw</b> <b>direction.</b> Study design: Experimental study. Sample population: Cadaveric equine limbs (n = 32). Methods: In 8 specimens each, a 4. 5 mm cortex bone screw was inserted in lag fashion in dorsopalmar (plantar) direction using CAS and COS. In 2 other groups of 8, the screws were inserted in opposite direction. Precision of CAS was determined by comparison of planned and actual screw position. Preferred <b>screw</b> <b>direction</b> was also assessed for CAS and COS. Results: In 4 of 6 direct comparisons, screw positioning was significantly better with CAS. Results of precision analysis for screw position were similar to studies published in human medicine. None of evaluated criteria identified a preferred direction of screw insertion. Conclusion: For abaxial fractures of the distal phalanx, superior precision in screw position is achieved with CAS technique compared with COS technique. Clinical Relevance: Abaxial fractures of the distal phalanx lend themselves to computer assisted implantation of 1 screw in dorsopalmar (plantar) direction.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{procedure for}} the development of 3 D patient-specific implants with drilling guides for acetabular fracture surgery is presented. By using CT data and 3 D surgical planning software, a virtual model of the fractured pelvis was created. During this process the fracture was virtually reduced. Based on the reduced fracture model, patient-specific titanium plates including polyamide drilling guides were designed, 3 D printed and milled for intra-operative use. One of the advantages of this procedure is that the personalised plates could be tailored to both the shape of the pelvis and the type of fracture. The optimal <b>screw</b> <b>directions</b> and sizes were predetermined in the 3 D model.

To analyze anatomic landmarks and safe zones for optimal screw placement through the posterior {{arc of the}} human atlas, morphometric parameters of 41 adult native human atlas specimens were quantitatively measured. Internal dimensions of the atlas (lateral mass, maximum and minimum intraosseous screw length), minimum height and width of the posterior arc and optimal screw insertion angles were defined on pQCT scans. By this, an optimal posterior screw insertion point (OIP) and a preferable <b>screw</b> <b>direction</b> (PSD) through the posterior arch into the lateral mass of C 1 were defined. External dimensions (transverse and sagittal diameter) {{as well as the}} width of the mid-portion of C 1 lateral mass were significantly higher in male specimens. The mean height of the posterior arch at the vertebral artery groove was 4. 1  ±  0. 8  mm in female and 4. 6  ±  0. 9  mm in male specimens. The optimal screw insertion point was located 21. 6  ±  1. 7  mm in female and 23. 6  ±  2. 3  mm in male lateral from the posterior tubercle of C 1 (P <  0. 01).

40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis of}} the large anomalous circular dichroism spectrum observed for highly native chromosomal fibers released from the heads of equine sperm has been investigated through physico-chemical and theoretical means. Linear dichroism measurements on the chromosomal fibers indicate an orientation of the DNA hdix axis perpendicular to the fiber length. The fibers respond as cholesteric liquid crystals to reflectance spectroscopy with a characteristic wavelength of maximum reflectivity (310 nm). The circular dichroism spectrum calculated for a liquid crystal model of the ordering of DNA molecules is in excellent agreement with the spectrum observed for the chromosomal fibers. Dissolution of the fibers gives the same circular dichroism {{as that of the}} chromatin of eukaryote somatic cells. Collectively these facts allow formulation of a model for the total structure of equine sperm chromosomal fibers. DNA molecules maintained in the B-form secondary structure are compacted by coiling into a superhelical tertiary structure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Computer {{assisted}} corrective osteotomy of the diaphyseal {{forearm and}} the distal radius based on computer simulation and patient-specific guides {{has been described}} as a promising technique for accurate reconstruction of forearm deformities. Thereby, the intraoperative use of patient-specific drill and cutting guides facilitate the transfer of the preoperative plan to the surgery. However, the difference between planned and performed reduction is difficult to assess with conventional radiographs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of this surgical technique based on postoperative three-dimensional (3 D) computed tomography (CT) data. METHODS: Fourteen patients (mean age 23. 2 (range, 12 - 58) years) with an extra-articular deformity of the forearm had undergone computer assisted corrective osteotomy with the healthy anatomy of the contralateral uninjured side as a reconstruction template. 3 D bone surface models of the pathological and contralateral side were created from CT data for the computer simulation. Patient-specific drill and cutting guides including the preoperative planned <b>screw</b> <b>direction</b> of the angular-stable locking plates and the osteotomy planes were used for the intraoperative realization of the preoperative plan. There were seven opening wedge osteotomies and nine closing wedge (or single-cut) osteotomies performed. Eight-ten weeks postoperatively CT scans were obtained to assess bony consolidation and additionally used to generate a 3 D model of the forearm. The simulated osteotomies- preoperative bone models with simulated correction - and the performed osteotomies - postoperative bone models - were analyzed for residual differences in 3 D alignment. RESULTS: On average, a significant higher residual rotational deformity was observed in opening wedge osteotomies (8. 30 ° ± 5. 35 °) compared to closing wedge osteotomies (3. 47 ° ± 1. 09 °). The average residual translation was comparable small in both groups, i. e., below 1. 5 mm and 1. 1 mm for opening and closing wedge osteotomies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The technique demonstrated high accuracy in performing closing wedge (or single-cut) osteotomies. However, for opening wedge osteotomies with extensive lengthening, probably due to the fact that precise reduction was difficult to achieve or maintain, the final corrections were less accurate...|$|E

At pH = 8. 0 in water, its deprotonated form [L 13 − 3 H] 3 - reacts with Ln(ClO 4) 3 to give the poorly soluble and stable podates [Ln(L 13 − 3 H) ] (log(β 110) = 6. 7 − 7. 0, Ln = La−Lu). The isolated complexes [Ln(L 13 − 3 H) ](H 2 O) 7 (Ln = Eu, 8; Tb, 9; Lu, 10) are isostructural, and their crystal structures show Ln(III) to be nine-coordinate in a pseudotricapped trigonal prismatic site defined by the donor atoms of the three helically wrapped tridentate binding units of L 13. The Ln−O(carboxamide) bonds are only marginally longer than the Ln−O(carboxylate) bonds in [Ln(L 13 − 3 H) ], thus producing a regular triple helix around Ln(III) which reverses its <b>screw</b> <b>direction</b> within the covalent Me−TREN tripod. High-resolution emission spectroscopy demonstrates that (i) the replacement of terminal carboxamides with carboxylates induces only minor electronic changes for the metallic site, (ii) the solid-state structure is maintained in water, and (iii) the metal in the podate is efficiently protected from interactions with solvent molecules. The absolute quantum yields obtained for [Eu(L 13 − 3 H) ] (= 1. 8 × 10 - 3) and [Tb(L 13 − 3 H) ] (= 8. 9 × 10 - 3) in water remain modest and strongly contrast with that obtained for the lanthanide luminescence step (ΦEu = 0. 28). Detailed photophysical studies assign this discrepancy to the small energy gap between the ligand-centered singlet (1 ππ*) and triplet (3 ππ*) states which limits {{the efficiency of the}} intersystem crossing process. Theoretical TDDFT calculations suggest that the connection of a carboxylate group to the central pyridine ring prevents the sizable stabilization of the triplet state required for an efficient sensitization process. The thermodynamic and electronic origins of the advantages (stability, lanthanide quantum yield) and drawbacks (solubility, sensitization) brought by the "carboxylate effect" in lanthanide complexes are evaluated for programming predetermined properties in functional devices...|$|E

Surgical hip dislocation approach with larger displacement of the posterior column {{in comparison to the}} anterior column, transtectal fractures, additional intraarticular fragments, marginal impaction. Stoppa approach with larger displacement of the anterior column in comparison to the posterior column. A combined approach might be necessary with difficult reduction. CONTRAINDICATIONS Fractures > 15 days (then ilioinguinal or extended iliofemoral approaches). Suprapubic catheters and abdominal problems (e. g., previous laparotomy due to visceral injuries) with Stoppa approach (then switch to classic ilioinguinal approach). SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Surgical hip dislocation: lateral decubitus position. Straight lateral incision centered over the greater trochanter. Entering of the Gibson interval. Digastric trochanteric osteotomy with protection of the medial circumflex femoral artery. Opening of the interval between the piriformis and the gluteus minimus muscle. Z-shaped capsulotomy. Dislocation of the femoral head. Reduction and fixation of the posterior column with plate and screws. Fixation of the anterior column with a lag <b>screw</b> in <b>direction</b> of the superior pubic ramus. Stoppa approach: supine position. Incision according to Pfannenstiel. Longitudinal splitting of the anterior portion of the rectus sheet and the rectus abdominis muscle. Blunt dissection of the space of Retzius. Ligation of the corona mortis, if present. Blunt dissection of the quadrilateral plate and the anterior column. Reduction of the anterior column and fixation with a reconstruction plate. Fixation of the posterior column with lag screws. If necessary, the first window of the ilioinguinal approach can be used for {{reduction and}} fixation of the posterior column. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: During hospital stay, intensive mobilization of the hip joint using a continuous passive motion machine with a maximum flexion of 90 degrees. No active abduction and passive adduction over the body's midline, if a surgical dislocation was performed. Maximum weight bearing 10 - 15 kg for 8 weeks. Then, first clinical and radiographic follow-up. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis for 8 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: 17 patients with a mean follow-up of 3. 2 years. Ten patients were operated via surgical hip dislocation, two patients with a Stoppa approach, and five using a combined or alternative approach. Anatomic reduction was achieved in ten of the twelve patients (83 %) without primary total hip arthroplasty. Mean operation time 3. 3 h for surgical hip dislocation and 4. 2 h for the Stoppa approach. Complications comprised one delayed trochanteric union, one heterotopic ossification, and one loss of reduction. There were no cases of avascular necrosis. In two patients, a total hip arthroplasty was performed due to the development of secondary hip osteoarthritis...|$|R
