Amino acids and nucleobases are compounds that are essential for all known life on Earth and are excellent target molecules in the search for potential Martian biomarkers or prebiotic chemistry. Martian meteorites represent the only samples from Mars that can be studied directly in the laboratory on Earth. Here, we analyzed the amino acid and nucleobase content of the shergottite Roberts Massif (RBT) 04262 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We did not detect any nucleobases above our detection limit in formic acid extracts; however, we did measure a suite of protein and nonprotein amino acids in hot-water extracts with high relative abundances of beta-alanine and gamma-amino-eta-butyric acid. The presence of only low (to absent) levels of several proteinogenic amino acids and a lack of nucleobases suggest that this meteorite fragment is fairly uncontaminated with respect to these common biological compounds. The distribution of <b>straight-chained</b> amine-terminal eta-omega-amino acids in RBT 04262 resembled those previously measured in thermally altered carbonaceous meteorites. A carbon isotope ratio of - 24 (0 / 00) +/- 6 (0 / 00) for beta-alanine in RBT 04262 is in the range of reduced organic carbon previously measured in Martian meteorites (Steele et al. 2012).

40|$|There are no in vivo {{repeated-dose}} {{data for}} the vast majority of β-olefinic alcohols. However, there are robust and consistent ex vivo data suggesting many of these chemicals are metabolically transformed, especially in the liver, to reactive electrophilic toxicants which react in a mechanistically similar manner to acrolein, the reactive metabolite of 2 -propen- 1 -ol. Hence, an evaluation was conducted to determine suitability of 2 -propen- 1 -ol as a read-across analogue for other β-olefinic alcohols. The pivotal issue to applying read-across to the proposed category is the confirmation of the biotransformation to metabolites having the same mechanism of electrophilic reactivity, via the same metabolic pathway, with a rate of transformation sufficient to induce the same in vivo outcome. The applicability domain for this case study was limited to small (C 3 to C 6) primary and secondary β-olefinic alcohols. Mechanistically, these β-unsaturated alcohols are considered to be readily metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase to polarised α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. These metabolites are able to react via the Michael addition reaction mechanism with thiol groups in proteins resulting in cellular apoptosis and/or necrosis. The addition of the non-animal in chemico reactivity data (50 % depletion of free glutathione) reduced the uncertainty so the read-across prediction for the straight-chain olefinic β-unsaturated alcohols is deemed equivalent to a standard test.

40|$|Stemming from a {{continuing}} demand for fuel surrogates, composed {{of only a}} few species, combustion of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (>C 5) is of scientific interest due to their abundance in petroleum-based fuels, which contain hundreds of different hydrocarbon species, used for military, aviation, and transportation applications. Fuel surrogate development involves the use of a few hydrocarbon species to replicate the physical, chemical, combustion, and ignition properties of multi-component petroleum-based fuels, enabling fundamental studies to be performed in a more controlled manner. Of particular interest are <b>straight-chained,</b> saturated hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) due to the high concentration of these species in diesel and jet fuels. Prior to integrating a particular hydrocarbon into a surrogate fuel formulation, its individual properties are to be precisely known. n-Nonane (n-C 9 H 20) is found in diesel and aviation fuels, and its combustion properties have received only minimal consideration. The present work involves first measurements of n-C 9 H 20 oxidation in oxygen (O 2) and argon (Ar), which were performed under dilute conditions at three levels of equivalence ratio (phi = 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0) and fixed pressure near 1. 5 atm using a shock tube. Utilizing shock waves, high-temperature, fixed-pressure conditions are created within which the fuel reacts, where temperature and pressure are calculated using 1 D shock theory and measurement of shock velocity. Of interest were measurements of ignition times and species time-histories of the hydroxyl (OH*) radical intermediate. A salient pre-ignition feature was observed in fuel-lean, stoichiometric, and fuel-rich OH* species profiles. The feature at each equivalence ratio was observed above 1400 K with the time-of-initiation (post reflected-shock) showing dependence on phi as the initiation time shortened with increasing phi. Relative percentage calculations reveal that the fuel-rich condition produces the largest quantity of pre-ignition OH*.

Among the classes of organic compounds found in meteorites are keto acids (pyruvic acid, etc.), hydroxy tricarboxylic acids (1), amino acids, amides, purines and pyrimidines. The Murchison and Murray meteorites {{are the most}} studied for soluble and insoluble organic compounds and organic carbon phases. The majority of (indigenous) meteoritic compounds are racemic, (i. e., their D/L enantiomer ratios are 50 : 50). However, {{some of the more}} unusual (non-protein) amino acids contain slightly more of one enantiomer (usually the L) than the other. This presentation focuses on the enantiomer analyses of three to six-carbon (3 C to 6 C) meteoritic sugar acids. The molecular and enantiomer analysis of corresponding sugar alcohols will also be discussed. Detailed analytical procedures for sugar-acid enantiomers have been described. Results of several meteorite analyses show that glyceric acid is consistently racemic (or nearly so) as expected of non-biological mechanisms of synthesis. Also racemic are 4 -C deoxy sugar acids: 2 -methyl glyceric acid; 2, 4 -dihydroxybutyric acid; 2, 3 -dihydroxybutyric acid (two diastereomers); and 3, 4 -dihydroxybutyric acid. However, a 4 C acid, threonic acid, has never been observed as racemic, i. e., it possesses a large D excess. In several samples of Murchison and one of GRA 95229 (possibly the most pristine carbonaceous meteorite yet analyzed) threonic acid has nearly the same D enrichment. In Murchison, preliminary isotopic measurements of individual threonic acid enantiomers point towards extraterrestrial sources of the D enrichment. Enantiomer analyses of the 5 C mono-sugar acids, ribonic, arabinonic, xylonic, and lyxonic also show large D excesses. It is worth noting that all four of these acids (all of the possible <b>straight-chained</b> 5 C sugar acids) are present in meteorites, including the rare lyxonic acid, and their relative abundances are in equilibrium proportions. In addition (in contrast to the above D-only excesses), some of the above acids are found in biology as the L enantiomer. Whether rare are common, all of the 6 C sugar acids that are present in sufficient amounts to allow enantiomer analysis (Mannonic, gluconic, altronic, talonic, idonic, gulonic, and galactonic) also, apparently, possess significant D excesses...|$|E

Fish in the North Sea experience exposure to xenobiotic compounds from historic pollution and releases from industry and other human activities. A number of adverse biological effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been shown, including alterations in the cell membrane. This study is a follow-up of a previously published study from IMR that showed that Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that were exposed to short-chained alkylphenols had altered lipid composition and fatty acid distribution in the liver and brain compared to un-exposed fish. The study in this thesis consists of two exposure experiments where Atlantic cod were given pollutants in the diet through 4 weeks. In experiment 1 Atlantic cod were exposed to para-substituted nonylphenols (NPs), either the <b>straight-chained</b> isomer 4 -n-NP, or a mixture of branched isomers, 4 - T-NP. In experiment 2 Atlantic cod were given crude oil and/or a mixture of halogenated POPs. The POPs included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), chlorinated pesticides, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). The fish were given doses corresponding to chronic pollution or higher doses analogous to acute spill accidents. The main focus of the thesis has been detailed studies of lipid composition, with emphasis on the phospholipids in the membranes, and fatty acid distribution in membrane lipids. Toxicogenomic studies have also been performed on the transcriptional levels, as well as biophysical studies of model lipid membranes as Langmuir monolayers and their interactions with selected POPs. The treatments with NPs or oil/POPs did not induce large changes in membrane composition (lipid class composition and fatty acid distribution) in the liver and brain of male Atlantic cod. However, the transcriptional data suggest that the fish were affected by the treatment at the molecular level.

40|$|A {{suite of}} 18 oils from the Barrow Island oilfield, Australia, and a non-biodegraded {{reference}} oil have been analysed compositionally {{in order to}} detail the effect of minor to moderate biodegradation on C₅ to C₉ hydrocarbons. Carbon isotopic data for individual low molecular weight hydrocarbons were also obtained for six of the oils. The Barrow Island oils came from different production wells, reservoir horizons, and compartments, but have a common source (the Upper Jurassic Dingo Claystone Formation), with some organo-facies differences. Hydrocarbon ratios based on hopanes, steranes, alkylnaphthalenes and alkylphenanthrenes indicate thermal maturities of about 0. 8 % Rc {{for most of the}} oils. The co-occurrence in all the oils of relatively high amounts of 25 -norhopanes with C₅ to C₉ hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and cyclic alkanes implies that the oils are the result of multiple charging, with a heavily biodegraded charge being overprinted by fresher and more pristine oil. The later oil charge was itself variably biodegraded, leading to significant compositional variations across the oilfield, which help delineate compartmentalisation. Biodegradation resulted in strong depletion of n-alkanes (> 95 %) from most of the oils. Benzene and toluene were partially or completely removed from the Barrow Island oils by water washing. However, hydrocarbons with lower water solubility were either not affected by water washing, or water washing had only a minor effect. There are three main controls on the susceptibility to biodegradation of cyclic, branched and aromatic low molecular weight hydrocarbons: carbon skeleton, degree of alkylation, and position of alkylation. Firstly, ring preference ratios at C₆ and C₇ show that isoalkanes are retained preferentially relative to alkylcyclohexanes, and to some extent alkylcyclopentanes. Dimethylpentanes are substantially more resistant to biodegradation than most dimethylcyclopentanes, but methylhexanes are depleted faster than methylpentanes and dimethylcyclopentanes. For C₈ and C₉ hydrocarbons, alkylcyclohexanes are more resistant to biodegradation than linear alkanes. Secondly, there is a trend of lower susceptibility to biodegradation with greater alkyl substitution for isoalkanes, alkylcyclohexanes, alkylcyclopentanes and alkylbenzenes. Thirdly, the position of alkylation has a strong control, with adjacent methyl groups reducing the susceptibility of an isomer to biodegradation. 1, 2, 3 -Trimethylbenzene is the most resistant of the C₃ alkylbenzene isomers during moderate biodegradation. 2 -Methylalkanes are the most susceptible branched alkanes to biodegradation, 3 -methylalkanes are the most resistant and 4 -methylalkanes have intermediate resistance. Therefore, terminal methyl groups are more prone to bacterial attack compared to mid-chain isomers, and C₃ carbon chains are more readily utilised than C₂ carbon chains. 1, 1 -Dimethylcyclopentane and 1, 1 -dimethylcyclohexane are the most resistant of the alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes to biodegradation. The <b>straight-chained</b> and branched C₅–C₉ alkanes are isotopically light (depleted in ¹³C) relative to cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of biodegradation consistently lead to enrichment in ¹³C for each remaining hydrocarbon, due to preferential removal of ¹²C. Differences in the rates of biodegradation of low molecular weight hydrocarbons shown by compositional data are also reflected in the level of enrichment in ¹³C. The carbon isotopic effects of biodegradation show a decreasing level of isotopic enrichments in ¹³C with increasing molecular weight. This suggests that the kinetic isotope effect associated with biodegradation is site-specific and often related to a terminal carbon, where its impact on the isotopic composition becomes progressively ‘diluted’ with increasing carbon number. 25 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of the work {{presented}} in this Thesis involved a major re-evaluation of detailed chemical kinetic models describing alkane oxidation under combustion conditions. Combined experimental and theoretical approaches have been undertaken in order to, as comprehensively as practically possible, elucidate the mechanistic pathways of oxidation, {{as well as to}} refine numerical values of the fundamental thermochemical kinetic parameters which underpin their description. This was achieved via a broad experimental campaign investigating the oxidation of the pentane isomers (n-, iso-, and neo-pentane), which comprise sufficient structural diversity to be representative of the majority of alkanes. Experimental data were obtained for n-pentane in the high-pressure shock tubes at both NUI Galway and Texas A&M University, one of the twin-opposed piston rapid compression machines at NUI Galway, the atmospheric pressure jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Nancy, and the high-pressure JSR at CNRS OrlÃ©ans. Pressures of approximately 1 â 20 atm, at temperatures in the range 500 â 1555 K, at equivalence ratios of 0. 3 â 2. 0, and for dilutions in the range 75 â 99 %, have been investigated. For the branched isomers, ignition delay times have been obtained in the aforementioned shock tube and rapid compression machine facilities under similar conditions to the <b>straight-chained</b> counterpart, with pressure, temperature, equivalence ratio, and dilution ranges of approximately 1 â 20 atm, 650 â 1720 K, 0. 3 â 2. 0, and 75 â 99 %, respectively, investigated. These data, alongside literature measurements, served as validation targets for an updated model describing pentane isomer oxidation. Previous models developed in this laboratory describing their oxidation were updated in terms of their level of mechanistic detail, and in their numerical description of the thermochemical kinetic properties of the species and reactions therein. Thermodynamic properties of species pertinent to pentane oxidation were updated based on group additivity values which were recently derived in this laboratory. This was followed by a literature review, conducted as part of this work, of kinetic rate parameters for reactions which are important for describing alkane oxidation under low-temperature conditions (~ 600 â 900 K). New recommendations for rate coefficients are made for each important reaction class within the typical low-temperature alkane oxidation scheme. Further refinement of kinetic parameters was undertaken due to experimental and modelling evidence of deficiencies in literature values for an important low-temperature reaction class: cyclisation of hydroperoxyl-alkyl radical to form a cyclic ether and a hydroxyl radical ("Q" ÌOOH â cyclic ether + È®H). Rate coefficients for 43 examples of this reaction type involving species ranging in size from C 2 H 5 O 2 to C 5 H 11 O 2 were determined using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio approaches. Geometries and ro-vibrational properties were determined using the M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory, with single point energies computed using coupled cluster [specifically, CCSD(T) ] and second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP 2) methods, with relatively large basis sets (cc-pVXZ, where X = D,T,Q). Standard statistical thermodynamics and canonical transition state theory were employed to derive the kinetic data of interest. The use of these new rate coefficients in the pentane oxidation model produces favourable agreement with C 5 cyclic ether concentration measurements in the JSRs at Nancy and OrlÃ©ans. These had previously been over-predicted by the model utilising literature rate coefficient values. The combined experimental, modelling, and quantum chemical approaches have led to a comprehensively validated model describing n-pentane oxidation, along with models which can accurately describe the ignition properties of iso- and neo-pentane. Furthermore, by updating recommendations for mechanism development, and for assignment of model parameter values, the findings of this work have influenced model development for alkanes from C 3 upwards. Thermodynamic properties [H(T), S(T), and Cp(T) ] of nitrogen-containing compounds pertaining to NOx formation mechanisms have been calculated using DFT and ab initio methods. The CBS-APNO, G 3, and G 4 composite methods were utilised to compute formation enthalpies via the atomisation method. The average values computed by these three methods were previously found to yield results rivalling âchemical accuracyâ (arbitrarily, 4. 184 kJ molâ 1, or 1 kcal molâ 1) when tested against a benchmark set of enthalpy of formation values. The effect of vibrational anharmonicities on the thermodynamic properties of the selected compounds was also investigated. The result is a comprehensive database of thermodynamic functions of species relevant to NOx formation, which will underpin subsequent kinetic studies of NOx chemistry. The studies conducted over the course of this work provide valuable information on the combustion chemistry and kinetic modelling of species ubiquitous in gas turbine and reciprocating engine environments...|$|E

Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where {{there is an important}} difference in properties between the <b>straight-chain</b> and branched-chain isomers, e.g., n-hexane or 2- or 3-methylpentane. Alternative names for this group are: linear paraffins or n-paraffins.|$|R
50|$|The {{aldehyde}} or ketone {{group of}} a <b>straight-chain</b> monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group {{on a different}} carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal, forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and pyranose forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the <b>straight-chain</b> form.|$|R
