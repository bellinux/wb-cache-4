50|$|Extreme {{care must}} be taken in the {{management}} and disposal of sharps waste. The goal in sharps waste management is to safely handle all materials until they can be properly disposed. The final step in the disposal of sharps waste is to dispose of them in an autoclave. A less common approach is to incinerate them; typically only chemotherapy sharps waste is incinerated. Steps must be taken along the way to minimize the risk of injury from this material, while maximizing the amount of sharps material disposed.

30|$|Before {{measuring}} the porosity, the cement hydration of all samples were ceased by applying a solvent exchange procedure that was by replacing water inside the cement samples {{as suggested by}} Zhang et al. (2009). For samples at atmospheric condition, placing those samples into 1 inch ×  1 inch cylinder rubber jacket was the curing process. Another sample conditioning was performed in the HPHT curing chamber containing a sample cell with a dimension of 1  inch ×  1  inch ×  1  inch. The curing durations were set to around 5, 10, 16 and 24  h for each scheduled samples. The samples for each curing period of about 4 – 8  g were rinsed in a 100 -ml acetone in the <b>sealable</b> <b>container</b> and shaken vigorously. The solvent was renewed regularly 2 – 3 times during the first 24  h and repeated about once per day for the rest 2  days. After soaking in acetone and before conducting porosity measurement, the samples were placed into a drying oven at 80  °C for 24  h. Three measurements were made for each sample condition to ensure data reproducibility, and by averaging these measurements, the final result was then calculated.|$|E
40|$|NASA's Resource Prospector (RP) mission {{intends to}} visit a lunar polar region to {{characterize}} the volatile distribution. Part of the RP payload, the Near-infrared Volatile Spectrometer System (NIRVSS) is a spectrometer operating from 1600 - 3400 nm that provides sensitivity to water ice, and other volatiles. For multiple years, the NIRVSS system has been incorporated into on-going RP payload testing in a cryogenic vacuum facility at Glenn Research Center. Soil tubes of lunar simulants, prepared with known amounts of water, are placed in the vacuum chamber and cooled to cryogenic temperatures (soil temperatures of 110 - 170 K) and placed under low vacuum (a few x 10 (exp - 6) Torr). During these tests NIRVSS continuously measures spectra of soil cuttings emplaced onto the surface by a drill. Real time processing of NIRVSS spectra produces two spectral parameters associated with water ice absorption features near 2000 and 3000 nm {{that can be used}} to inform decision making activities such as delivery of the soil to a <b>sealable</b> <b>container.</b> Post-test collection and analyses of the soils permit characterization the water content as a function of depth. These water content profiles exhibit the characteristics of a vacuum desiccation zone to depths of about 40 cm. Subsequent to completion of the tests, NIRVSS spectra are processed to produce two spectral parameters associated with water ice absorption features near 2000 and 3000 nm. These features can be evaluated as a function of time, and correlated with drill depth, and other measurements, throughout the drilling activities. Until now no effort was attempted to quantitatively relate these parameters to water abundance. This is the focus of our efforts to be presented...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 80 % of all seed used by farmers in the tropics is derived from stocks held on-farm from previous seasons. If yields are to be sustained and even increased {{it is essential that}} seed storage is of a consistently high standard. Good quality seed is central to productive agriculture. Poor planting material results in poor field establishment and ultimately poor yields, irrespective of subsequent inputs. Farmers choose to maintain their own seed stocks for a variety of reasons: the formal seed sector cannot, or does not, provide those varieties which farmers prize; the cost of buying fresh seed of 'improved' varieties on a regular basis is prohibitive; and because it appears that farmer selection of seed stocks often allows maintenance of yield levels under small-scale conditions. Because of the relatively small quantities involved and because sorting and planting are done by hand, farmers can select the largest seeds and those that are free of insect and mould attack, thereby ensuring plant-seeds with maximal vigour. Despite this preponderance of farmer-held material, very little attention has been directed towards assisting farmers in maintaining their seed stocks in the best possible condition. Grain stored for food and grain held as seed face many of the same problems, such as insect and rodent infestation and mould attack, and hence many lessons learnt from experience with grain storage {{can be applied to the}} seed situation. However, food grain seeds are only useful if they remain viable. Since seeds are more sensitive to the effects of temperature and humidity than food grain stocks, they need to be handled with additional care in order to maintain their germination potential. Agricultural development programmes that have a seed component often start with the premise that on-farm storage of seed must necessarily be inadequate and in need of improvement. These assumptions are rarely supported with survey or experimental data and their validity needs to be questioned. Indigenous knowledge With increasing appreciation of indigenous technical knowledge some studies have been undertaken to document farmer seed-saving practices. These studies show that farmers actively select planting material which they may then handle and treat in a different way to their food grain. In Zimbabwe detailed qualitative studies show clearly that farmers have an extensive understanding of techniques which maximize seed performance. Such documentation of farmer practices is extremely useful but it is also important that some quantitative measure of success can be attributed to the various techniques. The organization Seeds of Survival working in central Ethiopia has, from preliminary data, established that germination levels of farm saved seed, from a variety of crops, was above 70 % after six months storage in 85 % of their samples. These findings are supported by a more extensive survey undertaken by staff of the Natural Resources Institute, UK, with collaborating national institutes in Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania. A total of 1, 859 samples of five important crops were taken from farmers' seed stocks and assessed for germination potential just prior to planting. Maize, cowpeas and soya showed mean germination levels of above 75 % whilst beans and groundnut were less consistent, though still good. Until now, these quantitative studies have been carried out in countries or regions where the climate is conducive to successful seed storage, having significant dry seasons during which seeds can be conditioned before being placed in store. Whether or not farmer techniques are equally successful under hot humid conditions has yet to be established. In terms of volume, farmer seed requirements are often small. This means that farmers can invest more time, effort and care into the maintenance of seed quality than would be practicable for food grain stocks. Often this simply means using a <b>sealable</b> <b>container</b> to prevent insect attack. Alternatively, farmers apply traditional or insecticidal admixtures to control or prevent insect infestation. For example, some farmers in northern Ghana mix their cowpea seeds with shea nut oil, which appears to have an excellent repellent effect on bean bruchids. Other farmers, who store their maize seeds as suspended cobs, cover them with plastic sheeting or gourd shards as rat guards. These farmer initiatives are often very localized, despite being useful components of a seed storage strategy. Further studies would allow extension staff to decide which of these indigenous practices could usefully be more widely advertised. In addition, strategies that already have proven advantages but which are not universally adopted, should be promoted: for example, the selection of maize seed at harvest rather than just before the following planting season. Is change necessary? In the areas investigated it seems unlikely that at the farmer level, seed storage practices need to be drastically altered. Farmer techniques work sufficiently well and the only rationale for a radical change m storage practices would be if some major external change took place. This could include declining availability of traditional materials used as admixtures such as botanical insecticides because of over-cropping, unusual weather patterns, or the appearance of a novel pest against which traditional measures are ineffective (e. g. larger grain borer). It is clear that in zones that have a climate suited to seed storage, farmers are frequently very accomplished at E maintaining the viability of their own seed stocks. The techniques employed, which may have evolved over considerable periods of time, are usually well adapted to the farming. system in which they are used. However, there is room for improvement to many of the current practices through farmers learning from each other. Change can be brought about through awareness activities. This could take several forms, such as direct advice or through information exchanges, allowing farmers to become aware of techniques used successfully in other areas of the country. In this respect researchers and extension staff are most suited to act in the role of facilitators through the establishment of 'best practices' from among the range of techniques available, supporting farmer-based technologies and only offering totally new practices where the local systems can be shown to be failing. It {{is estimated}} that 80 % of all seed used by farmers in the tropics is derived from stocks held on-farm from previous seasons. If yields are to be sustained and even increased it is essential that seed storage is of a consistently high standard [...] . ...|$|E

50|$|A {{terrarium}} (plural: terraria or terrariums) {{is usually}} a <b>sealable</b> glass <b>container</b> containing soil and plants, and can be opened for maintenance to access the plants inside. However, terraria can also {{be open to the}} atmosphere rather than being sealed. Terraria are often kept as decorative or ornamental items. Closed terraria create a unique environment for plant growth, as the transparent walls allow for both heat and light to enter the terrarium. The sealed container combined with the heat entering the terrarium allows {{for the creation of a}} small scale water cycle. This happens because moisture from both the soil and plants evaporates in the elevated temperatures inside the terrarium. This water vapour then condenses on the walls of the container, and eventually falls back to the plants and soil below. This contributes to creating an ideal environment for growing plants due to the constant supply of water, thereby preventing the plants from becoming over dry. In addition to this, the light that passes through the transparent material of the terrarium allows for the plants within to photosynthesize, an important aspect of plant growth.|$|R
