The WTA circuit {{is based on}} a winner follower and wide-range transconductance amplifiers. The voltage based design uses capacitive storage for low power consumption. The circuit is modularized and its layout size is a linear function of the number of inputs. This makes the circuit easy to be implemented <b>in</b> VLSI circuit. <b>The</b> circuit’s processing speed is accelerated by wide-range transconductance amplifiers which offer an extraordinary signal gain.
