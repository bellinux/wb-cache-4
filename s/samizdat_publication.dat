40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the production of}} the Czechoslovak samizdat "edition" of the 70 's and 80 's of the 20 th century. It focuses mainly on textual and editorial care given to samizdat typescripts. The first part describes the samizdat self-reflection in the articles from the typewritten periodical Kritický sborník from the 80 's. The second part engages in samizdat Edice Expedice and examines how its production was processed by publishers under publishing conditions after the year 1989. It analyzes mainly two aspects - handling with samizdat sources described in editorial comments, possibly what it means for the textual quality of <b>samizdat</b> <b>publications,</b> and if the authentic literary historical context of the works is properly conveyed in the new published books.

Summaries of the Information Bulletins were published in the key <b>samizdat</b> <b>publication,</b> A Chronicle of Current Events. The Information Bulletins were sent to the Soviet officials, with request to verify the data and notify the Commission if mistakes were found, and to the West, where human rights defenders used them {{in the course of their}} campaigns.

40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} roots of the {{transformation}} thought in <b>samizdat</b> <b>publications</b> of the Czech dissent. Although nearly twenty years have passed since Communism collapsed and the ideas in question became relevant, there is still a lack of knowledge about the subject. In order to fill in this gap, the thesis provides the reader with a literature review, summarizing and evaluating the sources of various types (e. g., articles in samizdat periodicals, samizdat books), and with background information (e. g., the identity of authors publishing under pseudonyms) obtained by interviewing contemporaries. Of special importance is the work of Zdislav Šulc who, owing to his chef-d'oeuvre, the Government and Economics, emerges from this study as the central figure of the Czech samizdat economic literature.
