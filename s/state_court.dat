5|$|The {{court is}} {{composed}} of seven elected justices, each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election. Justices, like other Oregon <b>state</b> <b>court</b> judges, must be United States citizens, Oregon residents {{for at least three}} years, and lawyers admitted to practice in the state of Oregon. The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed “the broom closet”) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted.

To retain that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election.|$|E
5|$|Three {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} asserting that Trump University {{engaged in a}} variety of illegal business practices, ranging from false claims to racketeering.

A third case was filed in New York <b>State</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court.

Instead, the note supported the <b>state</b> <b>court</b> who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the <b>state</b> <b>court</b> of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the <b>state</b> <b>court</b> of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the <b>state</b> <b>court</b> did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in the case, and that the court lacked jurisdiction.

40|$|Since {{national}} scholars {{believe that}} <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> have not {{played a significant}} role in the development of CIL, they have asserted that leaving questions of CIL to parochial <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> invites chaos; <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> would develop conflicting rules of CIL and impermissibly interfere in matters of foreign relations. Because this critique of the revisionist position depends in great part on the validity of their understanding of the historical role of <b>state</b> <b>courts,</b> it is surprising that there is almost no commentary examining the historical foundations of these assumptions. This article seeks to fill this gap by describing the historical role of <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> in the interpretation and development of CIL in the American legal system. It aims to test the validity of nationalist claims about the role of <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> against the historical and doctrinal record of <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> applying CIL. While I do not purport to offer a definitive historical account, my discussion of the role of <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> in the application of CIL reveals that, at the very least, the revisionist understanding of how CIL has been incorporated into American law has far greater plausibility than nationalist critics have admitted...|$|R

5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a <b>state</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim.

Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. <b>State</b> <b>court</b> Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
