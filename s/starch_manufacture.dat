40|$|Mixed-mode {{chromatography}} is a chromatographic {{method in}} protein purification that utilizes {{more than one}} form of interactions between the stationary phase and the solutes. As being advantageous over other types of adsorption chromatography it has better salt-tolerant adsorption, unique selectivity, and facile elution by charge repulsion. Potato fruit juice (PFJ) is a by-product from industrial <b>starch</b> <b>manufacture</b> and contains several proteins such as patatin, protease inhibitors and others. Several protease inhibitors (Kunitz-type inhibitors, Potato protease inhibitors I and II, potato cysteine etc.) are ubiquitous and they account for 1 - 10 % of the total protein. Potato proteins, especially the protease inhibitors are a potential resource of proteins for potential pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. Recent advances in the isolation of major proteins from industrial potato fruit juice (PFJ) using novel chromatographic resins are opening new possibilities to develop value-added proteins. The aim {{of the work that}} has been presented in this thesis was to separate potato protease inhibitors using mixed mode chromatography and try to understand the aspect of interactions between a cationic mixed-mode (MMC) ligand and proteins via bioinformatics tools. The protease inhibitor fraction was isolated from industrial PFJ by acidification and removal of precipitated patatin, before being loaded onto Capto MMC HiTrap-columns (1 ml and 5 ml). The ÄKTA Pure chromatography platform (GE Healthcare) was used in all of the experiments. The effects of pH and conductivity on the adsorption behavior of PIs from clarified and acid treated PFJ (CAP) properties have been investigated. For protein elution pH-shift, different salts (NaCl, NH 4 Cl) and mobile phase modifiers (arginine, guanidine, lysine) were used to investigate the binding behavior of protease inhibitors such as hydrophobic interaction, repulsion etc. Responses were measured as eluted peak area (EPA) and by use of a trypsin inhibitor assay (TIA). The statistical methods used in experimental design were one-way and multi linear regression analysis (Design of Experiments). To predict the protein structure and surface characterization different bioinformatics servers (NCBI, PDB) and tools (BLAST, Phyre 2) were used. Maximum binding capacity of protease inhibitors on Capto MMC occurs at CAP sample pH 4. 3 and column buffer pH at 5. 5 - 6. 0, and at conductivity ranges 10. 0 - 11. 5 mS/cm. The molecular weight of adsorbed PIs was in the range 3 - 22 kDa. Results indicated that optimal binding capacity for PIs on Capto Hi-Trap MMC happens at precipitation pH 4. 3. The effects of column pH, sample conductivity, sample load and their interaction were significant. Of the mobile modifiers, arginine acted to weaken electrostatic interactions by increasing the dielectric constant; this would lead to a uniform decrease in retention. An increased concentration (0. 1 M) of arginine showed that more recovery of aggregated protein especially protease inhibitors II group and PCPI (20 kDa). By predicting protein surface revealed that mixed mode resin could be recognizing different hydrophobic surface features exposed on the protease inhibitors. Last but not least, it has done to separate protease inhibitors by multimode chromatography and different condition effects can understand to binding behaviors of protein and further also suggested chemical interaction of these protease inhibitors should be studied...|$|E

40|$|Starches {{isolated}} from 3 Chinese sweet potato varieties (XuShu 18, SuShu 2, and SuShu 8) differed in granule size and {{particle size distribution}} {{as well as in}} protein, lipid and phosphorus contents but the amylose contents were similar for these starches (19. 3 - 20. 0 %). The pasting behavior, swelling pattern, and syneresis properties were investigated and found to vary. On comparison, the physicochemical properties of the sweet potato starches rather differ from those of potato and mung bean starches. The quality of the starch noodle made from SuShu 8 starch was well comparable to that made from mung bean starch, and better than that made from SuShu 2 and XuShu 18 starches as evaluated by both instrumental and sensory analysis. Correlation between starch noodle quality and gel properties of the original starches was established {{in order to be able}} to predict the suitability of a starch for <b>starch</b> noodle <b>manufacture.</b> It was found that differently sized granule fractions showed a difference in ash, amylose and phosphorus content, as well as in gel firmness and freeze-thaw stability. The small size (< 20 µm) granule fractions were found to be more suitable for starch noodle making and the qualities of both dried and cooked starch noodles made from these fractions were significantly better than those made from their original starches and much better than those made from the large size granule fractions. Sweet potato and potato starches and their derivatives (acetylated and hydroxypropylated) were also evaluated for the ability to manufacture high quality White Salted Noodle (WSN) by replacing the commonly used wheat flour up to 20 %. It was found that only the use of acetylated starches could significantly improve WSN quality resulting in decreasing cooking loss, and increasing softness, stretchability and slipperiness. The cold peak breakdown (CPBD) of the composite flour, as measured in 1. 5 % NaCl solution, showed a significant correlation with the cooking loss, stretch stiffness and stretchability of WSN. Moreover, acetylated starch from potato and sweet potatoes were studied with respect to the degree of substitution (DS) and acetyl group distribution in differently sized granule fractions. The DS of the fractionated starches increased with decreasing starch granule size dimension. The DS of the amylopectin populations of differently sized granule fractions showed the same trends as the original starches, while the DS of the amylose populations were quite constant. It was confirmed that the acetylation only occurred in the outer lamellae of the crystalline region, but took place in all amorphous regions of starch granules.

Variations in product quality caused by grits from different hybrids and grain hardness {{have not been}} investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between rheological properties of the extrudate melt and the operating conditions in the extruder is not fully understood. Appropriate methods to determine com grain hardness to characterise com hybrids and the on-line viscosity of the extrudate melts {{have not yet been}} developed. These methods could provide sound and appropriate techniques to investigate the areas of milling and extrusion of com based food products. In this study, milling characteristics of 38 com hybrids from the 92 - 93 season and 12 com hybrids from the 94 - 95 season produced in New Zealand were studied. A modified Stenvert Hardness Test (SHT) using new parameters including milling energy and milling resistance time was developed. It was found that the modified SHT was simple and easy to use with low variability. The SHT milling energy can be used as an effective hardness index. It increased with grain bulk density and the ratio of hard to soft endosperm. All measured properties were highly dependent on the moisture content. For the same hybrid, SHT hardness increased and the grain bulk density decreased when the moisture content of the com grains increased. A roller-milling test was also developed to study the dry milling characteristics of these com hybrids. During milling, the breaking force measured in the roller-milling test increased with grain hardness. Analysis of particle size distributions in the ground samples after the modified Stenvert Hardness tests and the roller-milling tests showed that grit recovery rate increased with the grain hardness. Grits produced from hybrids harvested in the 92 - 93 and the 94 - 95 seasons, along with other grits and <b>starches</b> commercially <b>manufactured</b> in New Zealand, were used for the extrusion experiments. A new Slit-Die-Viscometer (SDV) was developed to measure the viscosity of extrudate melts on-line. Unlike many other viscometers used on-line, the operation of the new SDV did not interfere with the operating conditions of the extruder. The rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation were affected by the operating conditions of the extruder and the characteristics of the raw materials: It was found that the melt viscosity decreased as moisture content increased. The apparent viscosity had a maximum value at barrel temperature of about 130 DC, changed very little when screw speed increased at constant feed, and decreased slightly when the feed increased at constant screw speed. The grits were less gelatinised at high moisture content. The degree of starch gelatinisation increased slightly with screw speed and linearly with barrel temperature between 90 DC and 130 DC. At barrel temperatures higher than 130 DC, the extrudate was almost fully gelatinised. Melts produced with starch of high amylopectin content had an overall lower viscosity with less shear thinning and a higher degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with starch of high amylose content. Grit size affected the rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation. Melts produced from medium and coarse grits had a lower viscosity and a lower degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with fine grits. The effect of different hybrids of the same season on the rheological properties of the melt was negligible. However, the rheological properties were affected by the methods used to produce the grits. Grits from degermed grains had less oil and produced melts with lower viscosity and less shear thinning than grits from whole grains (higher oil content) ...|$|R

Modifications of starch are usually performed to alter gelling temperature and viscosity of starches or to increase its resistance to shear, low pH, high temperature and retrograding. Chemical modification is performed either by substitution of free hydroxyl-groups in the glucose units or by degradation of the starch chain. The most common chemical substitutions that is used for food applications today is a combination of cross-links with multi functional substituents and stabilizing modifications such as acetylating or hydroxypropylation.

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) {{has been}} grown in India {{for more than}} a century. Although cassava {{breeding}} was initiated during the 1940 s in Kerala, intensive research on breeding of superior varieties began only after the establishment of the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI) in 1963 in Trivandrum, Kerala. The Institute has an immense wealth of cassava germplasm, both indigenous and exotic. Nine superior varieties were released by CTCRI, three of them developed by selection, five by intervarietal hybridization and one by triploidy breeding. The high yielding hybrids not only increased cassava cultivation but also spread the crop outside Kerala. At present cassava is cultivated in 12 states and two union territories of the country, but the major producer is Kerala followed by the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The hybrids H- 226 and H- 165 are the most popular varieties in the industrial areas of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, but the recently released triploid hybrid ‘Sree Harsha’, with its high yield, high starch and good culinary quality, holds great potential for both industrial use and human consumption. The three short-duration varieties are highly preferred by farmers as a rotation crop in the paddy-based cropping system. Very recently, two superior top-cross hybrids, having high yield and good culinary quality, were developed from in breds and are ready for formal release. In recent years the spread of cassava outside Kerala has been quite substantial. In Tamil Nadu and Andra Pradesh, where cassava is mainly used as an industrial crop for <b>starch</b> and sago <b>manufacture,</b> cassava area and production are expanding. In the northeastern states, where it is used mainly as a food crop, cultivation is also gradually increasing. In non-traditional areas of central India, the crop is being introduced through the true seed program. Nevertheless, the total area and production of cassava in India is declining, especially in Kerala, due to the prominence gained by plantation crops like rubber, black pepper, coffee etc. which provide more cash income. Therefore, the future increase in cassava production seems possible only by increasing the productivity in the existing areas of cultivation, expanding its adoption in different cropping systems and introducing the crop to new, non-traditional areas. To fulfil this goal, a new challenge in cassava breeding would be the development of gene pools with adaptation to the main biological and physical environmental stresses, development of varieties having resistance to CMD and red mite as well as drought tolerance, the nutritional improvement of cassava roots by protein enrichment, as well as the development of high-yielding, high-starch and high eating-quality hybrids, which will be acceptable to farmers, processors and consumers. Among the conventional breeding techniques, triploidy and top crossing are probably better tools for this. However, biotechnological approaches through gene transfer might tackle the challenges in a shorter time, but this will require coordinated research efforts among international and national agricultural institutions...|$|R
40|$|Cassava is an {{important}} food security crop among smallholder farmers in Southern Nigeria, because it can tolerate drought, low soil fertility and its production requires minimum external inputs. In most African countries, cassava is becoming important cash crop that has high potential for use as an industrial raw material to <b>manufacture</b> <b>starch</b> and flour. The use of cassava flour in confectionery industries recently in Nigeria is new and fast gaining ground. One major constraint faced by the cassava industrial sector is inadequate supply of raw material to boast the industry. This {{has been attributed to}} poor yield and harvest from farmers’ field, due to several and interrelated factors. Most significant of these factors is lack of large-scale adoption and cultivation of improved cassava varieties. Various constraints have militated against the widespread adoption of improved cassava varieties, with effect evidenced in the poor supply of raw material need of cassava based agro-processors. This study examined these factors in eight States of Southern Nigeria, using the probit model. Sixty-eight cassava farmers from the eight project states were randomly selected using a multistage random sampling procedure during 2008 / 2009 planting season. Results of the study showed that 23. 5 % of the respondents were females, while majorities (76. 5 %) were male. Only about 46 % of the farmers were in their productive years (21 - 50 years), while the majority (54. 0 %) consisted of those who were > 50 years. The average of the farmers was about 50 years, with more than 50 % having greater than 15 years farming experience. About 59 % of the respondents were basically small-holder farmers with farm size less than one hectare; while 41 % had farm size between 1 and ≥ 5 ha. Of the 68 respondents, majority (60 %) farm on family land, while 40 % of them were leaseholders. Land use practices varied among the farmers. Results indicated that 73 % of 68 farmers who responded adopted fair land use practices while 16 % observed good land use practices. However, about 11 % of the respondents maintained a poor land use practice. The results of this study also showed that 66 % of the farmers adopted improved cassava variety, either solely or in combination with local varieties; while about 34 % of the farmers still rely on their local variety. However, less than 30 % of the farmers using improved variety adopted improved crop management practices. Yield from the farmers’ field averaged 13. 6 ton ha- 1. The study also observed that 68 % of the cassava roots sold for family income, were sold at the farm-gate, village and urban markets, and seldom to the agroprocessors; while 32 % were reserved for household consumption. The coefficient for gender, cassava yield and farming experience were positivelyrelated to adoption of improved varieties. However, gender and yield had a significant relationship at 5 % level of probability, while years of farming experience was not significant at 5 % but at 10 % level. Land ownership on the other hand had negative effect, significant at 5 % level of probability. Implicit in these results is that farming experience and level of yield obtained may determine a farmer’s willingness to commercially adopt improved variety. Similarly, the profitability arising from increased yield from improved variety may prompt more farmers to adopt and hence expand their holding and land use, with more leaseholder of land increasing.
