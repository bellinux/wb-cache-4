25|$|Among {{the most}} {{accurate}} tuning devices, strobe tuners work differently than regular electronic tuners. They are stroboscopes that flicker a light at the same frequency as the note. The light shines on a wheel that spins at a precise speed. The interaction of the light and regularly-spaced marks on the wheel creates a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effect</b> that makes the marks for a particular pitch appear to stand still when the pitch is in tune. These can tune instruments and audio devices more accurately than most non-strobe tuners. However, mechanical strobe units are expensive and delicate, and their moving parts require periodic servicing, so they are used mainly in applications that require higher precision, such as by professional instrument makers and repair experts.|$|E

In a laboratory study, participants reported whether they could detect <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effects</b> from flickering light with a range of frequencies and percent flicker values, and if detected, whether it was acceptable.

2500|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} usually {{supply power}} to the lamp at a frequency of [...] or higher, rather than the mains frequency of this substantially eliminates the <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effect</b> of flicker, {{a product of the}} line frequency associated with fluorescent lighting (see photosensitive epilepsy). The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent lamps using a {{magnetic}} power line frequency ballast {{do not give}} out a steady light; instead, they flicker at twice the supply frequency.

Even among persons not sensitive to light flicker, a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effect</b> can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp.

This variation was suggested by several inventors including Étienne-Jules Marey, who in 1887 used a large zoetrope to animate a series of plaster models based on his chronophotographs of birds in flight. Modern equivalents normally dispense with the slitted drum and instead use a rapidly flashing strobe light to illuminate the models, producing much clearer and sharper distortion-free results. The models are mounted on a rotating base and the light flashes on and off within an extremely small {{fraction of a second}} as each successive model passes the same spot. The <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effect</b> makes each seem to be a single animated object. By allowing the rotation speed to be slightly out of synchronization with the strobe, the animated objects can be made to appear to also move slowly forwards or backwards, according to how much faster or slower each rotation is than the corresponding series of strobe flashes.|$|E

50|$|By comparison, {{incandescent}} lamps have a brief warm-up when energized, {{followed by a}} cool-down period when power is removed. These delays result in smearing and blurring of detail of objects partially illuminated during the warm-up and cool-down periods.

25|$|Frame rate: High frame rates (i.e. images {{acquired}} per second) {{are needed}} to visualize fast motion without <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effects.</b> However, the higher the frame rate, the higher the radiation dose. Therefore, the frame rate should be chosen according to the clinical need and be as low as reasonably possible. For example, in pediatric cardiology, frame rates of 60 pulses per second are required compared to 0.5 p/s for slowly moving objects. A reduction to half pulse rate reduces dose by about half. The reduction from 30 p/s to 7.5 p/s results in a dose saving of 75%.|$|R
2500|$|Mechanical disc strobe tuners are expensive, bulky, delicate, {{and require}} {{periodic}} maintenance (keeping the motor that spins the disc at the correct speed, replacing the strobing LED backlight, etc.). For many, a mechanical strobe tuner {{is simply not}} practical for one {{or all of the}} above reasons. To address these issues, in 2001 Peterson Tuners added a line of non-mechanical electronic strobe tuners that have LCD dot-matrix displays mimicking a mechanical strobe disc display, giving a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effect.</b> In 2004 Peterson made a model of LCD strobe in a sturdy floor based [...] "stomp box" [...] for live on-stage use. Virtual strobe tuners are as accurate as standard mechanical disc strobe tuners. However, there are limitations to the virtual system compared to the disc strobes. Virtual strobes display fewer bands to read note information, and do not pick up harmonic partials like a disc strobe. Rather, each band on a virtual strobe represents octaves of the fundamental. A disc strobe provides [...] "one band correspondence"—each band displays a particular frequency of the note being played. On the virtual strobe system, each band combines a few close frequencies for easier reading on the LCD. This is still extremely accurate for intoning and tuning most instruments—but, as of this writing, no virtual strobe tuner provides detailed information on partials.|$|E

We show that, up to 12 000 cm- 1, CS 2 can be described by a system of two degrees of freedom strongly coupled by a 1 : 2 type Fermi resonance. The corresponding vibrational spectra are refitted with the aid of only seven parameters. Analysis of the spectra by the statistical Fourier transform technique reveals <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effects</b> between the symmetric stretching mode and the bending mode. The distinction between the ``stroboscopic hole'' due to these effects and the ``correlation hole'' due to nonintegrable terms in the Hamiltonian is discussed in detail. The study of the topology of the phase space of CS 2 in the regular and chaotic cases is carried out in the basis described by a vibrational angular momentum which includes the Fermi resonance. We show the analogy between the localization of the wave packets of the eigenstates and the trajectories. We also show the destabilization of the trajectories due to a term in the Hamiltonian which couples neighboring polyads and which is a second Fermi resonance.

40|$|LED lighting, as the {{fourth-generation}} lighting technology, {{is developing}} rapidly {{over the past}} years due to its high energy efficiency, longer life span and sustainability compared to incandescent light bulbs and CFLs. Today’s stand-alone LED drivers for professional lighting systems contain two cascaded power converters: an input and an output power stage. The output power stage drives the LED load with constant average current to achieve a uniform light output without visible light flicker and <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>effects.</b> The input power stage is a boost converter which acts as a power factor corrector (PFC), providing to the mains a power factor (PF) of at least 0. 9 and a constant average supply voltage to the output power stage. In high-end LED drivers, both the boost PFC converter as well as the converter in the output power stage are digitally controlled by a PI controller. The PFC controller currently being used has a low bandwidth as to not interfere with the power factor correction function. Because of this low bandwidth, disturbance from mains and load will be transferred to the boost PFC output capacitor, which, on its turn, can lead to undesired visible light effects if these disturbances are too large. The thesis aims at improving the dynamic response of the boost PFC converter without sacrificing PF/THD performance. Three solutions: 1. Digital notch/comb filter 2. Input voltage feedforward 3. Variable gain are proposed and investigated in detail. Simulation result for each solution shows improved dynamic response to both mains and load disturbances. Four criteria are applied to evaluate the 3 proposed methods. Finally system with notch filter is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed design. The experimental result shows improved dynamic response to both mains and load disturbances, as well as improved THD performance.

40|$|In the Pulfrich effect, an {{illusion}} of depth is produced by introducing differences in the times at which a moving object is presented to the two eyes. In the classic form of the illusion, there is a simple explanation for the depth percept: the interocular delay introduces a spatial disparity into the stimulus. However, when the moving object is viewed stroboscopically, this simple explanation no longer holds. In recent years, depth perception in the <b>stroboscopic</b> Pulfrich <b>effect</b> has been explained by invoking neurons that are sensitive both to stereo disparity and to direction of motion. With such joint motion/disparity encoders, interocular delay causes a perception of depth by causing a shift in each neuron’s preferred disparity. This model has been implemented by N. Qian and R. A. Andersen (1997). Here we show that this model's predictions for perceived disparity are quantitatively at odds with psychophysical measures. The joint-encoding model predicts that the perceived disparity is the virtual disparity implied by the apparent motion; in fact, the perceived disparity is smaller. We show that the percept can be quantitatively explained {{on the basis of}} spatial disparities present in the stimulus, which could be extracted from pure disparity sensors.

40|$|In the 1960 s, as {{the styles}} of {{counterculture}} psychedelia {{came to be}} incorporated into many parts of mainstream visual culture including advertising, what remained of its initial liberatory promise? In album cover design, light shows, and psychedelic artwork these visual vocabularies of typically hallucinatory experiences were the counterpart to contemporary music, both experimental and popular, that used electronic guitar and vocal effects, as well as tape loops and early synthesizers, to generate sonic qualities evoking the effects of hallucinogens. At the same time, popular and underground music samples were being used by experimental and commercial film, like Bruce Conner’s Looking for Mushrooms, Dennis Hopper’s Easy Rider, Barbet Schroder’s More, or Jud Yalkut’s Turn! Turn! Turn! as soundtracks for works with explicit hallucinatory imagery. How effectively did music and imagery complement one another to facilitate a comprehensive immersion into quasi-hallucinatory experiences or even serve as aids to experimentation with hallucinogens? What were the circumstances for image montage, <b>stroboscopic</b> light <b>effects,</b> and rotating mandala forms to become the visual tropes accompanying drug-referencing music? Alternately, what kinds of music were optimally used to accompany imagery, particularly in films, about drugs? Is it possible to identify an alternative aesthetics developing from within this plethora of immersive music and imagery, given that the abandonment of analytical criticality seems intended? An unlikely outcome perhaps, without his prior composition Mescaline Mix, Terry Riley’s 1964 In C amplified zones of sensory pleasure newly accessed by LSD pioneers. How was this compatible with the rigorously conceptual compositional structure of In C and the technological focus of the San Franscisco Tape Center where it was first performed? And what was the impact on compositional innovations of the SF Tape Center of the concerns of its members, particularly Pauline Oliveros, for Ramon Sender’s unexpected departure into the radical outer fields of LSD experimentation and commune life? The splintering of tendencies in popular music was in part accelerated by differences of opinion about drug use. Wallace Berman spoke about the stifling effects of heroin on creativity compared with the transformative motivations deriving from hallucinogens, yet his silent film Aleph depicts both drug uses, seemingly uncritically, while featuring imagery of Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones, amongst other musical references. Frank Zappa’s derisory lyrics in ‘Plastic People’ referred to Andy Warhol’s Plastic Inevitable and the Velvet Underground’s proclivity for heroin, although like his sometime musical partner, Captain Beefheart, he was hardly any more tolerant of hallucinogen use. Is it possible to differentiate Zappa’s and Beefheart’s inventive and bizarre customizing of psychedelia in their approaches to music and visual design as a critical aesthetics set apart from their LSD enthusiast peers? Can a difference of aesthetics be discerned between such critical musical positions and the immersive, interminable drift of hallucinatory music, {{as well as the}} slump, cacophony and sonic darkness of narcotic-inspired songs, and, if so, what qualities are possessed by their respective imagery archives...|$|R
