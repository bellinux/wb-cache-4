40|$|To {{improve the}} system {{performance}} of a gas engine driven heat pump (GHP) system, an analytical modeling and experimental study has been made by using desiccant system in cooling operation (particularly in high humidity operations) and suction line waste heat recovery to augment heating capacity and efficiency. The performance of overall GHP system has been simulated with a detailed vapor compression heat pump system design model. The modeling includes: (1) GHP cycle without any performance improvements (suction liquid heat exchange and heat recovery) as a baseline (both in cooling and heating mode), (2) the GHP cycle in cooling mode with desiccant system regenerated by waste heat from engine incorporated, (3) GHP cycle in heating mode with heat recovery (recovered heat from engine). According to the system modeling results, by using the desiccant system the <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>ratio</b> (SHR- <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>ratio)</b> can be lowered to 40 %.

But the application of this system is hindered by the condensation risk on dry cooling coil. In this study, the condensation risk {{of the use of}} dry cooling air-handler and dedicated ventilation (DCDV) system in subtropical climates was examined by analysing its application in a typical office building in Hong Kong using actual equipment performance data and realistic system characteristics. Through hour-by-hour simulations {{it was found that the}} annualised cumulative frequency of occurrence of condensation (ConHR) for normal operation of the office building was acceptable. However, departures of the in-use condition from design values are inevitable. Additional parametric studies were therefore performed to evaluate the influence of five design parameters on the ConHR, and to identify the influential factors. By statistical analysis, it was found that ConHR was most sensitive to changes in system latent load, followed by (descending order) system <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>ratio,</b> system total load and design moisture absorption coefficient of dry cooling coil.

In this paper, a procedure to develop the operating envelope for the tested equipment in a wind tunnel is presented. The temperature and humidity of the air that requires conditioning is controlled and maintained by the combination of cooling coil (or evaporator), heating elements, and a steam injection system. Therefore, the capacity of the components to be tested inside the wind tunnel is limited by the combined capacity of the cooling coil, heaters, and the steam injection system. For cooling coils or evaporators, an analysis is performed for different <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> <b>ratios</b> (SHR), inlet temperatures, and humidity. A similar analysis is performed for <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> coils or condensers where the SHR is 1.

40|$|DX {{cooling coil}} (DCC) systems have {{dominated}} light commercial and household {{applications in the}} U. S for several decades. Approximately 14. 5 % of energy use is consumed by space cooling in commercial buildings, whereas 87 % of households are installed with air-conditioners. Improper installation, poor design, and lack of optimized control/operations incur faults in HVAC systems causing 25 % to 50 % energy waste in a building. These consequences are subject to inefficient equipment modelling of which is developed from: (1) insufficient understanding in equipment characteristics, (2) uncertainties in testing environment and data, and (3) access and cost limitations. Therefore, in this thesis DCC inherent characteristics are investigated by using manufacturers’ data to improve DCC modelling procedures. Model based control/optimization of DCC methods are: white-box (theoretical-based and physical-based), requiring particular equipment physical geometries, and black-box (empirical-based), requiring high-qualitied data for performance mapping. In practice, physical geometries and laboratory testing data are not always available or not accurate enough to provide robust approximations and validations. A generic rating-data-based (GRDB) model, which can accurately predict roof top unit (RTU) capacities, is derived from readily available manufacturers’ data, and the model format is based on measured environment temperatures and air flow rates (CFM). Accordingly, GRDB will be re-examined and extensively applied to mini-split heat pumps (MSHPs). Unlike RTUs, MSHPs’ manufacturing performance data ranges are limited, so intensive understanding of DCC inherent characteristics are essential to create more accurate models. In accordance, the characteristics are examined by air principles and fundamentals of vapor compression cycle (VCC), and illustrated by normalized capacities (NCAPs) and <b>sensible</b> <b>heating</b> <b>ratio</b> (SHR) plots. In addition, new DCC modelling procedures are proposed in this research. Finally, the improved GRDB for MSHPs, validated by laboratory data, shows relative errors ranged from 12. 5 % to - 8. 6 %. In addition, the proposed inherent characteristic hypotheses are validated using manufacturers’ data from various conditions and systems. The results show correlations in associated with proposed hypotheses. Profound understanding of DCC inherent characteristics in this research could lead to better modelling procedures as it could lessen model complexity and computational processes, which could benefit low-cost sensing and fault detection and diagnostics technologies.

Return air leakage from hot attic spaces was simulated by assuming adiabatic mixing of the indoor air at normal conditions with the attic air at high temperatures. Effective capacity and Energy Efficiency Ratio both decreased with increased return air leakage. However, power consumption was relatively constant for all variables except outdoor temperature, which meant that for the same power consumption, the unit delivered much lower performance when there was return air leakage.

We explored the possibility to use advective fluxes of <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> as a proxy for the corresponding flux of carbon dioxide despite somewhat differing sinks and sources. On average, advective fluxes of <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> were of opposite sign in relation to the advective fluxes of carbon dioxide for the three investigated sites, especially during nighttime. Therefore, the respective gradients were of opposite sign, on average, for vertical and (to a lesser extent) horizontal direction. This is not as obvious for horizontal direction as for the vertical direction. A scheme is presented to explain the correlation of the respective gradients for different conditions. Based on the gained insights and regression statistics, two simple empirical models were tested to derive advective fluxes of carbon dioxide from advective fluxes of <b>sensible</b> <b>heat.</b> Our results suggest that the advective flux of <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> could be taken as an indicator concerning the presence and sign of carbon dioxide advection.

40|$|Land surface {{temperature}} and fluxes (soil <b>heat</b> flux, <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> flux and latent heat flux) of the Nanchong city in Sichuan Province on September 20, 2007, were retrieved using Landsat ETM+ images. Then based on sampling points in study area, {{surface temperature}} and each flux {{were compared with}} scatter diagram, and simulated the function to explore their correlation. The research results are the following: 1) Land surface temperature had positively correlation with both soil <b>heat</b> flux and <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> flux, but negatively correlation with latent heat flux. 2) Surface temperature was absolutely affected by <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> flux. ...|$|R
40|$|Scintillometry {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as a potential tool for obtaining spatially aggregated <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> fluxes at regional scales. Although many investigations have been made over contrasting component surfaces, few aggregation schemes consider footprint contributions. In this paper, an approach is presented to infer average <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> flux over a very heterogeneous landscape by using a large aperture scintillometer. The methodology is demonstrated on simulated data and tested on a time series of measurements obtained during the SPARC 2004 experiment in Barrax, Spain. Results show that the two-dimensional footprint approach yields more accurate results of aggregated <b>sensible</b> <b>heat</b> flux than traditional methods...|$|R
