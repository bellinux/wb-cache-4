5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the Oatley Train <b>Station</b> <b>Lift</b> construction, Coure has {{embarked}} upon the renewal of Narwee Station and is constructing a similar monument {{in the form of the}} Narwee Train <b>Station</b> <b>Lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coure was {{the driving}} mastermind behind the world renowned {{architectural}} marvel {{that is the}} Oatley Train <b>Station</b> <b>Lift.</b> Thanks to the lift-building expertise of Coure, the people of Oatley {{no longer have to}} use stairs to get to the trains that service their suburb. The Oatley Train <b>Station</b> <b>lift</b> is a formidable and imposing structure that stands as testament to Coure's glory.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{first opened}} on December 16, 1961, consisting of trails on Peak 8 serviced currently by the Colorado SuperChair. The main lift was a double chairlift, Lift 1, {{which had a}} midway unloading <b>station.</b> <b>Lift</b> 1 ran from the base area {{up to a point}} slightly west of the top of the current Colorado SuperChair. This small butte overlooks the Rocky Mountain SuperChair and is accessible by hiking from the Vista Haus along a short dirt road in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|Malfunction of pumping <b>station</b> <b>lifts</b> or {{electrical}} power failure ...|$|R
50|$|Another mode {{of system}} failure can include power outages, which may disable <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> pumps and cause sewage {{overflow}} from the <b>lift</b> <b>station</b> wet well. <b>Lift</b> <b>station</b> mechanical or power failure causes approximately {{ten percent of}} United States SSOs. This type of discharge is uncommon from combined sewers, because the combined volume of sewage and storm water discourages use of <b>lift</b> <b>stations.</b> Broken sewer lines are responsible for approximately ten percent of U.S. SSOs.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two side platforms serving two tracks forming a passing loop on the single-track line. The station entrance {{is located on the}} northern (Sakado-bound) side of the <b>station.</b> <b>Lifts</b> were added in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Swiss {{manufacturer}} Bolliger & Mabillard (B&M) unveiled its Flying Coaster {{model in}} 2002 with Air at Alton Towers (renamed Galactica in 2016), followed {{later in the}} year by Superman: Ultimate Flight at Six Flags Over Georgia. In this version, the rider takes a sitting position with their legs dangling in a similar fashion to B&M's inverted roller coaster.

5000|$|Jaguar! has a semi-complex [...] "block system" [...] {{to avoid}} the trains from coming too close or in {{complete}} contact with each other. The location of each train is monitored by proximity sensors that when sensing the metal of the brake fin, send the location to the main computer, which is displayed on the main dispatch control panel. The ride has three different blocks not including the station. [...] "A Block" [...] is {{from the end of}} station approach into the station. [...] "B Block" [...] is from the top of Lift 1 to the top of Lift 2. [...] "C Block", the only possible place to have a [...] "Set Up" [...] occur, is {{from the top of the}} second lift to the station approach section of the track. A [...] "set up" [...] is what occurs when one train attempts to enter a block already occupied by another train. The dispatch panel only allows the operator to send one train after the second train has cleared the second lift, thus entering the [...] "C Block". There are six places where the train can stop: <b>Station,</b> <b>Lift</b> 1, Lift 2 Approach, Lift 2, [...] "C" [...] Brakes, Station Approach. The train enters the station from station approach automatically when [...] "Auto Advance" [...] is activated. However, if the [...] "Auto Advance" [...] is deactivated, the train will stay in Station Approach while the other train travels through A and B Block. Once the train hits the top of Lift 2 with the one train in Station Approach, both lifts will stop immediately and the dispatcher's display will read [...] "067 Block C/Setup", indicating the two trains are attempting to occupy the same block. The other possible setup is an [...] "061 Block R/Setup", when the trains become too close in the computer's readings, though only one train is occupying the blocks.|$|E
40|$|Wastewater <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> are {{facilities}} {{designed to}} move wastewater from lower to higher elevation through pipes. Key elements of <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> include a wastewater receiving well (wet-well), often {{equipped with a}} screen or grinding to remove coarse materials; pumps and piping with associated valves; motors; a power supply system; an equipment control and alarm system; and an odor control system and ventilation system. <b>Lift</b> <b>station</b> equipment and systems are often installed in an enclosed structure. They can be constructed on-site (custom-designed) or prefabricated. <b>Lift</b> <b>station</b> capacities range from 76 liters per minute (20 gallons per minute) to more than 378, 500 liters per minute (100, 000 gallons per minute). Pre-fabricated <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> generally have capacities of up to 38, 000 liters per minute (10, 000 gallons per minute). Centrifugal pumps are commonly used in <b>lift</b> <b>stations.</b> A trapped air column, or bubbler system, that senses pressure and level is commonly used for pump station control. Other control alternatives include electrodes placed at cut-off levels, floats, mechanical clutches, and floating mercury switches. A more sophisticated control operation {{involves the use of}} variable speed drives. <b>Lift</b> <b>stations</b> are typically provided with equipment for easy pump removal. Floor access hatches or openings above the pump room and an overhead monorail beam, bridge crane, or portable hoist are commonly used. The two most common types of <b>lift</b> <b>stations</b> are the dry-pit or dry-well and submersible <b>lift</b> <b>stations.</b> In dry-well <b>lift</b> <b>stations,</b> pumps and valves are housed in a pump room (dry pit or dry-well), that is easily accessible. The wet-well is a separate chamber attached or located adjacent to the dry-well (pump room) structure. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the two types of pumps...|$|R

If permission is granted, the upgrade work is estimated to take six years and will {{more than double the}} size of the station, greatly increasing its capacity.|$|R
50|$|On November 25, 2012 at {{approximately}} 23:00 local time, a Robinson R44 helicopter clipped a refueling station canopy and exploded shortly thereafter.

Sea trout is a particularly common catch, as are pike, perch and bream.|$|R
50|$|A £7 million {{package of}} {{improvements}} was {{started at the}} station in June 2010.

50|$|The second Lavender Bay Station was a {{redesign}} {{of the first}} station, and came into use on 27 April 1924. This station was necessary because a contract had been let {{for the construction of}} the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Milsons Point land was required for workshops associated with the construction. The second Lavender Bay station was a terminus as the lines to Milsons Point were actually removed. Thus it was a more passenger-friendly version of its predecessor. The electric tram terminus was also moved to Glen Street on the cliff above the <b>station.</b> <b>Lifts</b> and escalators, the first in Australia, were installed.|$|R
5000|$|While {{engineering}} {{as a rule}} factors human safety {{into the}} design process, a modern appraisal of specific links to design and workers' safety {{can be seen in}} efforts beginning in the 1800s. Trends included the widespread implementation of guards for machinery, controls for elevators, and boiler safety practices. This was followed by enhanced design for ventilation, enclosures, system monitors, lockout/tagout controls, and hearing protectors. More recently, there has been the development of chemical process safety, ergonomically engineered tools, chairs, and work <b>stations,</b> <b>lifting</b> devices, retractable needles, latex-free gloves, and a parade of other safety devices and processes.|$|R
