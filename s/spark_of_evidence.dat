60|$|And, moreover, Graham {{had listened}} {{with all his}} mind to the {{cross-examination}} of Dockwrath, and he was filled with disgust--with disgust, not so much at the part played by the attorney as at that played by the barrister. As Graham regarded the matter, what had the iniquities and greed of Dockwrath to do with it? Had reason been shown why the statement made by Dockwrath was in itself unworthy of belief,--that that statement was in its own essence weak,--then {{the character of the}} man making it might fairly affect its credibility. But presuming that statement to be wrong,--presuming that it was corroborated by other evidence, how could it be affected by any amount of villainy on the part of Dockwrath? All that Chaffanbrass had done or attempted was to prove that Dockwrath had had his own end to serve. Who had ever doubted it? But not a word had been said, not a <b>spark</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> elicited, to show that the man had used a falsehood to further those views of his. Of all this the mind of Felix Graham had been full; and now, as he rose to take his own share of the work, his wit was at work rather in opposition to Lady Mason than on her behalf.|$|E
