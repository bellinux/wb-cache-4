5|$|While stone {{buildings}} {{became more}} and more common as town houses, farms continued to be half-timbered, sometimes in conjunction with a single <b>stone</b> <b>house.</b> Ordinary people continued to live in half-timbered houses.|$|E
5|$|Clemuel Ricketts, the {{architect}} of the <b>stone</b> <b>house,</b> was very interested in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house has}} a {{symmetrical}} facade with projecting wings {{either side of the}} central doorway with a Tuscan portico. The interior of the <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> is decorated with extensive plaster mouldings to ceilings and fireplaces. The grounds and gardens were laid out by Humphry Repton, but have since been reduced in size.|$|E

5|$|Deptford's {{population}} has been mainly associated with the docks since {{the establishment of the}} Royal Docks by Henry VIII, though there has also been some market gardening and potteries. When the docks were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and <b>Stone</b> <b>House</b> on Lewisham Way were erected.|$|E
5|$|It {{was never}} {{attacked}} again. The windmill was rebuilt in 1700, and was probably {{still in use}} until the 1780s. In 1703, Jacques Le Ber de Senneville constructed a large <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> and fort {{in order to improve}} and protect his fur trading operations, and the local seigneural manor house was built in 1706. However, after the fall of New France in 1763, it was not used by the British as a military post. In 1776, Fort Senneville was destroyed during the American Revolutionary War by Continental Army troops under Benedict Arnold, in military manoeuvres associated with the Battle of the Cedars.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{downtown}} Washington, architectural {{styles are}} even more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, Ch√¢teauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian revival, Beaux-Arts, {{and a variety of}} Victorian styles. Rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federalist and late Victorian designs. Georgetown's Old <b>Stone</b> <b>House</b> was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city. Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture. The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the District with a total area of approximately 3.1million squarefeet (288,000m2).|$|E

5|$|Ricketts' <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> {{served as}} the base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's {{excursions}} on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens.|$|E
5|$|Scotland was {{occupied}} by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from around 8500 BCE, who were highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements, like the <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE. The settlers also introduced chambered cairn tombs, as at Maeshowe, and the many standing stones and circles such as those at Stenness on the mainland of Orkney, which dates from about 3100 BCE, and similar stones to which are found across Europe from about the same time.|$|E
5|$|The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion (also {{known as}} the <b>Stone</b> <b>House,</b> the William R. Ricketts House, and Ganoga) is a Georgian-style house made of sandstone, built in 1852 or 1855 {{on the shore of}} Ganoga Lake in Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was home to several generations of the Ricketts family, {{including}} R. Bruce Ricketts and William Reynolds Ricketts. Originally built as a hunting lodge, it was also a tavern and post office, and served as part of a hotel for much of the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The North Mountain House was {{threatened}} by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss {{of much of the}} surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the village of Ricketts. The wooden addition to the <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> was torn down in either 1897 or 1903, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and the fishing club and passenger train service ended with the closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built over the old cloisters and the main rooms are on the first floor. It is a <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> with stone slated roofs, twisted chimney stacks and mullioned windows. Throughout {{the life of the}} building, many {{architectural}} alterations, additions, and renovations have occurred so that the house is a mish-mash of different periods and styles. The Tudor stable courtyard {{to the north of the}} house has retained many of its original features including the old brewhouse and bakehouse.|$|E
5|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> {{remained}} the Ricketts family's summer home. After the hotel closed, several small cabins were {{built around the}} lake for rental to sportsmen. Ricketts proposed moving the highway from his front yard in 1904; the Pennsylvania General Assembly approved this in 1908, after he paid {{for the construction of}} the new highway. The house was renovated and added to in 1913, and Ricketts died there during the 1918 flu pandemic. His wife died shortly thereafter, and they are buried in the small Ricketts family cemetery near {{the north end of the}} lake.|$|E

5|$|In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, {{who lived}} in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton. On 25 August 1902 his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, their only child. Rhodes found Yorkshire's {{dealings}} with money to be ungenerous; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid only one-third of the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to use the money to build a <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.|$|E
5|$|In the Neolithic period, {{from around}} 6,000 years ago, there is {{evidence}} of permanent settlements and farming. This includes the well-preserved <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE and the village of similar houses at Skara Brae on West Mainland, Orkney from about 500 years later. Evidence of prehistoric farming includes small plots of improved land, with simple stone boundaries. On Shetland these have been found under peat and on the mainland they are associated with cairnfields (piles of rocks that have been cleared from fields). Archaeological evidence of pollen, pottery, settlements and human remains indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow milk, in a pattern that probably remained constant until the High Middle Ages. There is also some limited evidence of the cultivation of flax from this period.|$|E
5|$|No {{childhood}} home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old <b>Stone</b> <b>House,</b> is in use as the Edgar Allan Poe Museum, though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used {{during his time}} with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe {{is believed to have}} used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits.

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, {{although the majority of}} the present <b>stone</b> <b>house</b> was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building.

It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred.
