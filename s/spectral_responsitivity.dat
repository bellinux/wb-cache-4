40|$|The {{spectral}} {{bands of}} the Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper subsystems of Landsat- 4 and Landsat-D' have been analyzed using a bandwidth normalization technique based on {{analysis of the}} moments of the <b>spectral</b> <b>responsitivity</b> curves. The results include the effective wavelength, the bandpass, the wavelength limits, and the normalized responsivity for each spectral channel. In addition, temperature coefficients for TM PF Channel 6 have been derived. The moments normalization method employed yields sensor parameters whose derivation is independent of source characteristics (i. e., incident solar spectral irradiance, atmospoheric transmittance, or ground reflectance). The errors expected using these parameters are lower than those expected using other normalization methods...|$|E
