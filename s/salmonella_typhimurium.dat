5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if <b>Salmonella</b> <b>typhimurium</b> was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E

40|$|Salmonella enterica {{subspecies}} 1 serovar Typhimurium is {{a common}} cause of bacterial enterocolitis. Mice are generally protected from <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> colonization and enterocolitis by their resident intestinal microflora. This phenomenon is called "colonization resistance" (CR). Two murine <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> infection models {{are based on the}} neutralization of CR: (i) in specific-pathogen-free mice pretreated with streptomycin (StrSPF mice) antibiotics disrupt the intestinal microflora; and (ii) germfree (GF) mice are raised without any intestinal microflora, but their intestines show distinct physiologic and immunologic characteristics. It has been unclear whether the same pathogenetic mechanisms trigger <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> colitis in GF and StrSPF mice. In this study, we compared the two colitis models. In both of the models <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> efficiently colonized the large intestine and triggered cecum and colon inflammation starting 8 h postinfection. The type III secretion system encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 was essential in both disease models. Thus, <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> colitis is triggered by similar pathogenetic mechanisms in StrSPF and GF mice. This is remarkable considering the distinct physiological properties of the GF mouse gut. One obvious difference was more pronounced damage and reduced regenerative response of the cecal epithelium in GF mice.

40|$|Vibrio cholerae is a monoflagellated gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{that causes the}} severe diarrheal disease cholera. In contrast to <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> infection, which is accompanied by both acute diarrhea and high-level inflammation, V. cholerae infection is largely noninflammatory in human hosts. Bacterial flagella are composed of flagellin, a highly conserved protein that is also a target of the innate immune response. Because the V. cholerae flagellum is covered by a sheath, we hypothesized {{that it might be}} less prone to activation of the innate immune response than nonsheathed flagella, such as those produced by <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium.</b> Indeed, compared with <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> flagella, V. cholerae flagella demonstrated significantly reduced NF-κB activation in A 549 human pulmonary epithelial cells. However, V. cholerae flagellin monomers, FlaD and FlaC, were almost equally potent with purified FliC, a monomer derived from <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> flagella, in NF-κB activation. Heat- and acid-induced dissociation assays showed that <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> flagella disassembled far more readily into monomeric flagellins than V. cholerae flagella, suggesting that the differential levels of NF-κB activation by V. cholerae and <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> flagella are likely attributable to the difference in their flagellin shedding. Our results suggest that monomer dissociation of V. cholerae flagella is suppressed likely due to the presence of the sheath and that this unique structural feature of V. cholerae flagella may have evolved as a strategy to evade flagellin-triggered host innate immune responses in various host species...|$|R

40|$|The autoinducer- 3 (AI- 3) /epinephrine (Epi) /norepinephrine (NE) interkingdom {{signaling}} system mediates chemical communication between bacteria and their mammalian hosts. The three signals are sensed by the QseC histidine kinase (HK) sensor. <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> is a pathogen that uses HKs to sense its environment and regulate virulence. <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> invades epithelial cells and survives within macrophages. Invasion of epithelial cells is {{mediated by the}} type III secretion system (T 3 SS) encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI- 1), while macrophage survival and systemic disease are mediated by the T 3 SS encoded in SPI- 2. Here we show that QseC {{plays an important role}} in <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> pathogenicity. A qseC mutant was impaired in flagellar motility, in invasion of epithelial cells, and in survival within macrophages and was attenuated for systemic infection in 129 x 1 /SvJ mice.

Additionally, dopamine β-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh−/−) mice that do not produce Epi or NE showed different susceptibility to <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> infection than wild-type mice.

40|$|Transmission is an {{essential}} stage of a pathogen's life cycle and remains poorly understood. We describe here a model in which persistently infected 129 X 1 /SvJ mice provide a natural model of <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> transmission. In this model only {{a subset of the}} infected mice, termed supershedders, shed high levels (> 108 CFU/g) of <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> in their feces and, as a result, rapidly transmit infection. While most Salmonella serovar Typhimurium-infected mice show signs of intestinal inflammation, only supershedder mice develop colitis. Development of the supershedder phenotype depends on the virulence determinants Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2, and it is characterized by mucosal invasion and, importantly, high luminal abundance of <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> within the colon. Immunosuppression of infected mice does not induce the supershedder phenotype, demonstrating that the immune response is not the main determinant of <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> levels within the colon. In contrast, treatment of mice with antibiotics that alter the health-associated indigenous intestinal microbiota rapidly induces the supershedder phenotype in infected mice and predisposes uninfected mice to the supershedder phenotype for several days.

Clinical symptoms, fecal excretion, the organ distribution of Salmonella, and the humoral immune response (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgM, and IgA levels) in serum were examined.

The probiotic group received a feed supplement containing E. faecium starting on day 14 postpartum prior to challenge with <b>Salmonella</b> serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> DT 104 at 28 days postpartum.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> were obtained from the human fecal samples. These strains were identified by standard microbiological and biochemical tests. Then, ERIC-PCR and BOX-PCR were carried out for determination of molecular relatedness of <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> using specific primers. Results: The results showed that all 60 <b>Salmonella</b> enterica serovar <b>Typhimurium</b> were separable using ERIC 1, ERIC 2 and BOXAIR. In electrophoresis, 2 - 11 bands with 20 - 3200 bp for ERIC-PCR and 2 - 10 bands with 200 - 1500 bp for BOX-PCR were observed.

We also carried out complementation experiments with a cloned wild-type rpoS gene. Our results showed that 15 of the 41 Salmonella serotype Typhi isolates were defective in RpoS. We sequenced the rpoS allele of 12 strains.
