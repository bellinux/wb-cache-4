5|$|To repair Zulf's {{damage to}} the Bastion, the Kid starts {{collecting}} Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion {{had the ability to}} somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the unusually great height of the corn, the French line of skirmishers, strengthened by whole battalions so as to give then a decided superiority over that of the Prussians, approached so cautiously and <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> to continue unperceived until they suddenly possessed themselves of the outermost hedges and gardens.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, 12 September, warrants {{were issued}} to the adjacent villages to supply certain quantities of {{food on the}} morrow, on pain of having their towns burnt {{in the event of}} non-fulfilment. This plan was merely a ruse on the part of Gage to mislead the besiegers as to his intentions, information having reached the House that large bodies of troops had arrived at the villages between Silchester and Kingsclere, with a view to cut off his retreat upon Oxford. At eleven o'clock that night Gage marched off with his men as <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> possible, and, while the Roundheads were peacefully sleeping, reached the River Kennet at Burghfield Bridge, and having forded the river (the bridge being destroyed) on the following morning crossed the Thames at Pangbourne, and arriving at Wallingford in safety, decided upon quartering there for the night. The next day he returned in triumph to Oxford, having completed the arduous task entrusted to him with a loss of only eleven men killed and forty or fifty wounded. For this exploit he received the honour of knighthood {{at the hands of the}} King on 1 November.|$|E

500|$|HMS Tiptoe {{was one of}} {{the group}} three of T-class submarines. She was named by Winston Churchill, with the {{intention}} to imply that it could approach the enemy <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> if on tiptoe, although the Royal Navy naming committee was against the name, stating that [...] "it was derogatory to one of His Majesty's ships", but the Prime Minister had his way. The only other Royal Navy vessel to be named by Churchill was HMS Varangian.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Hush", a {{group of}} fairytale ghouls named [...] "The Gentlemen" [...] come to town and steal everyone's voices, leaving them unable to scream when The Gentlemen cut out their hearts. Buffy and her friends must {{communicate}} with one another <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> they try to discover why no one can speak and find whoever is murdering the townspeople. They must also find ways to express their feelings about each other and keep some semblance of control as the town descends into chaos.|$|E
500|$|The Wiggles' songwriting and {{performances}} were rooted in their professional training as pre-school teachers {{and in the}} concepts of early childhood education. [...] Anthony Field reported, as he studied music for young children at university, being [...] "shocked... at the non-inclusive way music for children was usually performed". [...] According to Field, children had to sit <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> musicians played [...] "traditional songs often featuring negative or outdated lyrics and dealing with subject matter of no interest to small children". [...] The lack of songs with themes and topics that interested children inspired Field to record The Wiggles' first album.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{exposes the}} loss of innocence so {{frequently}} that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy. In exploring how each character deals {{with his or her}} own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and [...] "reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races" [...] while giving the [...] "appearance of gentility, piety, and morality". Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.|$|E
500|$|Cyber Rights {{received}} a positive review in Salon, which noted, [...] "Readers of 'Cyber Rights' will range {{from those who}} have never heard of Mike Godwin to those who have tangoed with him online at some point or have at least lurked <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> the debate raged. Whatever the number in the first category, those falling into the second are legion. Godwin has been online so long he's had a celebrated law that predicts the course of online discussions named after him." [...] The review observed, [...] "Throughout 'Cyber Rights,' it becomes clear that what makes Godwin a sometimes unpleasant online sparring partner is precisely what has catapulted him to the front lines in the seemingly endless battles for free speech on the Net. ... his tenacity and his insistence on wrestling every last breath out of his opponents' arguments." [...] Salon characterized the book as, [...] "an instructional book with an argument to convey – a sort of cross between a dry, textbookish primer and a lively personal history." ...|$|E
500|$|After DelaCerna {{stated that}} she would always make sure Copeland could dance, both the {{emancipation}} papers and restraining orders were dropped. Copeland, who claimed she {{did not understand the}} term emancipation, withdrew the petition after informing the judge that such charges no longer represented her wishes. Still, DelaCerna wanted the Bradleys out of her daughter's life. Copeland re-enrolled at San Pedro High School for her junior year (1998–99), on pace to graduate with her original class of 2000. DelaCerna sought Cantine's advice on finding a new ballet school. Copeland began ballet study at Lauridsen Ballet Centre with former ABT dancer Diane Lauridsen, although her dancing was now restricted to afternoons in deference to her schooling. Late in 1998, all parties appeared on Leeza Gibbons' talk show, Leeza, where Copeland sat <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> the adults [...] "bickered shamelessly". As a student, Copeland had a 3.8/4.0 GPA through her junior year of high school. In 2000, DelaCerna stated that Copeland's earnings from ballet were set aside in a savings account and only used as needed.|$|E

2500|$|During the trial, a [...] "command" [...] {{performance}} of White Cargo was {{given at the}} Beaux Arts on Tuesday, January 22, 1941, for the judge and jury. They sat <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> the cast enacted the play and Tondeleyo, as portrayed by Saunders, [...] "worked her sensuous wiles on every white man in the cast." ...|$|E
2500|$|To conceal {{themselves}} {{as much as}} possible, party members left extra supplies in the trench, and only ventured out at night. [...] The teams scrambled to work as quickly and <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> possible, as such stressful night work and physical labour promoted fatigue and little time to sleep. Also, returning to one's trench {{in the middle of}} the night proved tricky, as workers often got lost on their way back. Finally, wiring parties were always wary of the enemy's parties, as they performed the same task each night.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{appointed}} time, {{after the third}} part of the night had ended, the Carthaginian army roused itself and made ready to march as <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> possible. The picked force with the oxen marched to the saddle, and when they approached the slopes, the wood and faggot tied to the horns were lit by the camp followers. The terrified oxen began to flee and stampede up {{the slopes of the}} saddle, creating an illusion of thousands of torches moving up the mountainside. The lights and sounds of the spectacle attracted the attention of the Romans in the camp of Fabius, and also the Roman detachment guarding the pass. The reaction of the forces were [...] different.|$|E

2500|$|Trainer Keene Fitzpatrick {{walked onto}} the field to examine Curtis and quickly saw that the leg was broken. [...] In what the Detroit Free Press {{described}} as [...] "one of the most touching scenes ever witnessed on a football field," [...] the crowd of 1,000 sitting in the bleachers fell silent and Michigan's quarterback, Harry Workman, [...] "was seen {{to come out of}} the bunch of standing players, put his hands to his face, and break down and weep like a child." [...] A surgeon who was in the stands came onto the field, examined Curtis, and called for an ambulance. [...] The crowd sat <b>silently</b> <b>as</b> Curtis was [...] "carefully placed on a stretcher" [...] and into the hospital wagon. [...] As the crowd finally walked slowly up State Street, the [...] "gloom was awful." [...] The Detroit Free Press wrote:"Big Joe Curtis – one of the best fellows who ever went to college – who was acknowledged to be the best tackle in the west, and who was preparing himself to play the game of his life against Pennsylvania, the last college game in which he could ever participate, and who was practically certain of recognition for the All-American team, is down and out on the eve of what was to be the great climax of his spectacular football career[...] [...] [...] 'G-L-O-O-M' spells Ann Arbor tonight." ...|$|E

60|$|Her {{back was}} toward the jungle, {{and so she}} did not see the grasses part, or the savage face that peered from between. Little, bloodshot, close-set eyes scanned her intently, roving from time to time about the open beach for {{indications}} of the presence of others than herself. Presently another head appeared, and then another and another. The man in the shelter commenced to rave again, and the heads disappeared <b>as</b> <b>silently</b> and <b>as</b> suddenly as they had come. But soon they were thrust forth once more, as the girl gave no sign of perturbation at the continued wailing of the man above.|$|R
60|$|The girls tolerated this native curiosity with indulgent {{good humor}} and at midnight even passed out {{sandwiches}} to the crowd, a supply having been secured for the workmen.

50|$|Battery {{involves}} unlawfully touching {{another person}} (this {{does not include}} everyday knocks and jolts to which people <b>silently</b> consent <b>as</b> the result of crowds).
