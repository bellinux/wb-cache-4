5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively <b>small</b> <b>head</b> and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} head and include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E
5|$|The ruff has a {{distinctive}} gravy boat appearance, with a <b>small</b> <b>head,</b> medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. In flight, {{it has a}} deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white bar on the wing, and white ovals {{on the sides of}} the tail.|$|E

5|$|Since Patagosaurus {{is known}} from many specimens, {{including}} at least one juvenile, its anatomy and growth are fairly well understood. Both ages exhibit the typical features of a sauropod, a long neck, <b>small</b> <b>head,</b> a long tail, and being quadrupedal. The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, pectoral girdle, pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar. The many known specimens help fill in gaps in the anatomy of the genus, such as the forelimb and skull. Parts of the skeleton, like the pectoral girdle, tibia and pubis, are more robust, while others, like the forelimb and ischium, are more gracile. The material of Patagosaurus is similar to closely related taxa like Cetiosaurus and Volkheimeria, more primitive genera such as Barapasaurus and Amygdalodon, and more derived sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and dark spots above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a <b>small</b> <b>head</b> with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|The brolga is a common, gregarious wetland {{bird species}} of {{tropical}} and south-eastern Australia and New Guinea. It is a tall, upright bird with a <b>small</b> <b>head,</b> long beak, slender neck and long legs. The plumage is mainly grey, with black wing tips, {{and it has}} an orange-red band of colour on its head. It {{is well known for}} its intricate mating dance. The nest is built of sticks on an island in marshland and usually two eggs are laid. Incubation takes 32 days and the newly hatched young are precocial. The adult diet is mostly plant matter, but invertebrates and small vertebrates are also eaten.|$|E

5|$|These were large, heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, {{and tails}} held {{high in the}} air. Due to their {{distinctive}} combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with spikes, Stegosaurus {{is one of the}} most recognizable kinds of dinosaur. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spikes were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions. Stegosaurus had a relatively low brain-to-body mass ratio. It had a short neck and a <b>small</b> <b>head,</b> meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, Stegosaurus ungulatus, is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as Kentrosaurus and Huayangosaurus).|$|E
5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} stegosaur. It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a <b>small</b> <b>head,</b> a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs {{and an array of}} plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the front lower jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a <b>small</b> <b>head</b> and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a <b>small</b> <b>head,</b> and low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with CS appear prematurely {{aged and}} exhibit severe growth {{retardation}} leading to short stature. They have a <b>small</b> <b>head</b> (less than the -3 standard deviation), fail {{to gain weight}} and failure to thrive. They also have extreme cutaneous photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight), neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and deafness, and often exhibit lipoatrophy, atrophic skin, severe tooth decay, sparse hair, calcium deposits in neurons, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary retinopathy, and bone abnormalities. However, {{they do not have}} a higher risk of cancer.|$|E

It is usually described as being gray-brown in color. Some traditions, such as those of Boha Village, {{describe it as}} a spirit rather than a flesh and blood creature.|$|E
25|$|On January 5, 1934 a motorcyclist, Arthur Grant, {{claimed to}} have nearly hit the {{creature}} while approaching Abriachan (near the north-eastern end of the loch) at about 1a.m. on a moonlit night. According to Grant, it had a <b>small</b> <b>head</b> attached to a long neck; the creature saw him, and crossed the road back to the loch. Grant, a veterinary student, {{described it as a}} cross between a seal and a plesiosaur. He said he dismounted and followed it to the loch, but only saw ripples.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the Jurassic, very large Pliosauridae evolved. These were {{characterized}} by a large head and a short neck, such as Liopleurodon and Simolestes. These forms had skulls up to three metres (ten feet) long and reached a length of up to seventeen metres (55 feet) and a weight of ten tonnes. The pliosaurids had large, conical teeth and were the dominant marine carnivores of their time. During the same time, approximately 160 million years ago, the Cryptoclididae were present, shorter species with a long neck and a <b>small</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
