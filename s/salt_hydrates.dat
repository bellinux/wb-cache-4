In addition to buffering water activity, {{there is evidence}} that <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> also often affect initial rates in other ways. This has been generally overlooked or thought to be related to water transfer effects. Here we show that <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> can have important acid-base effects on enzymes in nonaqueous media. We performed transesterification reactions in n-hexane and in supercritical ethane catalyzed by cross-linked crystals of subtilisin, differing in the method used to set a(W), and confirmed that the presence of salt hydrate pairs significantly affected the catalytic performance of the enzyme. However, {{in the presence of a}} solid-state acid-base buffer, <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> had no effect on enzymatic activity.

The four salt hydrate pairs tested affected the indicator to very different extents. By promoting the exchange of H+ for Na+, <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> will tend to affect the ionization state of acidic residues in the protein and, hence, enzymatic activity. In fact, <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> were able to affect the pH memory of subtilisin lyophilized from different aqueous pHs, bringing about up to 20 -fold enhancements and up to 5 -fold decreases in catalytic activity.

40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} systems (TES) have {{attracted}} increasing interest for thermal {{applications such as}} hot water, space heating and cooling. These systems are useful to correct the mismatch between the supply and demand of energy. There are mainly two types of thermal energy storage systems, sensible and latent heat storage. Latent heat storage is particularly attractive due to its ability to provide a high energy storage density and its characteristics to store heat at a constant temperature corresponding to the phase transition temperature of the heat storage substance. Inorganic <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> as latent heat storage materials have certain advantages over organic materials. However, some problems occur when <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> are used as phase change material (PCM) in the latent heat storage applications.

When free water was added, activity reached a maximum at a defined water content, but this maximum increased with buffer content, suggesting that there was competition for water with the buffer salts from which the enzyme was lyophilized. Alternatively, a range of <b>salt</b> <b>hydrates</b> was used, each able to fix the water activity (a(w)) at a different value.
