A passing [...] "charming man" [...] in a luxury car stops to offer the cyclist a lift, and although the protagonist is at first hesitant, after much deliberation he accepts the offer. While driving together the pair flirt, although the protagonist finds it difficult to overcome his reluctance: [...] "I would go out tonight, but I haven't got a <b>stitch</b> <b>to</b> wear". The motorist tells the cyclist: [...] "it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} main types of basic {{stitches}} (the following description uses US crochet terminology which {{differs from the}} terminology used in the UK and Europe). [...] 1.

60|$|At daybreak {{the beggar}} awoke from the swoon, {{and there he}} found himself lying without a <b>stitch</b> <b>to</b> his back, and half dead with the cold and the water he had swallowed. Then, fearing lest {{somebody}} might see him, he crawled away into the rushes that grew beside the river, there to hide himself until night should come again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless," [...] said Ayala, [...] "I {{think we}} might have done without boiled mutton." [...] Then she turned to some {{articles}} of domestic needlework which were in her lap so as to show {{that in spite of}} the wickedness of her opinions she did not mean to be idle. But Mrs. Dosett, in her wrath, snatched the work from her niece's hands and carried it out of the room, thus declaring that not even a pillow-case in her house should owe a <b>stitch</b> <b>to</b> the hands of a girl so ungrateful and so blasphemous.|$|E
6000|$|What are {{you about}} to do? Do you think of {{perching}} in Cumberland, as you opined when I was in the metropolis? If you mean to retire, why not occupy Miss Milbanke's [...] "Cottage of Friendship," [...] late the seat of Cobbler Joe, [5] for whose death you and others are answerable? His [...] "Orphan Daughter" [...] (pathetic Pratt!) will, certes, turn out a shoemaking Sappho. Have you no remorse?

6000|$|I {{have been}} up at the Spec. and looked out a {{reference}} I wanted. [...] The whole town is drowned in white, wet vapour off the sea. [...] Everything drips and soaks. The very statues seem wet to the skin. [...] I cannot pretend to be very cheerful; I did not see one contented face in the streets; and the poor did look so helplessly chill and dripping, without a <b>stitch</b> <b>to</b> change, or {{so much as a}} fire to dry themselves at, or perhaps money to buy a meal, or perhaps even a bed. My heart shivers for them.|$|E
60|$|Thus further {{conversation}} was checked; but, through having rearranged {{the hours of}} his country lessons, Christopher met her the next Wednesday, and the next Friday, and throughout the following week--no further words passing between them. For a while she went by very demurely, apparently mindful of his offence. But effrontery is not proved {{to be part of}} a man's nature till he has been guilty of a second act: the best of men may commit a first through accident or ignorance--may even be betrayed into it by over-zeal for experiment. Some such conclusion may or may not have been arrived at by the girl with the lady-apple cheeks; at any rate, after the lapse of another week a new spectacle presented itself; her redness deepened whenever Christopher passed her by, and embarrassment pervaded her from the lowest <b>stitch</b> <b>to</b> the tip of her feather. She had little chance of escaping him by diverging from the road, for a figure could be seen across the open ground to the distance of half a mile on either side. One day as he drew near as usual, she met him as women meet a cloud of dust--she turned and looked backwards till he had passed.|$|E
6000|$|... 129. This {{ought to}} be the first lesson of every rich man's {{political}} code. [...] "Sir," [...] his tutor should early say to him, [...] "you are so placed in society,--it may be for your misfortune, it must be for your trial--that you are likely to be maintained all your life by the labor of other men. You will have to make shoes for nobody, but some one will have to make a great many for you. You will have to dig ground for nobody, but some one will have to dig through every summer's hot day for you. You will build houses and make clothes for no one, but many a rough hand must knead clay, and many an elbow be crooked to the <b>stitch,</b> <b>to</b> keep that body of yours warm and fine. Now remember, whatever you and your work may be worth, the less your keep costs, the better. It does not cost money only. It costs degradation. You do not merely employ these people. You also tread upon them. It cannot be helped;--you have your place, and they have theirs; but see that you tread as lightly as possible, and on as few as possible. What food, and clothes, and lodging, you honestly need, for your health and peace, you may righteously take. See that you take the plainest you can serve yourself with--that you waste or wear nothing vainly--and that you employ no man in furnishing you with any useless luxury." ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{the duty}} of a gentleman who has a lady under his charge, in making a journey, to consult her wishes, and to conform to them so far as it is possible, in {{determining}} where to go, and in making all the general arrangements of the journey. But when these points are decided upon, every thing in respect to the practical carrying into effect of the plans thus formed should be left to the gentleman, as the executive officer of the party; just as in respect to affairs relating to housekeeping, or any thing else relating to a lady's department, the lady should be left free to act according to her own judgment and taste in arranging details, while in the general plans she conforms to the wishes of her husband. For a lady, when travelling, to be continually making suggestions and proposals about the baggage or the conveyances, and expressing dissatisfaction, or wish for changes in this, that, or the other, is as much a violation of propriety as it would be for the gentleman to go into the kitchen, and there propose petty changes in respect to the mode of cooking the dinner--or to stand by his wife at her work table, and wish to have her thread changed from this place to that--or to have some different <b>stitch</b> <b>to</b> be used in making a seam. A lady very naturally feels disturbed if she finds that her husband does not have confidence enough in her to trust her with such details.|$|E
