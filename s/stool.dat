5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a <b>stool</b> sample or a swab of the pharynx.

5|$|Lactulose and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a <b>stool</b> pH of <6.0. Lactulose may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E

40|$|Objective: many {{patients}} with diarrhoea undergo colonoscopy. If this is macroscopically normal, random biopsies are obtained {{to rule out}} microscopic colitis (MC), but most patients have functional disease. Accurate predictors of MC could avoid {{the need to take}} biopsies in a substantial proportion of patients, saving money for the health service. We validated a previously described diagnostic scoring system for MC, and incorporated further variables to assess whether this improved performance. Material and methods: consecutive adults with loose <b>stools</b> undergoing colonoscopy in Leeds, UK were included. Demographic and symptom data were collected prospectively. The diagnostic scoring system described previously was applied. In addition, the incorporation of further variables, including drugs associated with MC, number of <b>stools,</b> nocturnal passage of <b>stools,</b> and duration of loose <b>stools,</b> into the scoring system was assessed. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Results: among 242 patients (mean age 51. 0 years, 163 (67. 4 %) female), 26 (10. 7 %) of whom had MC, a cut off of ? 4 on the original scoring system had a sensitivity of 92. 3 % and specificity of 35. 2 %. Nocturnal passage of <b>stools</b> and duration of loose stoolsâ��< 6 months were significant predictors of MC. Incorporating these variables in a new scoring system with a cut off ofâ��? 6 identified MC with 95. 7 % sensitivity and 46. 0 % specificity. Conclusions: incorporating nocturnal passage of <b>stools</b> and duration of loose <b>stools</b> into the scoring system may improve ability to predict MC, and avoid random colonic biopsies in a greater proportion of patients with loose <b>stools...</b>|$|R
5|$|One of {{the main}} methods of {{removing}} thallium (both radioactive and normal) from humans is to use Prussian blue, a material which absorbs thallium. Up to 20g per day of Prussian blue is fed by mouth to the person, and it passes through their digestive system and comes out in the <b>stool.</b> Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are also used to remove thallium from the blood serum. At later stage of the treatment additional potassium is used to mobilize thallium from the tissue.|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of a recently developed {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} which detects Giardia lamblia antigen in feces was determined in experimentally infected humans.

In contrast, all of the 13 GS/M-inoculated volunteers became infected, and Giardia antigen was present one or more times in the <b>stools</b> of each. Of 203 <b>stools</b> from GS/M-inoculated volunteers, 73 contained Giardia cysts, and 69 of these (94. 5 %) had detectable antigen. In contrast, 108 of the 203 specimens were positive for Giardia antigen and only 73 had cysts.
