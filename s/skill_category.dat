2500|$|In a 2017 {{literature}} {{review by the}} National Academy of Sciences, they explain the positive impact of illegal immigrants on natives in the following way:The entry of new workers through migration {{increases the likelihood of}} filling a vacant position quickly and thus reduces the net cost of posting new offers. The fact that immigrants in each <b>skill</b> <b>category</b> earn less than natives reinforces this effect. Though immigrants compete with natives for these additional jobs, the overall number of new positions employers choose to create is larger than the number of additional entrants to the labor market. The effect is to lower the unemployment rate and to strengthen the bargaining position of workers.According to Georgetown University economist Anna Maria Mayda and University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri, [...] "deportation of undocumented immigrants not only threatens the day-to-day life of several million people, it also undermines the economic viability of entire sectors of the US economy." [...] Research shows that illegal immigrants complement and extend middle- and high-skilled American workers, making it possible for those sectors to employ more Americans. Without access to illegal immigrants, U.S. firms would be incentivized to offshore jobs and import foreign-produced goods. Several highly competitive sectors that depend disproportionately on illegal immigrant labor, such as agriculture, would dramatically shrink and sectors, such as hospitality and food services, would see higher prices for consumers. Regions and cities that have large illegal populations are also likely to see harms to the local economy were the illegal immigrant population removed. While Mayda and Peri note that some low-skilled American workers would see marginal gains, {{it is likely that the}} effects on net job creation and wages would be negative for the U.S. as a whole.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the relative importance of selected skills that a systems analyst may need when performing systems development tasks and the relative importance of the systems development tasks as perceived by practicing systems analysts. The impact of selected dimensions of the system development environment was also investigated by evaluating the importance of skills within different system development contexts. A survey was sent to a national sample of organizations and 134 systems analysts from 77 different organizations participated in the study. The participating systems analysts were asked to rate the relative importance of 35 selected systems analyst tasks. The systems analysts rated the tasks on a 5 -point scale from "very important" to "very unimportant. " The respondents were instructed to rate the importance of the tasks by considering how each task aided them in successfully developing and maintaining computerized information systems at their organization. After rating the 35 tasks, the systems analysts were asked to rank the relative importance of four skill categories for each task. The four skill categories assessed were interpersonal skills, technical skills, analytical skills, and communication skills. The systems analysts ranked the four skill categories for each of the 35 activities from 1 to 4. For each task, every <b>skill</b> <b>category</b> received a unique ranking. The <b>skill</b> <b>category</b> rankings were weighted by the individual task ratings to determine an overall weighted <b>skill</b> <b>category</b> ranking. The overall weighted <b>skill</b> <b>category</b> rankings were grouped and analyzed based on four dimensions of the systems analysts' typical system development environment. The size of the system developed, the interpersonal environment in which the system was developed, the reason for undertaking a system project, and the individual who typically initiates system projects were assessed to determine their impact on the relative importance of each of the four skill categories. The results showed that regardless of the dimensions of the system development environment, analytical skills were consistently ranked the most important skill by the systems analysts. Although the computed average weighted ranking for technical skills was higher than communication skills, the rankings for these two skill categories were statistically equivalent. Interpersonal skills were consistently ranked last...|$|E
