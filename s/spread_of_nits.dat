40|$|The {{influence}} of channel length and oxide thickness on the hot-carrier induced interface (Nit) and oxide (Not) trap profiles is studied in n-channel LDD MOSFET's using a novel charge pumping (CP) technique. The technique directly provides separate Nit and Not profiles without using simulation, iteration or neutralization, and has better immunity from measurement noise by avoiding numerical differentiation <b>of</b> data. The <b>Nit</b> and Not profiles obtained under {{a variety of}} stress conditions show well-defined trends with the variation in device dimensions. The Nit generation {{has been found to be}} the dominant damage mode for devices having thinner oxides and shorter channel lengths. Both the peak and <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Nit</b> profiles have been found to affect the transconductance degradation, observed over different channel lengths and oxide thicknesses. Results are presented which provide useful insight into the effect of device scaling on the hot-carrier degradation process. IEE...|$|R

To determine the concentration <b>of</b> <b>NIT</b> in pharmaceutical preparations, two cost-effective extraction-free flow injection (FI) spectrophotometric methods (direct and indirect) were studied. The direct FI method was based on the reaction <b>of</b> <b>NIT</b> with potassium hydroxide and the formation of a red/orange coloured product with absorbance measured at 471  nm. The indirect method used a reduction reaction <b>of</b> <b>NIT</b> and involved an oxidative coupling step with 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH). The second method resulted in a green coloured product with absorbance measured at 610  nm. Both direct and indirect FI methods were in agreement with Beer’s law over a concentration range of 5 – 300  µg/mL. In addition, the limit for detection of the reaction product for direct and indirect method was 1. 9 and 4. 8  µg/mL, respectively.
