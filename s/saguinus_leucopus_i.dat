Materials and methods. A full physical examination, blood work, urinalysis were conducted in all individuals during the reception health check-up, in addition to running the microagglutination test with a pool of 19 serovars, with a starting dilution of 1 : 50. Results. A high positive titer (≥ 1 : 3200) to Leptospira alexanderi serovar manhao in an asymptomatic S. oedipus was detected. All S. leucopus tested negative or less than 1 : 50. Conclusions. Captive locations have been documented to artificially enhance opportunities to {{come into contact with}} contaminated bodily fluids from peridomestic rodents. However, infectious diseases acquired during the illegal transport of wildlife to major metropolitan centers are rarely considered a wildlife conservation or public health threat.

40|$|Prosthenorchis sp. is {{a common}} acanthocephalan in {{primates}} of the genus Saguinus, which produces gastrointestinal lesions associated with chronic diarrhea and low body condition. The diagnosis is incidental and surgical removal of the parasite is necessary as a treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis and therapeutic management of a <b>Saguinus</b> <b>leucopus</b> with nodules and ileal intussusception caused by Prosthenorchis sp. During the clinical examination, the patient was depressed, prostrate, hypothermic, and presenting low body condition, with generalized skin desquamation, alopecia in the distal third of the tail, and chipped canine teeth. Abdominal palpation evidenced nodules in groins. The blood count presented leukopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia; low hemoglobin; hypochromia and mild polychromatophilia. Prostenorchis sp. eggs and strongyles were found in stool. The patient was admitted to surgery, through which ileal intussusception was detected; for this reason, an enterotomy was performed followed by end-to-side enteroenterostomy of the ileum to the antimesenteric border of the caecum. Despite the antibiotic and analgesic treatment, the patient did not improve, it went into cardiac arrest and died. The histopathologic diagnosis was fibrinous peritonitis. This was a typical clinical history of Prosthenorchis sp., in which the patient’s prognosis was bad and the outcome was not favorable, due both to parasitism and nutritional deficiencies present.

40|$|Abstract. The Lyme borreliosis agent Borrelia burgdorferi and the {{relapsing}} fever group species Borrelia miyamotoi co-occur in the United States. We used species-specific, quantitative {{polymerase chain reaction}} to study both species in the blood and skin of Peromyscus leucopus mice and host-seeking Ixodes scapularis nymphs at a Connecticut site. Bacteremias with B. burgdorferi or B. miyamotoi were most prevalent during periods of greatest activity for nymphs or larvae, respectively. Whereas B. burgdorferi was 30 -fold more frequent than B. miyamotoi in skin biopsies and mice had higher densities of B. burgdorferi densities in the skin than in the blood, B. miyamotoi densities were higher in blood than skin. In a survey of host-seeking nymphs in 11 northern states, infection prevalences for B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi averaged ~ 0. 20 and ~ 0. 02, respectively.

40|$|Climate-induced {{ecological}} {{replacement of}} P. m. gracilis by P. leucopus {{has been documented}} with long-term studies in the Great Lakes Region. Gradually warming winters over the last 30 - 40 years in this area have facilitated northward range expansion of P. leucopus, and communities in which P. leucopus and P. m. gracilis co-occur have become characterized by strong numerical dominance of P. <b>leucopus.</b> <b>I</b> conducted a three year field study of syntopic P. leucopus and P. m. gracilis in northern Michigan to identify niche differences and investigate the mechanisms by which these differences facilitate ecological replacement. P. leucopus consistently experienced a longer breeding season than P. m. gracilis. P. leucopus and P. m. gracilis also differed in the survivorship of overwintered mice. This results in differences in the relative contributions of overwintered and young-of-year females to annual reproductive output, and may be a previously unreported niche difference between species. Ecological replacement of P. m. gracilis by P. leucopus results from the interaction between environmental conditions, niche differences, and species interactions. Abundance differed strongly in {{two out of three}} years, with P. leucopus outnumbering P. m. gracilis in 2011 and 2012. Increases in abundance of P. leucopus are well explained by enhanced survival conferred by increasingly warming conditions. Reproductive output in P. leucopus is highly dependent upon reproduction by overwintered females. Mild winters allow for increased abundance of breeding females in the spring and more favorable breeding conditions which facilitate successful early reproduction and lower mortality. The role of interspecific competition in ecological replacement in this species pair has not been previously investigated, and the role of competition in regulation of population growth remains unclear. Nevertheless, there was evidence that interspecific competition may influence replacement. Declining abundance of P. m. gracilis was caused by reduced reproduction by young-of-year females rather than by changes in survival, and these phenomena may be better explained by interspecific social interactions than by environmental conditions alone. Increasingly warm winters may shift the competitive balance in this community to favor P. leucopus by allowing this species to establish territories earlier than P. m. gracilis...|$|R
40|$|Shriver, W. GregoryBuler, JeffreyUrbanization {{and human}} {{development}} are accelerating globally, rapidly changing surrounding ecosystems. Urbanization-induced changes to biotic and abiotic processes affect wildlife populations and the dynamics of associated infectious diseases. In this dissertation, I explore how features of urban forest fragments in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States impact the ecology of zoonotic tick-borne disease systems. In Chapter 1, I describe the relationship between nonnative woody plant invasion and the abundance of host-seeking nymphal blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) at two spatial scales. Within forest fragments with significant nonnative plant invasion in the understory, I. scapularis are aggregated within patches of invasive plants. At the forest fragment scale, however, invasion by nonnative plants is associated with loss of leaf litter, which reduces habitat quality for I. scapularis. Thus, at the broader, forest fragment scale, I. scapularis are found in higher abundance in forests without nonnative plant invasion. In Chapter 2, I characterize prevalence of four zoonotic tick-borne pathogens in northern Delaware, and I study the vegetation and landscape factors that determine prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, among host-seeking I. scapularis. Nonnative plant invasion and several habitat features specific to small mammal and bird host niches increase the prevalence of B. burgdorferi. In a comparison of invaded and uninvaded forest fragments, B. burgdorferi prevalence is nearly twice as high among ticks from invaded forests compared to ticks from uninvaded forests. In Chapter 3, I investigate urban forest fragment characteristics that influence the distribution and abundance of an important reservoir host for B. burgdorferi, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus <b>leucopus).</b> <b>I</b> also model habitat and landscape features that promote interactions between P. leucopus and immature stages of I. scapularis, and ultimately could amplify infection prevalence. In spring, landscape variables have the greatest influence on P. leucopus distributions, but in fall a combination of landscape and habitat variables explain P. leucopus abundance. Both intrinsic P. leucopus traits and extrinsic habitat features predict the tick burdens found on P. leucopus individuals in spring and summer. In Chapter 4, I focus on population vital rates in urban forest fragments of another important group of tick hosts, ground-foraging passerine birds. Specifically, I estimate cumulative survival rates of Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) during the post-fledging stage, and I model how behavior and anthropogenic hazards in an urban landscape affect mortality risk. Gray Catbird fledglings have approximately half the survival rate of Wood Thrushes; but for both species, mortality risk increases as individuals cross more roads and become exposed to more anthropogenic hazards. Overall, urbanization has complex, cascading effects on wildlife populations and tick-borne disease dynamics. Given the heterogeneity of urban forest fragments, both topics warrant further study with careful attention {{to the issue of}} scale.

40|$|Members of 18 {{species of}} ticks, mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies were {{collected}} in southeastern Connecticut and tested by indirect fluorescent-antibody staining methods for Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. An infection rate of 36. 2 % (116 tested), recorded for immature Ixodes dammini, exceeded positivity values for all other arthropod species. Prevalence of infection for hematophagous insects ranged from 2. 9 % of 105 Hybomitra lasiophthalma to 14. 3 % of seven Hybomitra epistates.

40|$|The tick-borne flavivirus, Powassan virus (POWV) causes {{life-threatening}} encephalitis {{in humans}} in North America and Europe. POWV is transmitted by ixodid tick vectors that feed on small to medium-sized mammals, such as Peromyscus leucopus mice, which {{may serve as}} either reservoir, bridge or amplification hosts. Intraperitoneal and intracranial inoculation of 4 -week old Peromyscus leucopus mice with 103 PFU of POWV {{did not result in}} overt clinical signs of disease. However, following intracranial inoculation, infected mice seroconverted to POWV and histopathological examinations revealed that the mice uniformly developed mild lymphocytic perivascular cuffing and microgliosis in the brain and spinal cord from 5 to 15 days post infection (dpi), suggesting an early inflammatory response. In contrast, intracranial inoculation of 4 -week old C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice was lethal by 5 dpi. Intraperitoneal inoculation was lethal in BALB/c mice, but 40 % (2 / 5) of C 57 BL/ 6 mice survived. We concluded that Peromyscus <b>leucopus</b> mice infected <b>i.</b> c. with a lethal dose of POWV support a limited infection, restricted to the central nervous system and mount an antibody response to the virus. However, they fail to develop clinical signs of disease and are able to control the infection.

40|$|In {{the northeastern}} United States, the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, is {{maintained}} by enzoonotic transmission, cycling between white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is genetically variable {{and has been}} divided into three major genotypes based on 16 S- 23 S ribosomal DNA spacer (RST) analysis. To better understand how genetic differences in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may influence transmission dynamics in nature, we investigated the interaction between an RST 1 and an RST 3 strain in a laboratory system with P. <b>leucopus</b> mice and <b>I.</b> scapularis ticks. Two groups of mice were infected with either BL 206 (RST 1) or B 348 (RST 3). Two weeks later, experimental mice were challenged with the opposite strain, while control mice were challenged with the same strain as that used for the primary infection. The transmission of BL 206 and B 348 from infected mice was then determined by xenodiagnosis with uninfected larval ticks at weekly intervals for 42 days. Mice in both experimental groups were permissive for infection with the second strain {{and were able to}} transmit both strains to the xenodiagnostic ticks. However, the overall transmission efficiencies of BL 206 and B 348 were significantly different. BL 206 was more efficiently transmitted than B 348 to xenodiagnostic ticks. Significantly fewer double infections than expected were detected in xenodiagnostic ticks. The results suggest that some B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, such as BL 206, may be preferentially maintained in transmission cycles between ticks and white-footed mice. Other strains, such as B 348, may be more effectively maintained in different tick-vertebrate transmission cycles...|$|R
