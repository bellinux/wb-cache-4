5|$|Similarities that lemurs {{share with}} anthropoid primates, such as diet and <b>social</b> <b>organization,</b> {{along with their}} own unique traits, have made lemurs the most heavily studied of all mammal groups on Madagascar. Research often focuses on the link between ecology and <b>social</b> <b>organization,</b> but also on their {{behavior}} and morphophysiology (the study of anatomy in relation to function). Studies of their life-history traits, behavior and ecology help understanding of primate evolution, since they are thought to share similarities with ancestral primates.|$|E

Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting <b>social</b> <b>organization</b> and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has {{much to say about}} perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|E

In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the <b>social</b> <b>organization</b> at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality.

In such context, we need to know if the mission of the organization has an impact on employment integration, and more particularly for low-skilled workers. This article uses the economic literature in order to compare <b>social</b> and for-profit <b>organization</b> about the employment integration of their low-skilled workers. This literature review has highlighted the specificities of <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> which may influence employment integration. First, it is showed that the social values sustained by the mission of <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> could be a source of intrinsic motivation that may imply a higher satisfaction at work and lower wages. Secondly, the organizational structure implemented by <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> should be slightly different since these structures have to be adapted to the mission of the organization and workers motivations...|$|R

Among the sources that the authors used to compose Geographia Neoteriki, were the Géographie Moderne by Nicolle de La Croix, the Géographie Ancienne, and the Géographie Moderne, which were part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke. Additionally, the authors had personally examined the areas described in the work.

The island of Carriacou is home to a calypso-like song style, as well as canboulay feasts, calinda songs and steel bands, all similar to though distinct from the related Trinidadian traditions. Modern influences from Trinidad have organized the Carriacou song style, and there are competitions similar to calypso tents on the island. The Antiguan benna is part of the same song complex, featuring news-oriented and ribald, often satirical lyrics and a rhythmic, uptempo style.|$|E

30|$|Secondly, <b>social</b> service <b>organizations</b> {{have few}} resources, {{leading to a}} one-way {{dependence}} on the government. In recent years, <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> in China have undergone explosive growth because of the government procurement of services (Wang et al. 2014). Government funding is an important contributor {{to the development of}} <b>social</b> <b>organizations.</b> But the “state-society” relationship, in which the “society” is controlled by the “state,” has not been changed, and the state takes entire control of the new economic environment in a “non-governmental” way (Kang and Han 2005). Salamon (2008) believes that government funding does not weaken the independence of the nonprofit sector because in the USA, private donations {{play an important role in}} sustaining nonprofits. However, in China, <b>social</b> <b>organizations</b> currently lack <b>social</b> resources because they have little public property (Wang and Liu 2007), and this leads to <b>social</b> service <b>organizations</b> having the one-way dependence on the government. Basically, <b>social</b> service <b>organizations</b> are restricted and cannot raise money from the society.|$|R

However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the <b>social</b> <b>organization</b> of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass <b>social</b> <b>organization</b> or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E

Although powered by violence, the Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region.

The Song government supported social welfare programs including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers' graveyards. The Song dynasty supported a widespread postal service that was modeled on the earlier Han dynasty (202 BCE – CE 220) postal system to provide swift communication throughout the empire. The central government employed thousands of postal workers of various ranks to provide service for post offices and larger postal stations. In rural areas, farming peasants either owned their own plots of land, paid rents as tenant farmers, or were serfs on large estates.|$|E
