40|$|Summary: The protein pättern of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) of 334 patients with various neurological and systemic diseases was investigated by high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE). 2 -DE gels of normal CSF contain piroteins {{which are not}} detectable in 2 -DE gels of serum. Disturbances of the blood-brain or blood^CSF barrier, and degenerative diseases {{of the brain and}} malignant diseases produce specific changes on 2 -DE gels of the CSF. The appearance of 10 <b>spot</b> <b>areas</b> in the light chain region of 2 -DE gels seem to be connected with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The sensitivity and the specificity of these <b>spot</b> <b>areas</b> for the diagnosis of multiple jsclerosis are described.

This temperature increase {{results in a}} strain that can be estimated by multiplying it with the linear {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the film. Usually, a typical magnitude value of the acoustic pulse will be small, and for long propagation nonlinear effects could become important. But propagation of such short duration pulses will suffer acoustic attenuation if the temperature is not very low (Ref B). Thus, this method is most efficient with the utilization of surface acoustic waves, and studies on investigation of this method toward lateral structures are being conducted.|$|E
50|$|While {{studying}} guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in Trinidad, biologist John Endler detected selection {{at work on}} {{the fish}} populations. To rule out alternative possibilities, Endler set up a highly controlled experiment to mimic the natural habitat by constructing ten ponds within a laboratory greenhouse at Princeton University. Each pond contained gravel to exactly match that of the natural ponds. After capturing a random sample of guppies from ponds in Trinidad, he raised and mixed them to create similar genetically diverse populations and measured each fish (spot length, spot height, <b>spot</b> <b>area,</b> relative spot length, relative spot height, total patch area, and standard body lengths). For the experiment he added Crenicichla alta (P. reticulatas main predator) in four of the ponds, Rivulus hartii (a non-predator fish) in four of the ponds, and left the remaining two ponds empty with only the guppies. After 10 generations, comparisons were made between each ponds guppy populations and measurements were taken again. Endler found that the populations had evolved dramatically different color patterns in the control and non-predator pools and drab color patterns in the predator pool. Predation pressure had caused a selection against standing out from background gravel.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{limitations}} {{in the study were}} that a high level of coordinates did not match. This was because the raw data was collected by various agencies and for different purposes. The method of analysis was to calculate the hotspot ellipses through the implementation of Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Crime (STAC). Eck and Weisburb (1995) define the process of how STAC works “STAC hot <b>spot</b> <b>area</b> searches begin with individual pin map data and build areas that reflect the actual scatter of events, regardless of arbitrary or predefined boundaries. STAC finds the densest clusters of events in the map and calculates the standard deviational ellipse that best fits each cluster.” (p. 154). It was determined that the number of liquor stores and liquor related businesses were not randomly dispersed in the area. They were generally located in clusters along major roads. This supports the idea that hotspots may contain different arrangements of crime. After the hotspots were identified by the researchers, they continued to examine the hotspots arrangement and took a look at some specific address level crime concentrations. The study found that high concentrations of taverns or liquor stores do not necessarily produce high levels of crime. It concluded that there were places that were responsible for higher levels of crime than others. Therefore, not all crime concentrations are equally generators of crime. Some crime places have environmental cues that facilitate the occurrence and sustainment of crime victimization.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, the {{activity}} of the eclipsing binary AB And is examined by analysing the photometric data covering the period from 1968 till 1995. The light curves corresponding to this period show significant differences and asymmetries, which are especially conspicuous in the height of the light-curve maxima and in the part following the secondary maximum {{as well as in the}} depth of the primary light-curve minimum. To explain the light asymmetries and variations, we used a model that involves spotted regions on the components. The analysis shows that AB And is in overcontact configuration (f over ∼ 15 %). The Roche model with single <b>spotted</b> <b>areas</b> on both components yields a good fit of the observations for the whole set of the analysed light curves without any changes of the basic system’s parameters. This indicates that the complex nature of the light-curve variations during the examined period can be almost completely explained by the development and motion of the <b>spotted</b> <b>areas</b> on the components. According to the obtained results the <b>spotted</b> <b>areas</b> are probably formed at high latitudes and cover a significant part of the stellar surface; the change of their locations and sizes with time is examined...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a {{preliminary}} review of institutional data against hot and cold <b>spot</b> <b>areas</b> identified in the recent Social Mobility Index (SMI) (Social Mobility Commission, 2016). The review sought to explore {{the extent to which}} Open University (OU) students from the lowest quintiles of the POLAR 3 classification were represented in the SMI cold <b>spot</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on the premise that geographic mobility is a challenge for many disadvantaged students (Reay et al., 2001), a link between OU students from the lowest quintiles (one and two) and the cold spots may suggest that the opportunities open to them upon completion of their degree are limited. This potentially has implications for all HE providers if the HE sector is serious about tackling the dramatic decline in part-time student numbers over recent years (Butcher, 2015). The review found that in the bottom 10 cold <b>spot</b> <b>areas</b> POLAR 3 classification for OU students was predominantly within quintiles one or two and in the top 10 hot spots, quintiles four and five. Drawing on literature around the challenges for disadvantaged students, including mature and part-time, the implications of this were subsequently explored through a case study of the industrial town of Corby in the East Midlands area of England...|$|R

To ex-pand the film application, formation of oxygen {{deficiencies in the}} film {{was one of the}} useful meth-ods. Electrical resistance of the film can be decreased due to oxygen deficiencies formation. The lo-cal heating process in vacuum is a useful method to create the oxygen deficiencies in local area of the film. Electrical resistance might be locally decreased by local heating with a CW fiber laser. In our experiment, the films were irradiated with the laser in vacuum. Control of temperature on the film was very important for reducing the electrical resistance. Therefore, temperature monitoring of the laser focusing <b>spot</b> <b>area</b> on the film was performed. Temperature of the laser focusing <b>spot</b> <b>area</b> was increased as the laser intensity was increased.
