5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It {{has been argued that}} Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link is based on the interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E

25|$|The main {{factor that}} {{encourages}} cyber bullying {{is the fact}} that a cyber bully can hide behind the shield of online anonymity.

25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. It {{is very hard to}} <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> this fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|E

25|$|Although Cage started {{painting}} in his youth, {{he gave it}} up in order to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, Not Wanting to <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>About</b> Marcel, dates from 1969. The work comprises two lithographs {{and a group of}} what Cage called plexigrams: silk screen printing on plexiglas panels. The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.|$|E
25|$|I {{asked him}} what work he wanted done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed on the right lower {{forehead}} between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one {{to the left of}} the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the fingers that day to me.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} issues that the Court did not address in Quanta. One such omission is the Court’s failure to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the other possible formats that this transaction might have used—such as a sale by a manufacturing licensee with a limitation on its grant, or (alternatively) a sale by the patentee or its licensee with explicit restrictions imposed on the buyer's freedom to dispose of the product. The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.|$|E

Scott will not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> theTenandrome mission, except {{to confirm that the}} survey ship found something and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the Tenadrome had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the problem}} in this debate {{revolved}} around the high level of abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic model-building on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied predictions about the real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club, The Humane Society, and the Eco-Justice Program {{have all}} officially {{endorsed}} the Green Bible. Reaction to the Green Bible among Christian leaders has been mixed. Some leaders have praised {{the concept of}} the Green Bible, but have raised issues with how some content is presented, stating that the environmental message deemphasizes the Bible’s central message of the Gospels. Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission said about the edition: “Sure it's important, but when they asked Jesus what was most important, he said, 'Love your God, and love your neighbor as yourself.' He didn't <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> creation”.|$|E

The Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh provides a story in which Brian challenges High King Máel Sechnaill to a battle at the Hill of Tara {{in the province of}} Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. Máel Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E
25|$|According to Greek {{accounts}} Xandrammes was deposed by Sandrokottos, son of Sandrokottos. Chandragupta Maurya {{had opposed}} Dhanananda of the Nanda dynasty; {{his son was}} Bindusara. These names (Dhanananda and Bindusara) are dissimilar to the names Xandrammes and Sandrocyptus in the Greek accounts. However, {{as in the case}} of Amitraghata (Bindusara), Greek sources mention secondary (Sanskritic) names for Indian kings. The Greek accounts contain statements from Greek and Roman writers from the fourth century BC to the second century CE. None mention Kautilya or Ashoka. Kautilya, according to tradition, helped Chandragupta to the throne. Ashoka's empire was larger than Chandragupta's. Colebrook has pointed out that the Greek writers did not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the Buddhist Bhikkhus (although that was the predominant religion of the time) due to Ashoka's patronage. Herodotos, in his Histories, about 420 BC, mentions ascetics in the Punjab.|$|E

25|$|Following this success, Crowe {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for 1984's The Wild Life, the pseudo-sequel to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers' lives in high school, The Wild Life traced {{the lives of}} several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex. Filmmaker James L. Brooks noticed Crowe's original voice and {{wanted to work with}} him. Brooks executive produced Crowe's first directing effort, 1989's <b>Say</b> <b>Anything...,</b> <b>about</b> a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. Though it could have easily ended up a formulaic teen love story, Say Anything... got glowing reception from critics. They applauded the way Crowe crafted an intriguing and insightful tale that also involved the girl's relationship with her father and how it is threatened when she discovers he is caught up in a shady business deal.|$|E

25|$|According to Altekar, {{there is}} no mention of actual sati in the period of Brahmana {{literature}} (c. 1500–700 BCE) and the later Grhyusutras, roughly composed 600–300 BCE on a number of rituals, but sati is not described or mentioned. In fact, what is written about funeral customs, is that the widow is brought back from the funeral pyre, typically by a trusted servant. Altekar thinks it significant that Gautama Buddha, who castigated customs of animal sacrifice, and other customs where pain was inflicted, is entirely silent about burning women alive. Altekar takes these elements as proofs that burning widows alive had long ago died out as a practice. Nor do the authors of the Dharmasutras (c. 400 BCE–100 BCE) or Yajnavalkya (c. 100 CE–300 CE) <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it being commendable to burn a widow alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although we have late fourth-century BCE evidence from Greek authors and the Mahabarata for the 'existence' of the custom of sati, Altekar thinks it did not really begin to grow in popularity before 400 CE, by the manner of which it is infrequently mentioned in the Puranas of that time. A very early attested case from 510 CE is that of the wife of Goparaja, who immolated herself with her dead husband, according to the Eran inscription of king Bhanugupta, with another similar case attested from 606 CE. As the custom grew in popularity, Altekar highlights as determined opponents of this aristocratic custom in particular 7th-century poet Bāṇabhaṭṭa, but also 9th-century theologian Medhātithi and 12th-century Devana Bhatta. In Altekar's view, their crusades against the custom were largely unsuccessful.|$|E
