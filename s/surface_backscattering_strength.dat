40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe sound propagation {{conditions in the}} central part of the Black Sea were investigated. Profiles of temperature and salinity were generated by averaging data from the U. S. National Oceanographic Data Center over monthly periods. Wilson's equation was used to compute sound velocities and a digital computer program provided plots of sound velocity versus depth and selected ray trace diagrams. Seasonal temperature, salinity and sound velocity variations are found only in the upper layer of the Black Sea. Below 125 m, seasonal variations are insignificant. A well defined sound channel exists in the Black Sea that is caused by a cold intermediate layer. Therefore, a seasonal convergence zone is observed during the months of May, November and December.

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to develop a seabed map of {{the region of the}} Pelotas Basin using {{acoustic}} methods. A total number of 1, 507, 823 seabed reflectivity data, collected during six oceanographic surveys, were processed to generate a seabed map. Data processing consisted of the classification of the acoustic parameter BSBS (Bottom <b>Surface</b> <b>Backscattering</b> <b>Strength)</b> obtained with the Scientific Echosounder EK 500 operating at a frequency of 38 kHz. BSBS is expressed in decibels (dB), and corresponds to a logarithm of the ratio between incident acoustic energy and the energy reflected by the seabed. Four BSBS value classes, associated with different sediment types, were established. High BSBS values are associated with coarse sediments, whereas low values indicate fine sediments. A seabed reflectivity map was generated using the Natural Neighbor method to interpolate the BSBS values organized according to the pre-established classes. Four features with high BSBS values were identified at 100 - 200 m depth. The largest one was found in the region of Santa Marta Cape and attributed mainly to consolidated seabed and/or the presence of biodetritic material, according to comparison with maps available in the literature. Above 500 m depth, there was a predominance of acoustically low reflectivity sea floor, which was attributed to the presence of muddy sediment. Considering the lack of information on the seabed at great depths, the acousti...|$|E

First a method is described to improve the instrument depth measurements using the binned backscattered energy profile near the surface. The accuracy of the depth estimates is found to be significantly better than 0. 5 m. Further, improvements of wind speed estimates were found by using the ambient noise in the 150 -kHz band in favor of the <b>surface</b> <b>backscattered</b> energy as suggested by Schott. Limitations of the ambient sound method at low wind speeds are presented when thermal noise overwhelms the wind-induced noise. Finally, a method to detect the presence of sea ice above the ADCP is presented by cross correlating the <b>surface</b> <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> and the magnitudes of all Doppler velocity components.

40|$|Radar {{measurements}} at 70 cm and 7. 5 m wavelengths {{provide insight}} into the structure and chemical properties of the upper 5 - 100 m of the lunar regolith and crust. Past work has identified a number of anomalous regions and changes in echo strength, some attributed to differences in titanium content. There has been little opportunity, however, to compare calibrated long-wavelength backscatter among different units or to theoretical model results. We combine recent high-resolution (3 - 5 km) 70 -cm radar data for the nearside with earlier calibrated full-disk observations to provide a reasonable estimate of the true lunar backscatter coefficient. These data are tested against models for quasi-specular scattering from the surface, echoes from a buried substrate, and Mie scattering from surface and buried rocks. We find that 70 cm echoes likely arise from Mie scattering by distributed rocks within the soil, consistent with earlier hypotheses. Returns from a buried substrate would provide a plausible fit to the observations only if the regolith depth were ~ 3 m or less and varied little across the maria. Depolarized echoes are due to some combination of single and multiple scattering events, but it appears that single scattering alone could account for the observed echo power, based on comparisons with terrestrial rocky <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> from the regolith is most strongly affected by the loss tangent, whose variation with mineral content is still poorly defined. We compared the backscatter values for the mare deposits to the oxide contents inferred from spectral ratio methods, and found that in general the unit boundaries evident in radar images closely follow those seen in color difference images. The 70 -cm data are not well correlated with TiO 2 values found using the Charette relationship nor with Fe abundances derived from Clementine observations. The lack of a relationship between radar echo and Fe content is reasonable given the distribution of iron among various mineral phases, but ilmenite content (FeTiO 3) has typically been cited as the dominant cause of changes in loss tangent (and thus the radar absorption). The lack of correlation between the radar data and TiO 2 estimates may arise from uncertainties in the Charette technique, subtle differences in the upper surface and bulk properties of the regolith, mineralogic effects on the radar not linked to titanium content, or to some combination of these factors. Dark crater haloes in the mare and highlands, and low radar returns from apparent cryptomare regions, are used to illustrate the role radar data can play in identifying changes in regolith composition; low-return haloes around craters such as Petavius may indicate 5 - 25 % contamination of the highlands soil by excavated mare material or a layer of rock-poor ejecta at least several meters deep. The 7. 5 -m data were shown to correlate to a reasonable degree with estimates of Fe abundance, suggesting that this component of the mare basalts is primarily responsible for attenuation losses at very long wavelengths. The different sensitivities of the two radar wavelengths and multispectral data offers the potential for future deep mapping of the mare lava flows and regolith...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and examine the use of {{backscatter}} data collected with multibeam sonar (MBS) systems for benthic habitat mapping. Backscatter data were collected from six sites around the Australian coastal zone using the Reson SeaBat 8125 MBS system operating at 455 kHz. Benthic habitats surveyed in this study included: seagrass meadows, rhodolith beds, coral reef, rock, gravel, sand, muddy sand, and mixtures of those habitats. Methods for processing MBS backscatter data were developed for the Coastal Water Habitat Mapping (CWHM) project by a team from the Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST). The CMST algorithm calculates the seafloor <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> derived from the peak and integral (or average) intensity of backscattered signals for each beam. The seafloor <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> estimated from the mean value of the integral backscatter intensity was shown in this study to provide an accurate measurement of the actual <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> of the seafloor and its angular dependence. However, the seafloor <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> derived from the peak intensity was found to be overestimated when the sonar insonification area is significantly smaller than the footprint of receive beams, which occurs primarily at oblique angles. The angular dependence of the mean <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> showed distinct differences between hard rough substrates (such as rock and coral reef), seagrass, coarse sediments and fine sediments. The highest <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> was observed not only for the hard and rough substrate, but also for marine vegetation, such as rhodolith and seagrass. The main difference in acoustic backscatter from the different habitats was the mean level, or angle-average <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength.</b> However, additional information can also be obtained from the slope of the angular dependence of <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength.</b> It was shown that the distribution of the backscatter. The shape parameter was shown to relate to the ratio of the insonification area (which can be interpreted as an elementary scattering cell) to the footprint size rather than to the angular dependence of <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength.</b> When this ratio is less than 5, the gamma shape parameter is very similar for different habitats and is nearly linearly proportional to the ratio. Above a ratio of 5, the gamma shape parameter is not significantly dependent on the ratio and there is a noticeable difference in this parameter between different seafloor types. A new approach to producing images of backscatter properties, introduced and referred to as the angle cube method, was developed. The angle cube method uses spatial interpolation to construct a three-dimensional array of backscatter data that is a function of X-Y coordinates and the incidence angle. This allows the spatial visualisation of backscatter properties to be free from artefacts of the angular dependence and provides satisfactory estimates of the backscatter characteristics. Using the angle-average <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> and slope of the angular dependence, derived by the angle cube method, in addition to seafloor terrain parameters, habitat probability and classification maps were produced to show distributions of sand, marine vegetation (e. g. seagrass and rhodolith) and hard substrate (e. g. coral and bedrock) for five different survey areas. Ultimately, this study demonstrated that the combination of high-resolution bathymetry and <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> data, as collected by MBS, is an efficient and cost-effective tool for benthic habitat mapping in costal zones...|$|R

In addition to parameters such as water depth, knowledge about the sediment properties is of high importance {{for a wide range}} of operations. In this context, the MREA BP' 07 experiment was carried out in the Mediterranean Sea in 2007. Measurements employed a large set of sensors, thereby providing all information required to fully describe the environment. This paper focuses on multibeam echosounder (MBES) measurements, which were taken not only to provide information about the water depths, but also to provide the <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> as a function of angle. These backscatter data are employed to infer sediment parameters. To this end, a comparison of measured and modeled <b>backscatter</b> <b>strengths</b> is conducted. Use is made of a model that accounts for both scattering at the water-sediment interface and scattering and scattering at the inhomogeneities in the sediment, i. e. volume scattering. In practice, the measured <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> values are affected by the imperfect MBES calibration. This impedes a direct model-data comparison, unless the effects of miscalibration are eliminated. Therefore, a calibration curve is derived by optimizing spectral strength and volume parameter, according to known mean grain sizes at bottom grab positions.

Adaptions to achieve both vertical (0 °) and non-vertical inclination (1 – 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 60 °) comprise mechanical tilting of the acoustic transducer and electronic beam steering. Data were acquired at 18 m water depth at a study site characterized by a flat, muddy seafloor where a 0. 1 m diameter power cable lies 1 – 2 m below the seafloor. Surveying the cable with vertical incidence revealed that the buried cable can hardly be discriminated against the <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength</b> of the layered mud.

The size of the cable echo pattern increases linearly with incidence. These effects are attributed to reflection loss from layered mud at larger incidence and to the scattering of the 0. 1 m diameter buried cable.

Backscatter signals corrected from system-related gain, etc., reveal better correlations with sedimentary and benthic parameters than the estimated coherence parameters (using echo peaks). Statistically, correlations are significant for the 210 kHz backscatter signal with sand and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) sediment content. Also, correlations are higher for macrobenthic biomass (wet weight) and population density with a 210 kHz <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength,</b> emphasizing the dominant seawater-seafloor interface scattering process. For 33 kHz <b>backscatter</b> <b>strength,</b> the absence of such correlations indicates a different scattering processes, i. e. dominant sediment volume scattering attributable to the comparatively lower signal attenuation. Additionally, to validate the results, the backscatter signal from other locations in the vicinity of this transect were considered...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{backscattering}} {{and reflection}} from water-saturated granular sediments at frequencies from 150 kHz to 8 MHz at normal and oblique incidence was studied in controlled laboratory conditions. Two kinds of natural sediments, well sorted medium and coarse sands and two comprised with glass beads of corresponding grain size, were taken for the study, degassed, and their surface was flattened. At oblique incidence, intrinsic scattering {{due to the}} sediment granular structure {{can be considered as}} a dominating mechanism of backscatter. Comparison of frequency dependencies of the <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> for sediments with different mean grain size shows the existence of a scaling effect that allows a description of the <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> as a scaling function of one parameter, the mean grain size/wavelength ratio. Comparisons with previous results obtained for moderately sorted sands shows effects of the grain size distribution width. Comparisons for sand and glass beads of the same size demonstrate effects of the grain shape. Possible applications to remote sensing of marine sediments, and particularly determining the sediment mean grain size, are discussed. [Work supported by ONR and CNRS]...|$|R

40|$|Three {{decades of}} {{continuous}} ocean exploration have {{led us to}} identify subsurface fluid related processes as a key phenomenon in marine earth science research. The number of seep areas located on the seafloor has been constantly increasing {{with the use of}} multi-scale imagery techniques. Due to recent advances in transducer technology and computer processing, multibeam echosounders are now commonly used to detect submarine gas seeps escaping from the seafloor into the water column. A growing number of en-route surveys shows that sites of gas emissions escaping from the seafloor are much more numerous than previously thought. Estimating the temporal variability of the gas flow rate and volumes escaping from the seafloor has thus become a challenge of relevant interest which could be addressed by sea-floor continuous acoustic monitoring. Here, we investigate the feasibility of estimating the volumetric flow rates of gas emissions from horizontal backscattered acoustic signals. Different models based on the acoustic backscattering theory of bubbles are presented. The forward volume <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> and the inversion volumetric flow rate solutions were validated with acoustic measurements from artificial gas flow rates generated in controlled sea-water tank experiments. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the behavior of the 120 -kHz forward solution with respect to model input parameters (horizontal distance between transducer and bubble stream, bubble size distribution and ascent rate). The most sensitive parameter was found to be the distance of the bubble stream which can affect the volume <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> by 20 dB within the horizontal range of 0 – 200 m. Results were used to derive the detection probability of a bubble stream for a given volume <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> threshold according to different bubble flow rates and horizontal distance...|$|R
30|$|Lunar Radar Sounder (LRS) is a {{spaceborne}} HF {{radar system}} {{and is a}} science mission of Japanese lunar exploration project, SELENE, {{which is scheduled to}} be launched in 2005. The primary objective of LRS is to investigate the geologic structure of lunar subsurface from orbit. Computer simulations of LRS observation of lunar mare region have been carried out by utilizing a newly developed simulation code, the Kirchhoff-approximation Sounding Simulation (KiSS) code. The purpose of the simulations is {{to understand the nature of}} reflection/refraction of HF wave at the lunar surface as well as at the lunar subsurface boundary, and to confirm that the lunar subsurface structure can be investigated from orbit by means of an HF radar. Gaussian random rough surfaces are employed to represent the surface feature of a lunar mare region. From simulation results, we have found that the power flux of both surface nadir echo and subsurface nadir echo vary little if roughness of either/both surface or/and subsurface boundary interface changes. However, their intensity of <b>surface</b> off-nadir <b>backscattering</b> echo varies following a power law of (kσ 0) 2, where k is the wave number of LRS transmission pulse, and σ 0 is the RMS height of the surface. Thus slight roughness of the surface causes significant increase of the power flux of <b>surface</b> offnadir <b>backscattering</b> echo, which easily masks weak subsurface echoes. These observations have been understood qualitatively by geometrical optics approximation and quantitatively by examining the Stratton’s integral formula in an analytic way. Computer simulations have revealed that subsurface echoes are received even if they are completely masked by <b>surface</b> off-nadir <b>backscattering</b> echo. To distinguish those subsurface echoes from strong <b>surface</b> <b>backscattering</b> echo, the data stacking technique has been proved to be effective on reducing <b>surface</b> <b>backscattering</b> echoes due to their random nature.|$|R
40|$|Bragg {{scattering}} {{is widely}} recognized as the dominant mechanism by which the ocean <b>surface</b> <b>backscatters</b> microwave radiation, but efforts to identify other, non-Bragg sources of this scattering have been pursued for many years. Non-Bragg backscattering from the sea surface is known to occur at incidence angles close to 0 ◦ and 90 ◦. In this paper Bragg scattering is shown to explain most features of sea <b>surface</b> <b>backscatter</b> for incidence angles between about 20 ◦ and 80 ◦, except when it predicts very small mean cross sections. The often-quoted evidence for non-Bragg scattering in this incidence angle range is that σo(HH) is occasionally found to be larger {{than or equal to}} σo(VV) for short integration times. We show that because of fading this is not evidence of non-Bragg scattering. For incidence angles up to about 50 ◦, standard Bragg/composite surface scattering theory yields probabilities of finding σo(HH) > σo(VV) that are only slightly smaller than those found experimentally. As the incidence angle increases, greater differences betwee...|$|R
40|$|We measure weak {{quasiparticle}} tunneling {{across a}} constriction {{in the second}} Landau level. At ν = 7 / 3, 8 / 3 and 5 / 2, comparison of temperature and DC bias dependence to weak tunneling theory allows extracting parameters that describe the edges' quasiparticle excitations. At ν = 8 / 3, our results are well described by a particle-hole conjugate Laughlin state, but not compatible with proposed non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations. For ν = 5 / 2, our measurements are in good agreement with previous experiments and favor the Abelian (3, 3, 1) or (1, 1, 3) -states. At these filling factors, we further investigate {{the influence of the}} <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> on the extracted scaling parameters. For ν = 7 / 3, the <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> strongly affects the scaling parameters, whereas quasiparticle tunneling at ν = 8 / 3 and 5 / 2 appears more robust.

40|$|Three {{years of}} 300 kHz {{acoustic}} doppler current profiler data {{collected in the}} central Ligurian Sea are analysed to investigate the variability of the zooplankton biomass and the diel vertical migration in the upper thermocline. After a pre-processing phase aimed at avoiding the slant range attenuation, hourly volume <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> time series are obtained. Despite the lack of concurrent net samples collection, different migration patterns are identified and their temporal variability examined by means of time–frequency analysis. The effect {{of changes in the}} environmental condition is also investigated. The highest zooplankton biomasses are observed in April–May just after the peak of surface primary production in March–April. The main migration pattern found here points to a "nocturnal" migration, with zooplankton organisms occurring deeper in the water column during the day and shallower at night. Also, twilight migration is highlighted during this study. The largest migrations are recorded in November–December, corresponding to lowest <b>backscattering</b> <b>strength</b> values and they are likely attributable to larger and more active organisms (i. e. euphausiids and mesopelagic fish).
