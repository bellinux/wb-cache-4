25|$|Bitter orange (Citrus aurantium), {{also known}} as Seville orange, sour orange (especially when used as {{rootstock}} for a <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> tree), bigarade orange and marmalade orange. Like the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange,</b> it is a pomelo x mandarin hybrid.|$|E

25|$|An {{enormous}} number of cultivars have, like the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange,</b> a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.|$|E

Shortly afterward, the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> quickly was adopted as an edible fruit.

D-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans, to very toxic to marine life in different countries.|$|E

ABSTRACT: Aims: This study focused on the assessment and identification of key insect pests on <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> (Citrus sinensis) plantation in Tony farm of Dire Dawa town. It was also explain the abundance of key pests and effective controlling methods. Methodology and Results: The farm lands of <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> stratified in to nursery stage and adult stage by using stratification method technique. Then random sampling {{method of data collection}} was carried out in both strata. By this method direct observations were taken place and the data collected from this area were analyzed. The larvae and adult stages of key insect pests of <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> were identified by using the dissecting microscope. Citrus leaf miners, leaf dogs and cottony cushion scale are key insect pests of <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> in this area. From these citrus leaf miners are highly dominant where as orange dog is less in abundance. Conclusions: Citrus sinensis plants in Tony farm are highly damaged by these key insect pests particularly nursery stages of plants are devastated...|$|R

25|$|The 'Jaffa' orange {{was a new}} variety {{developed}} by Palestinian farmers after emerging in the mid-19th century as a mutation on a tree of the 'Baladi' variety {{near the city of}} Jaffa. While the sour orange (C. aurantium) was brought westward from China and India by Arab traders, who probably introduced it to Sicily and Spain, the 'Jaffa' orange was developed from the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> (C. sinensis) which was brought from China to the Mediterranean region by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{travelers}} {{introduced the}} <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> into the American continent. On his second voyage in 1493, Christopher Columbus may have planted the fruit in Hispaniola. Subsequent expeditions in the mid-1500s brought sweet oranges to South America and Mexico, and to Florida in 1565, when Pedro Menéndez de Avilés founded St Augustine. Spanish missionaries brought orange trees to Arizona between 1707 and 1710, while the Franciscans {{did the same}} in San Diego, California, in 1769. An orchard was planted at the San Gabriel Mission around 1804 and a commercial orchard was established in 1841 near present-day Los Angeles. In Louisiana, oranges were probably introduced by French explorers.|$|E
500|$|Like {{most other}} {{starling}}s, the hoopoe starling was omnivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, and insects. Its tongue—long, slender, sharp, and frayed—may {{have been able}} to move rapidly, helpful when feeding on fruit, nectar, pollen, and invertebrates. Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large, indicating that it foraged near the ground. Its jaws were strong; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe, and it may have foraged in a similar way, probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak. De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen, consisting of seeds and the berries of [...] "Pseudobuxus" [...] (possibly Eugenia buxifolia, a bush with <b>sweet,</b> <b>orange</b> berries). He noted that the bird weighed , and was fatter around June and July. Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion, spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains. Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter, with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer. The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities. Its song was described as a [...] "bright and cheerful whistle" [...] and [...] "clear notes", indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings.|$|E
40|$|Citrus, and {{particularly}} <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges,</b> are very recalcitrant to anther culture. In this paper it was evaluated {{for the first}} time the response of 27 genotypes of Citrus sinensis and of one hybrid C. clementina × C. sinensis, to in vitro anther culture. Ten genotypes of <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> showed embryogenic callus induction, mostly blood <b>sweet</b> <b>oranges</b> genotypes, such as Tarocco, Moro and Sanguinelli. In vitro microspore developmental switches from the gamethophytic to the sporophytic pathway were shown by DAPI staining in microspores of these responsive genotypes, after 10 months in culture. However, microsatellite marker analyses showed that these calli were heterozygous. The flow-cytometric analysis of these embryogenic calli showed the presence of two peaks, corresponding to haploid (n) and diploid (2 n) genotypes. Differently, anther cultures of the hybrid C. clementina × C. sinensis produced tri-haploid (3 n) embryogenic calli and the embryos obtained were homozygous when analyzed by molecular markers (sample sequence repeats), confirming the more responsive characteristic of clementine to microspore embryogenesis through anther culture. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

2500|$|The orange is {{the fruit}} of the citrus species Citrus × sinensis in the family Rutaceae. It is also called [...] <b>sweet</b> <b>orange,</b> to {{distinguish}} it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange.

2500|$|Different {{names have}} been given to the many {{varieties}} of the genus. Orange applies primarily to the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> – Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. The orange tree is an evergreen, flowering tree, with an average height of , although some very old specimens can reach [...] Its oval leaves, alternately arranged, are [...] long and have crenulate margins. Sweet oranges grow in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue, the white, bitter mesocarp or albedo (pith). The orange contains a number of distinct carpels (segments) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by a membrane, and containing many juice-filled vesicles and usually a few seeds (pips). When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the <b>sweet</b> <b>orange</b> is non-climacteric. The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.|$|E
