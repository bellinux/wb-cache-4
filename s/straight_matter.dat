5000|$|In contrast, Foundas is kinder to the film, {{observing that}} it is:less a <b>straight</b> <b>matter</b> of {{addition}} or subtraction {{than it is}} a complex algebra equation, with multiple variables that all have a bearing on the sum. It is also, much like the film that opened Toronto this year, Jeremy Podeswa's [...] "Fugitive Pieces," [...] another visually lush, dramatically obvious story of Holocaust survivors still wrestling with the ghosts of their past, several decades on {{from the end of}} World War II. Generally solid performances and Barzman's sensitive handling help to elevate the pic above the realm of the familiar and could result in okay arthouse biz among auds not yet exhausted by the subject matter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Chinese blog {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} sources of information in China. The content of Chinese blog varies widely, thus its classification is of great significance. The Chinese blog has the features of the title, <b>straight</b> <b>matter,</b> tags and user-defined types, and different features have different lengths. Traditional text classification method of the Chinese blog classification is not ideal. In this paper, the Chinese blog is classified by using a number of Chinese blog features in which traditional text classification technique and short text classification technique will be chosen according to the different length of features. In addition, the feature expansion method is adopted for sparse features of short text, and the features are integrated by linear training. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of classification. Keywords- text classification; Chinese blog classification; short text classification; feature expansion; multi-feature integration I...|$|E

Following this success, Coriolanus becomes active in politics and seeks political leadership.

40|$|To {{produce an}} {{indicator}} of sustainable development applicable {{to the world of}} business enterprise is not a <b>straight</b> forward <b>matter.</b> It appears difficult to find a clear consensus on the relevance or not of particular indicators. The three dimensional aspect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Organizational Social Responsibility (OSR) adds to the difficulty of bringing different types of data together to produce a final composite indicator (taking into account economics, societal issues and environmental considerations). The current thesis is based around the work of Boutaud (2002) and suggests the use of an indicator based on GRI principles. It also promotes the idea of comparing the economic and societal performance of a company with an environmental indicator calculated using the carbon footprinting system known as the Bilan Carbone®...|$|R

Hugh and Conrad of Ivrea apparently requested the Empress Theophanu to come to Italy to set <b>matters</b> <b>straight</b> at Bobbio.

A farmer named Darton had lost heavily, and the similarity of name had probably led to the error. Belief in it was so persistent that it demanded several days of letter-writing to set <b>matters</b> <b>straight,</b> and persuade the world that he was as solvent as ever he had been in his life. He had hardly concluded this worrying task when, to his delight, another letter arrived in the handwriting of Sally.|$|R
