25|$|The socialist {{policy of}} Ujamaa was {{gradually}} phased out when Nyerere handed power over to Ali Hassan Mwinyi, first as President in 1985 {{and then as}} head of the ruling party in 1990. The government initiated political and administrative reforms, as part of which the first National Water Policy was approved in 1991. At the core of the reforms was the Local Government Reform Programme aimed at decentralising power by devolving resources and responsibility for service delivery to district and municipal councils, including transfers of conditional and unconditional block grants to the councils. The National Water Policy emphasized community participation in the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> and in operating and maintaining them through water committees that charged for water. Villagers also had to make a cash contributions towards capital costs and contributed time and labour, local materials and hospitality for visiting government staff. They also undertook hygiene education and serve on health committees.|$|E

40|$|The <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>project</b> {{from a large}} list of {{possibilities}} is a common problem in Engineering. This type of problem seems to be incessant in many organizations. In fact, it became a problem for our team when we were faced with a difficult decision of which topic to select for our team term project. There were four project alternatives that were brought to our first meeting. All <b>of</b> the <b>projects</b> seemed perfectly reasonable and {{could be used for}} the purpose of the class. However, the problem was that we were only able to select one project. This situation was identified as a good opportunity to be the project topic itself. The purpose <b>of</b> this <b>project</b> is to use decision making methodologies in <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> one <b>project</b> from among four project proposals. Since our <b>project</b> covers the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> a student <b>project</b> for ETM students, the result is the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>project</b> proposal and not the continuation and completion of the selected proposal. To provide effective information on our decision, the Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM), algorithm and tools used for the project selection are studied. The proposed algorithm is mainly based on using the Pairwise Comparison Method (PCM), an Online Survey, Bibliometric Techniques, and Utility Curves...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> development <b>projects</b> in the context of strategic product planning, which is equally as complex as crucial for the success of a company. Although numerous methods and tools are available, there are no ideal "off-the shelf" methods which are suited to every specific application. The authors describe how a relevant method can be selected, adapted and implemented to the application-specific boundary conditions. This procedure is exemplified by the company LEWA Herbert Ott GmbH & Co KG. In addition, the initial situation for the evaluation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> development <b>projects</b> is illustrated, both at LEWA and in SMEs in general. Various approaches for the evaluation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> developement <b>projects</b> are presented. Furthermore, the article describes how LEWA, based on the results and experiences of a study focussed purely on amortisation time, selected F&E portfolios as an evaluation method, adapted them to t heir own needs and successfully implemented these in their company...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{subjects}} in the sciences and arts include the keeping of records or creation of a physical object or project. This work {{is designed to provide}} tangible proof of the students abilities. However, not every book or project is examined, with inspectors being sent to a small few, randomly selected schools each year, or simply examining a small <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> from each class to check the standard. Some subjects such as Art and Technology involve a practical exam which is supervised by an external examiner. In the academic year of the written exam, all practical science subjects are partially examined by student assignments which involve stepping away from the books and getting students to put the theory they have learned into practice.|$|E

After receiving over 25,000 responses to a project questionnaire in July, the Sound Transit Board expanded the list of candidate projects to include light rail studies on previously excluded corridors, including State Route 522 (also the recipient of bus rapid transit service). In December, three package size options were presented to the Sound Transit Board: a 15-year, $26 billion program with at-grade lines between Ballard and West Seattle; a 20-year, $30 billion program with a new downtown tunnel for Ballard and West Seattle; and a 25-year, $48 billion program with a new downtown tunnel for Ballard.|$|E

50|$|The {{model was}} created as an {{analytical}} framework for India’s Second Five Year Plan in 1955 by appointment of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, as India {{felt there was}} a need to introduce a formal plan model after the First Five Year Plan (1951-1956). The First Five Year Plan stressed investment for capital accumulation {{in the spirit of the}} one-sector Harrod-Domar model. It argued that production required capital and that capital can be accumulated through investment; the faster one accumulates, the higher the growth rate will be. The most fundamental criticisms came from Mahalanobis, who himself was working with a variant of it in 1951 and 1952. The criticisms were mostly around the model’s inability to cope with the real constraints of the economy; it’s ignoring of the fundamental choice problems of planning over time; and the lack of connection between the model and the actual <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> for governmental expenditure. Subsequently Mahalanobis introduced his celebrated two-sector model, which he later expanded into a four-sector version.|$|E
