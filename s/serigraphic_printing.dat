40|$|My {{exhibition}} and paper addresses the physicality of the image, specifically {{that of the}} printed image and its material substrate, whether that image is photographically produced, or one created from printmaking processes. Several years ago I inherited a family archive of photographic negative, prints and slides that date from 1940 onward. These photographs form the genesis of my work. I often begin by sanding away areas of original contact prints to reconfigure the narrative structure of the image. I also use these images to produce large serigraphs on Mylar. Frequently I embellish these works with silver leaf - referencing the silver oxide that forms the foundation for light-sensitive exposures. Along with the sanded photographs and <b>serigraphic</b> <b>prints,</b> I have created an artist book consisting of two decks of trading cards. These cards contain imagery taken from the photo-collection as well as sentence fragments that I develop while sanding the prints...|$|R

40|$|As {{a graphic}} {{designer}} who has direct experience of exploitation through employment, I {{am interested in}} researching the subjective experience of underpaid workers in New Zealand. In doing this I have sought to creatively synthesize experiences into artworks that provide a deeper insight into the impact of underpaid work. Through this investigation I have attempted {{to contribute to a}} broader discussion of underpaid work than what is currently provided, through the analysis of statistical data. In undertaking this project I have also been concerned with investigating new potentials in serigraphy (a graphic medium traditionally associated with working-class politics). I have inquired into how it might be used to create a visual ‘voice’ for contemporary workers’ narratives. Accordingly, this project has employed audio recordings of three personal stories. The research has led to the production of a series of <b>serigraphic</b> <b>prints</b> that artistically interpret the journeys and experiences of the participants. These images sit in discourse with looped audio excerpts of their recorded interviews. In this approach, narratives of marginalization that have often been muted through their presentation as written records, have been re-conceptualized as an artists' images, with which the recordings are in discussion. The second phase of this project moves concerns with narratives of underpaid work into spatiotemporal environments. Audio recordings of worker’s stories are fused with typographical treatments and imagery to produce a series of short films. The advantage of this approach is that these texts are more widely available and operate outside of the cultural exclusivity of the art gallery and the graphic design field. I teach graphic design on the Graphic Design degree programme in both undergrad and post grad. I am a senior lecturer and programme leader for the bachelor in graphic design degree and I also supervise honours and master degree students. My research interests are in capturing workers narratives and portraying these as visual texts in the form of large <b>serigraphic</b> <b>prints</b> using the methodology of narrative inquiry. I am also interested in spatiotemporal environments where I have taken the audio recordings of worker’s stories and imagery and fused with typographical treatments to produce a series of short films...|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, Nash {{agreed to}} fund Mac Holbert {{to start a}} fine art digital based {{printing}} company using the IRIS Graphics 3047 printer sitting in Nash's Manhattan Beach, California carriage house. Holbert retired as road manager for Crosby, Stills and Nash {{so that he could}} run the company. It opened its doors on 1 July 1991 with the name of Nash Editions Ltd. Early employees included David Coons, John Bilotta and a <b>serigraphic</b> <b>print</b> maker named Jack Duganne. They worked to further adapt the IRIS printer to fine art printing, experimenting with ink sets to try to overcome the fast-fading nature of IRIS prints, and even going as far as sawing off part of the print heads so they could be moved back to clear thicker printing paper stocks (voiding the $126,000 machine's warranty). Nash and Holbert decided to call their fine art prints [...] "digigraphs" [...] although Jack Duganne coined the name [...] "Giclée" [...] for these type of prints. The company is still in operation and currently uses Epson based large format printers.|$|R

We whose multi-coloured spray made the miracle of your Incarnation. You, who stand on an old tyre, crush the demons of {{capitalist}} domination. Artist, eco-architect and champion of the people’s media – the poster, Xavier de la Cueva Meade lives {{in the hills of}} Whaingaroa-Raglan with his partner, Carolyna Hart. His motherland is Mexico. You actually cannot take Mexico outta the boy. The spirit of Emiliano Zapata is his guardian angel and Santisima Virgen de las Barrikadas is always interceding on his behalf to the heart of indigenous Mexico. Meade is an artist suspicious of America and the many manifestations of colonial powers and multi-national corporations, or ‘demonic’ capitalism. In 2003 - 4, I had the honour of teaching in the studio next to Meade, Xavier de la Cueva Meade at the School of Media Arts in the Drawing and Design faculty. Slowly learning about the depth of conviction he had for the indigenous peoples of Mexico was one of the gems I gleaned in getting to know him. His exchanges and friendships with colleagues and family in his homeland of Mexico forged close ties with the famed ASARO (Socialist Assembly of Revolutionary Artists from Oaxaca). Oaxaca, Mexico is a city laden with graphic artists whose political images and texts wall-paper the city. Not just with aerosol, but with xylographs, stencilled works and hand-painted posters. There are many people who conscientiously object in this manner, and it has become somewhat of a widespread ‘tradition’ now. So for Meade, the project was also a way of reaching back home across the ether. As a prolific collector of graphic works such as the poster, Meade has amassed hundreds of works from Mexico, Cuba and the world over. In 2007 he collaborated with Professor Flor de Lis López Hernández (Cuba), a group of artists from Aotearoa and the famous printers – ICAIC (Instituto Cubano de Arte Industria Cinematografica) in Havana, Cuba. The result was a series of hand-cut and <b>printed</b> <b>serigraphic</b> posters entitled Aotearoa Liberators. The second poster series was entitled Purakau, Mitos y Leyendas, Myths and Legends, collaboration between artists from Aotearoa, Cuba, Mexico and Spain and again, Flor de Lis López Hernández. It was this poster series for which the work Santisima Virgen de las Barrikadas was made. Meade possesses a genuine and strong sense of social justice as a Mexicano living in Aotearoa since the 1980 s. His natural aroha – love for Tangata Whenua –indigenous peoples of Aotearoa has inspired the collaborative and inclusive practice of representing each of his homelands through language. Each series of posters has been documented as a catalogue and each catalogue is tri-lingual: Te Reo Maaori, Spanish and English. Retablo + The People Co-opted into the indigenous peoples’ lexicon of deities in various parts of Meso-America and Mexico is Our Lady of Guadalupe along with other relative saints. Whether one actually believes or not in any kind of god, the retablo or shrine, is not an unusual object to have in the home. The indigenous beliefs always gave credence to a deity or protector, it just has a Catholic veneer. Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most well-known of the Catholic icons. Kind-of at-odds with one another, but in a very real way, both serving the purposes of ‘the people’. ASARO’s secularised version of her is The Blessed Virgin of the Barricades; she crushes the head of the demons of capitalism and oppressive power. In the visual narratives that come out of the resistance of Mexico, there are various names for these powers: United States of America El Presidente Monsanto and its subsidiaries International Monetary Fund The World Bank Santisima Virgen de las Barrikadas made her first appearance on the walls of Oaxaca in 2006 by ASARO. Meade has immortalised her and her message. The message will continue to be transmitted to distant places around the planet, {{for the sake of the}} planet and the people, now and forever. From the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, free us. But keep alive our ancestral memories and our millenary cultures. For now, we will sell for free your image on every wall, in an effort to adore and invoke you, and, respectful to our traditions, preserve the local resistance… and, by the way, without global copyright. 2011 - 5 - 12 Xavier de la Cueva Meade (Mexico/ Whaingaroa) b. 1951. <b>Serigraphic</b> <b>print</b> 1 / 50, 2011.
