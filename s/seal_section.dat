40|$|Flaws and {{defects in}} heat seals formed between sheets of {{translucent}} film are identified by optically examining consecutive lateral {{sections of the}} seal along the seal length. Each lateral <b>seal</b> <b>section</b> is illuminated and an optical sensor array detects the intensity of light transmitted through the <b>seal</b> <b>section</b> {{for the purpose of}} detecting and locating edges in the heat seal. A line profile for each consecutive <b>seal</b> <b>section</b> is derived having an amplitude proportional to the change in light intensity across the <b>seal</b> <b>section.</b> Instances in the derived line profile where the amplitude is greater than a threshold level indicate the detection of a seal edge. The detected edges in each derived line profile are then compared to a preset profile edge standard to identify the existence of a flaw or defect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} O-ring seal nonlinear axisymmetric {{finite element}} model are established which is used for swinging hydraulic cylinder. Some factors influencing rubber O-ring sealing performance were taken into account, such as rotating shaft diameter, O-ring <b>seal</b> <b>section</b> diameter. The results indicate that when medium pressure is zero, the two factors influence Von Mises and maximum contact stress of sealing face greatly. Under medium pressure(P= 10 Mpa), the two factors have a little influence to Von Mises and maximum contact stress...|$|E

500|$|The {{projects}} {{funded by}} the Beef Roads Scheme resulted in a noticeably higher quality road in the Kimberley, but work still progressed on other sections of the highway. In 1970, a single-lane <b>sealed</b> <b>section</b> was completed between Perth and Meekatharra.

Due to the remoteness of the location, airstrips were built alongside the highway, so that workers could be flown in from Geraldton. The highway was realigned in several spots, to avoid difficult areas, improve river crossings, or give drivers a more scenic view of the surrounding area. New bridges were constructed along the route, including a reinforced concrete bridge at the Fortescue River, and a four-span bridge over the Gascoyne River's Middle Branch. By December 1978, the sealed road reached Newman, with the project completed three months ahead of schedule, and at a cost of $20million, [...] $1million under budget.

40|$|The sealing and {{resealing}} {{of joints}} and cracks in concrete, asphalt, and composite pavements {{is assumed to}} be an important component of pavement maintenance. Recently this practice has been challenged by research indicating that sealing may not be cost-effective. The Indiana Department of Transportation currently spends approximately four million dollars annually to perform joint/crack sealing. The primary objective of the research presented in this report is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of joint/crack sealing in relation to pavement performance. The results of a mail survey showed that most states, including Indiana, do not have quantitative justification for sealing policies, nor do they know the cost-effectiveness of the operations. Based on the experimental design for this research, nineteen test sites were selected in Indiana, each site having one <b>sealed</b> <b>section</b> and one unsealed section. Collected data including falling weight deflectometer measurements, pavement roughness, visual condition surveys, and core samples were used to evaluate the pavement performance between <b>sealed</b> and unsealed <b>sections.</b> A three-dimensional finite element pavement model was developed to evaluate the effect of contact interface shape at the joint on the load transfer measurements. The temperature effect was evaluated by statistical analyses and a temperature correction factor for deflections on asphalt pavement is provided. A statistical model was developed to compare the pavement performance between <b>sealed</b> and unsealed <b>sections</b> for three pavement types, concrete, asphalt and composite. The results indicated that {{there appears to be no}} significant differences between the performance of <b>sealed</b> and unsealed <b>sections</b> regardless of pavement type, drainage condition and road classification. ...|$|R

In 2008, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that the Shimon Hatzadik property belonged to the Sephardi Community Committee. The Arab families had protected tenant status {{as long as they}} paid rent but several families refused to pay, ending in their eviction. The al-Kurds were evicted in November 2008. Muhammad al-Kurd, the head of the family, died eleven days later.
