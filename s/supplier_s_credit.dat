40|$|It {{is known}} that the BOJ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Credit</b> Rationing {{has been the most}} {{important}} measure to control the money supply in the Japanese monetary transmission mechanism. However, the recent innovation of money markets has also significantly influenced behaviors of banks and the non-bank public and, in turn, the money supply in a potent fashion. This paper presents a money market model in which money market innovations are taken into account with the BOJ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>credit</b> rationing, which enables us to analyze the determination of the money supply. In the short run, the Bank of Japan has used the restriction of BOJ loans along with the restriction of the expansion of lending by banks to try to control the money supply. However, the development of money market brought less dependence of banks and the public on the Bank of Japan so that the Bank of Japan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>credit</b> rationing is of limited usefulness as a monetary policy measure. The implications of these recent developments in money markets for policy makers are examined here. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{identifies}} four U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> crunches-periods of sharply increased non-price credit rationing-between 1960 and 1992. Extreme intimidation {{of banks}} by the Federal Reserve and U. S. federal government through jawboning and credible threats of increased regulatory oversight caused the crunches of 1966 and 1969. Thus, this article overturns {{the conventional wisdom}} that Regulation Q produced the 1960 <b>s</b> <b>credit</b> crunches. The 1980 crunch was the unintended effect of direct regulatory limits on credit extensions. More recently, a market-induced crunch occurred from early 1990 through 1992 when a collapse of commercial real estate values made pricing risk on real estate-collateralized loans extremely difficult.

40|$|Schwarz surveys U. S. {{experience}} with directed credit as background {{for a larger}} study of the Asian experience. Almost half of net credit lent in the United States annually is directly affected by government policies - half of net credit covering budget deficits, and half falling under various federal credit programs. The main difference between U. <b>S.</b> and Asian <b>credit</b> policy is that U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> policy is oriented more toward equity than toward growth. Different sectors are affected differently by U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> policies. Few empirical studies test how U. <b>S.</b> <b>credit</b> policy affects growth - perhaps {{partly because of the}} motives behind those policies. Few enpirical studies even test whether the policies edffectively increase credit to the target group. Schwarz outlines a method for testing the effectiveness of credit policy, then examinesexisting empirical work to see how it fits that methodology. The first common empirical technique examines credit allocation in the economy. Schwarz finds that for the largest program, housing credit, the effect of credit program on credit allocation is very small and may be negative when cross-program effects are considered. The second common empirical technique examines individual sectors. Results here are mixed. In agriculture, much of the credit raises the demand for land, providing a gain for landowners rather than increasing production. In education, {{less than a third of}} the students who got government credit would not have gone to college without it. So in both cases, the credit has a positive impact but at a sizable cost. Schwarz concludes that despite its huge volume, directed credit in the United States has a limited impact in growth. The credit programs have generally succeeded in increasing credit to the targeted group, but not necessarily in increasing investment by that group.

In this case, it is necessary to examine several short-listed assignments before choosing one.

40|$|Credit bureau data on {{consumer}} borrowing and payment behavior {{has become the}} cornerstone of the underwriting decision for U. S. consumer loans. Armed with the most comprehensive consumer payment histories in the world, U. S. creditors apply statistical scoring models to estimate an individual's repayment risk with remarkable accuracy.

40|$|We {{consider}} an industry {{where one of}} the manufacturers and its <b>supplier</b> (<b>S)</b> have engaged in some specific investment in the past.

In the case when only S knows its true production costs, we compare alternative mechanisms to induce S to reveal its private information, namely, paying informational rents, using threats of switching suppliers, and most importantly, permitting S to serve other firms. We prove that the presence of asymmetric information mitigates the manufacturer’s incentives to engage in vertical restraints. We derive several policy implications from this result. Adapting to more efficient suppliers, supplier switching costs, sharing suppliers, vertical restraints, asymmetric information...|$|R
