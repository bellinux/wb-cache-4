It is possible to determine the physical and cognitive capabilities of the elderly by inferring what activities they perform in their houses. Our primary aim was to establish a proof of concept that a wireless sensor system can monitor and record physical activity and these data can be modeled to predict activities of daily living. The secondary aim {{was to determine the}} optimal placement of the <b>sensor</b> <b>boxes</b> for detecting activities in a room. A wireless sensor system was set up in a laboratory kitchen. The ten healthy participants were requested to make tea following a defined sequence of tasks. Data were collected from the eight wireless <b>sensor</b> <b>boxes</b> placed in specific places in the test kitchen and analyzed to detect the sequences of tasks performed by the participants. These sequence of tasks were trained and tested using the Markov Model. Data analysis focused on the reliability of the system and the integrity of the collected data. The sequence of tasks were successfully recognized for all subjects and the averaged data pattern of tasks sequences between the subjects had a high correlation. Analysis of the data collected indicates that sensors placed in different locations are capable of recognizing activities, with the movement detection sensor contributing the most to detection of tasks. The central top of the room with no obstruction of view was considered to be the best location to record data for activity detection.

40|$|Despite the {{numerous}} wireless position estimation schemes in the patent and research literature, motion capture grade localization with RF has eluded engineering practice. Motion capture localization with cm-scale accuracy or better is typically performed optically, with limited range, high setup time, and environmental limitations (e. g. infrared systems {{that do not}} work outdoors). Today's true RF-based motion capture technology involves sensing low-frequency or DC fields using bulky <b>sensor</b> <b>boxes</b> [...] with ranges {{of only a few}} meters.

Experimental results yielded a positional accuracy in the range of 2 mm and 20 mm, respectively, for one- and two-dimensional tracking of a fast-moving tag.

This will save money {{in the future for}} SwedishTransport Administration and all other partners that use the rails. Swedish Transport Administration has already RFID readers beside the rail to detecttrains position. The new monitoring system will use these readers and send data fromthe monitoring system via these readers to a database. The aim of this thesis work is to design and build a RFID antenna to send data fromthe monitoring system to the RFID readers. The antenna should be a circularpolarized and it needs to manage the harsh environment on the train. This thesis work started with a theoretical study which investigated four commonantenna types (dipole, loop, PIFA and patch/microstrip) to evaluate which antennatype that is the best solution for this application. It was decided to design a patchantenna from the theoretical study since it fulfils all the requirements for the antenna. Simulations and tests shows that the antenna is circular polarized and have amaximum reading distance of 5 m for 868 MHz. For 2. 45 GHz it is linear polarizedand has a reading distance of at least 10 m. With other hardware settings the antennawill have longer reading distance at 2. 45 GHz. When all parts of the test bed was finished the test bed was mounted on themeasurement wagon. The final test shows that the antenna fulfils the task. Theantenna transmitted the data from the <b>sensor</b> <b>boxes</b> to the RFID readers. The report suggests future work to minimize the reading distance and size for theantenna.

40|$|Chinese liquors can be {{classified}} according to their flavor types. Accurate identification of Chinese liquor flavors is not always possible through professional sommeliers’ subjective assessment. A novel polymer piezoelectric sensor electric nose (e-nose) {{can be applied to}} distinguish Chinese liquors because of its excellent ability in imitating human senses by using sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems. The sensor, based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) principle is comprised of a quartz piezoelectric crystal plate sandwiched between two specific gas-sensitive polymer coatings. Chinese liquors are identified by obtaining the resonance frequency value changes of each sensor using the e-nose. However, the QCM principle failed to completely account for a particular phenomenon: we found that the resonance frequency values fluctuated in the stable state. For better understanding the phenomenon, a 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation using the finite volume method is employed to study the influence of the flow-induced forces to the resonance frequency fluctuation of each sensor in the <b>sensor</b> <b>box.</b> A dedicated procedure was developed for modeling the flow of volatile gas from Chinese liquors in a realistic scenario to give reasonably good results with fair accuracy. The flow-induced forces on the sensors are displayed from the perspective of their spatial-temporal and probability density distributions. To evaluate the influence of the fluctuation of the flow-induced forces on each sensor and ensure the serviceability of the e-nose, the standard deviation of resonance frequency value (SDF) and the standard deviation of resultant forces (SDFy) in y-direction (Fy) are compared. Results show that the fluctuations of Fy are bound up with the resonance frequency values fluctuations. To ensure that the sensor's resonance frequency values are steady and only fluctuate slightly, in order to improve the identification accuracy of Chinese liquors using the e-nose, the sensors in the <b>sensor</b> <b>box</b> should be in the proper place, i. e., where the fluctuations of the flow-induced forces is relatively small. This plays a significant reference role in determining the optimum design of the e-nose for accurately identifying Chinese liquors...|$|E
