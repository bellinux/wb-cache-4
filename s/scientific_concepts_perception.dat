Where appearances are misleading, failing to portray ecological degradation or ecological health, public opionion may be ill-informed, with consequences for environmental policy. This paper argules that while ecology is a <b>scientific</b> <b>concept,</b> landscape <b>perception</b> is a social process. If we do not recognize this difference, we have problems with the appearance of ecological systems. Three influential problems are discussed: 1) the problem of the false identity of ecological systems, 2) the problem of design and planning as deceit about ecological systems, and 3) the problem of invisible ecological systems. These problems for environmental policy may be resolved in part if landscape planners and policy-makers use socially recognized signs to display human intentions for ecological systems. Specifically, planning and policy can include socially-recognized signs of beauty and stewardship to display human care for ecological systems.

An example in United States federal agricultural policy is described. Environmental policy should explicitly address the look of the land, not because aesthetic quality is coequal with biotic and physical quality of the land- scape, though some have made this argument, but because the look of the land communicates. Kevin Lynch (1971) called the environment `anenormous communications device'. What people see, and par- ticularly our affective response to landscape, in- fluences what we think belongs in the landscape. Policy can intentionally use this enormous commu- nications device to suggest that patterns that sup- port the ecological function of the landscape belong there, or poli [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{whether or not}} on-line learning (on-line as compared to classroom) influenced the progression of <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> construction and analogical reasoning ability; {{and the degree to}} which different analogical reasoning (surface and relational salience) contributes to the progression of <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> construction and analogical reasoning ability. A total of 190 5 th grade students were assigned to three different conditions: surface salience analogical reasoning without the use of on-line learning (condition 1), the same surface salience analogical reasoning with on-line learning (condition 2), and relational salience analogical reasoning with on-line learning (condition 3). Results indicate that condition 2 significantly outperformed condition 1, regardless of the progression of <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> construction and analogical reasoning. Condition 2 performed at the same level that condition 3 did, regardless of the progression of <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> construction and analogical reasoning. The stepwise regression indicated that the best predictor for <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> construction is analogical reasoning followed by scientific reasoning. This study highlights the idea that on-line learning benefits students more than classroom learning, surface salience analogical reasoning is as efficient as relational salience analogical reasoning, and analogical reasoning can better predict <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> construction than can scientific reasoning.

This paper is based on drawing up the development strategy of a university, and brings up the idea of grasping the strategic opportunity, running the university with features, strengthening the education quality, and promoting harmonious development, which are the key points of using <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> of development to guide the development of university. Key words: the <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> of development; higher education institutions; strategic planning The <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> of development is a momentous strategic concept brought forward by Chinese government in the new stage of the new era. It is the Marxist Weltanschauung and methodology that command the development of contemporary Chinese society.

40|$|Students {{come into}} the science {{classroom}} with, often erroneous, preconceptions of <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts.</b> These preconceptions serve the student well in explaining the world in everyday life, but they inhibit the learning of <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts</b> in the science class. Posner suggested that the shortcomings of the preconceptions must be shown, thus allowing the students to rationally make the step from the preconception to the <b>scientific</b> <b>concept.</b> Vosniadou and colleagues, and Mortimer and colleagues both continue on this idea with respectively a framework theory and a conceptual profile-theory. To stimulate conceptual understanding in the science classroom about concepts such as energy, we aim to continue the work of Vosniadou and Mortimer by combining Socratic dialogue with hands-on experimentation. An approach is presented with six distinct steps: waking up, identifying, and challenging the preconception are followed by introducing, securing and using the <b>scientific</b> <b>concept.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the form of knowledge that is made available to six year olds as 'Science' in key South African Grade R curriculum texts. The study draws on a neo-Vygotskian conceptualisation of forms of knowledge and child development to develop a language of description in terms of which the selected texts are analysed. Representations of knowledge in the curriculum texts are described in relation to the notion of a simple <b>scientific</b> <b>concept,</b> an idea that was derived from a neo-Vygotskian conceptualisation of knowledge. A simple <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> is consistent with scientific criteria and functions as an entry level concept in relation to scientific knowledge. Findings indicate that the Grade R science curriculum represents knowledge in terms of everyday <b>concepts</b> and 'potential' <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts,</b> i. e. concepts that have the potential to prompt the Grade R educator to translate an everyday concept into a simple <b>scientific</b> <b>concept.</b> However, the curriculum does not represent any concepts in ways that conform to the criteria for <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts,</b> including simple <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts.</b> The study concludes that the official recontextualisation of scientific knowledge into Grade R school science is problematic because the Grade R science curriculum represents knowledge mostly in everyday terms. The implications are that Grade R learners are not given the opportunity to acquire the form or content of scientific knowledge or to develop the cognitive skills required for formal schooling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a challenge to}} the coherence of social constructivism about science. It introduces an objection according to which social constructivism appeals to the authority of science regarding the nature of reality and so cannot coherently deny that authority. The challenge is how to avoid this incoherence. Social constructivism about science is a doctrine that involves the following claims: (a) <b>Scientific</b> <b>concepts</b> are not innate. (b) <b>Scientific</b> <b>concepts</b> have been brought into existence by human beings. (c) Scientific theories involve <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts.</b> (d) There is no good reason to think of scientific theories as identifying the nature of a reality that is independent of human beings. It is understandable to label a doctrine composed of these four claims as constructivism about science, but perhaps not social constructivism about science. On the basis of (a) and (b), the doctrine says that <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts</b> are constructions, in the sense of being non-innate products of living beings. On the basis of (c) and (d), i...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{concepts}} advanced {{in the present}} discussion aims at accounting for a) how a concept makes successful practice possible, and b) how a <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> can be subject to rational change {{in the course of}} history. To this end, I suggest that each <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> consists of three components of content: 1) the concept’s reference, 2) its inferential role, and 3) the epistemic goal pursued with the concept’s use. In the course of history a concept can change in any of these three components, and change in one component — including change of reference — can be accounted for as being rational relative to other components, in particular a concept’s epistemic goal. This framework is motivated and spelled out based on a concrete case: the history of the homology <b>concept</b> in biology. <b>SCIENTIFIC</b> PRACTICE, CONCEPTUAL CHANGE, AND THE NATURE OF CONCEPTS 1 The task {{of this paper is to}} develop a theory of <b>scientific</b> <b>concepts</b> that is intended to account for a) how a <b>concept</b> makes successful <b>scientific</b> practice possible, and b) how a <b>scientific</b> <b>concept</b> can be subject to rational change in the course of history.
