25|$|The {{government}} of Peru is currently undertaking a major transformation of its {{water resources management}} from a centralized approach focused on irrigation development in the coastal area to a river basin integrated water resources management for the entire country. The 2009 Water Resources Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos) and the draft National Water Resources Management Strategy of 2004 (Estrategia Nacional para la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos Continentales del Perú) contain the necessary elements for Integrated Water Resources Management as stated in international good practices namely, integration of <b>sectoral</b> <b>policies,</b> participation of stakeholders, decentralization of management to the river basin level and recognition of water as a social and economic good. Despite the new law, several key challenges remain, including limited institutional capacity, increasing water stress in the coastal region, deteriorating water quality, poor efficiency in the irrigation sector, as well as inadequate access to and poor quality of water supply and sanitation.|$|E

It is unclear how military rule sought to manage water resources during this period. The next major water resources policy measures were signed in 2003 as the Water Framework Law which, among many aspects, aims to reduce poverty through better water resources management. In August 2009, a new General Water Law was passed to replace the 1927 water law. Within the new water law a National Water Authority was created to oversee the work of sector institutions[...]|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has provided significant {{insights into the}} impact which policy networks, or institutionalised patterns of state-society relations have on the policy process. One branch of this literature highlights how achieving {{a high degree of}} sectoral embeddedness can enhance the state’s capacity to achieve industrial transformation and bolster economic competitiveness (Evans 1995, Weiss 1998). This paper builds on this research by assessing the impact of dense <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> networks on the political dynamics of economy-wide, as opposed to sectoral business mobilisation. In the case of the recent politics of tax reform in Japan it would appear that concentrated <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> networks may actually compromise the state’s reformative capacity. The argument here is that dense industry specific <b>policy</b> networks exacerbate <b>sectoral</b> differences over tax reform and tend to create factional cleavages among state agencies and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{engages with}} {{a debate in}} the {{literature}} on the political economy of China’s industrial reforms about the determinants of major policy trajectories in that country’s strategic industries. A common approach understands central-level policy processes and their structural outcomes in strategic sectors to be subject to active and effective central government guidance, often applied via control over state-owned industry. A less common perspective, on the other hand, has argued that policy formulation and implementation in a number of strategic industries are often dominated by large central state-owned enterprises (SOEs) capable of imposing their own preferences on <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy.</b> Addressing these partially opposing perspectives, this thesis analyses political processes underlying major policy developments in China’s electricity supply industry since 2002, finding that neither approach sufficiently accounts for the complexity of interactions between government and SOEs during the formulation and implementation of <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy.</b> ‘Government-centred’ accounts were found to have exaggerated the effectiveness of central government’s policy guidance while underappreciating SOEs’ considerable <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy</b> impact. ‘SOE-centred’ accounts, on the other hand, have similarly overstated their claims while furthermore giving a distorted perspective of the mechanisms through which SOEs’ policy influence occurs. Building on findings from the case of electricity supply, this thesis establishes an alternative account of the political interplay between both sides and its relevance for sectoral policy-making in China’s strategic industries. It illustrates that central SOEs autonomously pursue their own industrial reform agendas which often deviate from government’s sectoral preferences and from existing <b>sectoral</b> <b>policy.</b> However, it contends that these firms are only able to realise contentious sectoral objectives by tactically ‘synchronising’ them with cross-sectoral policy agendas pursued by central government. When sectoral reform goals diverge and ‘synchronisation’ is absent, policy gridlock often ensues. Overall, this thesis finds that central government’s sectoral guidance over strategic industries is subject to substantial interference by central SOEs, but that this interference largely takes place within the confines of government-sanctioned cross-sectoral policy...|$|R

Utilizing evidence from a case study of forest policy development in British Columbia, Canada, in the 1990 s, this article suggests that understanding policy change in complex sectors such as forestry requires a more nuanced conceptualization and analysis of sectorsubsectoral relationships than exists in the present literature.
