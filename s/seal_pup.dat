25|$|Bycatch {{in fishing}} gear, such as {{commercial}} trawls, is also another threat to ringed seals. Climate change is potentially {{the most serious}} threat to ringed seal populations since much of their habitat is dependent upon pack ice. Birthing lairs are often destroyed before the <b>seal</b> <b>pup</b> is able to forage on its own leading to poor body condition.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, the European Union {{banned the}} import of whitecoat harp <b>seal</b> <b>pup</b> pelts (pelts from pups less than about two weeks of age, when the pups molt). As a result, the market for pelts dropped. The kill rates thus {{declined}} in subsequent years {{to an average of}} about 52,000 seals from 1983 to 1995. During this time, the harp seal population increased.|$|E

60|$|He {{was doing}} it now, vociferating, bellowing, waving his arms, and cursing like a fiend, and all because of a {{disagreement}} with another hunter as to whether a <b>seal</b> <b>pup</b> knew instinctively how to swim. He held that it did, that it could swim the moment it was born. The other hunter, Latimer, a lean, Yankee-looking fellow with shrewd, narrow-slitted eyes, held otherwise, held that the <b>seal</b> <b>pup</b> was born on the land {{for no other reason}} than that it could not swim, that its mother was compelled to teach it to swim as birds were compelled to teach their nestlings how to fly.|$|E
60|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{remaining}} four hunters leaned on the table or lay in their bunks and left the discussion to the two antagonists. But they were supremely interested, for every little while they ardently took sides, and sometimes all were talking at once, till their voices surged {{back and forth in}} waves of sound like mimic thunder-rolls in the confined space. Childish and immaterial as the topic was, the quality of their reasoning was still more childish and immaterial. In truth, there was very little reasoning or none at all. Their method was one of assertion, assumption, and denunciation. They proved that a <b>seal</b> <b>pup</b> could swim or not swim at birth by stating the proposition very bellicosely and then following it up with an attack on the opposing man’s judgment, common sense, nationality, or past history. Rebuttal was precisely similar. I have related this in order to show the mental calibre of the men with whom I was thrown in contact. Intellectually they were children, inhabiting the physical forms of men.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSerum and blubber of pup harbor (Phoca vitulina), grey (Halichoerus grypus) and harp (Phoca groenlandica) seals {{from the}} Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence were {{analyzed}} for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Concentrations of ∑PBDEs (on lipid weight basis) in tissues of harbor <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> inhabiting the St. Lawrence Estuary were {{about five times}} higher than in those from a colony located in the northern Gulf. Harp <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> have the lowest levels of ∑PBDEs among the seal species born in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Lipid normalized concentrations of ∑PBDEs in serum and blubber were strongly correlated, suggesting that the blood collection as a less invasive method {{could be used to}} monitor ∑PBDEs in pups. This study shows that fluvial inputs of PBDEs are important to the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem and that inhabiting harbor <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> have a substantial exposure to PBDEs at a critical developmental stage. In addition, the observed difference in PBDE levels between harp and grey or harbor <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> from the Gulf of St. Lawrence is explained by the difference in diets of their mothers which is linked with their residency time in the Gulf and their seasonal migration pattern...|$|R

40|$|Australian {{fur seals}} (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) breed on Bass Strait islands in Victoria and Tasmania. They have been {{recorded}} in South Australia (SA) for many years as non-breeding visitors and on Kangaroo Island frequently since 1988, mostly in breeding colonies of the New Zealand fur seal (A. forsteri) {{which is the most}} numerous pinniped in SA. Australian fur seals have displaced New Zealand fur seals from sections of the Cape Gantheaume colony on Kangaroo Island. North Casuarina Island produced 29 Australian fur <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> in February 2008. Australian fur <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> were larger than New Zealand fur <b>seal</b> <b>pups</b> in the same colony and have been identified genetically using a 263 -bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. North Casuarina Island has been an important breeding colony of New Zealand fur <b>seals,</b> but <b>pup</b> numbers there decreased since 1992 – 93 (contrary to trends in SA for New Zealand fur seals), while numbers of Australian fur seals there have increased. This study confirms that Australian fur seals breed in SA. The two fur seal species compete for space onshore at several sites.
