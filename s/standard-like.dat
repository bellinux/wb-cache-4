40|$|One of the {{intriguing}} {{achievements of the}} superstring derived <b>standard–like</b> models in the free fermionic formulation is the possible explanation of the top quark mass hierarchy and the successful prediction of the top quark mass. An important property of the superstring derived <b>standard–like</b> models, which enhances their predictive power, is the existence of three and only three generations in the massless spectrum. Up to some motivated assumptions {{with regard to the}} light Higgs spectrum, it is then possible to calculate the fermion masses in terms of string tree level amplitudes and some VEVs that parameterize the string vacuum. I discuss the calculation of the heavy generation masses in the superstring derived <b>standard–like</b> models.

40|$|We {{extend the}} free fermionic {{classification}} methodology {{to the class}} of <b>standard-like</b> heterotic-string vacua, in which the SO(10) GUT symmetry is broken at the string level to SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) ^ 2. The space of GGSO free phase configurations {{in this case is}} vastly enlarged compared to the corresponding SO(6) × SO(4) and SU(5) × U(1) vacua. Extracting substantial numbers of phenomenologically viable models therefore requires a modification of the classification methods. This is achieved by identifying conditions on the GGSO projection coefficients, which are satisfied at the SO(10) level by random phase configurations, and that lead to three generation models with the SO(10) symmetry broken to the SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) ^ 2 subgroup. Around each of these fertile SO(10) configurations, we perform a complete classification of <b>standard-like</b> models, by adding the SO(10) symmetry breaking basis vectors, and scanning all the associated GGSO phases. Following this methodology we are able to generate some 10 ^ 7 three generation <b>Standard-like</b> Models.

40|$|This article {{develops}} a repeated gamemodel of {{the choice of}} doctrinal form by a higher court. Doctrine can take any point along a continuum frommore determinate, rule-like legal commands to more flexible, <b>standard-like</b> directives. In deciding a case, the Supreme Court not only decides on a substantive outcome, but also chooses where on this continuum to set the doctrine. The lower court then applies the legal command to future cases. Indoing so, itmaywish to take intoaccountnew information,but thecost of doing so varies with {{the form of the}} legal doctrine. The model shows that in equili-brium doctrine ocsillates over time between more rule-like commands and more <b>standard-like</b> commands. What triggers the shift in doctrinal form are the lower court’s “mistakes ” when trying to implement the standard in the way the Supreme Court prefers. The mistakes induce the Supreme Court to cabin the lower court’s discre-tionby issuingmore rule-like legal commands for a certain number of periods. Toomuch constraint, however, produces error costs when the lower court cannot adjust the law appropriately to new circumstances, leading to a shift back to more <b>standard-like</b> doc-trine.

40|$|U(n⊗ m) ∗ gauge {{field theory}} on noncommutative spacetime is {{formulated}} and the <b>standard-like</b> model with the symmetry U(3 _c⊗ 2 ⊗ 1 _Y) ∗ is reconstructed based on it. U(n+m) ∗ gauge group reduces to U(n+m) on the commutative spacetime {{which is not}} U(N), (N=n+m) but isomorphic to SU(n) ×SU(m) ×U(1) in this article. On the noncommutative spacetime, the representation that fields belong to is fundamental, adjoint or bi-fundamental. For this reason, one had to construct the standard model by use of bi-fundamental representations. However, we can reconstruct the <b>standard-like</b> model with only fundamental and adjoint representation and without using bi-fundamental representations. It {{is well known that}} the charge of fermion is 0 or ± 1 in the U(1) gauge theory on noncommutative spacetime. Thus, there may be no room to incorporate the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory into the standard model because the quarks have fractional charges. However, it is shown in this article that there is the noncommutative gauge theory with arbitrary charges which symmetry is for example U(3 ⊗ 1) ∗. This type of gauge theory emerges from the spontaneous breakdown of the noncommutative U(4) ∗ gauge theory in which the gauge field contains the 0 component A_μ^ 0 (x,θ). The <b>standard-like</b> model in this paper also has fermion fields with fractional charges. Thus, the noncommutative gauge theory with fractional U(1) charges can not exist alone, but it must coexist with noncommutative nonabelian gauge theory. Comment: 10 page...|$|E

The suppression of the lightest generation masses results from the horizontal symmetries in the superstring models. The problems of neutrino masses, gauge coupling unification and hierarchical SUSY breaking are discussed.

40|$|For two decades, the doctrinal test {{laid out}} in Thornburg v Gingles has been the {{centerpiece}} of vote dilution litigation in the United States. Gingles defined a sequential, two-part framework combining a set of rule-like preconditions to liability with a <b>standard-like</b> inquiry into {{the totality of the}} circumstances. Despite this elaborate framework, emerging empirical work shows that political ideology connects closely with how judges have decided vote dilution cases; Democratic appointees have proven much more likely than Republican appointees to favor liability under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. This work raises the question of what role the Gingles framework really plays in voting rights litigation. More basically, it raises the fundamental question of whether legal doctrine actually constrains judicial decisionmaking. Using a dataset of every Section 2 decision issued since Gingles, this Article explores these twin puzzles. It finds substantial evidence that legal rules are indeed more ideologically constraining than standards. Ideological divisions are much more pronounced in the <b>standard-like</b> second step of Gingles than under the more rule-like preconditions. Moreover, the Article shows that the doctrinal dynamics of vote dilution litigation have changed dramatically over the past two decades.

40|$|Self-consistent chaotic {{transport}} is {{studied in}} a Hamiltonian mean-field model. The model provides a simplified description of transport in marginally stable systems including vorticity mixing in strong shear flows and electron dynamics in plasmas. Self-consistency is incorporated through a mean-field that couples all the degrees-of-freedom. The model is formulated {{as a large}} set of $N$ coupled <b>standard-like</b> area-preserving twist maps in which the amplitude and phase of the perturbation, rather than being constant like in the standard map, are dynamical variables. Of particular interest {{is the study of}} the impact of periodic orbits on the chaotic transport and coherent structures. Numerical simulations show that self-consistency leads to the formation of a coherent macro-particle trapped around the elliptic fixed point of the system that appears together with an asymptotic periodic behavior of the mean field. To model this asymptotic state, we introduced a non-autonomous map that allows a detailed study of the onset of global transport. A turnstile-type transport mechanism that allows transport across instantaneous KAM invariant circles in non-autonomous systems is discussed. As a first step to understand transport, we study a special type of orbits referred to as sequential periodic orbits. Using symmetry properties we show that, through replication, high-dimensional sequential periodic orbits can be generated starting from low-dimensional periodic orbits. We show that sequential periodic orbits in the self-consistent map can be continued from trivial (uncoupled) periodic orbits of <b>standard-like</b> maps using numerical and asymptotic methods. Normal forms are used to describe these orbits and to find the values of the map parameters that guarantee their existence.
