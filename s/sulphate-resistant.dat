50|$|All of LCC’s cement {{production}} is domestically consumed, with market demand exceeding LCC’s capacity. Demand for cement is very high; for building and construction, which consumed an estimated 8,000,000 {{tones of the}} <b>sulphate-resistant</b> cement. Upon the entrance of Asamer Holding 100MEUR modernization and investment projects were completed increasing the production efficiency, environmental protection measures and labor safety standards.|$|E
5000|$|The Libyan Cement Company started {{production}} in 1972 with one factory. The production capacity for ordinary Portland cement was 200,000 t/yr. In 1974, a new production line was {{added with a}} capacity of 400,000 t/yr. A third production line was built in 1977 with a 400,000 ton capacity, which brought production to 1 million t/yr of ordinary Portland cement. However, the first factory stopped production due to maintenance problems. As of 2007, the Benghazi plant produces 800,000 t/yr. The Hawari plant, which was established in 1964 to produce 1,000,000 t/yr. In 1987, adjustments {{were made to the}} Hawari plant production lines to produce <b>sulphate-resistant</b> cement. The El-Fatayah factory was established in 1982 with two production lines having a 1,000,000 t/yr capacity of ordinary Portland cement. This factory is located 350 km east of Benghazi, near Derna. LCC also has a factory that produces the cement packaging, which was established in 1975; as it stands today, the factory produces 200,000 bags per day.

40|$|The aim was {{to measure}} the {{behaviour}} of various mortars employed in livestock media in central Spain and to analyse the aggressiveness of pig slurry to cement blended with fly ash mortars. To achieve this, mortar specimens were immersed in ponds storing pig slurry. Mortar specimens, of 40 ? 40 ? 160 mm, were made from four types of cement commonly used and recommended for rural areas. The types were a <b>sulphate-resistant</b> Portland cement and three cements blended in different proportions with fly ash and limestone filler. After 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of exposure, three or four specimens of each cement type {{were removed from the}} pond and washed with water. Their compressive strength and microstructure (X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion pore-symmetry, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy) were then measured. <b>Sulphate-resistant</b> Portland cement (SR-PC), found to be more susceptible to degradation due to its greater proportion of macro-pores and increased total porosity, was found not to be suitable for use with livestock. After 60 months of immersion in the pig slurry medium, CEM II-A (40. 3 %) mortar retained the greatest compressive strength. Mortars with less than 20 % replacement of cement by fly ash were found to be the most durable, with the most suitable mechanical behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the performance of geopolymer concrete prepared using blended ash of pulverized fuel ash and palm oil fuel ash from agroindustrial waste along with alkaline activators when exposed to a 5 % sodium sulphate solution for up to 18 months. Ordinary portland cement (OPC) concrete was also prepared as the control concrete. The main parameters studied were the evaluation of mass change, compressive strength, products of degradation, and microstructural changes. The deterioration was examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), a thermogravimetry analyzer (TGA), and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The results of geopolymer and OPC concretes were compared and discussed. The compressive strength of geopolymer concrete, when exposed to a 5 % sodium sulphate solution for more than 1 year, was superior to that of OPC concrete. These materials could be used for making <b>sulphate-resistant</b> concretes, attributable to a more stable cross-linked aluminosilicate polymer structure formed in the geopolymer concrete.

30|$|To {{identify}} {{the cause of}} damage, the LGRB made several exploration drillings. Similar {{to the case of}} Staufen, inflow of groundwater into an anhydrite-bearing layer had caused the uplifts. The swellable anhydrite layers were located in the Grabfeld formation at a depth of 56 – 114  m below ground level (Fig.  4). Geothermal drillings reached their final depth in the impermeable Erfurt formation. Hence, upward migration of the underlying confined groundwater of the Upper Muschelkalk was excluded just as in the city of Staufen. Temperature profiles confirmed a descending groundwater flow from the Stuttgart formation into the anhydrite-bearing layers of the Grabfeld formation. Groundwater from the Stuttgart formation found its way through a leaky backfilling. In late 2014, the LGRB took first damage-limiting measures: Post-grouting of the leaky annulus with <b>sulphate-resistant</b> cement and permanent groundwater drawdown below the swellable zones. After this, the temperature profiles indicated a stop of vertical groundwater flow along the installed BHE. A reduced ground uplift rate was measured as soon as the initial recovery measures started (LGRB 2016). The uplift damaged more than 250 buildings and the amount of damage is currently estimated to be around 50  million Euros (StZ 2015).|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} mineralogical and geochemical analysis of a suite of mudstones from the London Clay Formation of southern and south-eastern England. The work was carried out {{as part of the}} ongoing ‘Ground Movements: Shrink/Swell’ project under the Physical Hazards Programme. The first part of the report gives an introduction to the geology of the London Clay Formation and a summary of previous mineralogical studies of these rocks. A summary of analytical methods employed (X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and surface area determinations) is then provided and the results discussed with reference to their likely effect on the engineering performance of the London Clay Formation. The study has generally confirmed the findings of previous workers with typical non-clay mineral assemblages composed of quartz, feldspar (albite and K-feldspar), carbonates (dolomite, siderite and calcite), ‘mica’, pyrite, gypsum and goethite while clay mineral assemblages are generally formed of smectite, illite, kaolinite and chlorite. However, the wide geographic and stratigraphic distribution of the analysed samples has provided important new information which will aid not only interpretation of the engineering behaviour of these rocks but also their diagenetic and geological histories. The engineering properties of the London Clay Formation are heavily influenced by its clay mineralogy and the proportion of clay minerals present. This study has shown that while the composition of the clay mineral assemblages is similar across the London Clay Formation outcrop, the proportion of clay material increases from west to east. The most clay-rich samples are found in the London Basin and particularly around the Thames estuary, central Essex and just west of London in eastern Berkshire/Surrey. These clay-rich samples also contain the most smectite and are therefore likely to undergo the greatest shrink-swell volume changes during wetting and drying and provide the most problems in terms of their engineering behaviour. It would appear most likely that the smectite in the London Clay Formation was contributed by the reworking of ash-rich soils while kaolinite was sourced from tropical weathering of granites to the west. A rare occurrence of a pure interlayered kaolinite/smectite clay assemblage in a sample from Studland Bay, Dorset is likely to have developed due to the acidic, tropical weathering of a volcanic-ash or smectite-rich deposit. The very common presence of pyrite, together with gypsum in the London Clay Formation means that concrete engineering sited in these rocks may require <b>sulphate-resistant</b> compositions to avoid acid attack and thaumasite formation...|$|E
30|$|Concrete {{materials}} are in general very durable. However, an aggressive environment can cause deterioration and total collapses of concrete structures {{long before they}} have reached the designed end of life. Sulphate environment {{represents one of the}} aggressors with significant influence on the durability of concrete. A special type of sulphate deterioration of concrete materials is biocorrosion—the process caused by presence and activities of microorganisms producing sulphuric acid. Studies of the biological processes behind the corrosion of wastewater infrastructure with reference to the role of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulphur-oxidising bacteria (SOB), studies of the chemical effects of sulphates and sulphuric acid on concrete mixes as well as laboratory research methodologies were studied in [1]. Initiating the bacterial processes, sulphates present in the sewer system are converted into the sulphides by sulphate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio spp. The biofilms with SRB in pipelines with intense corrosion had lower cell numbers but much higher total hydrogenase activity [2]. In the study [3], various mechanisms proposed for SRB-induced corrosion such as biocatalytic cathodic sulphate reduction (BCSR); three stages mechanism (Romero mechanism) or sulphide and hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC) were investigated. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that the concentration of Acidithiobacillusthiooxidans (A. thiooxidans) in concrete surface layer may be the best indicator of its biodeterioration intensity [4]. Dubravka et al. [5] has presented a review on microbial processes in municipal waste water collection system, which occur when concrete is exposed to microbacterial and biodegradation favourable environment. Overview [6] has tried to compile the status of knowledge in the field of biodeterioration of concrete, identify areas where more information is needed, and describe nanotechnologies {{that can be used to}} obtain the research goals. Zivica and Bajza in [7] described in detail the sources of the gaseous and liquid acidic media, principles of acidic attack and its chemical effects on the attacked material and its resulted degradation. Results of the study on aggressivity of selected carboxylic and sulphonic acids, phenols and some others are published in [8]. Observed increased expansions followed by crack propagation at the action of some media were adjudged to the cooperation of the mechanism. The highest aggression showed the solution of naphtensulphonates and p-toluene sulphonic acid [8]. A special type of sulphate deterioration of concrete materials is biocorrosion—the process caused by presence and activities of microorganisms producing sulphuric acid. Five different concrete compositions were tested in [9] including a reference mixture with high <b>sulphate-resistant</b> Portland cement and four different polymer cement concrete with a styrene–acrylic ester polymer, an acrylic polymer, a styrene butadiene polymer and a vinyl copolymer, respectively. The change in pH of the simulation solutions, changes of Ca 2 + concentration of the simulation solution, change in height of the different concrete mixtures and change in weight of the different concrete mixtures were presented. Also results of comparison between the microbiological tests and the chemical tests are published in [9]. Experiments lead to conclusion that concrete composition with the styrene–acrylic ester polymer showed in both tests a higher resistance than the reference, mixture while the compositions with the acrylic polymer and the styrene butadiene polymer had a lower resistance than the reference mixture [9]. In work [10] deterioration mechanisms associated with cementitious materials made with calcium aluminate cement those made with ordinary Portland cement are presented. These samples were exposed to accelerated test relevant to these materials, as well as any other materials that can be used in sewer networks. According to [11, 12] biodeterioration mechanisms of cementitious materials in sewer networks also bring in a succession of microorganisms clearly identified in the case of ordinary Portland cement. Samples were prepared for laboratory and for in situ experiments. Studies carried out in the laboratory indicate that the simple chemical tests (with the addition of sulphuric acid) do not allow estimation of the service life of materials in sewer system [10]. A part of development of a computer model to describe the carrion concrete made with Portland/Portland blastfurnace cement/concrete with calcium aluminate cement at pH value between 4.0 and 6.5 are presented in [13]. According to this work, degree of the corrosion is defined by the thickness and porosity of the corroded layer and if abrasion effect occurs, the thickness of removed material. Classification of test methods for concrete corrosion determination and evaluation were presented in [14]. Test methods can be classified according to: the aggressive environment (sewers, underground structures, chemical plants…); the scale of test methods; the type of aggressive species (organic acid, salts, soft water…); parameters to accelerate degradation in simulation tests; the way of measuring the degradation of the specimens (thickness changes, mass loss, expansion, residual strength of specimens, pH changes of liquid); Ca, Fe, Al, Si and other ions released in liquid. Often combinations of the multiple relevant indicators are necessary [14].|$|E
