5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or <b>semantic</b> role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the <b>semantic</b> cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or <b>semantic,</b> depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E

25|$|Different {{diseases}} and disorders {{can affect the}} biological workings of <b>semantic</b> memory. A variety of {{studies have been done}} in an attempt to determine the effects on varying aspects of <b>semantic</b> memory. For example, Lambon, Lowe, & Rogers (2007) studied the different effects <b>semantic</b> dementia and herpes simplex virus encephalitis have on <b>semantic</b> memory. They found that <b>semantic</b> dementia has a more generalized <b>semantic</b> impairment. Additionally, deficits in <b>semantic</b> memory as a result of herpes simplex virus encephalitis tend to have more category-specific impairments. Other disorders that affect <b>semantic</b> memory - such as Alzheimer's disease - has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects. Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of <b>semantic</b> knowledge (Koenig et al. 2007).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} <b>semantic</b> memory disorders, one must first understand how these disorders affect memory. <b>Semantic</b> memory disorders fractionate into two categories. <b>Semantic</b> category specific impairments and modality specific impairments are apparent in disorders of <b>semantic</b> memory. Understanding these types of impairments will give insight into how disorders of <b>semantic</b> memory function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> memory {{disorders}} {{fall into}} two groups. <b>Semantic</b> refractory access disorders are contrasted with <b>semantic</b> storage disorders according to four factors. Temporal factors, response consistency, frequency and <b>semantic</b> relatedness are the four factors used to differentiate between <b>semantic</b> refractory access and <b>semantic</b> storage disorders. A key feature of <b>semantic</b> refractory access disorders is temporal distortions. Decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times. Response consistency is the next factor. In access disorders you see inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times. Temporal factors impact response consistency. In storage disorders, you do not see an inconsistent response to specific items like you do in refractory access disorders. Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition. Extreme word frequency effects are common in <b>semantic</b> storage disorders while in <b>semantic</b> refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal. The comparison of 'close' and 'distant' groups tests <b>semantic</b> relatedness. 'Close' groupings have words that are related because they are drawn from the same category. For example, a listing of clothing types would be a 'close' grouping. 'Distant' groupings contain words with broad categorical differences. Non-related words would fall into this group. Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders <b>semantic</b> relatedness had a negative effect. This is not observed in <b>semantic</b> storage disorders. Category specific and modality specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of <b>semantic</b> memory.|$|E
25|$|Together, <b>semantic</b> and {{episodic memory}} make up our {{declarative}} memory. They each represent {{different parts of}} context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect <b>semantic</b> memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and <b>semantic</b> memory operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and <b>semantic</b> memory were separate systems that competed {{with each other in}} retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent <b>semantic</b> analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in <b>semantic</b> similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so <b>semantic</b> cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.|$|E
25|$|The hippocampal {{areas are}} {{important}} to <b>semantic</b> memory's involvement with declarative memory. The left inferior prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the left posterior temporal areas are other areas involved in <b>semantic</b> memory use. Temporal lobe damage affecting the lateral and medial cortexes have been related to <b>semantic</b> impairments. Damage to {{different areas of the}} brain affect <b>semantic</b> memory differently.|$|E
25|$|Category {{specific}} impairments {{can result}} in widespread, patchy damage or localized damage. Category specific impairments {{can be broken down}} into four categories. Perceptual and functional features, topographic organization, informativeness and intercorrelations are areas of decreased functioning in disorders of <b>semantic</b> memory (Warrington and Shallice, 1984). Alzheimer's disease is a <b>semantic</b> memory disorder that results in errors describing and naming objects, though not necessarily category-specific. <b>Semantic</b> dementia is another disorder associated with <b>semantic</b> memory. <b>Semantic</b> dementia is a language disorder characterized by a deterioration in understanding and recognizing words. Impairments include difficulty in generating familiar words, difficulty naming objects and difficulties with visual recognition. Research suggests that the temporal lobe might be responsible for category specific impairments of <b>semantic</b> memory disorders. In addition to category specific impairments, modality specific impairments are included in disorders of <b>semantic</b> memory (Cohen et al. 2002).|$|E
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> MediaWiki (SMW) is an {{extension}} to MediaWiki that allows for annotating <b>semantic</b> data within wiki pages, thus turning a wiki that incorporates the extension into a <b>semantic</b> wiki. Data that has been encoded {{can be used in}} <b>semantic</b> searches, used for aggregation of pages, displayed in formats like maps, calendars and graphs, and exported to the outside world via formats like RDF and CSV.|$|E
25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, <b>semantic</b> field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a <b>semantic</b> field. The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger <b>semantic</b> category of cooking. <b>Semantic</b> field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. <b>Semantic</b> relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. <b>Semantic</b> field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of <b>semantic</b> relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|A {{task and}} its track {{allocation}} is flexible; a task might develop {{into its own}} track, e.g. the taxonomy evaluation task in SemEval-2015 was under the Learning <b>Semantic</b> Relations track and in SemEval-2016, there is a dedicated track for <b>Semantic</b> Taxonomy with a new <b>Semantic</b> Taxonomy Enrichment task.|$|E
25|$|As {{the types}} of {{different}} computational <b>semantic</b> systems grew beyond the coverage of WSD, Senseval evolved into SemEval, where more aspects of computational <b>semantic</b> systems were evaluated.|$|E
25|$|In English, WordNet is {{an example}} of a <b>semantic</b> network. It {{contains}} English words that are grouped into synsets. Some <b>semantic</b> relations between these synsets are meronymy, hyponymy, synonymy and antonymy.|$|E
25|$|In <b>semantic</b> priming, {{the prime}} {{and the target}} are from the same <b>semantic</b> {{category}} and share features. For example, the word dog is a <b>semantic</b> prime for wolf, because the two are similar animals. <b>Semantic</b> priming is theorized to work because of spreading activation within associative networks. When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even {{if they are not}} words, morphemes can prime for complete words that include them. An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'.|$|E
25|$|Some {{pairs of}} Traditional and Simplified are also {{considered}} to be <b>semantic</b> variants. According to Unicode's definitions, {{it makes sense that}} all simplifications (that do not result in wholly different characters being merged for their homophony) will be a form of <b>semantic</b> variant. Unicode classifies 丟 and 丢 as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants and also as each other's <b>semantic</b> variants. However, while Unicode classifies 億 (U+5104)and 亿 (U+4EBF) as each other's respective traditional and simplified variants, Unicode does not consider 億 and 亿 to be <b>semantic</b> variants of each other.|$|E
25|$|TLC is an {{instance}} of a more general class of models known as <b>semantic</b> networks. In a <b>semantic</b> network, each node is to be interpreted as representing a specific concept, word, or feature. That is, each node is a symbol. <b>Semantic</b> networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as {{may be found in}} a neural network. The defining feature of a <b>semantic</b> network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they only point in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes. Processing in a <b>semantic</b> network often takes the form of spreading activation (see above).|$|E

25|$|Neuroimaging {{evidence}} suggests that left hippocampal areas show an increase in activity during <b>semantic</b> memory tasks. During <b>semantic</b> retrieval, two regions in the right middle frontal gyrus and {{the area of the}} right inferior temporal gyrus similarly show an increase in activity. Damage to areas involved in <b>semantic</b> memory result in various deficits, depending on the area and type of damage. For instance, Lambon Ralph, Lowe, & Rogers (2007) found that category-specific impairments can occur where patients have different knowledge deficits for one <b>semantic</b> category over another, depending on location and type of damage. Category-specific impairments might indicate that knowledge may rely differentially upon sensory and motor properties encoded in separate areas (Farah and McClelland, 1991).|$|E
25|$|Over 80% of Chinese {{characters}} are phono-semantic compounds, with a <b>semantic</b> component giving a broad category {{of meaning and}} a phonetic component suggesting the sound. Usually, the radical is also the <b>semantic</b> component, {{but that is not}} always the case.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the <b>semantic</b> entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a <b>semantic</b> field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. A <b>semantic</b> field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger <b>semantic</b> field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the <b>semantic</b> field further.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{modality}} testing allows {{practitioners to}} assess for generalized versus specific deficits, distinguishing visual agnosias from optic aphasia, {{which is a}} more generalized deficit in <b>semantic</b> knowledge for objects that spans multiple sensory modalities, indicating an impairment in the <b>semantic</b> representations themselves.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Wikimedia Foundation Deputy Director Erik Möller {{stated that}} Wikimedia was {{interested}} in adding <b>semantic</b> capabilities to Wikipedia, but that they were unsure whether <b>Semantic</b> MediaWiki was the right solution, since {{it was unclear whether}} it could be used without negatively affecting Wikipedia's performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} deficit {{model is}} based on a multi-component theory of memory representation that suggests that <b>semantic</b> and phonological information is stored in memory and retrieved separately. The transmission deficit model posits that TOTs occur when there is activation of the <b>semantic</b> component of the target word memory but this activation does not pass on to the phonological level of the memory of the target word. Thus, TOTs are caused by the deficit in transmission of activation from the <b>semantic</b> memory store to the phonological memory store.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} anterograde amnesia {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and <b>semantic</b> memory. Episodic memory is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas <b>semantic</b> memory involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed anterograde amnesia during childhood, it was determined that the patient ("C.L.") retained <b>semantic</b> memory while suffering an extreme impairment of episodic memory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> MediaWiki is also {{supported}} on the wiki farm Referata, by default. Wikia has previously activated <b>Semantic</b> MediaWiki on user request, but has stopped doing so since upgrading to version 1.19 of MediaWiki; Wikia sites, such as Familypedia, that had started using it are able to continue.|$|E
25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the <b>semantic</b> web. The <b>semantic</b> web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the <b>semantic</b> web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future <b>semantic</b> web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E
25|$|Three {{advantages}} of <b>semantic</b> compaction over single meaning pictures and alphabet-based systems are that a user {{need not be}} literate, symbol combinations are limited to up to just 3 at a time, and fewer symbols are required on the screen or device than with other AAC devices. A disadvantage of <b>semantic</b> compaction is that the user {{must be able to}} memorize codes; if a user is not cognitively capable of linking multiple icons together, he or she will not benefit from the <b>semantic</b> compaction system. A single-meaning icon set would be more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|So-called <b>semantic</b> {{variants}} of 丟 (U+4E1F) and 丢 (U+4E22) are examples that Unicode gives as differing {{in a significant}} way in their abstract shapes, while Unicode lists 佛 and 仏 as z-variants, differing only in font styling. Paradoxically, Unicode considers 兩 and 両 to be near identical z-variants {{while at the same}} time classifying them as significantly different <b>semantic</b> variants. There are also cases of some pairs of characters being simultaneously <b>semantic</b> variants and specialized <b>semantic</b> variants and simplified variants: 個 (U+500B) and 个 (U+4E2A). There are cases of non-mutual equivalence. For example, the Unihan database entry for 亀 (U+4E80) considers 龜 (U+9F9C) to be its z-variant, but the entry for 龜 does not list 亀 as a z-variant, even though 龜 was obviously already in the database at the time that the entry for 亀 was written.|$|E
25|$|One {{would expect}} that all {{simplified}} characters would simultaneously also be z-variants or <b>semantic</b> variants with their traditional counterparts, but many are neither. It is easier to explain the strange case that <b>semantic</b> variants can be simultaneously both <b>semantic</b> variants and specialized variants when Unicode's definition is that specialized <b>semantic</b> variants have the same meaning only in certain contexts. Languages use them differently. A pair whose characters are 100% drop-in replacements for each other in Japanese {{may not be so}} flexible in Chinese. Thus, any comprehensive merger of recommended codepoints would have to maintain some variants that differ only slightly in appearance even if the meaning is 100% the same for all contexts in one language, because in another language the two characters may not be 100% drop-in replacements.|$|E

25|$|<b>Semantic</b> {{memory has}} had a {{comeback}} in interest in the past 15 years, {{due in part to}} the development of functional neuroimaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which have been used to address some of the central questions about our understanding of <b>semantic</b> memory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Semantic</b> {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). <b>Semantic</b> memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. <b>Semantic</b> memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, <b>semantic</b> memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E
25|$|For <b>semantic</b> purpose, classifications can {{be grouped}} into compositions.|$|E
25|$|Various neural {{imaging and}} {{research}} points to <b>semantic</b> memory and episodic memory resulting from distinct {{areas in the}} brain. Still other research suggests that both <b>semantic</b> memory and episodic memory {{are part of a}} singular declarative memory system, yet represent different sectors and parts within the greater whole. Different areas within the brain are activated depending on whether <b>semantic</b> or episodic memory is accessed. Certain experts are still arguing whether or not the two types of memory are from distinct systems or whether the neural imaging makes it appear that way {{as a result of the}} activation of different mental processes during retrieval.|$|E
