In particular when so-called ‘priming effects’, the counterintuitive loss of soil carbon following input of organic carbon substrates, {{are taken into}} consideration. Here we investigate the dynamics of priming effects and ask whether the source of primed carbon is microbial biomass or soil organic matter and whether specific microbial groups, as identified by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers, may be important in causing them. We measured d 13 C within soil CO 2 efflux and PLFA biomarkers following C 3 <b>soil</b> <b>priming</b> effects caused by additions of C 4 sugar-cane sucrose and maize (Zea mays L.) leaf-litter chopped and ground.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether <b>soil</b> <b>priming</b> induced by J. curcas monoculture could alter the rhizobial populations that nodulate cowpea and acacia, two locally widespread legumes. Soil samples were transferred into a greenhouse from three fields previously cultivated with Jatropha for 1, 2, and 15 years, and the two trap legumes were grown in them. Control soil samples were also taken from adjacent Jatropha-fallow plots. Both legumes tended to develop fewer but larger nodules when grown in Jatropha soils. Nearly all the nifH sequences amplified from nodule DNA were affiliated to the Bradyrhizobium genus. Only sequences from Acacia seyai nodules grown in the most recent Jatropha plantation were related to the Mesorhizobium genus, which was much a more conventional finding on A. seyal than the unexpected Bradyrhizobium genus. Apart from this particular case, only minor differences were found in the respective compositions of Jatropha soil versus control soil rhizobial populations. Lastly, the structure of these rhizobial populations was systematically imbalanced owing to the overwhelming dominance of a very small number of nifH genotypes, some of which were identical across soil types or even sites. Despite these weak and sparse effects on rhizobial diversity, future investigations should focus on the characterization of the nitrogen-fixing abilities of the predominant rhizobial strains...|$|E

We conducted {{one of the}} first studies of PyOM and wood decomposition in a temperate forest using isotopically labeled organic substrate, and quantified microbial incorporation and physico-chemical transformations of PyOM in situ. Stable-isotope (13 C and 15 N) enriched PyOM and its precursor wood were added to the soil at 2 cm depth at ambient (N 0) and increased (N+) levels of nitrogen fertilization. The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) of added PyOM or wood were tracked through soil to 15 cm depth, in physically separated soil density fractions and in benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) molecular markers. After 10 months in situ, more PyOM-derived C (> 99 % of initial 13 C-PyOM) and N (90 % of initial 15 N-PyOM) was recovered than wood derived C (48 % of 13 C-wood) and N (89 % under N 0 and 48 % under N+). PyOM-C and wood-C migrated at the rate of 126 mm yr- 1 with 3 - 4 % of PyOM-C and 4 - 8 % of wood-C recovered below the application depth. Most PyOM C was recovered in the free light fraction (fLF) (74 %), with 20 % in aggregate-occluded and 6 % in mineral associated fractions —fractions that typically have much slower turnover times. In contrast, wood C was recovered mainly in occluded (33 %) or dense fraction (27 %). PyOM addition induced loss of native C from <b>soil</b> (<b>priming</b> effect), particularly in fLF (13 %). The total BPCA-C content did not change but after ten months the degree of aromatic condensation of PyOM decreased, as determined by relative contribution of benzene hexa-carboxylic acid (B 6 CA) to the total BPCA C.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} interactions between the decomposition of aboveground litter and rhizosphere activity. The experimental approach combined the placement of labelled litter (delta(13) C=- 37. 9 parts per thousand) with forest girdling in a 35 -year-old Norway spruce stand, resulting in four different treatment combinations: GL (girdled, litter), GNL (girdled, no litter), NGL (not girdled, litter), and NGNL (not girdled, no litter). Monthly sampling of soil CO 2 efflux and delta(13) C of soil respired CO 2 between May and October 2002 allowed the partitioning of the flux into that derived from the labelled litter, and that derived from native soil organic matter and roots. The effect of forest girdling on soil CO 2 efflux was detectable from June (girdling took place in April), and resulted in GNL fluxes to be about 50 % of NGNL fluxes by late August. The presence of litter resulted in significantly increased fluxes for the first 2 months of the experiment, with significantly greater litter derived fluxes from non-girdled plots and a significant interaction between girdling and litter treatments over the same period. For NGL collars, the additional efflux was found to originate only in part from litter decomposition, but also from the decay of native soil organic matter. In GL collars, this priming effect was not significant, indicating an active role of the rhizosphere in <b>soil</b> <b>priming.</b> The results therefore indicate mutual positive feedbacks between litter decomposition and rhizosphere activity. Soil biological analysis (microbial and fungal biomass) of the organic layers indicated greatest activity below NGL collars, and we suppose that this increase indicates the mechanism of mutual positive feedback between rhizosphere activity and litter decomposition. However, elimination of fresh C input from both above- and belowground (GNL) also resulted in greater fungal abundance than for the NGNL treatment, indicating likely changes in fungal community structure (i. e. a shift from symbiotic to saprotrophic species abundance).

Its ideal habitat extends from above the tree line around 3,200 to 4,500 m, with some wolves inhabiting the Bale Mountains being present in montane grasslands at 3,000 m. Although specimens were collected in Gojjam and northwestern Shoa at 2,500 m in the early 20th century, no recent records exist of the species occurring below 3,000 m. In modern times, subsistence agriculture, which extends up to 3,700 m, has largely restricted the species to the highest peaks.The Ethiopian wolf uses all Afroalpine habitats, but has a preference for open areas containing short herbaceous and grassland communities inhabited by rodents, which are most abundant along flat or gently sloping areas with poor drainage and deep <b>soils.</b> <b>Prime</b> wolf habitat in the Bale Mountains consists of short Alchemilla herbs and grasses, with low vegetation cover.

40|$|Fresh plant litter inputs {{accelerate}} soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) decomposition through a ubiquitous mechanism called priming. Insufficient priming has been suggested as a stabilization mechanism of SOM at depth, {{as well as the}} long-term persistence of some highly degradable organic compounds in <b>soils.</b> <b>Priming</b> therefore plays a crucial, albeit unquantified and commonly neglected, role in the global carbon cycle. Because priming intensity is likely to be altered by global changeinduced changes in net primary productivity, it casts substantial uncertainty to future projections of the climate-carbon cycle feedback. Using results from a large field litter manipulation experiment in Mongolian steppe, we here show that priming intensifies with increasing litter inputs, but at a decreasing efficiency: the stimulation per unit litter added declines with increasing litter inputs. This non-linear behavior originates from two antagonistic responses to fresh litter inputs: a stimulation of microbial activity versus a shift in microbial community composition (more fungi) associated to substrate shift from SOM to litter. Despite all complexity, however, the priming effect on SOM decomposition scaled linearly with the response of microbial biomass across the entire range of plant litter addition (60 – 480 g C m⁻²), suggesting that priming could be modeled effectively {{as a function of the}} response of microbial biomass to litter inputs. Incorporating the priming mechanism in Earth System models will improve their estimates of the SOM-climate feedback and appears to be best addressed by explicitly representing microbial biomass in the models...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} reports of losses of soil carbon (C) in New Zealand {{pastures}} under dairy grazing. Acceleration of mineralisation or leaching of soil C following urine deposition may decrease soil C. However, little research {{of the effect of}} cow urine on soil C has been conducted. The overall objective of this thesis was to investigate the potential for dairy cow urine to solubilise soil C, which can then be lost through mineralisation or leaching. Soils from both grazed pasture and Pinus radiata plantations (termed pasture and pine soils) were investigated. The concentration, composition, and bioavailability of urine-C were investigated. Cow urine contained 7. 5 ± 1. 2 g C L–¹, with a C:N ratio of 2 : 1. About 45 % of the C content of cow urine was attributed to hippuric acid, the other major contributors were urea, an unidentified amide and phenaceturic acid. On incubation at 25 °C, up to 25 % of urine-C was degraded in 28 days, demonstrating that cow urine is biodegradable and could potentially act to prime C mineralisation in soils. Solubilisation of soil C (0 - 20 cm soil depth) following urine application was tested by measuring adsorption of urine-C and subsequent desorption of soil C in air-dried pine and pasture soils. While adsorption was low at 3 % of urine-C, the solubilisation of soil C by urine ranged between 11 - 28 % of soil C concentration for 5 different soils, however, solubilisation was likely overestimated due to the use of air-dried soils. Soil C solubilisation was also measured in field moist soils applied with artificial urine, and was less than that reported from air-dried <b>soils.</b> <b>Priming</b> of <b>soil</b> C mineralisation, solubilisation, and extracellular enzyme activity were measured using moist repacked pine and pasture soil cores (0 - 5 cm soil depth) treated with cow urine or radio-labelled artificial urine. Positive <b>priming</b> of <b>soil</b> C mineralisation, where more carbon dioxide (CO₂) was produced than C added, was measured following application of cow urine in both pine and pasture soils. The pasture soils lost 5. 1 ± 0. 9 %, and the pine soils 4. 0 ± 0. 1 %, of soil C concentration as CO₂ during a 84 day incubation. Positive priming was attributed to increased microbial and urease activity and accelerated soil C mineralisation in urine treated soils. The remaining extracellular enzyme activities assayed were unlikely to have contributed to <b>soil</b> C <b>priming.</b> In contrast to the positive priming measured following cow urine application, treatment of soil with artificial urine resulted in less CO₂ produced than C added – or negative <b>priming.</b> Increased <b>soil</b> pH following urine application may have {{played an important role in}} increasing C mineralisation as water soluble C increased with increasing soil pH. Therefore, cow urine can cause <b>priming</b> of <b>soil</b> C mineralisation and lead to a loss of soil C. However, artificial urine may not adequately model cow urine with respect to C cycling. Soil C solubilisation by urine and subsequent leaching from undisturbed pasture soil (0 - 5 cm soil depth) was assessed by applying δ¹³C enriched urine. Leaching resulted in a loss of 0. 45 ± 0. 03 % of soil C concentration, which was 10 times greater than the loss of soil C in the water control treatment (0. 048 ± 0. 001 %). The leaching of soil C was small compared to the 5 % loss of <b>soil</b> C by <b>priming</b> in the repacked core experiment. Soil solubilisation in the undisturbed cores was less than both repacked cores and air-dried soils, demonstrating that soil C solubilisation increases with increasing soil disturbance. The acid neutralising capacity (ANC) forcing potential of cow urine was 11. 8 meq L–¹, which was more than 20 times greater than sodium nitrate fertiliser application (30 kg N ha-¹ year-¹), although the nitrogen loading rates of the urine were higher than the fertiliser. ANC forcing has been linked to increasing soil pH and dissolved organic C leaching, and may have been a factor in soil C solubilisation under urine patches. Upon assessing water stable aggregates after urine application, disaggregation of soil was not a major factor in soil C solubilisation. The key conclusions were that: •	there was strong evidence to support the hypothesis that urine deposition led to soil C solubilisation and <b>priming</b> of <b>soil</b> C mineralisation, that could have contributed to the reported declines in soil C in dairy pastures; •	<b>priming</b> of <b>soil</b> C decomposition was 10 times greater than leaching and may be the predominant mechanism of soil C loss following urine deposition; and •	urine deposition resulted in greater losses of soil C from pasture soils than pine soils, in contrast to expectations that soil C in pasture soils would have been acclimatised to urine application. The work in this thesis was laboratory based and requires further testing under field conditions. Further work is also needed to establish the mechanisms of soil C solubilisation and the role of solubilised <b>soil</b> C in <b>priming</b> of <b>soil</b> C mineralisation...|$|R

40|$|Tropical forests {{contain a}} large stock of soil carbon, but {{the factors that}} {{constrain}} its mineralization remain poorly understood. Microorganisms, when stimulated {{by the presence of}} new inputs of labile organic carbon, can mineralize (‘prime’) soil organic matter to acquire nutrients. We used stable carbon isotopes to assess how nutrient demand and soil properties constrain mineralization of added labile (sucrose) carbon and pre-existing (<b>primed)</b> <b>soil</b> carbon in tropical forest soils. In a series of lowland tropical forest soils from Panama, we found that the mineralization of fresh labile carbon was accelerated foremost by phosphorus addition, whereas the mineralization of pre-existing soil carbon was constrained foremost by nitrogen addition. However, there was variation in the relative importance of these nutrients in different soils and the largest effects on the acceleration of sucrose metabolism and constraint of priming occurred following the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus together. The respiration responses due to sucrose or <b>primed</b> <b>soil</b> carbon mineralization were reduced at pH below 4. 8 and above 6. 0. We conclude that in these tropical forest soils, phosphorus availability is more important in promoting microbial mineralization of sucrose carbon, whereas nitrogen availability is more important in constraining the <b>priming</b> of pre-existing <b>soil</b> organic carbon.

It was incubated for 30 days to evaluate how the labile substrate affected the microbial abundance and native SOC decomposition. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were used as biomarkers for bacteria (Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and actinobacteria) and fungi. ¹³C-glucose application resulted in a significant increase in microbial abundance and positive priming effect for all treatments. The primed CO₂ flux derived from native SOC peaked on day 11, then increased gradually again from day 15 onwards in all treatments. The increase of abundance peaked on days 7 and 15 for Gram-negative (G⁻) bacteria and Gram-positive (G⁺) bacteria, however, fungal and actinobacterial PLFAs increased steadily from day 3 onwards under all three fertilization regimes. The results suggest that G⁺ and G⁻ bacteria make a greater contribution to priming effects during the first 15 days of incubation, while fungi and actinobacteria are more important at the latter stages. The difference between glucose-derived ¹³C remaining in <b>soils</b> and <b>primed</b> CO₂ from native SOC was 480, 381 and 263 mg C kg⁻¹ in CM, NPK and Control treatments, respectively. Our study demonstrates that the exogenous labile organic substrate addition can more effectively promote C sequestration in organic C-rich soil (CM) than in organic C-poor soil (NPK or Control) ...|$|R
40|$|Biochar and its {{properties}} can {{be significantly}} altered {{according to how}} it is produced, and this has ramifications towards how biochar behaves once added to soil. We produced biochars from corncob and miscanthus straw via different methods (slow pyrolysis, hydrothermal and flash carbonization) and temperatures to assess how carbon cycling and soil microbial communities were affected. Mineralization of biochar, its parent feedstock, and native soil organic matter were monitored using 13 C natural abundance during a 1 -year lab incubation. Bacterial and fungal community compositions were studied using T-RFLP and ARISA, respectively. We found that persistent biochar-C with a half-life 60 {{times higher than the}} parent feedstock can be achieved at pyrolysis temperatures of as low as 370 °C, with no further gains to be made at higher temperatures. Biochar re-applied to soil previously incubated with our highest temperature biochar mineralized faster than when applied to unamended <b>soil.</b> Positive <b>priming</b> of native SOC was observed for all amendments but subsided {{by the end of the}} incubation. Fungal and bacterial community composition of the soil-biochar mixture changed increasingly with the application of biochars produced at higher temperatures as compared to unamended soil. Those changes were significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 005) related to biochar properties (mainly pH and O/C) and thus were correlated to pyrolysis temperature. In conclusion, our results suggest that biochar produced at temperatures as low as 370 °C can be utilized to sequester C in soil for more than 100 years while having less impact on soil microbial activities than high-temperature biochars...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} sheep dung on soil carbon (C) sequestration, a 152 days incubation experiment was conducted with soils from two different Inner Mongolian grasslands, i. e. a Leymus chinensis dominated grassland representing the climax community (2. 1 % organic matter content) and a heavily degraded Artemisia frigida dominated community (1. 3 % organic matter content). Dung was collected from sheep either fed on L. chinensis (C 3 plant with d 13 C = 226. 8 %; dung d 13 C = 226. 2 %) or Cleistogenes squarrosa (C 4 plant with d 13 C = 214. 6 %; dung d 13 C = 215. 7 %). Fresh C 3 and C 4 sheep dung was mixed with the two grassland soils and incubated under controlled conditions for analysis of 13 C-CO 2 emissions. Soil samples were taken at days 17, 43, 86, 127 and 152 after sheep dung addition to detect the d 13 C signal in soil and dung components. Analysis revealed that 16. 9 % and 16. 6 % of the sheep dung C had decomposed, of which 3. 5 % and 2. 8 % was sequestrated in the soils of L. chinensis and A. frigida grasslands, respectively, while the remaining decomposed sheep dung was emitted as CO 2. The cumulative amounts of C respired from dung treated soils during 152 days were 7 – 8 times {{higher than in the}} un-amended controls. In both grassland soils, ca. 60 % of the evolved CO 2 originated from the decomposing sheep dung and 40 % from the native <b>soil</b> C. <b>Priming</b> effects of <b>soil</b> C decomposition were observed in both soils, i. e. 1. 4...|$|R

This is better stated: “At temperatures of 86 F (30 C) corn plants reach incipient water stress more than 50 {{percent of the}} time. ” Naturally, this {{does not apply to}} irrigated crops and specifically it applies to non-irrigated corn in the Midwest. In a year with ideal moisture, a perfectly healthy corn plant in <b>prime</b> <b>soil</b> does not begin to expeience water stress until temperatures exceed 92 F and perhaps not then if humidity is high. Still, 86 F is the average and because the government tends to work with the average. the average was set as the upper bound for the U. S. Corn Growing Degree Day and as the lower bound for water stress. The number is rarely the exact switch-over point, but it is “good enough for government work. ” Because we have the government’s critical point numbers, we can make use of them (while remaining keenly aware of the limitations) ...|$|R
50|$|Water project law has had, and {{continues}} to have, {{a significant role in}} the management of important water resources. For example, agricultural drainage, much of which is now responsible for maintaining a significant infrastructure, results largely from these local districts or other entities. Drainage in the United States occurred in two primary developmental periods,during 1870-1920 and during 1945-1960. By 1920, more than 53 e6acre km2 out of a total of 956 e6acre km2 of US farmland had received some form of drainage. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 1982 Natural Resources Inventory (NRI) inventory identified about 107 e6acre km2 of wet <b>soils</b> as being <b>prime</b> or adequately drained, of which 72 percent was then cropland. (Economic Research Service, 1987.) Often, state projects are constructed under the mantle of local water project authorities, using special federal funds appropriated for these purposes. Often the local entity must agree in return for the original federal funds to maintain the project indefinitely with local funds, derived either from taxes or special assessments.|$|R
40|$|Earthworm {{activity}} {{is known to}} increase emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from arable soils. Earthworm gut, casts, and burrows have exhibited higher denitrification activities than the bulk <b>soil,</b> implicating <b>priming</b> of denitrifying organisms as a possible mechanism for this effect. Furthermore, the earthworm feeding strategy may drive N 2 O emissions, as it determines access to fresh organic matter for denitrification. Here, we determined whether interactions between earthworm feeding strategy and the soil denitrifier community can predict N 2 O emissions from the soil. We set up a 90 -day mesocosm experiment in which 15 N-labeled maize (Zea mays L.) was either mixed in or applied {{on top of the}} soil in {{the presence or absence of}} the epigeic earthworm Lumbricus rubellus and/or the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa. We measured N 2 O fluxes and tested the bulk soil for denitrification enzyme activity and the abundance of 16 S rRNA and denitrifier genes nirS and nosZ through real-time quantitative PCR. Compared to the control, L. rubellus increased denitrification enzyme activity and N 2 O emissions on days 21 and 90 (day 21, P = 0. 034 and P = 0. 002, respectively; day 90, P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 007, respectively), as well as cumulative N 2 O emissions (76 %; P = 0. 014). A. caliginosa activity led to a transient increase of N 2 O emissions on days 8 to 18 of the experiment. Abundance of nosZ was significantly increased (100 %) on day 90 in the treatment mixture containing L. rubellus alone. We conclude that L. rubellus increased cumulative N 2 O emissions by affecting denitrifier community activity via incorporation of fresh residue into the soil and supplying a steady, labile carbon sourc...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of future warming and drought on (1) the biochemical composition of above-ground biomass of forage plants (Festuca arundinacea and Dactylis glomerata), (2) the potential mineralization of this material in soil, and (3) its priming effect on native soil organic matter. We sampled above-ground plant material from spring regrowth and summer regrowth of a climate change experiment. While in spring, the plants were well watered, the summer regrowth was exposed to drought and elevated temperature (+ 3 A degrees C) by infrared heating of the canopy during 3 weeks. We assessed the elemental and isotopic composition, lignin and non-cellulosic carbohydrate content and composition of plant material grown under all three conditions. Its mineralization potential in <b>soil</b> and <b>priming</b> effects were evaluated during laboratory incubation. Warming had no significant effect on elemental and stable isotope composition of both plant materials. In contrast, it resulted in reduction of lignin content for both plant species and decrease of the lignin-to-N ratio for F. arundinacea and increased non-cellulosic carbohydrate content for D. glomerata. Summer regrowth was characterised by increase of delta C- 13 values, which is consistent with variations in stomatal conductance due to water shortage. Moreover, summer drought induced an increase in N content leading to decrease of the C/N ratio and increase of lignin-to-N ratio of summer regrowth compared to spring regrowth. Differences in decomposition were small, while priming effects were more strongly altered by the different exposure to enviromental. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that extreme climatic events (high temperature and precipitation deficit) have an influence on soil carbon storage particularly through their effect on <b>priming</b> of native <b>soil</b> organic matter induced by altered plant litter. These effects seem to be governed by alterations of stoichiometry and to a smaller extent by alterations of plant chemical composition...|$|R
40|$|Sandy {{soils are}} {{prevalent}} in tropical environments especially where felsic volcanic, or siliceous sedimentary rocks and their erosional products are found. Whereas {{some of these}} soils are only sandy in the surface layers, others are sandy throughout the root zone. In terms of the agro-ecosystems developed on sandy <b>soils,</b> the <b>prime</b> limiting factors and the main concerns for sustainability, vary according to {{their position in the}} landscape (steeplands, uplands and lowlands) and agro-ecological zoning. Sandy soils occur in arid, semi-arid and humid rainfall zones of the tropics and from coastal lowlands to high altitudes. Sloping sandy soils tend to be used for conservation reserves, forestry (including plantations) and for shifting cultivation, and may also serve as important water catchments. Sandy uplands and lowlands are used for a range of cropping systems including rice-based systems. Plantation crops and forestry are also prevalent. The continuously or seasonally waterlogged lowlands are largely developed for irrigated and rainfed rice cultivation. Tropical sandy soils have a wide range of limiting factors for agricultural use, these include nutrient deficiencies, acidity, water stress and poor physical attributes. The environments in which they occur are prone to degradation risks from nutrient decline, erosion, leaching, salinity, and acidification. Development of sustainable agro-ecosystems in these sandy terrains should be based on optimisation of key ecosystems processes: closing nutrient cycles, restoring hydrological balance; enhancing biodiversity and strengthening resilience of these processes to perturbations. A range of opportunities exist to achieve sustainability of sandy landscapes through plantation forestry, agroforestry, clay and other mineral soil amendments, maintenance of soil organic matter, balanced fertilisation, strategic irrigation, and breeding species for adaption to the constraints present. Management of agro-ecosystems associated with sandy soils will be explored with respect to agricultural productivity and sustainability, and the supply of ecosystem services...|$|R

Assigning a value to the development is difficult and can be costly. Data was collected on 409 preservation transactions from 3 Maryland counties and supplemented with farm level spatial data via GIS. A hedonic price analysis is conducted to determine the marginal return to different farm characteristics using a spatial econometric model to correct for spatial correlation. Parcel characteristics such as distance to city and town, number of acres, <b>prime</b> <b>soils</b> and current land-use explain {{eighty percent of the}} variation in easement values. As expected, characteristics perform least well in explaining easement values in transfer of development right programs. This information can help formulate policy decisions and selection criteria to maximize the preservation of the agricultural economy and/or maximize public preferences. A supply curve is constructed using simulations that determine non-participant parcels' easement values. To preserve the remaining eligible acres in these three counties, $ 167 million would be needed. This method can support programs choosing to use a point system rather than the more costly and difficult to apply standard appraisal methods. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
