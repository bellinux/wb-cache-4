40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>organisms</b> are {{important}} in the structuring of plant communities. However, {{little is known about}} how to apply this knowledge to vegetation management. Here, we examined if <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> may promote plant species of characteristic habitats, and suppress plant species of disturbed habitats. We classified nineteen fields into four types: characteristic and disturbed matgrass swards and successfully and unsuccessfully restored fields. We recorded the vegetation composition and measured biotic and abiotic soil characteristics of the sites. In a pot experiment, we mixed non-sterilized (with <b>soil</b> <b>organisms)</b> or sterilized (without <b>soil</b> <b>organisms)</b> <b>soil</b> inoculum from each field with a common sterilized background soil. We planted seedlings of characteristic matgrass species Antennaria dioica and Nardus stricta, of disturbance indicators Deschampsia flexuosa and Agrostis capillaris, or a combination of the four species. At harvest, we measured root and shoot dry mass of all plants. The vegetation composition of characteristic matgrass swards differed from the disturbed and unsuccessfully restored fields. The successfully restored fields were intermediate. The composition of the nematode community tended to follow the same pattern. In the pot experiment, addition of <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> increased the biomass of A. dioica, N. stricta and D. flexuosa, but decreased the biomass of A. capillaris. However, the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> on plant biomass was not related to field type. A. dioica showed a large variation in biomass in non-sterilized, but not in sterilized <b>soil.</b> <b>Soil</b> <b>organisms</b> from some sites increased plant biomass, whereas <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> from other sites did not. The biomass of characteristic matgrass plants was lower in the presence of plants from disturbed swards, irrespective of the presence of <b>soil</b> <b>organisms.</b> Probably A. capillaris was so much larger than the other species, that this overruled effects of added <b>soil</b> <b>organisms.</b> <b>Soil</b> <b>organisms</b> promoted growth of plant species characteristic of matgrass swards, whereas they reduced growth of a plant species characteristic of disturbed fields. <b>Soil</b> <b>organisms</b> did not change the outcome of plant interactions, which was won by a disturbance indicator. Nevertheless, measurement of the growth stimulating capacity of a soil may be used to assess opportunities for reintroduction of characteristic plant species...|$|R

50|$|Together {{with his}} {{students}} and collaborators, {{over the next}} 20 years, McCarty's work changed {{the understanding of the}} organism from a gram-positive streptococcus with a particular serological characteristic to one of the best characterized bacterial species. Work on bacterial cell-wall anatomy and chemistry was just beginning. His work led to the isolation of the streptococcal cell wall as a structural entity suitable for anatomic inspection by electronmicroscopy. Chemical dissection led to characterization of the group A-specific polysaccharide and the peptidoglycan, and the identification of its serological specificity in the terminal hexosamine. In order to prove this specificity, he first had to identify and purify a specific enzyme that cleaved hexosamine (a hexosaminidase) from a <b>soil</b> <b>organism.</b> Treating the polysaccharide with this enzyme abrogated its serological reactivity. McCarty further demonstrated the precise configuration of the hexosamine linkage by synthesizing both α- and β-N-acetyl-glucosamine ovalbumin and showing that only the second reacted with group A antisera. A similar analytical strategy indicated that the polysaccharide of group C streptococci differed by having a terminal β-N-acetyl galactosamine as the serological determinant.|$|E

50|$|Verticillium albo-atrum Reinke & Berthold - causes {{verticillium wilt}} or maple wilt. First {{identified}} from potatoes in Germany in 1870, this species attacks over 300 different cultivated plants and can persist as a saprotrophic <b>soil</b> <b>organism</b> {{for more than}} 15 years. When infecting ornamental trees such as maples, elms, aspen, ash, beech, catalpa, oak, and others, the first symptoms are midsummer wilting {{on one side of}} a tree or branch. The sapwood has greenish or brownish streaks, and the infection can take a few years to progress {{to the rest of the}} tree or move rapidly. The fungi universally move up the xylem vessels. In fruit trees, the infection is known as black heart, and is common in apricots and sometimes affects almond, peach, plum, and avocado trees. This fungus also affects herbaceous ornamentals and vegetables such as chrysanthemums, mints, Lychnis spp., tomatoes, eggplants, okra, and rhubarb, causing wilting and death. Identification can be made by looking for one-celled conidia, hyaline round to ellipsoid which are formed at the tips of whorled branches. They are easily separated from the tips.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{agricultural}} practices have generally caused declining soil structure. For example, cultivation causes the mechanical mixing of the soil, compacting and sheering of aggregates and filling of pore spaces - organic matter is also {{exposed to a}} greater rate of decay and oxidation. Soil structure is essential to soil health and fertility; soil structure decline has a direct effect on soil and surface food chain and biodiversity as a consequence. Continued crop cultivation eventually results in significant changes within the soil, such as its nutrient status, pH balance, organic matter content, and physical characteristics. While some of these changes can be beneficial to food and crop production, {{they can also be}} harmful towards other necessary systems. For example, studies have shown that tilling has had negative consequences towards soil organic matter (SOM), the organic component of soil composed of plant and animal decomposition and substances synthesized by soil organisms. SOM plays an integral role in the preservation of soil structure, but the constant tilling of crops has caused the SOM to shift and redistribute, causing soil structure to deteriorate and altering <b>soil</b> <b>organism</b> populations (such as with earthworms). Yet {{in many parts of the}} world, maximizing food production at all costs due to rampant poverty and the lack of food security tends to leave the long term ecological consequences overlooked, despite research and acknowledgment by the academic community.|$|E
5000|$|Infiltration {{is caused}} by two forces: gravity and {{capillary}} action. While smaller pores offer greater resistance to gravity, very small pores pull water through capillary action in addition to and even against the force of gravity. [...] The rate of infiltration is determined by soil characteristics including ease of entry, storage capacity, and transmission rate through the soil. The soil texture and structure, vegetation types and cover, water content of the soil, soil temperature, and rainfall intensity all {{play a role in}} controlling infiltration rate and capacity. For example, coarse-grained sandy soils have large spaces between each grain and allow water to infiltrate quickly. Vegetation creates more porous soils by protecting the soil from raindrop impact, which can close natural gaps between soil particles, loosening soil through root action and enhancing the presence of <b>soil</b> <b>organism</b> like termites, worms and small mammals that have a direct impact on soil bulk densities. This is why forested areas have the highest infiltration rates of any vegetative types. [...] The top layer of leaf litter that is not decomposed protects the soil from the pounding action of rain; without this the soil can become far less permeable. In chaparral vegetated areas, the hydrophobic oils in the succulent leaves can be spread over the soil surface with fire, creating large areas of hydrophobic soil. Other conditions that can lower infiltration rates or block them include dry plant litter that resists re-wetting, or frost. If soil is saturated at the time of an intense freezing period, the soil can become a concrete frost on which almost no infiltration would occur. Over an entire watershed, there are likely to be gaps in the concrete frost or hygroscopic soil where water could infiltrate. [...] Once water has infiltrated the soil it remains in the soil, percolates down to the ground water table, or becomes part of the subsurface runoff process.|$|E

Management of belowground pests and diseases remains particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the soil and the limited reach of conventional agrochemicals. Boosting the presence of beneficial rhizosphere organisms is a potentially sustainable alternative and may help to optimize crop health and productivity. Field application of single beneficial <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> has shown satisfactory results under optimal conditions. This might be further enhanced by combining multiple beneficial <b>soil</b> <b>organisms,</b> but this remains poorly investigated. Here, we inoculated wheat plots with combinations of three beneficial <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> that have different rhizosphere functions and studied their effects on crop performance. Plant beneficial Pseudomonas bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), were inoculated individually or in combinations at seeding, and their effects on plant performance were evaluated throughout the season. We used traditional and molecular identification tools to monitor their persistence over the cropping season in augmented and control treatments, and to estimate the possible displacement of native populations. In three separate trials, beneficial <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> were successfully introduced into the native populations and readily survived the field conditions. Various Pseudomonas, mycorrhiza, and nematode treatments improved plant health and productivity, while their combinations provided no significant additive or synergistic benefits compared to when applied alone. EPN application temporarily displaced some of the native EPN, but had no significant long-term effect on the associated food web. The strongest positive effect on wheat survival was observed for Pseudomonas and AMF during a season with heavy natural infestation by the frit fly, Oscinella frit, a major pest of cereals. Hence, beneficial impacts differed between the beneficial <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> and were most evident for plants under biotic stress. Overall, our findings indicate that in wheat production under the test conditions the three beneficial <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> can establish nicely and are compatible, but their combined application provides no additional benefits.

The description of spatiotemporal distributions of <b>soil</b> <b>organisms</b> at relevant scales and in relation to their activity is a prerequisite to understand and quantify the factors that control soil functions. Species distribution models can help to explain the functional relationships between organisms and their habitat by estimating occurrence probabilities from spatial-distribution data and environmental predictors for single species or species groups. Here, I present a brief overview of recent developments in species distribution models and illustrate this tool with a case study using a carabid beetle species in a small-scale highly heterogeneously structured environment.
