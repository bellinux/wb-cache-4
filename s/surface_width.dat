5000|$|The {{country rock}} in the {{proximity}} of the mine is a black graphitic slate, though the schist belt lies a short distance to the east. This slate is usually wrinkled, rich in carbonaceous matter, and scattered throughout are stringers and films of calcite, often carrying particles of pyrite. The mineral deposits are well-defined quartz-filled fissures, striking approximately parallel with the northwest trend of the country rock. They extend for a few hundred feet in a horizontal direction and have been mined to a depth of several hundred feet below their surface outcrops. Two such ledges, which have been largely developed, are known as the Sumdum Chief and the Bald Eagle. The former ledge varies from a <b>surface</b> <b>width</b> of 3 ft to a narrow vein filling at a depth of 1200 ft. The Bald Eagle ledge, on the other hand, increases from a <b>surface</b> <b>width</b> of 2 ft to 20 ft at a depth of 500 ft. In the latter ledge, the vein changes from a free-milling ore near the surface to a low-grade ore at 500 ft in depth. Within the quartz bodies, the gold is not uniformly distributed, but is segregated here and there, forming rich pockets, which seem to represent enrichments where the main ledges are intersected by smaller quartz veins. The ore is essentially free gold and gold-bearing pyrite, with small amounts of galena and sphalerite. Quartz and calcite are the gangue minerals, and films of graphite occur between the fillings and the black-slate country.|$|E

50|$|The West India Docks Act of 1799 {{allowed the}} City of London Corporation to {{construct}} a canal from Limehouse Reach to Blackwall Reach, across the Isle of Dogs. It was intended to provide a short cut for sailing ships, to save them travelling around {{the south of the}} Isle of Dogs to access the wharves in {{the upper reaches of the}} river. If winds were unfavourable, this journey could take some time. The idea had been suggested by Ralph Walker in 1796. The West India merchants employed him as an engineer, and with assistance from William Jessop, John Foulds and George Dance, who was the City of London's surveyor, he produced the detailed plans which enabled the Act of Parliament to be obtained. Jessop was appointed as engineer with Walker as resident engineer, in August 1799, but Walker departed in 1802 after a disagreement with Jessop following a structural failure of part of the works. The canal was 3710 ft long with a <b>surface</b> <b>width</b> of 173 ft and a depth of 45 ft. The two locks were 193 by 45 ft, with the floors built as inverted arches. The lock walls were 6 ft thick, built of bricks with a stone facing. The depth over the lock cills varied between 20 and 24 ft at high tide, allowing ships of up to 500 tons burden to use the canal. Banks 12 ft high had to be built, because the high tide level was above that of the surrounding land, and the tops were 6 ft above water level. The surrounding land also had to be raised to the same height.|$|E
