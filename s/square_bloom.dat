40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in the mold {{is the heart}} of the continuous casting process and its quantitative analysis was pioneered by Keith Brimacombe. With many different processes currently competing, it is appropriate to apply modeling to investigate the theoretical limits of continuous casting speed and productivity. The heat transfer rate during solidification processes drops with time so the shell thickness at mold exit drops with increasing casting speed. A computational heat flow model similar to those of Brimacombe is applied to investigate the consequences of very high casting speed on shell thickness at mold exit. Next, a finite-element stress model is applied to predict the minimum shell thickness at mold exit that should have sufficient strength to avoid rupture due to longitudinal tearing of the weak shell under the forces of ferrostatic pressure. The critical shell thickness is predicted to be on the order of 3 mm for most grades and casting conditions. The models are then applied to predict maximum casting speeds for different steel grades, section sizes, and mold lengths. The theoretical limits to casting speed are predicted to be extremely high, exceeding 21 m/min for a conventional 800 -mm long, 200 -mm <b>square</b> <b>bloom</b> mold, which corresponds to 3. 5 million tonnes per year. The infeasibility of these high limits in practice is due to other problems, such as achieving shell thickness uniformity and liquid flux lubrication. This work suggests that if shortening mold length can solve lubrication, taper, and other problems, then it should be explored as a potential means to increase productivity...|$|E

40|$|Proper {{timing of}} {{fertilizer}} N applications {{in relation to}} crop uptake can serve to improve fertilizer efficiency in irrigated cotton. Earlier research has identified an optimum application window extending from the formation of first pinhead <b>squares</b> to peak <b>bloom,</b> which corresponds well with maximum crop uptake and utilization. Field experiments were conducted at the University of Arizona Marana Agricultural Center (Grabe clay loam soil) utilizing sidedress applications of ammonium sulfate with 5 -atom % 15 -N at pinhead <b>square,</b> early <b>bloom,</b> and peak bloom {{at a rate of}} 56 kg N/ha. The objective was to compare relative efficiencies in terms of fertilizer N uptake and recovery among these three times of application. Results indicate that all treatments averaged approximately 80 % total fertilizer N recovery. Of the fertilizer N that was recovered, approximately 40 % was taken up by the plants and 60 % recovered in the soil, primarily in the top 60 cm of the soil profile...|$|R

40|$|The cotton {{cultivar}} ´Tamcot CAMD-E´, Gossypium hirsutum L., {{was planted}} {{in three different}} planting dates. Five wood-framed screen cages were used to cover 30 cotton plants during match-head <b>squares</b> and <b>blooming</b> phase for each planting date. Five female and five male bollworm moths, Heliothis zea, were released in each cage. The majority of eggs were laid on {{the upper part of}} the plant. The greatest proportions of eggs were observed during the second infestation period, which coincided with the blooming phase. Leaves were the most common place for eggs deposition. Terminal alone is probably not a good place to scount for larvae. The greatest proportion of larvae were found on {{the upper part of the}} plant during the second infestation period, which coincided with a larger canopy and more fruiting structures available. High correlations were obtainded among eggs on leaves and total number of eggs on the whole plant.

50|$|Pennette's {{career began}} on the sitcom Kate & Allie from where {{he moved on to}} other {{projects}} including Dave's World and Dear John. He went on to create and write for many of his own series: Caroline in the City, Union <b>Square,</b> Conrad <b>Bloom</b> and All About the Andersons. Most notably, though, were the short-lived medical drama Inconceivable co-created with Oliver Goldstick, inspired by both of their surrogate pregnancy experiences, and the short-lived midseason sitcom Crumbs, an autobiographical portrayal of his family experiences and closeted young adulthood. His other writing and producing work from 2003 onwards includes serving as executive producer and co-executive producer on the television series I'm with Her and the sitcom What I Like About You, for both of which he also wrote a number of episodes. He also wrote the script for and an the executive producer of the 2007 Football Wives pilot, which was originally intended to be a television series but was later declined by the American Broadcasting Company in favour of seven other pilots with lower budgets, as the ABC claimed that the pitched budget for Football Wives was too high for a midseason pick-up. The series was set to be a U.S. version of the popular British soap opera Footballers' Wives.|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{fertilization}} {{of cotton}} in arid and semiarid areas is usually guided by soil nitrate tests and the yield goal. Canopy spectral reflectance between first <b>square</b> and mid <b>bloom</b> {{can be a}} powerful tool to assess leaf nitrogen (N) status and biomass in cotton. We present several site-years of date from center-pivot and subsurface drip irrigated cotton relating normalized difference vegetative index to leaf N, biomass, and lint yields. Correlations between spectral reflectance indices, e. g normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) an leaf N and biomass are better from small plots, compared to landscape scale studies, and correlations improve from early to late season. Our research has also tested using reflectance-based N management for SDI cotton. Reflectance based N management has resulted in savings of N fertilizer, compared to soil nitrate test based management, without reducing lint yields...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Spore {{dispersal}} gradients and pod disease gradients {{from point}} inoculum sources of Botrytis cinerea were measured {{over time in}} two snap bean field experiments. Laboratory grown inoculum was placed at ground level in a 30 x 30 cm <b>square</b> at <b>bloom</b> initiation and removed at full bloom. Dispersal of inoculum, assessed by quantifying spores washed from bean foliage, was limited to within 3 m from the inoculum source during bloom. At harvest, the spore populations on plants were 20 to 30 times higher than populations at full bloom due to secondary production of inoculum. At two sampling times during bloom, incidence of B. cinerea on senescing blossoms averaged 70 percent {{at a distance of}} 0. 9 m from the inoculum source but less than 25 percent at distances greater than 4 m. In one experiment, the incidence of pod rot at harvest averaged 7. 2 percent at 0. 9 m from the inoculum source but only 1. 3 percent at a distance of 4. 5 m. Spore dispersal gradients analyzed by regression of the form log Y = a + b log X showed significant flattening at harvest compared to full bloom, whereas gradients for pod rot incidence at harvest did not flatten when compared to incidence of B. cinerea on blossoms at full bloom. Blossom infections early in the bloom period from point inoculum sources were important in pod rot development. To determine if within-field inoculum sources are important in pod rot development in commercial snap bean production, an observational study was conducted in five bean fields in Oregon's Willamette Valley. Senescing cotyledons were the initial plant tissue colonized by Botrytis cinerea. Young stem tissues and leaf tissues also became diseased and served as within-field inoculum sources. The number of these inoculum sources before bloom varied between fields and ranged from 14. 8 to 0. 2 per 5 m row. The number of spores per plant at bloom initiation and the incidence of B. cinerea on blossoms at full bloom was positively correlated with the number of prebloom inoculum sources within a field. Using the number of inoculum sources prior to bloom as a predictive variable, 50 percent of the variation in the incidence of pod rot among fields could be explained. A multiple regression model, which included the number of inoculum sources before bloom, frequency of irrigation, duration of leaf wetness due to irrigation and rain, and canopy size explained 82 percent of the variation in percent pod rot among fields...|$|R

Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for cotton production; consequently {{there is a tendency to}} over-apply nitrogen. High N causes excessive vegetative growth and delayed crop maturity, which result in increased cost in pesticides, growth regulator, and defoliant. Currently, the most common methods for obtaining information about the nitrogen needs of cotton are labor-intensive and time-consuming limiting their use. Reflectance sensors offer the potential to diagnose N needs immediately in a spatially intensive manner. The objective of this study was to develop on-the-go sidedress N rate recommendations based on sensor readings and quantify variability during the day for both passive and active sensors mounted above cotton plants. Reflectance was measured with three sensors (Crop Circle, GreenSeeker, and Cropscan) at three growth stages (early square, mid <b>square</b> and early <b>bloom)</b> and at three heights above the cotton canopy (25, 50, and 100 cm) in 2006 and 2007. Results indicated that all three sensors have potential for accurate prediction of optimal N rate. Prediction accuracy was low at the first square stage but acceptable at mid square or early flower. These results suggest that variable-rate N applications to cotton based on real-time reflectance sensor readings are feasible for the mid-square to first flower growth stages. Variability in reflectance values during the day was relatively large for all three sensors. Mid-day was the time with the least error introduced into N rates by drift in sensor readings...|$|R
40|$|The within-plant {{distribution}} of the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., was determined during June through the 1 st week in August in 1992 and 1993 at Stoneville, MS. Locations of adults and nymphs in cotton were determined weekly using visual searches of whole plants or plant sections (mainstem terminals, upper and lower plant halves below the mainstem terminals). The distributions of adults and nymphs found in the morning (0900 - 1100 hours) in 1992 {{were not significantly different}} from their distributions found in the afternoon (1300 - 1500 hours). Adults had a significantly different distribution than nymphs on vegetative structures (mainly leaves), fruiting structures (<b>squares,</b> bolls, and <b>blooms)</b> and mainstem terminals in both years. The distributions of adults and nymphs also were significantly different in both years on the mainstem terminals and upper and lower plant halves below the terminal. Nymphs and adults were found in both years to have 75 % of their populations (on average) in the mainstem terminal plus the fruit and vegetative structures on the top 6 nodes of the plant. Nymphs showed a strong preference for fruiting structures, and high percentages of adults were found on vegetative structures through the first 3 wk of squaring (June through the 1 st week in July) in both years. Adults then became more dispersed among the vegetative structures, fruit, and mainstem terminals. These types of distributions would make the drop cloth an excellent method for sampling nymphs, whereas the sweep net would work well for adults especially through the first 3 wk of squaring. If visual examination of plants for nymphs and adults is used to sample cotton, it should include mainstem terminals plus vegetative and fruiting structures in the upper halves of plants...|$|R
40|$|Phenology {{relates to}} the study of timing of {{periodic}} events in the life cycle of plants or animals as influenced by environmental conditions and climatic forcing. Phenological metrics provide information essential to quantify variations in the life cycle of these organisms. The metrics also allow us to estimate the speed at which living organisms respond to environmental changes. At the surface of the oceans, microscopic plant cells, so-called phytoplankton, grow and sometimes form blooms, with concentrations reaching up to 100 million cells per litre and extending over many <b>square</b> kilometres. These <b>blooms</b> can have a huge collective impact on ocean colour, because they contain chlorophyll and other auxiliary pigments, making them visible from space. Phytoplankton populations have a high turnover rate and can respond within hours to days to environmental perturbations. This makes them ideal indicators to study the first-level biological response to environmental changes. In the Earth’s climate system, the El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dominates large-scale inter-annual variations in environmental conditions. It serves as a natural experiment to study and understand how phytoplankton in the ocean (and hence the organisms at higher trophic levels) respond to climate variability. Here, the ENSO influence on phytoplankton is estimated through variations in chlorophyll concentration, primary production and timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration of the growing period. The phenological variabilities are used to characterise phytoplankton responses to changes in some physical variables: sea surface temperature, sea surface height and wind. It is reported that in oceanic regions experiencing high annual variations in the solar cycle, such as in high latitudes, the influence of ENSO may be readily measured using annual mean anomalies of physical variables. In contrast, in oceanic regions where ENSO modulates a climate system characterised by a seasonal reversal of the wind forcing, such as the monsoon system in the Indian Ocean, phenology- based mean anomalies of physical variables help refine evaluation of the mechanisms driving the biological responses and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the integrated processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{compatible}} solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) {{is made in}} prodigious amounts by many single-celled marine phytoplankton. Emiliania huxleyi is {{the most}} prominent coccolithophore, distributed across the world's oceans and forming regular blooms that can cover over hundred thousand <b>square</b> kilometers. The <b>blooms</b> act as {{an important source of}} dimethyl sulfide (DMS). The enzymatic cleavage of DMSP to DMS and either acrylate or a proton 3 -hydroxypropionate (3 -HP) appears via the action of the enzymes known generically as DMSP lyases. The emitted DMS can be transformed by DMS-consuming bacteria or released into the atmosphere and can be oxidized further to sulfate aerosols that form cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which may influence global climate by increasing albedo. The metabolism of DMSP was investigated and compared in two E. huxleyi strains (NCMA 1516 and 373) previously reported to exhibit low and high DMSP lyase activity, respectively. The EhDddD gene, encoding a putative DMSP lyase, was sequenced in both strains, and an expression analysis of EhDddD was performed. Furthermore, DMSP lyase activity was studied by determining extracellular DMS and DMSP concentrations and in vitro measurements of DMSP lyase activity (DLA). The amino acid sequence of EhDddD in 1516 contains an insertion of one amino acid at the N-terminus compared with 373, which may be aspartate or serine. The amino acid (aa) sequence contains eleven amino acid substitutions between 1516 and 373, of which six are non-conserved. EhDddD encodes an additional C-terminal protein domain of 200 amino acids in length that is missing in bacteria. The additional domain may be involved in the function of the protein or in the regulation of the protein. Expression of the EhDddD gene was 8. 414 times higher in 373 than 1516, whereas in vitro DMSP lyase activity was observed to be 60. 6 times higher in 373 than 1516. In determination of extracellular DMS and DMSP concentrations, extracts of both strains produced DMS from DMSP, but the DMS production was 0. 8 times lower in 373 than 1516. The DMSP concentration in 373 was observed to be 1. 2 time higher than 1516. These results did not correlate with in vitro DMSP lyase activity. These results suggest that the observed differences in DMSP lyase activity between E. huxleyi strains are due to structural differences and adaptation to different environmental conditions. </p...|$|R
