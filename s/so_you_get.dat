500|$|The {{series was}} pitched to ABC Entertainment, {{who gave the}} green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season {{replacement}} for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, {{executive vice president of}} development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that [...] "edical shows are hard, and it was hard {{trying to figure out where}} ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [...] found a way to slow it down, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks, {{with additional}} recording and mixing at Radiohead's studio in Oxfordshire, England in late 2002 and early 2003. In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really good fun to make a record... but we finished it and nobody could let go of it. 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E

500|$|Harries {{commented that}} he [...] "was {{interested}} {{in developing a}} quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't." [...] Richard Armitage called the series an [...] "ambitious project for television. But the advantage {{of that is that}} these three feature films are linked together <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area." [...] Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, Chris Ryan, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; [...] "When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class myself as a storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E

500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, just <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a different sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E
2500|$|Gameplay {{involves}} the player {{being able to}} interact with the environment, and the realistic water dynamics. Rob Hewson stated that [...] "player versus environment is certainly {{a large part of the}} experience, the wonderful thing about water is that it is constantly affecting every area of the environment, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> incredible amounts of emergent behaviour. The player constantly has to adapt to the environment and react quickly because doors, walls and windows are going to cave in differently each time according to the distribution of water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs Robinson is four-part {{series that}} focuses on the {{relationship}} and subsequent engagement between Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane). The pair meet in an airport bar after they both leave Erinsborough for a while, anthen deciding to go to an island in Queensland together. The actors spent two days filming on Heron Island. Dennis admitted that he was excited to film on the island, as he had always wanted to go. He also revealed that the shoot avoided the show's [...] "location filming curse", which causes the weather to turn bad when they film away from their studio in Nunawading. Dennis added [...] "That's what I love about the web series, even though I'm still playing Paul Robinson and even though it's kind of Neighbours, it's also completely different <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a chance to play, dipping our toes in something else." ...|$|E

6000|$|The 'bus that plies between New Romney and Folkestone {{is painted}} a British red and inscribed {{on either side}} with the word [...] "Tip-top" [...] in gold amidst voluptuous scrolls. It is a slow and portly 'bus. Below it swings a sort of hold, hung by chains between the wheels, and in the summer time the top has garden seats. The front over the two dauntless unhurrying horses rises in tiers like a theatre; there is first a seat for the driver and his company, and above that a seat and above that, unless my memory plays me false, a seat. There are days when this 'bus goes and days when it doesn't go--you have to find out. And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to New Romney.|$|E
6000|$|She {{knew that}} he was {{shielding}} and trying to spare her, and she felt inexpressibly degraded by the terms of his forbearance. She could not accept, and she had not the strength to refuse it; and Putney said: [...] "I've not seen anything to make me doubt his sanity; but I must say the present racket shakes my faith in his common-sense, and I rather held by that, you know. But I suppose no man, except the kind of a man that a woman would be if she were a man--excuse me, Annie--is ever absolutely right. I suppose the truth is a constitutional thing, and you can't separate it from the personal consciousness, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it coloured and heated by personality when you get it fresh. That is, we can see what the absolute truth was, but never what it is." ...|$|E

60|$|You motor up {{from the}} station, and after you have gone about three miles, you turn in at a big iron gate with stone posts on each side with stone beasts on them. Close by the gate is the cutest little house with an old man inside it who pops out and touches his hat. This is only the lodge, really, but {{you think you have}} arrived; <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all ready to jump out, and then the car goes rolling on for another fifty miles or so through beech woods full of rabbits and open meadows with deer in them. Finally, just as you think you are going on for ever, you whizz round a corner, and there's the house. You don't get a glimpse of it till then, because the trees are too thick.|$|E
60|$|This is how {{introversion}} begins. The lower sexual {{centers are}} aroused. They find no sympathy, no connection, {{no response from}} outside, no expression. They are dynamically polarized by the upper centers within the individual. That is, {{the whole of the}} sexual or deeper sensual flow goes on upwards in the individual, to his own upper, from his own lower centers. The upper centers hold the lower in positive polarity. The flow goes on upwards. There must be some reaction. And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>get,</b> first and foremost, self-consciousness, an intense consciousness in the upper self of the lower self. This is the first disaster. Then you get the upper body exploiting the lower body. You get the hands exploiting the sensual body, in feeling, fingering, and in masturbation. You get a pornographic longing with regard to the self. You get the obscene post cards which most youths possess. You get the absolute lust for dirty stories, which so many men have. And you get various mild sex perversions, such as masturbation, and so on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] {{the artist}} said, {{stopping}} {{in his work}} now, and speaking very earnestly, [...] "there is not a lad of your age in the land, brought up as a miner, or a mechanic, or an artisan, who may not, if he sets it before him, and gives his whole mind to it, end by being a rich man and a gentleman. If a lad from the first makes up his mind to three things--to work, to save, and to learn--he can rise in the world. You won't {{be able to save}} out of what you get at first, but you can learn when your work is done. You can read and study of an evening. Then when you get better wages, save something; when, at twenty-one or <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> man's wages, live on less than half, and lay by the rest.
