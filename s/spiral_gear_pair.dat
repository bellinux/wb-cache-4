In a {{turbofan}} engine, {{the high}} pressure rotor and the radial driveshaft, which transmit the {{power from the}} internal gear-box to the external gear-box, are <b>geared</b> by a <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> <b>pair.</b> In this paper, a reasonably simplified dynamic model of the coupled rotors system is established, and then, the coupled stiffness matrix and coupled damping matrix of the <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> are deduced. A shaft element method is proposed to investigate the lateral-torsional coupled vibration equations of the gear-rotor system. Furthermore, the mode shapes and unbalance responses of this two rotors coupled system are simulated. The {{results indicate that the}} system derives many new modes and the exciting forces on a rotor of the system would be passed to the other rotor for the gears meshing. When the rotor dynamics of a turbofan engine is being analyzed, the high pressure rotor and the radial drive shaft must be viewed as a whole. The dynamic balance precision of the rotors should be qualified properly, in order to improve the dynamic quality of the turbofan engine...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{undertaken to}} improve computational modelling capability for the internal gearbox (IGB) of an aeroengine. Using the commercial {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) software ANSYS FLUENT modelling methodologies for regions within the IGB have been developed, applied and refined. The IGB is a bearing chamber that houses the bearings that support the low pressure, intermediate pressure and high pressure shafts and in addition the <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> that enable power to be taken from the high pressure shaft to power aircraft auxiliary systems. Within civil aeroengines parasitic power loss is a significant issue and as oil is used to lubricate and cool throughout the engine, this power loss largely manifests as increased heat-to-oil (HTO). A significant contributor to HTO is the IGB. The IGB contains complex geometry and a highly rotating two-phase flow consisting of films, droplets, ligaments and mist. Central to the IGB is the <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> <b>pair.</b> Previous modelling {{research has shown that}} detailed modelling of flow behaviour is too computationally expensive for domains larger than a few teeth. Modelling the meshing gears with full flow fidelity is not yet feasible. In this thesis a significantly less computationally expensive approach is explored.

40|$|Abstract—Research {{in damage}} of <b>gear</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> using {{vibration}} signals {{is still very}} attractive, because vibration signals from a <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> are complex in nature and not easy to interpret. Predicting <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of <b>gears</b> <b>pairs</b> in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information usually covered under noise of other <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> dynamic factors. This paper {{presents the results of}} an evaluation of vibration analysis techniques as a method for the <b>gear</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> condition assessment. The origin of vibration in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> and useful definition of damage identification techniques are presented.

Its dynamic characteristics are addressed by many scholars. However, <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gears,</b> especially tooth fracture occurrence and monitoring, are not to be investigated, according to the limited published issues. Therefore, this paper establishes a three-dimensional model and finite element model of the Gleason <b>spiral</b> bevel <b>gear</b> <b>pair.</b> The model considers the effect of tooth root fracture on the system due to fatigue. Finite element method is used to compute the mesh generation, set the boundary condition, and carry out the dynamic load. The harmonic response spectra of the base under tooth fracture are calculated and the influence of main parameters on monitoring failure is investigated as well. The results show that the change of torque affects insignificantly the determination of whether or not the system has tooth fracture. The intermediate frequency interval (200 [*]Hz– 1000 [*]Hz) is the best interval to judge tooth fracture occurrence. The best fault test region is located in the working area where the system is going through meshing.

In order to improve the meshing performance, the resulting surface of the pinion is modified in the third step. Finally, the pinion is produced on a CNC machining center.
