5|$|The average cardiac output, {{using an}} average <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, {{with a normal}} range of 4.0–8.0 L/min. The <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is {{normally}} measured using an echocardiogram and can {{be influenced by the}} size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload and afterload.|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. <b>Stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, <b>stroke</b> <b>volume,</b> and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
30|$|After the NPB dive with exercise, left atrial {{volume was}} only {{moderately}} increased but LVEF and SV {{had not changed}} from pre-exercise. The RV/LV ratio was also strongly correlated with the cumulated work of breathing (Fig.  4). Recently, we suggested that a discrepancy between the current <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> in {{the two sides of}} the heart would cause acute pulmonary edema [9, 24]. At higher heart rates, a relatively small mismatch between right and left ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> will create extravascular lung water and pulmonary edema because the volume mismatch per minute is increased substantially.|$|R
40|$|An {{operator}} {{interactive video}} {{system for the}} measurement of roentgen angiographically outlined structures is described. Left ventricular volume and three-dimensional shapes are calculated from up to 200 pairs of diameters measured from ventriculograms {{at the rate of}} 60 pairs of biplane images per second. The accuracy and reproducibility of volumes calculated by the system were established by analysis of roentgenograms of inanimate objects of known volume and by comparison of left ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> calculated by the system with the <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> calculated by an indicator-dilution technique and an aortic root electromagnetic flowmeter.

In half the animals, hypothermia was induced during reperfusion via a dual-lumen balloon occlusion catheter placed in the carotid ipsilateral to the ischemic region. Following reperfusion, the animals were sacrificed. Brain MRI and histology were evaluated blinded to the intervention. In a series of animals, the mean temperature achieved was 26. 5 C.

5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (<b>stroke</b> <b>volume)</b> by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{output and}} {{peripheral}} resistance {{are the two}} determinants of arterial pressure. Cardiac output is determined by <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> and heart rate; <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is related to myocardial contractility and {{to the size of}} the vascular compartment. Peripheral resistance is determined by functional and anatomic changes in small arteries and arterioles.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward <b>stroke</b> <b>volume)</b> but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> and the regurgitant volume is known as the total <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> of the left ventricle.|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of ventricular volumes in the fetal heart from two-dimensional echocardi-ography (2 DE) may give a better estimate of fetal ventricular size than simple diameter measurements, but {{the accuracy of}} this method has not been established. In fetal lambs, we tested whether ventricular volume calculations from 2 DE using a biplane Simpson's rule algorithm are accurate. Calculations of left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes from 2 DE were compared with cast volumes of these ventricles. Also, {{at different levels of}} left atrial pressure, left ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> calculated from 2 DE were compared with <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> measured simultaneously by an electromagnetic flowmeter. There was a good correlation between volumes determined from 2 DE (y axis) and from casts (x axis) for both the left (r= 0. 92; y= 0. 2 + 1. 1 x; SEE= 0. 19 ml) and right ventricle (r= 0. 90; y= 0. 7 + 0. 9 x; SEE= 0. 21 ml). Left ventricular <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> calculated from 2 DE correlated well with those measured by the electromagnetic flowmeter (r= 0. 87; y= 0. 2 + 0. 9 x; SEE= 0. 27 ml). Thus, calculation of fetal ventricular volumes from 2 DE images using a biplane Simpson's rule method is feasible and accurate.

50|$|In a {{prospective}} randomized study involving 86 patients who underwent {{right and left}} cardiac catheterization, the abdominojugular test was shown to correlate best with the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} a novel real-time phase-contrast {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) technique {{for the assessment of}} through-plane flow in the ascending aorta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time MRI was based on a radial fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with about 30 -fold undersampling and image reconstruction by regularized nonlinear inversion. Phase-contrast maps were obtained from two (interleaved or sequential) acquisitions with and without a bipolar velocity-encoding gradient. Blood flow in the ascending aorta was studied in 10 healthy volunteers at 3 T by both real-time MRI (15 sec during free breathing) and electrocardiogram (ECG) -synchronized cine MRI (with and without breath holding). Flow velocities and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> were evaluated using standard postprocessing software. RESULTS: The total acquisition time for a pair of phase-contrast images was 40. 0 msec (TR/TE= 2. 86 / 1. 93 msec, 10 ° flip angle, 7 spokes per image) for a nominal in-plane resolution of 1. 3 mm and a section thickness of 6 mm. Quantitative evaluations of spatially averaged flow velocities and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> were comparable for real-time and cine methods when real-time MRI data were averaged across heartbeats. For individual heartbeats real-time phase-contrast MRI resulted in higher peak velocities for values above 120 cm s(- 1). CONCLUSION: Real-time phase-contrast MRI of blood flow in the human aorta yields functional parameters for individual heartbeats. When averaged across heartbeats real-time flow velocities and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> are comparable to values obtained by conventional cine MRI...|$|R
25|$|In {{the acute}} setting, the <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> {{of the left}} {{ventricle}} is increased (increased ejection fraction); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV {{and a decrease in}} ejection fraction. The increase in <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is explained by the Frank–Starling mechanism, in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.|$|E
25|$|Increase {{cardiac output}} by {{increasing}} heart rate (positive chronotropic effect), conduction velocity (positive dromotropic effect), and <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> (by enhancing contractility—positive inotropic effect).|$|E
25|$|Other factors {{correlated}} with development of pacemaker syndrome include decreased <b>stroke</b> <b>volume,</b> decreased cardiac output, and decreased left atrial total emptying fraction associated with ventricular pacing.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{regional}} wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) on regional and global left ventricular (LV) elastances {{has not been}} defined. To induce RWMA, we infused esmolol (9 mg) into the left anterior descending coronary artery in eight anesthetized open-chest canine preparations. Global and regional <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> and end-systolic pressure-volume relationships (LV conductance catheter) and pressure-length relationships (sonomicrometer crystals) were measured in dysfunctional (apical) and normal (basilar) LV regions at baseline, during esmolol infusion, and after treatment with a systemic dobutamine infusion (4 μg · kg - 1 · min - 1) and combined dobutamine- esmolol. Esmolol induced apical dyskinesis, as evidenced by reduced effective apical <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> and <b>stroke</b> work, a parallel right-shift of the apical regional, global end-systolic pressure-volume relationships, and increased regional and global LV volumes (P < 0. 05). However, global and regional elastances remained unchanged. Dobutamine increased global and apical regional elastances, but did not increase regional volumes. During the infusion of combined esmolol-dobutamine, apical elastance and volumes increased compared with baseline (P < 0. 05), but apical regional stroke work decreased. Thus, esmolol-induced RWMA were associated with cardiac dilation but not with decreased regional or global elastances. Implications: Regional and global elastances and maximal <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> may not identify esmolol- induced left ventricular regional dysfunction in dogs. The primary effect of asynchrony of regional contraction is global cardiac dilation. Systemic dobutamine infusion increases regional and global left ventricular elastances but does not reverse regional wall motion abnormality-induced cardiac dilation...|$|R
30|$|The {{cycle-to-cycle}} {{evolution of}} the heart rate (12) and the {{evolution of the}} end-diastolic volumes (15) depend on the right and left <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes.</b> In DE PATER and VAN DEN BERG like-models [11], the cavities are described using voltage generators producing a pressure corresponds to the contraction of the ventricles.

The right-ventricular ejection fraction was also only slightly depressed, indicating preservation of right-ventricular function. All patients were noted to maintain normal <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> and normal systolic indices...|$|R

25|$|The {{radial artery}} {{is the easiest}} to use to check the heart rate. However, in {{emergency}} situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is lower and pulse wave is {{not strong enough to}} be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery.

25|$|In addition, at high altitude, {{the heart}} beats faster; the <b>stroke</b> <b>volume</b> is {{slightly}} decreased; and non-essential bodily functions are suppressed, {{resulting in a}} decline in food digestion efficiency (as the body suppresses the digestive system in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves).|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) reference ranges {{have not been}} well established in Chinese. Here we determined normal cardiac and aortic reference ranges in healthy Singaporean Chinese and investigated how these data might affect clinical interpretation of CMR scans. In 180 healthy Singaporean Chinese (20 to 69 years old; males, n[*]=[*] 91), comprehensive cardiac assessment was performed using the steady state free precision technique (3 T Ingenia, Philips) and images were analysed by two independent observers (CMR 42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging). Measurements were internally validated using standardized approaches: left ventricular mass (LVM) was measured in diastole and systole (with and without papillary muscles) and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> were compared in both ventricles. All reference ranges were stratified by sex and age; and indeterminate/borderline regions were defined statistically at {{the limits of the}} normal reference ranges. Results were compared with clinical measurements reported in the same individuals. LVM was equivalent in both phases (mean difference 3. 0 [*]±[*] 2. 5 g; P[*]=[*] 0. 22) and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> were not significantly different in the left and right ventricles (P[*]=[*] 0. 91). Compared to females, males had larger left and right ventricular volumes (P[*] [*] 0. 05 for all measures). In both sexes, age correlated negatively with left and right ventricular volumes; and positively with aortic sinus and sinotubular junction diameters (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001 for all). There was excellent agreement in indexed <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> in the left and right ventricles (0. 1 ± 5. 7 mL/m 2, 0. 7 ± 6. 2 mL/m 2, respectively), LVM (0. 6 ± 6. 4 g/m 2), atrial sizes and aortic root dimensions between values reported in clinical reports and our measured reference ranges. Comprehensive sex and age-corrected CMR reference ranges at 3 T have been established in Singaporean Chinese.

30|$|In {{response}} to a pathological challenge, clinically and physiologically model-based hemodynamic metrics typically change by 50 - 100 % {{and in some cases}} up to 400 %. Nearly all the errors associated with the model outputs are less than 25 % (Table 1), indicating that the subject-specific models are identified with sufficient accuracy to identify induced disease states. The larger errors in Table 1 result from differences between the measured left and right ventricle <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes,</b> which are expected to be same at steady state. In some cases, especially pigs 1 and 2, the ratio of the left to right ventricular outputs is greater than 2 : 1. This discrepancy is probably due to difficulties in measuring the right ventricle volume due to its complex shape, which causes the model to underestimate the end diastolic volumes and maximum pressure of the left ventricle and overestimate the end diastolic volume and maximum pressure of the right ventricle. However, the ratio of the measured <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> is generally consistent for each pig {{for the duration of the}} trial resulting in systematic errors in the model outputs, so importantly, changes in the model trends are preserved.|$|R

This work {{suggests}} a fast estimation method of the lateral ventricles volume from a 2 D image and then determines if this volume is {{correlated with the}} cerebrospinal fluid flow at the aqueductal and cerebral levels in neurodegenerative diseases. Materials and Methods. FForty-five elderly patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (19), normal pressure hydrocephalus (13), and vascular dementia (13) were involved and underwent anatomical and phase contrast MRI scans. Lateral ventricles and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> were assessed on anatomical and phase contrast scans, respectively. A common reference plane was {{used to calculate the}} lateral ventricles’ area on 2 D images. Results. The largest volumes were observed in hydrocephalus patients. The linear regression between volumes and areas was computed, and a strong positive correlation was detected (R 2 = 0. 9).

We assessed {{its impact}} on functional left ventricular (LV) parameters. METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients underwent a one-day (99 m) Tc-tetrofosmin pharmacologic stress/rest imaging protocol on a novel CZT camera. Electrocardiogram-gated high-dose (rest) MPI was performed without and with real-time respiratory triggering by intermittent scanning confined to breath-hold at deep inspiration. We studied the effect of respiratory triggering at deep inspiration levels on LV wall motion, wall thickening, LV volumes and ejection fraction (LVEF) compared to regular MPI without respiratory triggering. RESULTS: Compared to regular MPI without respiratory triggering, systolic and diastolic LV <b>volumes</b> and <b>stroke</b> <b>volumes</b> decreased significantly (P <  0. 05) when respiratory triggering was applied.
