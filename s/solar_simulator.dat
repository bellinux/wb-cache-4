40|$|Repeatable and {{accurate}} tests are important when designing hardware and algorithms for solar-powered {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). Since no two days are exactly alike with regard to energy harvesting, tests {{must be carried out}} indoors. <b>Solar</b> <b>simulators</b> are traditionally used in replicating the effects of sunlight indoors - however, <b>solar</b> <b>simulators</b> are expensive, have lighting elements that have short lifetimes, and are usually not designed to carry out the types of tests that hardware and algorithm designers require. As a result, hardware and algorithm designers use tests that are inaccurate and not repeatable (both for others and also for the designers themselves). In this article we propose an indoor test methodology which does not rely on <b>solar</b> <b>simulators.</b> The test methodology has its basis in astronomy and photovoltaic (PV) cell design. We present a generic design for a test apparatus which can be used in carrying out the test methodology. We also present a specific design which we use in implementing an actual test apparatus. We test the efficacy of our test apparatus and, to demonstrate the usefulness of the test methodology, perform experiments akin to those required in projects involving solar-powered WSNs. Results of the said tests and experiments demonstrate that the test methodology is an invaluable tool for hardware and algorithm designers working with solar-powered WSNs...|$|R
50|$|Artificial {{sunlight}} {{is the use}} of a {{light source}} to simulate sunlight where the unique characteristics of sunlight are needed, but where sufficient natural sunlight is not available or is not feasible. A light source used to simulate sunlight is a <b>solar</b> <b>simulator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The third type of <b>solar</b> <b>simulator</b> is the pulsed simulator, {{which uses}} a shutter to quickly block or unblock the light from a {{continuous}} source. This category is a compromise between the continuous and flash, having the disadvantage of the high power usage and relatively low intensities of the continuous simulators, but advantage of stable output intensity and spectrum. The short illumination duration also provides {{the benefit of the}} low thermal loads of flashed simulators. Pulses are typically on the order of 100 milliseconds up to 800 milliseconds for special Xe Long Pulse Systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of the}} {{amphiphilic}} Z-907 dye {{in conjunction}} with the polymer gel electrolyte in DSC achieved an energy conversion efficiency of 6.1%. More importantly, the device was stable under thermal stress and soaking with light. The high conversion efficiency of the cell was sustained after heating for 1,000 h at 80 °C, maintaining 94% of its initial value. Afteraccelerated testing in a <b>solar</b> <b>simulator</b> for 1,000 h of light-soaking at 55 °C (100 mW cm−2) the efficiency had decreased by less than 5% for cells covered with an ultraviolet absorbing polymer film.

However, the Xe spectrum is also characterized by many undesirable sharp atomic transitional peaks, making the spectrum less desirable for some spectrally sensitive applications.|$|R

50|$|The {{second type}} of <b>solar</b> <b>{{simulator}}</b> is the flashed simulator which is qualitatively similar to flash photography and use flash tubes. With typical durations of several milliseconds, very high intensities of up to several thousand suns are possible. This type of equipment {{is often used to}} prevent unnecessary heat build-up in the device under test. However, due to the rapid heating and cooling of the lamp, the intensity and light spectrum are inherently transient, making repeated reliable testing more technically challenging. The temporal stability dimension of the standard does not directly apply to this category of solar simulators, although it can be replaced by an analogous shot-to-shot repeatability specification.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{renewable}} energy industry (solar and heat pumps, in particular) {{the conflict between}} daily thermal Legionella control and high temperatures, which may drop system performance, is subject to heated debate.

However some <b>solar</b> <b>simulator</b> analysis work using Polysun 5 suggests that an 11% energy penalty is a more likely figure.

5000|$|Solar {{simulators}} can {{be divided}} into three broad categories: continuous, flashed, and pulsed. The first type is a familiar form of light source in which illumination is continuous in time. The specifications discussed in the previous section most directly relate to this type of <b>solar</b> <b>simulator.</b> This category is most often used for low intensity testing, from less than 1 sun up to several suns. In this context, 1 sun is typically defined as the nominal full sunlight intensity on a bright clear day on Earth, which measures 1000 W/m2. Continuous light solar simulators may have several different lamp types combined (e.g. an arc source and one or more halogen lamps) to extend the spectrum far into the infrared.|$|E
