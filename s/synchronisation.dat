5|$|The {{west side}} {{will have a}} large,tree-lined, {{pedestrian}} mall with a reflecting pool and new illumination. The reflecting pools will also work as a performance fountain, providing splash and spectacle at programmed moments during stadium events. Around the complex, granite flooring will have stripes evocative of the club's second uniform, in <b>synchronisation</b> with the external illumination. There will be benches and large gardens; the media centre will be housed in one of them. The landscaping was designed by John Loomis, who headed the Burj Khalifa project. Lighting was projected by the American firm T. Kondos.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in track}} laying and depot {{construction}} affected vehicle testing. By September 2009, construction {{was reported to}} be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due to deliver the first trams from its factory in Spain. With key project dependency out of <b>synchronisation,</b> TIE held discussions with Transport for London about delivering the trams to Croydon to conduct operational tests on the Tramlink network. Tram vehicle testing commenced in March 2010 on the Siemens test track in Wildenrath, Germany. The tests included recreating the steep gradients of Leith Walk, and using weights to simulate the heavy passenger load expected during a Murrayfield match day.|$|E

The workshop was held in Bologna, Italy on 31 th of August 2009, as a satellite workshop of CONCUR' 09. The previous edition of ICE has been organized in Reykjavik (2008). The ICE workshop is intended as a series of international scientific meetings oriented to researchers in various fields of theoretical computer science and, each year, the workshop focuses on a specific topic: ICE 2009 focused on structured interactions meant as the class of <b>synchronisations</b> that go beyond the "simple" point-to-point <b>synchronisations</b> (e. g., multicast or broadcast <b>synchronisations,</b> even-notification based interactions, time dependent interactions, distributed transactions, [...] .) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{question of}} most activities in information science, in practice or science, is “Does a given system {{satisfy the requirements}} regarding its application?” Commonly, requirements are expressed and accessible by means of models, mostly in a diagrammatic representation by visual models. The requirements may change over time and are often defined from different perspectives and within different domains. This implies that models may be transformed either within the same domain-specific visual modelling language or into models in another language. Furthermore, model updates may be synchronised between different models. Most types of visual models can be represented by graphs where model transformations and <b>synchronisations</b> are performed by graph transformations. The theory of graph transformations emerged from its origins in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s as a generalisation of term and tree rewriting systems to an important field in (theoretical) computer science with applications particularly in visual modelling techniques, model transformations, <b>synchronisations</b> and behavioural specifications of models. Its formal foundations but likewise visual notation enable both precise definitions and proofs of important properties of model transformations and <b>synchronisations</b> from a theoretical {{point of view and}} an intuitive approach for specifying transformations and model updates from an engineer’s point of view. The recent results were presented in the EATCS monographs “Fundamentals of Algebraic Graph Transformation” (FAGT) in 2006 and its sequel “Graph and Model Transformation: General Framework and Applications” (GraMoT) in 2015. This thesis concentrates on one important property of model transformations and <b>synchronisations,</b> i. e., syntactical completeness. Syntactical completeness of model transformations means that given a specification for transforming models from a source modelling language into models in a target language, then all source models can be completely transformed into corresponding target models. In the same given context, syntactical completeness of model <b>synchronisations</b> means that all source model updates can be completely synchronised, resulting in corresponding target model updates. This work is essentially based on the GraMoT book and mainly extends its results for model transformations and <b>synchronisations</b> based on triple graph grammars by a new more general notion of syntactical completeness, namely domain completeness, together with corresponding verification techniques. Furthermore, the results are instantiated to the verification of the syntactical completeness of software transformations and <b>synchronisations.</b> The well-known transformation of UML class diagrams into relational database models and the transformation of programs of a small object-oriented programming language into class diagrams serve as running examples. The existing AGG tool is used to support the verification of the given examples in practice...|$|R

5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release <b>synchronisation.</b> This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen {{continually}} evolved new composition techniques, always integrating {{them into}} his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition. For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any <b>synchronisation</b> with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding <b>synchronisation</b> is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{interest}} recently {{in the concept of}} using information from the motor cortex region of the brain, recorded using non-invasive scalp electrodes, to construct a crude interface with a computer. It is known that movements of the limbs, for example, are accompanied by desynchronisations and <b>synchronisations</b> within the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG). These EventRelated Desynchronisations and <b>Synchronisations</b> (ERD & ERS), however, appear to be present when volition to move a limb occurs, even when actual movement of the limb does not in fact take place. The determination and classification of the ERD/S offers many exciting possibilities for the control of peripheral devices via computer analysis.

The main challenge is to obtain pertinent global timing constraints from the timings in the components alone.

The method has been implemented in the RTD-Finder tool and successfully experimented on several benchmarks...|$|R

25|$|Local {{differences}} in topography (such as {{the presence of}} mountains), geology (such as the density of rocks in the vicinity), and deeper tectonic structure cause local and regional {{differences in}} the Earth's gravitational field, known as gravitational anomalies.

25|$|Perhaps {{the first}} major change was the advent of music {{sequencer}} technology. Prior to its introduction all <b>synchronisation</b> was achieved by adding SMPTE time code to analogue tape. This acted as a reference point so that individual tracks could be easily synchronised.

Continuing development in this area has led to computer-controlled sequencing.|$|E

This forms the basis of the Fast First Sink (FFS) algorithm which places, provably, the minimal number of barriers in polynomial time for codes with a regular structure. This algorithm is implemented in a prototype compiler and applied to three well known benchmarks. Preliminary results show that it outperforms an existing state-of the-art commercial compiler...|$|R

We propose extensions to specification logics that provide handles for programming both monitor <b>synchronisations</b> (with individual actors), as well as the administration of the resp. adaptations once the triggering behaviour is observed. Since this added functionality allows the specifier to introduce erro-neous adaptation procedures, we also develop static analysis techniques based on substructural type systems to assist the construction of correct adaptation scripts. ...|$|R

While there were some tactical advantages in this approach, the effect of German air superiority was limited by the rarity of German fighters appearing behind the Allied lines.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study a {{class of}} {{concurrent}} pushdown automata communicating by both global <b>synchronisations</b> and reversal-bounded counters, providing a natural model for multithreaded programs with procedure calls and numericdata types. Weshow that the synchronisation-bounded reachability problem can be efficiently reduced {{to the satisfaction of}} an existential Presburger formula. Hence, the problem is NP-complete and can be tackled with efficient SMT solvers such as Z 3. In addition, we present techniques addressing the important problem of minimisation of pushdown automata. We provide a prototypical implementation of our results and perform preliminary experiments on examples derived from real-world problems. ...|$|R

Our measure of quantity is based on the general notion of semirings. Furthermore, we develop a syntax-directed static analysis for the new language, which captures the properties of name substitution and semiring value retrieval. Such properties allow us to solve quantitative constraints controlling <b>synchronisations</b> in the analysed systems. We provide an example of a cost analysis of communications in a simple adaptive routing algorithm...|$|R

In this paper we assume that such platforms exist and we focus on the timing analysis of parallel real-time applications. One of the main challenges is to determine how much the delays induced by software constructs such as <b>synchronisations</b> can impact the worst-case execution times (WCETs) of parallel threads. In this paper, we refine state-of-the-art analysis: first, we derive more accurate estimations of stalls at critical sections; second, we introduce new locking primitives that minimise stall times on the worst-case path. Experimental results show noticeable improvements on the WCETs of benchmarks...|$|R
