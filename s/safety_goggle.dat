5000|$|Pyrene Panorama Limited was {{established}} in 1959 when Pyrene purchased the business of Panorama Equipment Limited, which itself dated from 1941. This company was formed originally to manufacture an industrial wide-field vision <b>safety</b> <b>goggle</b> which {{gave rise to the}} name-"Panorama". Also in 1959 Pyrene acquired Roberts McClean who in 1931 introduced self-contained compressed air breathing apparatus to the UK and these two companies merged under the Pyrene Panorama flag. In 1976 Fireward Limited, manufacturers since 1964 of plastic-bodied portable dry-powder fire extinguishers also merged with Pyrene Panorama, to form the new Company, Chubb Panorama. A further addition to the Panorama Group came in 1976 when with the change from Pyrene Panorama to Chubb Panorama, Submarine and Safety Engineering Limited joined the team. Specialists in self-contained under-water breathing apparatus and diving equipment, their [...] "Dominair" [...] range added considerably to the company's comprehensive coverage of safety equipment.|$|E

50|$|UVGI {{is often}} used to {{disinfect}} equipment such as <b>safety</b> <b>goggles,</b> instruments, pipettors, and other devices. Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way. Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside biological safety cabinets ("hoods") between uses.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>goggles</b> {{and gloves}} should be worn while {{handling}} lime sulfur. Lime sulfur solutions are strongly alkaline (typical commercial concentrates have a pH over 11.5), {{and so it}} is corrosive to living things and can cause blindness if splashed in the eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{indicated}} {{powers are}} for visible-light, continuous-wave lasers. For pulsed lasers and invisible wavelengths, other power limits apply. People working with class 3B and class 4 lasers can protect their eyes with <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> which {{are designed to}} absorb light of a particular wavelength.|$|R
2500|$|Laser <b>safety</b> <b>goggles.</b> Laboratory-type laser <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> are {{not well}} suited for pilot operation. [...] "The 20% {{transmission}} ratio of laboratory laser eyewear would probably have disastrous effects on a cockpit crew who must read instruments while flying at night.... The optical quality of such systems also becomes a factor because slight amounts of distortion or haze which may be of no concern in the laboratory may be a major concern to pilots flying at low altitudes and high speed." [...] Also, {{there may be a}} variety of laser wavelengths/colors that may need to be defended against. If all wavelengths are protected, the goggles essentially are opaque. There are also issues with the discomfort of wearing goggles routinely, given that laser incidents are relatively rare.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the laser}} {{operates}} at 780 nm, is continuous wave {{with a power}} of 50 mW/cm2 (P = 500 W/m²). This means you need a D protection level of , which is rounded up to 2. In other words, the <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> {{should be at least}} D 780 L2.|$|R
50|$|Exposure of {{p-xylene}} to eyes {{can cause}} redness and pain.

50|$|The Dog {{explosion}} is most {{popularly known}} for an image taken of those viewing it {{than the actual}} explosion itself, the photograph depicts numerous VIPs wearing <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> sitting on Adirondack chairs while being illuminated by the flash of the detonation. This photograph takes up the bottom portion of {{the cover of the}} 1995 documentary Trinity and beyond by Peter Kuran. The <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> worn by all those viewing the test in the picture have become somewhat of a museum collectors item, with a possibility that Norman F. Ramsey may have been present. Cynthia Miller claims that her father, Van Dine, is the first man on the left in the photo. The blast wave safely arrived at the location of the VIPs some 45 seconds after the initially silent flash of the detonation as observed from their position on Parry island.|$|R
50|$|Magnesium acetate is a {{relatively}} safe compound to handle and {{has been given a}} health hazard rating of zero. However, it should always be handled with gloves and <b>safety</b> <b>goggles.</b> If it gets in the eyes, the skin, ingested, or inhaled it will cause irritation in the respective areas: eyes, skin, gastrointestinal system, and lungs.|$|R
5000|$|Eye {{protection}} {{is a necessity}} when woodturning. There are several PPE available for eye protection such as <b>safety</b> <b>goggles,</b> glasses and visors, some of which feature built-in respirators. Although {{all of these are}} adequate, for the highest level of protection, a visor that protects the entire head from dust and debris should be worn.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Boston’s {{more than}} 500 {{automotive}} shops, located primar ily in low-income communities of color, {{are a source}} both of well-paying jobs and of potential hazardous exposures to employees and residents. The Safe Shops Project works to reduce occupational and environmental health hazards with out having to close these businesses. Combining inspections, in-shop trainings, outreach, and technical/financial assistance, it brings shops into compliance with laws and promotes use of safer practices and alternative products. After 18 months, 254 workers at 61 of 124 participating shops had received training. Surveys showed improved worker knowledge: Pre-training, 24. 2 percent of the worker survey respondents stated that they knew what an MSDS was, and post-training, 75 percent stated that they knew. The surveys also found improvement in work practices: Pre-training, 48 percent of workers indicated that they used <b>safety</b> <b>goggles</b> in their work, while post-training, 70 percent indicated proper use of <b>safety</b> <b>goggles.</b> The results also showed shops investing in capital improvements such as re placement of PCE-based brake cleaners with aqueous cleaners. The Safe Shops Project has a successfully modeled application of the 10 -essential-services framework to the building of public health capacity and community collaboration, and this model {{can be adapted to}} other locations and industries...|$|R
