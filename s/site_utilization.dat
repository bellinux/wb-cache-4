Because the behaviors of different viral isolates might reflect in part differences in splicing, we investigated the patterns of splice <b>site</b> <b>utilization</b> by simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) originally isolated from sooty mangabey monkeys (Cercocebus atys). We used reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), molecular cloning, and DNA sequencing approaches to characterize SIVdeltaB 670, a pathogenic and neurovirulent isolate, and SIVsmmH 4, a related molecular clone. The majority of randomly selected SIVdeltaB 670 and SIVsmmH 4 partial cDNAs containedtat, rev, nef,and long terminal repeat (LTR) intron splice donor and acceptor sites positioned as expected based on the proviral sequence of SIVsmmH 4.

40|$|Ankyrin defects are {{the most}} common cause of {{hereditary}} spherocytosis (HS). In some HS patients, mutations in the ankyrin promoter have been hypothesized to lead to decreased ankyrin mRNA synthesis. The ankyrin erythroid promoter is a member of the most common class of mammalian promoters which lack conserved TATA, initiator or other promoter cis elements and have high G+C content, functional Sp 1 binding sites and multiple transcription initiation sites. We identified a novel ankyrin gene promoter mutation, a TG deletion adjacent to a transcription initiation site, in a patient with ankyrin-linked HS and analyzed its effects on ankyrin expression. In vitro, the mutant promoter directed decreased levels of gene expression, altered transcription initiation <b>site</b> <b>utilization</b> and exhibited defective binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIID complex formation. In a transgenic mouse model, the mutant ankyrin promoter led to abnormalities in gene expression, including decreased expression of a reporter gene and altered transcription initiation <b>site</b> <b>utilization.</b> These data indicate that the mutation alters ankyrin gene transcription and contributes to the HS phenotype by decreasing ankyrin gene synthesis via disruption of TFIID complex interactions with the ankyrin core promoter. These studies support the model that in promoters that lack conserved cis elements, the TFIID complex directs preinitiation complex formation at specific sites in core promoter DNA and provide the first evidence that disruption of TBP binding and TFIID complex formation in this type of promoter leads to alterations in start <b>site</b> <b>utilization,</b> decreased gene expression and a disease phenotype in viv...|$|E

We carried out extensive mutagenesis of the gene and selected for new alleles that confer a phenotype {{similar to that of}} prp 8 - 101.

40|$|The {{relative}} increase in Aβ 42 peptides from familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) linked APP and PSEN mutations {{can be related}} to changes in both ε-cleavage <b>site</b> <b>utilization</b> and subsequent step-wise cleavage. Cleavage at the ε-site releases the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD), and perturbations in the position of ε-cleavage are closely associated with changes in the profile of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) species that are produced and secreted. The mechanisms by which γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) or FAD mutations affect the various γ-secretase cleavages to alter the generation of Aβ peptides have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggested that GSMs do not modulate ε-cleavage of APP, but the data were derived principally from recombinant truncated epitope tagged APP substrate. Here, using full length APP from transfected cells, we investigated whether GSMs modify the ε-cleavage of APP under more native conditions. Our results confirmed the previous findings that ε-cleavage is insensitive to GSMs. In addition, fenofibrate, an inverse GSM (iGSM), did not alter the position or kinetics of ε-cleavage position in vitro. APH 1 A and APH 1 B, a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, also modulated Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratio without any alterations in ε-cleavage, a result in contrast to what has been observed with PS 1 and APP FAD mutations.

Additionally, ferroportin may be regulated in both cell-dependent and cell-autonomous fashions.

40|$|Since the cloning of the cDNA for X-linked {{ornithine}} transcarbamylase (OTC) in 1984, diagnostic {{accuracy of}} OTC deficiency for prenatal and carrier detection {{has been greatly}} improved {{by the use of}} linkage analysis. However, the use of RFLP-based diagnosis is limited in this and in other new mutation diseases. Here we report both the use of direct mutation detection by new PCR-based techniques and our experience with linkage-based diagnosis in 18 families. We have previously reported the use of chemical mismatch cleavage to detect mutations first in amplified mRNA and then in genomic DNA of patients. This technique has now been utilized for prenatal diagnosis. Primers for specific amplification of OTC exons 1, 3, 5, 9, and 10 have been developed and been employed to map deletions of the OTC gene in two families. These primers also have been used to detect alterations in the TaqI sites found in exons 1, 3, 5, and 9. Four novel mutations of the OTC gene leading to abolition of a TaqI site in the OTC cDNA were discovered. One of these mutations is in exon 1; two lie in exon 3; and one is in exon 9. In addition, we have used the PCR products as probes to identify the exon-specific bands seen on Southern blots and to map the polymorphic BamHI and MspI sites, which are commonly used for linkage analysis. This information will facilitate the interpretation of altered band patterns seen in deletion cases and in cases of point mutations affecting restriction <b>sites.</b> <b>Utilization</b> of the appropriate combination of these molecular techniques permitted accurate diagnostic evaluations in 17 of 18 families...|$|R

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy, bleeding complications remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PPCI. A significant proportion of such bleeding complications are related to the access site, and adoption of radial access may reduce these complications. These benefits have not previously been studied in a large unselected national population of PPCI patients. METHODS: Mortality (30 -day), MACCE (a composite of 30 -day mortality and in-hospital myocardial re-infarction, target vessel revascularization, and cerebrovascular events), and bleeding and access site complications were studied based on transfemoral access (TFA) and transradial access (TRA) <b>site</b> <b>utilization</b> in PPCI STEMI patients.

RESULTS: TRA was independently associated with a lower 30 -day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 71, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 52 to 0. 97; p < 0. 05), in-hospital MACCE (HR: 0. 73, 95 % CI: 0. 57 to 0. 93; p < 0. 05), major bleeding (HR: 0. 37, 95 % CI: 0. 18 to 0. 74; p < 0. 01), and access site complications (HR: 0. 38, 95 % CI: 0. 19 to 0. 75; p < 0. 01).

The objective of this program was to consolidate and evaluate all geologic, environmental, legal, and institutional information in existing records and files, and to apply a uniform methodology to the evaluation and ranking of all known geothermal sites. This data base would enhance the making of credible forecasts of the supply of geothermal energy which could {{be available in the}} region over a 20 year planning horizon. The four states, working together under a cooperative agreement, identified a total of 1, 265 potential geothermal sites. The 1, 265 sites were screened to eliminate those with little or no chance of providing either electrical generation and/or electrical offset. Two hundred and forty-five of the original 1, 265 sites were determined to warrant further study. The Four-State team proceeded to develop a methodology which would rank the sites based upon an estimate of development potential and cost. Development potential was estimated through the use of weighted variables selected to approximate the attributes which a geothermal firm might consider in its selection of a site for exploration and possible development. Resource; engineering; and legal, institutional, and environmental factors were considered. Cost estimates for electrical generation and direct <b>utilization</b> <b>sites</b> were made using the computer programs CENTPLANT, WELLHEAD, and HEATPLAN. Finally, the sites were ranked utilizing a technique which allowed for the integration of development and cost information. On the basis of the developability index, 78 high temperature sites and 120 direct <b>utilization</b> <b>sites</b> were identified as having ''good'' or ''average'' potential for development and should be studied in detail. On the basis of cost, at least 29 of the high temperature sites appear to be technically capable of supporting a minimum total of at least 1, 000 MW of electrical generation which could be competitive with the busbar cost of conventional thermal generating technologies. Sixty direct <b>utilization</b> <b>sites</b> have a minimum total energy potential of 900 + MW and can be expected to provide substantial amounts of electrical offset at or below present conventional energy prices. The combined development and economic rankings can be used to assist in determining sites with superior characteristics of both types. Five direct <b>utilization</b> <b>sites</b> and eight high temperature sites were identified with both high development and economic potential. An additional 27 sites were shown to have superior economic characteristics, but development problems. The procedure seems validated by the fact that two of the highest ranking direct <b>utilization</b> <b>sites</b> are ones that have already been developed [...] Boise, Idaho and Klamath Falls, Oregon. Most of the higher ranking high temperature sites have received serious examination in the past as likely power production candidates...|$|R
40|$|Nonprint {{materials}} are rapidly becoming important information and learning resource {{materials for the}} health science library. Because of their long experience in organizing and utilizing informational materials, libraries represent highly appropriate repositories and <b>sites</b> for <b>utilization</b> of these new materials. Nonprint materials differ from printed materials in several ways, and this {{may account for the}} resistance of some librarians to dealing with them. One of the most important differences is that a machine must serve as mediator between the information and the user of nonprint materials. Also, the great variety of formats and machines can confuse the novice. The librarian must learn to deal with these differences in a creative way through a process of cooperation and collaboration with media and educational technology specialists...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{and function of}} axons depends on the microtubule-based transport of cellular components from their sites of synthesis in the neuronal cell body to their <b>sites</b> of <b>utilization</b> at the axon terminus. To directly visualize this axonal transport in a living organism, we constructed transgenic lines of Caenorhabditis elegans that express green fluorescent pro-tein fused to the monomeric synaptic vesicle transport motor, UNC- 104. This UNC- 104 ::GFP construct rescued the Unc- 104 mutant phenotype and was expressed throughout the nervous system. Using time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy, {{we were able to}} visualize fluorescent motor proteins moving in both directions along neuronal processes, some of which were identified definitely as axons and others as dendrites. Using kymograph analysis, we followed the movement of. 900 par-ticles. Most of them moved in one direction, but not necessarily at the same velocity. Ten percent of the observed particles reversed direction of movement during the period of observa-tion, and 10 % exhibited periods of movement interspersed with pauses. During episodes of persistent movement, particles moved at an average velocity of 1. 02 mm/sec, which is close to the in vitro velocity of microtubule gliding driven by purified monomeric kinesin at high motor density. To our knowledge, this is the first direct visualization and analysis of the movement of specifically labeled microtubule motor proteins along axons in vivo. Key words: monomeric kinesin; UNC- 104; Caenorhabditis elegans; axonal transport; time-lapse confocal microscopy; in vivo motor movement The neuron is a highly polarized cell that elaborates two pro-cesses, a dendrite, specialized for neuronal signal reception, and an axon, specialized for neuronal signal conduction and transmis-sion. The {{formation and}} function of both types of processes are thought to depend on the microtubule-based transport of cellular components from their sites of synthesis in the neuronal cell bodies to their <b>sites</b> of <b>utilization</b> in the axonal and dendriti...|$|R
