6000|$|... "I see now, Gervaise, that it {{is truly}} no holiday {{excursion}} on which you are starting. I should envy you greatly were you going in command of an armed galley, prepared to beat off any craft that might try to overhaul you; but, going alone as you are, {{it is a very}} different thing. Should pirates meet you, you could offer no resistance, and your position would be a perilous one indeed. However, I think you are born to good luck, and am confident that your patron saint will look after you, and therefore expect to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> in a fortnight's time at the outside." ...|$|E
5000|$|The R101 left Cardington, with Scott and 53 {{other people}} aboard, at 18:36 GMT on 4 October 1930, bound for Karachi with an {{intermediate}} stop at Ismaïlia in Egypt. (Scott {{had sought to}} expedite the departure {{in the hope of}} avoiding an approaching low-pressure area.) Opinions differ on Scott's mood at the time of departure; Masefield quoted F. A. de V. Robertson of Flight to the effect that Scott's final words before departure were [...] "The ship is really good now. I'm sure we'll have a splendid flight—and we'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> just two weeks from now". However, another historian of the programme, Geoffrey Chamberlain, presented a different view in his 1984 book Airships—Cardington, citing comments allegedly made by Scott to Ted Stupple, an R100 crewman who was a [...] "frequent visitor" [...] to Scott's household, before departure. According to Chamberlain, Scott asked Stupple to [...] "keep an eye" [...] on his (Scott's) pregnant wife, describing the R101 as [...] "an old ragbag" [...] that was [...] "never going to make it".|$|E
