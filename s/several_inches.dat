The storm dropped up to , washing out roads and causing localized flooding in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland. This rainfall smashed all-time rainfall records in a 24-hour period (most {{of the rain}} fell in a 6 to 8hour-period). Ottawa's O-Train Trillium Line was halted because of a landslide that obstructed the railroad corridor.

25|$|Of the carts, {{the main}} {{one was the}} plaustrum or plostrum. This was simply a {{platform}} of boards attached to wheels and a cross-tree. The wheels, or tympana, were solid and were <b>several</b> centimetres (<b>inches)</b> thick. The sides could be built up with boards or rails. A large wicker basket was sometimes placed on it. A two-wheel version existed along with the normal four-wheel type called the plaustrum maius.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the DES designs have a few common features. First, they are two boards connected via a mechanism. Secondly, the mechanism comprises a mounting platform for the rider which is <b>several</b> centimeters (<b>inches)</b> above {{the top of the}} boards, and the mechanism attaches roughly to the longitudinal center of the boards. Since they all use only two boards, {{there appears to be no}} advantage to three or more.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump <b>several</b> <b>inches,</b> and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In {{southern}} Arizona, {{a surge of}} moisture from the storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in {{a short amount of}} time; one location reported hail of 1.75inches (44.5mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled <b>several</b> <b>inches</b> in some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8inches (205mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64mph (103km/h) at the airport in Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona for about a week. In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.|$|E
5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people {{to lose their jobs}} in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, <b>several</b> <b>inches</b> of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1991 when the members were still in high school. In early 1992 the {{original}} bass player, Leer Baker, left the band and was eventually replaced by Rob Huddleston. They recorded their first full-length album, Broken Songs, and appeared on <b>several</b> 7 <b>inch</b> records and compilations. Their most well-known recording, Revolution, I Think It's Called Inspiration, was released in early 1996 on Pop A Wheelie Records and was re-released in October 2005 on A-F Records.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} develop a mobile {{anti-aircraft}} weapon, <b>several</b> 0.5 <b>inch</b> (12.7 mm) twin machine gun mounts were tested on the chassis of the M2 half-track including Bendix, Martin Aircraft Company, and Maxson. The Maxson M33 turret mount was preferred and—on the larger M3 half-track (T1E2)—was accepted for service in 1942 as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage. The mount was also used on the similar M5 half track as the M14 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage.|$|R
2500|$|In March 1949, as RCA {{released}} the 45, Columbia released <b>several</b> hundred 7 <b>inch</b> rpm small spindle hole singles. This format was soon dropped {{as it became}} clear that the RCA 45 was the single of choice and the Columbia 12-inch LP would be the [...] "album" [...] of choice.|$|R
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was <b>several</b> <b>inches</b> taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nate caused {{minor damage}} in southeastern Mexico in mid-September2011. The sixteenth named storm and fourth {{hurricane}} of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a frontal trough in the Bay of Campeche on September7. Within a weak steering environment, the storm meandered southwestward while gradually gaining strength. Though {{classified as a}} tropical storm operationally, data during a post-season review indicated that Nate briefly attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September8. As {{a result of its}} slow motion, the storm caused significant upwelling, leading to a marked decrease in convection, and weakening accordingly. On September11, Nate moved ashore Mexico as a tropical storm, producing <b>several</b> <b>inches</b> of rainfall and damaging several hundred structures. Ten oil rig workers went missing; seven were rescued, but one died of an unknown cause, and three other bodies were later recovered. In Veracruz, a boy was killed after being struck by lightning.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating <b>several</b> <b>inches</b> above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
50|$|Reznor asked Beavan {{to mix the}} demos of {{what would}} {{eventually}} become Pretty Hate Machine, which had received multiple offers for record deals. Beavan mixed sound during Nine Inch Nails' live concerts for many years, eventually becoming an unofficial member of the live band, and even singing live backup vocals from his place at the mixing console. Reznor invited him to work on The Downward Spiral as well as mix several songs on Marilyn Manson's debut record Portrait of an American Family. After contributing to <b>several</b> Nine <b>Inch</b> Nails remix releases (including Closer to God), Beavan mixed and co-produced Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar.|$|R
5000|$|When {{discussing}} {{the importance of}} the argument, despite its playfullness, the press described the opinion as highlighting important problems in American society. In particular, Biery's opinion also highlighted the problems inherent with the assumptions from law makers about stemming crime related to Sexually Oriented Businesses writing: While the court finds these businesses to be nefarious magnets of mischief, the court doubts <b>several</b> square <b>inches</b> of fabric will stanch the flow of violence and other secondary effects emanating from these businesses. Indeed, this case exposes the underbelly of America's Romanesque passion for entertainment, sex and money, sought to be covered with constitutional prophylaxis.|$|R
50|$|Late that night, Commander Meiji {{ordered his}} crew to surface his {{submarine}} {{at the mouth}} of the Columbia River. His target was Fort Stevens, which dated to the American Civil War and armed with now more or less obsolete Endicott era artillery, including 12-inch coast defense mortars, and <b>several</b> of 10 <b>inch</b> mm disappearing guns.|$|R
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the intruder. If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack and kill the intruder. Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable of jumping <b>several</b> <b>inches</b> when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E
