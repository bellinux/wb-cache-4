50|$|Afterward, Leonid retreats, and Sophie passes out. The trio run to her aid. Soon after they've learned each other's names, Sophie takes Edward and Alphonse {{and presses}} her <b>seal</b> (a {{transmutation}} <b>circle</b> {{shaped like a}} flower) onto Edward's right hand, and Alphonse's shoulder, increasing their alchemic abilities.|$|R
50|$|A Coat of Arms {{is not the}} {{property}} of a whole surname, but only belongs to a specific family ennobled by the monarch. No one else, not even collateral relatives, are legally allowed to use it. However, non-ennobled people (from Minorca) can use it privately if it is modified to omit certain details reserved for the noble family, i.e., {{the shape of the}} heraldic shield, the helmet and its accessories. Also, the silver swan on the blue field can be moved inside a <b>seal,</b> a <b>circle,</b> an oval, a rectangle, a square, etc.|$|R
50|$|The flag is a tricolor {{consisting}} of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue. These represent valor, purity, vigilance, and justice. The colors also reflect the state's historic status {{as part of}} the French Louisiana (New France). In the center white stripe is the <b>seal</b> of Missouri, <b>circled</b> by a blue band containing 24 stars, symbolizing Missouri's admission as the 24th U.S. state.|$|R
50|$|The brand Flowtite and its logo {{was created}} in the 1970s by Owens Corning, when the company {{produced}} GRP pipes under the trademark Flowtite. The trademark was first registered in the USA in 1975, then progressively across the world. It is composed of the words “flow” and “tite” (a dialect version of “tight”) and represents a steady movement of liquids through a compact and <b>sealed</b> medium. Two <b>circles</b> of the Flowtite logotype symbolize a pipe containing water flow.|$|R
5000|$|Portuguese {{euro coins}} show three {{different}} designs {{for each of}} the three series of coins. However, they are quite similar in that all contain old Portuguese royal mints and <b>seals</b> within a <b>circle</b> of seven castles and five escutcheons with silver bezants (all similar to what can be seen in the coat of arms and flag of Portugal) and the word [...] "Portugal". Also featured in the designs, all done by Vítor Manuel Fernandes dos Santos, are the 12 stars of the EU and the year of minting.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust seal imprint verification method with rotation invariance. The rotation invariant feature {{is represented by}} the absolute value of Fourier coefficients of log-polar image of <b>seal</b> imprint on <b>circles</b> with different radii. Firstly, the feature vector of a seal imprint is defined by the above absolute value of Fourier coefficients of the log-polar image. Secondly, the feature vector is expanded into Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. Thirdly, seal imprint is verified using the distance between vectors defined by coefficients in K-L expansion corresponding to true and given seal imprints. Finally, seal imprint verification experiments are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. 1...|$|R
40|$|DNA topoisomerase {{activity}} {{detected in}} cell extracts of the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata interlocks kinetoplast DNA duplex minicircles into huge catenane forms resembling the natural kinetoplast DNA networks found in trypanosomes. Catenation of duplex DNA circles is reversible and equilibrium {{is affected by}} ionic strength, and by spermidine. The reaction requires magnesium, is ATP dependent and is inhibited by high concentrations of novobiocin. Extensive homology between duplex DNA rings was not required for catenane formation since DNA circles with unrelated sequences could be interlocked into mixed network forms. Covalently <b>sealed</b> catenaned DNA <b>circles</b> are specifically used as substrates for decatenation. No such preference for covalently sealed duplex DNA rings was observed for catenate formation. Its catalytic properties and DNA substrate preference, suggest a potential role for this eukaryotic topoisomerase activity in the replication of kinetoplast DNA...|$|R
50|$|Bethany's town <b>seal</b> is a <b>circle</b> {{within which}} appears {{a circle of}} rope. In the upper aspects of the seal appear the words TOWN OF BETHANY CONNECTICUT in two curved lines of print {{bordering}} the inner aspect of the rope circle. On {{the bottom of the}} seal also bordering the inner aspect of the rope circle appear the words INCORPORATED 1832. These words form the top and bottom edges of a third circle, the sides of which are made of a string of inverted oak leaves on each side. A roadway bisecting the seal and extending from bottom to center is pictured within the innermost circle. Surrounded by trees are Christ Episcopal Church pictured on the right, and First Church of Christ Congregational with carriage shed on the left. The Town Seal was created by local artist and Bethany resident, Betsy Seaton, as part of Bethany's 150th anniversary celebration in 1982.|$|R
500|$|At its peak, {{the farm}} {{delivered}} milk to areas from Albany to New York City. After it was cooled, the milk was brought daily to the dairy-processing building, {{where it was}} poured into a large, sterilized tank and forced—with compressed air at [...] per minute—through sterilized pipes to the building's second floor. There the milk was cooled, strained five times and bottled. The bottles were <b>sealed</b> with parchment <b>circles</b> with the supervising commission's certification and the date, and then put in boxes with ice. The entire process, from entering the building to bottling, took five minutes. Every utensil contacting the milk (or workers) would be regularly sterilized with live steam. The building was as free of bacteria as the farm could make it; its rooms had white-tiled walls and floors, with coving (concave tiling) between the walls and floors for better cleaning. Milk bottles were reused after several cleanings with rotating wire brushes and two hours of heat sterilization.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Seal of the State of Missouri {{was adopted}} on January 11, 1822. Judge Robert William Wells {{designed}} the sealhttp://www.waymarking.com/gallery/image.aspx?f=1&guid=cfed68de-b7d2-44f0-8082-68db72e122c5. The {{center of the}} seal contains the Great Seal of the United States on the right side, and, on the left, symbols representing the state. On {{both sides of the}} center circle, a bear represents strength and bravery; a crescent moon represents the newness of statehood and the potential for growth. Surrounding these symbols is the motto [...] "United we stand, divided we fall". The belt buckle signifies the State's ability to secede from the Union if deemed necessary, i.e., the belt can be unbuckled. Two mighty grizzly bears support this center shield. A scroll carries the state motto, [...] "Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto", a Latin phrase meaning [...] "Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law." [...] The year 1820 is inscribed in Roman numerals below the scroll, although Missouri was not officially granted statehood until 1821. A star representing each of the other states of the Union (Missouri became the 24th) graces the top portion of the <b>seal.</b> The outer <b>circle</b> of the <b>seal</b> bears the words [...] "The Great Seal of the State of Missouri". Above the shield is a helmet representing Missouri's state sovereignty. The large star above the helmet surrounded by 23 smaller stars represents Missouri's status as the 24th state. The cloud around the stars indicates the problems Missouri had in becoming a state.|$|R
5000|$|Although he was {{initially}} {{inspired by the}} Hegelian philosophy of the unilinearlity of history, one that resonated well with the official Sadharan Brahmo Samaj doctrine, Seal eventually rejected the Hegelian thesis of the linear flow of historical progress from East to West as being too narrow and parochial. The logical culmination of the Hegelian idea envisioned all human races as being surrogates and appendages to the dominant Greco-Roman-Gothic type, which in its wake resonated perfectly well with the Orientalist doctrine. Seal saw this discourse as being dangerously Eurocentric that in effect precluded {{the possibility of an}} equitable cultural dialogue. As he saw it, the philosophy of the subaltern societies or those relegated to the periphery would be seen as being in a state of primitivism when compared to the philosophy of the dominant societies. As he saw it, the Orientalist bias espoused by Hegelianism: ...seems to be a mischievous error due to an essentially wrong conception of the philosophy of history and the evolution of culture and an essentially perverse use of the historical-comparative method. Seal drew close to what is today called postcolonialism. As contrary to colonial discourse, he argued that in any proper comparative-historical analysis, all societies should be seen as being in similar stages in the development of culture. All cultural traditions could be relatively seen as they evolved parallel patterns wherein every code, language, myth or system, has its own history - its own origin, growth and development - a study of which is essential to a proper understanding of its function in society, its place, meaning and worth. As distinct from the Hegelian world view, Seal espoused that the idea of Western civilisation as being the focal point or the culmination of world civilisation was fundamentally erroneous, that failed {{to take into account the}} myriad richness and complex mosaic of cultural continuum that manifested themselves in Hindu, Islamic, and Chinese civilisations. Human civilisation, far from being a centripetal order where the West was to be considered as the center around which other (non-Western) cultures revolved was for <b>Seal,</b> [...] a <b>circle</b> of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere and each culture was diversely embodied, reflected in specific modes and forms. But in spite of the diverse ethnic developments all very real, all very special, there has been a general history of human culture and progress, the unfolding of a single ideal, plan, or pattern, a universal movement...the same general historic plan and in obedience to the same general law of progress [...] Thus, as he saw it (in Comparative Studies in Vaishnavism and Christianity), Vaishnavism and Christianity were two distinct religious traditions, each with its own uniquely rich tradition of historical exegesis that spanned two millennia and could in no way be seen as being phases in the development of (a Eurocentric) human civilisation, as one leading to another in a pattern of cause and effect. Seal's philosophical insights were to be developed by his latter day successor from his college A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the ISKCON movement.|$|R
