Tite's squad lacked individual quality and talent, but was fine-tuned tactically and enjoyed a heavy boost of morale. The match saw the young goalkeeper Cássio save many dangerous shots, and Corinthians won after striker Paolo Guerrero scored a header against Petr Čech, winning Corinthians its second World Club Cup title, as well as Tite's first.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} half of the 2011 season there was an acute {{shortage}} of qualified strikers in Aalesund's squad. Skagestad, who originally was a right back, was then forced to play as a striker and occasionally as a winger. He went on to receive praise for his performance At one point, Skagestad made the starting-eleven as a striker while the actual strikers Sander Post, Didrik Fløtre and Solomon Okoronkwo was referred to the bench. His first goal for the club came on 30 October in an 1-1 away draw against Lillestrøm. The 2011 season ended triumphantly for Skagestad as he was chosen to start, again as a <b>striker,</b> the 2011 <b>Cup</b> final against Brann. A match which Aalesund won 2-1.|$|R
5000|$|... "Diego {{was capable}} of things {{no one else could}} match. The things I could do with a football, he could do with an orange." [...] —Michel Platini, former French midfielder and UEFA President. [...] "Even if I played for a million years, I'd never come close to Maradona. Not that I'd want to anyway. He's the {{greatest}} there's ever been." [...] —Lionel Messi. [...] "When Diego scored that second goal against us, I felt like applauding. I'd never felt like that before, but it's true... and not just because it was such an important game. It was impossible to score such a beautiful goal. He's the greatest player of all time, by a long way. A genuine phenomenon." [...] —Gary Lineker, England's 1986 World <b>Cup</b> <b>striker</b> on Maradona's Goal of the Century.|$|R
2500|$|Despite not yet {{playing in}} the FA Women's Premier League National Division, Fulham were already {{considered}} [...] "the dominant force in England" [...] by the BBC. In their second year as the only full-time professional women's club in Europe, they had already won that season's FA Women's Premier League Cup by beating Birmingham City 71 in the final. In securing the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division championship Fulham beat one team 220. The total amount of goals they had put past their opponents in 34 league and cup matches stood at 267.

50|$|Following an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Manchester United in 1980, Wegerle chose to play college soccer in the United States. He spent two {{season with the}} University of South Florida in 1982 and 1983 and holds the school's single season scoring record with 21 goals. The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League drafted Wegerle {{in the first round}} of the 1984 NASL college draft. He would play 21 games and score 9 goals, adding 17 assists, during the last year of the NASL's existence in 1984, being named league's Rookie of the Year. More significantly, Rodney Marsh coached him at Tampa Bay. This association would be integral to Wegerle's future move to England. When the league folded, Wegerle moved indoors with the Tacoma Stars of the Major Indoor Soccer League for two seasons. At the University of South Florida, Wegerle came under the professional instruction of ex-Chelsea <b>striker</b> and UEFA <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup winner Derek Smethurst, who grounded him and got him ready for his professional career.|$|R
5000|$|The {{club was}} in the process of a [...] "lengthy search" [...] for a [...] "marquee-designated player". MLSE President Tim Leiweke, Club General Manager Tim Bezbatchenko, and Head Coach Ryan Nelsen {{traveled}} to Europe in October 2013 to search for such a player. Leiweke was quoted, stating, that [...] "the days of us putting our toe in the water and trying to find a cheap DP (designated player) are over. We're going to go swing for the fences." [...] The club wanted to sign two strikers in the January transfer window and were at the [...] "top of the list." [...] The attention was on clubs in the Premier League and Serie A. Jermain Defoe, Alberto Gilardino Samuel Eto'o and Fabio Quagliarella were rumoured to join Toronto FC. The club denied the report about signing Defoe, but Bezbatchenko stated that [...] "it's obvious the public [...] "knows" [...] who the targets are." [...] Bezbatchenko also stated that [...] "We’ve identified 3-5 (potential Designated Players) that would fit the role" [...] and that [...] "We’re really [...] on two." [...] Another name in the media was Gilberto. Toronto FC was in competition with clubs in La Liga, Liga MX, Serie A, and Bundesliga for Gilberto's signature. Gilberto was in Toronto and was at the Toronto Raptors game on December 10. Gilberto signed for the club on December 14. Michael Bradley and Defoe joined Gilberto as designated players. Defoe joined Toronto on February 28. Defoe was part of a marketing campaign with the club. The club put together a television advertisement stating that it's a [...] "bloody big deal" [...] that Defoe is coming to Toronto FC. The ad was also online and had close to 60,000 views in a day. The ads were running on The Sports Network and Sportsnet with Toronto being the main focus of the marketing campaign. Even though MLSE was using Defoe in their marketing campaigns, British newspaper The Guardian stated [...] "The money may be good but the club are woeful and playing in Canada may end the <b>striker's</b> World <b>Cup</b> hopes." ...|$|R
