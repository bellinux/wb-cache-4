5|$|Early on March28, an upper-level low tracked eastward {{into the}} Southern United States {{along with its}} {{associated}} shortwave trough, sending the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet</b> through Texas and bringing along with it strong west-northwesterly winds in the upper-levels of the troposphere. Concurrently, a cold front extended zonally tracked south across the Great Plains before eventually stalling near the Red River valley, providing an additional focus area for storm development. Favorable conditions for severe weather were expected ahead of the upper-level low over areas of North Texas; accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center(SPC) issued a moderate risk for severe weather for the region, citing an unstable atmosphere caused by steep lapse rates of 7.5-8.0°C/km and high convective available potential energy values.

5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet</b> stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet</b> stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E

5|$|Cyclogenesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet</b> stream.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet</b> forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E
40|$|Drivers of {{upwelling}} in {{the tropical}} lower stratosphere are investigated using the E 39 C-A chemistry– climate model. The climatological annual cycle in upwelling and its wave forcing are compared to the interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). The strength in tropical upwelling and its annual cycle can be largely explained by local resolved wave forcing. The climatological mean forcing is due to both stationary planetary-scale waves that originate in the tropics and extratropical transient synoptic-scale waves that are refracted equatorward. Increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations to 2050 force a year-round positive trend in tropical upwelling, which maximizes in the lowermost stratosphere. Tropical ascent is balanced by downwelling between 208 and 408. Strengthening of tropical upwelling {{can be explained by}} stronger local forcing by resolved wave flux convergence, which is driven in turn by processes initiated by increases in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Higher tropical SSTs cause a strengthening of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets</b> and modification of deep convection affecting latent heat release. While the former can modify wave prop-agation and dissipation, the latter affects tropical wave generation. The dominant mechanism leading to enhanced vertical wave propagation into the lower stratosphere is an upward shift of the easterly shear zone due to the strengthening and upward shift of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{paleoclimate}} {{evidence that}} much past climate {{change has been}} symmetric about the equator, the causes of hemispherically symmetric variability in the recent observational record are examined using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset and numerical models. It {{was found that the}} dominant cause of hemispherically symmetric variability is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. During an El Niño event the Tropics warm at all longitudes and the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets</b> in both hemispheres strengthen on their equatorward flanks. Poleward of the tropical warming there are latitude belts of marked cooling, extending from the surface to the tropopause in both hemispheres, at all longitudes and in all seasons. The midlatitude cooling is caused by changes in the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. Changes in the transient eddy momentum fluxes during an El Niño event force upper-tropospheric ascent in midlatitudes through a balance between the eddy fluxes and the Coriolis torque. The eddy-driven ascent causes anomalous adiabatic cooling, which is primarily balanced by anomalous diabatic heating. Using a quasigeostrophic spherical model, forced by an imposed surface eddy disturbance of chosen wavenumber and frequency, it is shown that the anomalous eddy momentum fluxes are caused by the impact that the changes in the tropically forced <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets</b> have on the propagation in the latitude–height plane o...|$|R

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet,</b> which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system now in place, the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet.</b> The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|In early January2016, a {{stationary}} front was draped across the western Caribbean; a non-tropical low developed along this boundary over northwestern Cuba by January6. Moving northeast {{ahead of the}} <b>subtropical</b> <b>jet</b> stream, the system acquired a surface vortex the following day to the northeast of the Bahamas. Initial conditions, including strong wind shear, low sea surface temperatures, and dry air, inhibited formation of a tropical cyclone as the storm moved northeast toward Bermuda. The large system featured gale-force winds, with maximum sustained winds of 60–65mph (95–100km/h). On January8, the system passed about 75mi (120km) north of Bermuda, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the islands. On January9, an anomalous blocking pattern prevented the cyclone from continuing along a seasonal northeasterly track. Instead, the storm turned east-southeast into a region slightly more favorable for subtropical development. Hurricane-force winds developed around {{the core of the}} cyclone on January10 as it deepened to 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg), though convective activity near the center remained sparse. Separated from the jet stream, the cyclone dove south-southeast over the central Atlantic around a mid-latitude trough. Slight weakening took place on January11.|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} regression analysis of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis dataset shows a response to increased solar activity of a weakening and poleward shift of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets.</b> This signal is separable from other influences, {{such as those of}} El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and is very similar to that seen in previous studies using global circulation models (GCMs) of the effects of an increase in solar spectral irradiance. The response to increased stratospheric (volcanic) aerosol is found in the data to be a weakening and equatorward shift of the jets. The GCM studies of the solar influence also showed an impact on tropospheric mean meridional circulation with a weakening and expansion of the tropical Hadley cells and a poleward shift of the Ferrel cells. To understand the mechanisms whereby the changes in solar irradiance affect tropospheric winds and circulation, experiments have been carried out with a simplified global circulation model. The results show that generic heating of the lower stratosphere tends to weaken the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets</b> and the tropospheric mean meridional circulations. The positions of the jets, and the extent of the Hadley cells, respond to the distribution of the stratospheric heating, with low-latitude heating forcing them to move poleward, and high-latitude or latitudinally uniform heating forcing them equatorward. The patterns of response are similar to those that are found to be a result of the solar or volcanic influences, respectively, in the data analysis. This demonstrates that perturbations to the heat balance of the lower stratosphere, such as those brought about by solar or volcanic activity, can produce changes in the mean tropospheric circulation, even without any direct forcing below the tropopause...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Rossby wave breaking on the isentropic surfaces that intersect the subtropical tropopause, using {{winds and}} isentropic potential vorticity from high-resolution meteorological analysis. The focus is both on particular aspects of individual wave breaking events, {{as well as}} on more general aspects such as the spatial and temporal distribution of the mixing associated with these events. The direction and intensity of wave breaking is shown to exhibit the same dependence on stagnation points in the wind field as that seen in previous highly idealized numerical model studies. Wave breaking that results in stratospheric intrusions into the troposphere can be categorized as weak or strong, depending on the development of filaments or larger, coherent vortices or cutoff lows. The events presented show a deep vertical structure that approximately spans the region between the 330 -K and 370 -K isentropic surfaces, where the tropopause is steeply sloping through the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets.</b> This is in contrast with tropospheric intrusions into the stratosphere, which appear to be less directly related to wave breaking than to the interaction of coherent structures in the tropospheric circulation. Transport estimates during weak wave breaking are shown to be very sensitive to the definition of the tropopause. Contour stretching is used as a measure of the mixing properties at the tropopause associated with the Rossby wave breaking and reveals longitudinal inhomogeneities that are consistent with the different structure of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets</b> over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Analysis of transport across TTL is performed using a new version of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). In this new version, the stratospheric model has been extended to the earth surface. Above the tropopause, the isentropic and cross-isentropic advection in CLaMS is driven by ECMWF winds and heating/cooling rates derived from a radiation calculation. Below the tropopause the model smoothly transforms from the isentropic to hybrid-pressure coordinate and, in this way, takes into account the effect of large-scale convective transport as implemented in the ECMWF vertical wind. As with other CLaMS simulations, the irreversible transport, i. e. mixing, is controlled by the local horizontal strain and vertical shear rates. Stratospheric and tropospheric signatures in the TTL can be seen both in the observation and in the model. The composition of air above ? 350 K is mainly controlled by mixing on a time scale of weeks or even months. Based on CLaMS transport studies where mixing can be completely switched off, we deduce that vertical mixing, mainly driven by the vertical shear in the outflow regions of the large-scale convection and in the vicinity of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>jets,</b> is necessary to understand the upward transport of the tropospheric air from the main convective outflow around 350 K up to the tropical tropopause around 380 K.
