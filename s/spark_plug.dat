5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark plugs fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation {{in the case of a}} single magneto failure, and has the advantage of more efficient combustion over a single <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> application.|$|E
5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} smaller ones like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry began looking at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope {{expressed an interest in}} the design and felt he could adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for AC <b>Spark</b> <b>Plug</b> to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct sales to the UK.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} made some basic {{changes to the}} design {{to make it easier}} to produce and a final design was ready in May 1942. The Sperry T-1 was fully compatible with UK-built versions and a T-1 computer could be used with a Mk. XIV sight head or vice versa. Full production commenced at the AC plant in Flint, Michigan, in November and T-1s arrived in the UK from March 1943. The sights were sent to medium bombers like the Wellington, while UK-built versions were sent to the heavy bombers. In August 1943, George Mann of AC <b>Spark</b> <b>Plug</b> visited the UK for a period of about a year, liaising with RAE Farnborough, Boscombe Down and the Ministry of Aircraft Production.|$|E

5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the heat}} for fusion {{ignition}} {{comes not from}} the primary but from a second fission bomb called the <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> embedded {{in the heart of}} the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.|$|E

50|$|The {{ignition}} coils provided current for two <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> each. A system of “Wasted spark” was used where one coil powers two <b>spark</b> <b>plugs.</b> But the coils were still {{subjected to a}} high heat zone.|$|R

25|$|Ignition: a {{high voltage}} pulse {{is used to}} produce an {{electrical}} arc – {{in a manner similar}} to a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> – which ionizes the xenon gas, creating a conducting channel between the tungsten electrodes. Electrical resistance is reduced within the channel, and current flows between the electrodes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{may also}} be used for other purposes; in Saab Direct Ignition when they are not firing, <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> are used to measure {{ionization}} in the cylinders - this ionic current measurement is used to replace the ordinary cam phase sensor, knock sensor and misfire measurement function. <b>Spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{may also be}} used in other applications such as furnaces wherein a combustible fuel/air mixture must be ignited. In this case, they are sometimes referred to as flame igniters.|$|R
25|$|The Y-12 {{plant in}} Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where mass spectrometers called calutrons had enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, was {{redesigned}} to make secondaries. Fissile U-235 {{makes the best}} <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> because its critical mass is larger, especially in the cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries. Early experiments used the two fissile materials in combination, as composite Pu-Oy pits and <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> but for mass production, {{it was easier to}} let the factories specialize: plutonium pits in primaries, uranium <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> and pushers in secondaries.|$|R
25|$|Equally important, {{the active}} {{ingredients}} in the Flute probably cost no more {{than those in the}} Swan. Most of the fission came from cheap U-238, and the tritium was manufactured in place during the explosion. Only the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> at the axis of the secondary needed to be fissile.|$|E
25|$|Some designs {{using an}} EMS retain the {{original}} ignition coil, distributor and high-tension leads found on cars throughout history. Other systems dispense with the distributor altogether and have individual coils mounted directly atop each <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> This removes {{the need for}} both distributor and high-tension leads, which reduces maintenance and increases long-term reliability.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacitor}} suppresses arcing at {{the points}} when they open; without the capacitor, the energy {{stored in the}} coil would be expended at an arc across the points {{rather than at the}} <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> gap. The Kettering system became the primary ignition system for many years in the automotive industry due to its lower cost, and relative simplicity.|$|E

25|$|Ferrocene and its {{derivatives}} are antiknock agents used in {{the fuel}} for petrol engines; they are safer than tetraethyllead, previously used. Petrol additive solutions containing ferrocene {{can be added to}} unleaded petrol to enable its use in vintage cars designed to run on leaded petrol.

25|$|With the {{universal}} adoption of electrical starting for automobiles, {{and the availability}} of a large battery to provide a constant source of electricity, magneto systems were abandoned for systems which interrupted current at battery voltage, using an ignition coil to step the voltage up {{to the needs of the}} ignition, and a distributor to route the ensuing pulse to the correct <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> at the correct time.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} layer shields {{and the oil}} film act as thermal insulation, leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film (maximum ~ on a water-cooled Wankel engine.

25|$|Mazda has {{undertaken}} research on HCCI ignition for its SkyActiv-R rotary engine project, using research from its SkyActiv Generation 2 program. A constraint of rotary engines {{is the need}} to locate the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> outside the combustion chamber to enable the rotor to sweep past. Mazda confirmed that the problem had been solved in the SkyActiv-R project. Rotaries generally have high compression ratios, making them particularly suitable for the use of HCCI.|$|E
