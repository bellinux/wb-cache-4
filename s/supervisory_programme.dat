40|$|The present· {{system of}} {{education}} in Saskatchewan has evolved from legislation and regulations established {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century, when education in the West became a responsibility of the Territorial governments. In the intervening years there have been great changes in all aspects of the educational programme. Traditionally, supervision has been inspectoral in nature, but striking changes in the system of inspection and supervision of the schools are apparent when one compares the practices of the nineteenth century with those in use today. An examination of these changes and an evaluation of current practices in the <b>supervisory</b> <b>programme</b> should contribute to an understanding of the development of the educational system in Saskatchewan...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} about {{evaluating}} supervisor performance at Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) {{and the impact}} {{it has in the}} business world in general. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the quality of supervisors at Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) in the Eastern Cape. The sample size of 43 supervisors working at TPT from different departments like operations, planning, key accounts and procurement participated in the study. The sampled supervisors are between the ages of 20 and 59 years and was composed of females and predominantly males. The data was gathered through a questionnaire that was designed particularly to address the lack of quality of supervisory support at TPT. The response from respondents were tied to themes that were constructed, which are: (a) organisational goals; vision and management competencies; (b) communication; (c) performance cycle-setting of goals; (d) supervisor/supervisee performance conversation; and (e) supervisory development programme. The literature gathered and deliberated on in the literature review emanate from different authors in the form of books, journals and treatises. The empirical results were linked to theories gathered from different authors. Research findings were used to curb the issues identified, which will be beneficial to both TPT and its employees. The recommendations were submitted to the company to look at developing an in-house <b>supervisory</b> <b>programme,</b> capacity building internally and creating platforms for effective communication...|$|E
40|$|During a high-cell density fed-batch {{fermentation}} of recombinant E. coli, both oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} transfer rates (OTR and CTR) were calculated on-line from inlet and exhaust gas composition measurements obtained with Mass Spectrometry (MS) and from the culture weight. These rates, together with on-line measurements of acetate concentration by Flow Injection Analysis, were used to implement an adaptive control law in a real fermentation. For MS calibration, a new method was adapted, where several gas mixtures were used, their composition being chosen from {{the analysis of the}} expected experimental space. A calibration factor was then calculated by linear regression that correlated the pressure values obtained in the MS for a given mass to charge ratio with the mixture composition in oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. During the fermentation, 12 MS and weight data points (corresponding to approximately 3 minutes) were acquired in a developed LabVIEW subroutine where a C embedded window performed data analysis by statistical significance assessment to exclude potential outliers. Afterwards, the noise was partially eliminated by applying a moving average filter and MS raw data was converted to molar fractions, according to the calculated calibration factors. CTR and OTR values are then computed from inlet and exhaust gas composition and reactor weight. This LabVIEW subroutine was then integrated in a <b>supervisory</b> <b>programme,</b> together with the measurements of other equipments, acquired by serial ports or analog input and using string interpretation or the standard Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol...|$|E
40|$|SAPS is {{currently}} implementing an EAP. Supervisors {{are an important}} link in the EAP process {{because they are the}} first persons to identify a troubled employee and to refer the employee to the EAP. Owing to her knowledge of an EAP and her interest in supervisory training, the researcher was asked to assist with the development of a <b>supervisory</b> training <b>programme.</b> The researcher has been employed as a social worker in the SAPS for ten years. In practice it happens that commanders refer troubled employees to the EAP when the commanders do not {{know what else to do}} with the troubled employees. At that stage the problems that the employees experience are of such a nature that long-term therapy is needed to attend to them. At times the commanders will act as social workers instead of referring the employee to the EAP. The researcher wanted to establish empirically what the role, knowledge and the attitude of commanders within the SAPS are regarding the EAP. The researcher decided to explore the topic by means of a literature study regarding the EAP in the SAPS and supervisory training and to interview several experts in the EAP in the SAPS and two experts in private organisations. An interview schedule was compiled and tested on one respondent. The information gained from the interview was sufficient and the researcher could go ahead with the data collection. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two percent (2 %) of the commanders in area West-Metropole. The researcher interviewed one (1) Senior superintendent, two (2) Superintendents, four (4) Captains and three (3) Inspectors. None of the respondents had previous training in the EAP. A stratified random sample was used to select the respondents. From the information gathered from the respondents, the researcher achieved the objectives of the study and provide answers to the three (3) research questions, namely: • What is the knowledge of SAPS commanders regarding the EAP? • What is the knowledge of SAPS commanders regarding their role within the EAP? • What is the attitude of SAPS commanders towards the EAP? The researcher determined that the respondents had limited knowledge regarding the EAP and the services rendered by the EAP professionals in the SAPS. The respondents all knew that they had to refer the troubled employee to the EAP but some of them first tried to be the social worker before they referred to the EAP. Therefore it is important that the distinctive roles of the commander/supervisor and the EAP are identified. All the respondents felt positive towards the EAP in the SAPS and said that they self would make use of the services of the EAP. Although the researcher could not generalise the findings, sufficient information was provided to make the following valuable recommendations: recommendations regarding the content of a <b>supervisory</b> training <b>programme,</b> the marketing of the services rendered by the EAP in the SAPS and the steps that could be taken to ensure confidence in the EAP.

40|$|Orientation: An {{important}} {{evaluation function}} is to assess {{the adequacy of the}} programme process, including {{the extent to which the}} appropriate people participate in its activities. Research purpose: The study aimed to provide information about coverage, service delivery, organisational resources, and medium-term outcomes for a <b>supervisory</b> development <b>programme</b> (SDP) in the hospitality industry. Motivation for the study: The primary motivation was to assist programme staff to understand their programme and also to generate information that the programme staff could use to reflect on the programme’s performance and future direction. Research design, approach and method: A mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods was employed, namely: a literature review; personal interviews; and internal programme documentation, such as e-mail correspondence, financial statements, attendance registers, and personnel records. Personal interviews were conducted with two stakeholders, namely the programme manager and programme administrator. The programme data of 69 participants in the SDP were utilised for the evaluation. Main findings: The evaluation’s main finding concluded that the ‘implemented programme’ was not congruent with the ‘planned programme’. Practical/managerial implications: It is recommended that programme activities and theory should be re-evaluated, as the programme is used mainly as a training programme for new appointees, rather than a management development programme to create a pool of potential supervisors. Programme uptake and output should also be closely aligned. The length of time that people in the pool of potential supervisors had to wait before they were appointed should also be reduced. Contribution/value-add: By explicating the basic programme theory and studying programme implementation, this evaluation serves as a starting point for future evaluations of the SDP. </p...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} wide scale {{review of}} {{postgraduate}} research regulations and processes at the University of Lincoln, work began in 2014 - 15 {{to develop a new}} framework for the professional development of research supervisors. The aim of the framework is to build a culture of excellence in supervisory practice through emphasis on reflection, continued professional development (CPD) and building a community of supervisors. The framework provides support for new and experienced supervisors as we argue that excellence cannot be measured by the number of completions alone. This crude indicator ignores both the role of the student and the complexities of supervisory practice. The foundation of the framework is the Supervisor Development Programme (SDP), which is mandatory for all staff who supervise doctoral students or intend {{to do so in the}} future. The programme encourages participants to explore their own experiences of being supervised, the supervisory relationship and supporting students from induction to completion. It is constructed around Lee’s (2008) framework and grounded in a belief that supervision is a specialist form of teaching (McCallin & Nayer, 2012). Lee’s (2008) framework supports the idea that supervision must be responsive and flexible to the needs of individual students, characteristics which are seen by Nulty et al (2009) as hallmarks of <b>supervisory</b> excellence. The <b>programme</b> is built on by an annual requirement for CPD, specialist workshops, and forums for supervisors at a local level which are underpinned by the theory of Communities of Practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Supervisors access updated information on regulatory and process changes via the institutional virtual learning environment. This presentation will outline the components of the framework in further detail and open discussion around whether conceptualising supervision as a form of teaching and emphasising continued professional development can help achieve excellence in postgraduate supervision...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{level of}} access to {{intermittent}} preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) in Nigeria is still low despite relatively high antenatal care coverage in the study area. This paper presents information on provider factors that affect the delivery of IPTp in Nigeria. Methods Data were collected from heads of maternal health units of 28 public and six private health facilities offering antenatal care (ANC) services in two districts in Enugu State, south-east Nigeria. Provider knowledge of guidelines for IPTp was assessed with regard to four components: the drug used for IPTp, time of first dose administration, of second dose administration, and the strategy for sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) administration (directly observed treatment, DOT). Provider practices regarding IPTp and facility-related factors that may explain observations such as availability of SP and water were also examined. Results Only five (14. 7 %) of all 34 providers had correct knowledge of all four recommendations for provision of IPTp. None {{of them was a}} private provider. DOT strategy was practiced in only one and six private and public providers respectively. Overall, 22 providers supplied women with SP in the facility and women were allowed to take it at home. The most common reason for doing so amongst public providers was that women were required to come for antenatal care on empty stomachs to enhance the validity of manual fundal height estimation. Two private providers did not think it was necessary to use the DOT strategy because they assumed that women would take their drugs at home. Availability of SP and water in the facility, and concerns about side effects were not considered impediments to delivery of IPTp. Conclusion There was low level of knowledge of the guidelines for implementation of IPTp by all providers, especially those in the private sector. This had negative effects such as non-practice of DOT strategy by most of the providers, which can lead to low levels of adherence to IPTp and ineffectiveness of IPTp. Capacity development and regular supportive <b>supervisory</b> visits by <b>programme</b> managers could help improve the provision of IPTp. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the recent Financial Crisis - after it had been widely accepted that “a serious disturbance in the economy of Member States” had occurred, and that several measures were required to remedy this disturbance, various Commission communications were adopted. The Communications include: The first Communication which (initially), {{was the only one}} that the Commission adopted intentionally: the Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions in the context of the current global financial crisis (hereinafter "the Banking Communication"). However, faced with the pressure to issue more guidelines (such pressure being exerted by Member States), the Commission adopted three further Communications: the Communication on the re capitalisation of financial institutions in the current financial crisis: limitation of aid to the minimum necessary and safeguards against undue distortions of competition (hereinafter "the Recapitalisation Communication"); the Communication “On the treatment of impaired assets in the Community banking sector” (hereinafter, “the Toxic Assets Comunication”) and finally, the Communication on the return to viability and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Restructuring Communication"). ” Whilst the Banking and Re capitalisation Communications constituted the focus of study in Part I to this paper, this paper will focus on the impact of shadow banking and Basel III on regulatory arbitrage, the corresponding need for greater transparency and disclosure within financial markets – particularly within OTC markets, and impediments to the successful implementation of capital requirements which are aimed at fostering financial stability, coordination and harmonisation. Further, it will consider the extent to which regulators are prepared to deviate from regulations during the implementation of stress-testing and rescue programmes which are aimed at restoring stability to the financial system. The redefinition of quantitative and qualitative standards for capital, in implementing the <b>Supervisory</b> Capital Assessment <b>Programme</b> (SCAP), as illustrated in the paper, should demonstrate the extent to which regulators, independent of shadow banking practices, are prepared to deviate from capital regulations under adverse scenarios where certain regulations prove to be unduly stringen...|$|R
