5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
25|$|The EA Falcon, {{released}} {{under the}} codename EA26 (E {{for the large}} size, A for Australia, 26 for the (usually in sequence) global project number), would retain the traditional Falcon hallmarks of width and rear-wheel drive. This {{proved to be the}} correct move as sales of the Falcon began to climb after the fuel crisis aftermath, while those of the rival Commodore <b>slipped.</b> <b>It</b> became clear that Australian buying patterns had not truly changed and what the public wanted was a full-size (albeit smaller) family car.|$|E
25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{created their}} first chance inside 24 seconds, when Ljungberg put Henry clear down the {{right-hand}} side. The striker used his pace {{to get the}} better of Lundekvam, only to have his shot blocked by goalkeeper Antti Niemi. Bergkamp's goal effort in the eighth minute was cleared off the line by full back Chris Baird, after Niemi fumbled Henry's initial shot. Southampton fashioned their first opportunity in the 15th minute through a high cross; in spite of unsettling the Arsenal defence, the unmarked Svensson volleyed over the bar. Baird moments after won the ball in midfield and curled a shot that left Seaman [...] "scrambling across his goal to save". Seven minutes before the break, Arsenal went into the lead. Henry, receiving the ball from Parlour, <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> into Bergkamp down the right. He in turn fed the ball to Ljungberg, whose shot was blocked. The ball rebounded in the direction of Pirès, who needed one touch to set himself and another to fire at the near post, despite Niemi getting a hand. Arsenal missed further chances to extend their lead when a cross from the right by Henry was shot over the bar by Pirès and from the same area, Bergkamp's [...] "cross-cum-shot" [...] was missed by Ljungberg.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was then}} that French {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï was introduced by Madonna's partner Guy Oseary. In an interview with CNN, she stated, [...] "Guy Oseary, my partner at Maverick , was given a demo by a French artist called Mirwais. [...] <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> to me and said, 'What do you think [...] as an artist to sign at Maverick?' [...] I just said 'Oh my God, this is what I want.' I just flipped over it and said, 'Please {{find out if he}} wants to work with me.'" [...] Ahmadzaï spoke little English, and Madonna commented: [...] "The first couple of days we were recording, I wanted to rip my hair out. [...] It didn't seem like there was any way for us to communicate. His manager had to come in and translate everything at first." ...|$|E
2500|$|His first theft came in March 1995 {{during a}} visit to the medieval castle at Bonn, Germany, with his then-girlfriend Anne-Catherine Kleinklauss. He became entranced with a small {{painting}} by Christian Wilhelm Dietrich, later saying, [...] "I was fascinated by her beauty, by the qualities of the woman in the portrait and by her eyes. I thought it was an imitation of Rembrandt." [...] With his girlfriend keeping watch, he worked out the nails holding the painting in its frame and <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> under his jacket. He would use similar methods for at least 170 other museums for his thefts in the ensuing years. He would visit small collections and regional museums, where security was lax, and Kleinklauss would serve as his lookout as he cut the paintings from their frames.|$|E

2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend <b>slipped</b> <b>it</b> into their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception {{induced by the}} hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with CNN, Madonna said, [...] "Guy Oseary, my partner at Maverick , was given a demo by a French artist called Mirwais.

I just flipped over it and said, 'Please {{find out if he}} wants to work with me.'" [...] Ahmadzaï always preferred taking musical risks and hence he wanted the collaborations with Madonna to get out the best from the artist. [...] "The challenge was to make something current appear, something hidden in her personality. Everybody knows [...] as a chameleon, as a businesswoman. I wanted to show her potential as a musician," [...] Ahmadzaï noted. [...] "Music" [...] features production by Ahmadzaï, who Madonna has called a [...] "genius".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a public}} meeting on 22 July 1976, the Nottingham Canal Society was formed, {{with a view}} to {{preserving}} {{what was left of the}} canal, and to reinstating navigation between Langley Mill and Coventry Lane, Nottingham. They hoped to prevent further sections of the canal from being filled in, and to ensure that any plans for open-cast mining would include provision to reinstate the line of the canal afterwards. Also in 1976, children from Fernwood Junior School, Wollaton, created a nature trail along the bed of the canal near Wollaton colliery, and Browtowe Council announced that they were hoping to buy [...] of the canal for £7,350. The canal society began holding working parties to trim hedges, repair bridges, and mend the canal banks from April 1977, once ownership had passed from British Waterways to Browtowe Council. They also campaigned for the Awsworth Bypass, which was scheduled to be built in 1980, to include navigable headroom where it crossed the canal. A breach of the canal occurred in 1978, when part of the embankment at Trowell, near to the M1 motorway, <b>slipped.</b> <b>It</b> was repaired by the society, with some labour supplied by one of the local prisons, and machinery supplied by the Waterway Recovery Group. Bridge restoration work was carried out on the swing bridge at Bailey Grove, Eastwood and on Tinsley Road bridge, but in early 1979, Nottinghamshire County Council declared that the cost of a navigable bridge on the Awsworth Bypass would be £428,000. As that amount of money was not available, there would be no navigable culvert, and as that effectively prevented the canal reopening for navigation, the canal society was wound up soon afterwards.|$|E
