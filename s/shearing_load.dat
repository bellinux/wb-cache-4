50|$|To {{positionally}} {{compensate the}} additional load {{due to the}} pregnancy, pregnant mothers often extend their lower backs. As the fetal load increases, women tend to arch their lower backs, specifically in the lumbar region of their vertebral column to maintain postural stability and balance. The arching of the lumbar region is known as lumbar lordosis, which recovers the center of mass into a stable position by reducing hip torque. According to {{a study conducted by}} Whitcome, et al., lumbar lordosis can increase from an angle of 32 degrees at 0% fetal mass (i.e. non-pregnant women or very early in pregnancy) to 50 degrees at 100% fetal mass (very late in pregnancy). Postpartum, the angle of the lordosis declines and can reach the angle prior to pregnancy. Unfortunately, while lumbar lordosis reduces hip torque, it also exacerbates spinal <b>shearing</b> <b>load,</b> which may be the cause for the common lower back pain experienced by pregnant women.|$|E

However, on 300 MPa the density increment for stainless powder was smaller than for titanium powder although the density before <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was lowest.

Scoliosis is a 3 -dimensional deformity of the spine that presents itself mainly in adolescent girls and elderly patients. Our concept of its etiopathogenesis is that an excess of posteriorly directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads,</b> relative to the body's intrinsic stabilizing mechanisms, induces a torsional instability of the spine, making it vulnerable to scoliosis. Our hypothesis for the elderly spine is that disc degeneration compromises the stabilizing mechanisms. Methods. In an adult lumbar motion segment model, the disc properties were varied to simulate different aspects of disc degeneration. These models were then loaded with a pure torsion moment in combination with either a <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> in posterior direction, no shear, or a <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> in anterior direction. Results. Posteriorly directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> reduced torsion stiffness, anteriorly directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> increased torsion stiffness.

To {{investigate}} axial rotational {{stability of the}} thoracic spine under dorsal and ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Idiopathic scoliosis is a condition restricted exclusively to humans. An important difference between humans and other vertebrates {{is the fact that}} humans ambulate in a fully erect position. It has been demonstrated that certain parts of the human spine, more specifically the dorsally inclined lower thoracic and high lumbar parts, are subject to dorsally directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> It has been hypothesized that these dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> reduce the rotational stability of the spine, thereby increasing the risk to initiate idiopathic scoliosis. METHODS. Fourteen porcine and 14 human thoracic functional spinal units (FSUs) with intact costotransverse and costovertebral articulations were used for biomechanical testing. In both dorsal and ventral directions, <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> were applied to the upper vertebra of the FSU in the midsagittal plane (centrally), and at 1 cm to the right and to the left (eccentrically), resulting in a rotary moment. Vertebral rotation was measured at 3 incremental loads by an automated optoelectronic 3 -dimensional (3 D) movement registration system. RESULTS. The results of this study showed that eccentrically applied <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> induce vertebral rotation in human as well as in porcine spinal segments. At the mid-thoracic and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> CONCLUSION. These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R

Background: Screws are used in spinal instrumentation for many diseases. Various techniques are available for the placement of the screws in the vertebral body. However, clear guidelines as to which technique to apply to optimize the strength of fixation at the bone screw interface are not available. Methods: A spine model to imitate a vertebral body was used for the biomechanical comparison of the different positioned double-screw constructs, similar to an angular stability system. Each different double-screw construct (parallel, converged, and cross) was tested on the spine model with simulated corticalis and without simulated corticalis. The tests conducted were performed on both the bending load and the <b>shearing</b> <b>load.</b> Results: The study was designed to provide insight on the relationship of the positioning of various double-screw constructs and the biomechanical stability. Different biomechanical tests were conducted and the results were analyzed. The biomechanical study on double-screw constructs showed that screw positioning (i. e. parallel, converged, and cross) had no significant influence on fixation strength. The study shows comparable results for both the bending load and for the <b>shearing</b> <b>load.</b> Conclusion: Regarding the application of angular stability double-screw systems as a ventral Instrumentation, however, the study showed no additional benefit in biomechanical stability depending on a change of screw- positioning. The method of fixation that uses the principle of angular stability system already provides a high level of biomechanical stability. Another reason is to be seen in the less bone mineral density at the vertebral body.

To clarify the mechanism for the second phase of PGI 2 upregulation, we examined the gene expression of the enzymes involved in PGI 2 production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after shear-stress (24 dyne/cm 2) loading. The production of 6 -keto-PGF 1 a, a stable metabolite of PGI 2, increased time-dependently under shear stress. The arachidonic acid liberation from membrane phospholipids in HUVECs after 12 hours of <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was increased significantly compared with the static condition. No change was observed for cytosolic phospholipase A 2 expression, as detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.

After the addition of nano Ni powder in Sn-based solders, the <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> were increased due to a refinement of the microstructure and in addition, ductile fracture surfaces were clearly observed. The <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> of the plain Sn- 9 Zn and Sn- 8 Zn- 3 Bi solders after one reflow cycle were about 1798 g and 2059 g, respectively. After the addition of nano Ni powder, their loads were about 2172 g and 2212 g, respectively, after one reflow cycle and their <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> after eight reflow cycles were about 2099 g and 2081 g, respectively.
