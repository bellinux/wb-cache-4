5000|$|Sialolithiasis (also termed <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi,</b> or salivary stones), is a {{condition}} where a calcified mass or sialolith forms within a salivary gland, usually in the duct of the submandibular gland (also termed [...] "Wharton's duct").

50|$|The submandibular gland {{accounts}} for 80% of all <b>salivary</b> duct <b>calculi</b> (<b>salivary</b> stones or sialolith), possibly {{due to the}} different nature of the saliva that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal opening for a considerable upward distance.|$|R
40|$|<b>Salivary</b> gland <b>calculi</b> {{account for}} the most common disease of salivary glands.

40|$|Abstract: Sialolithiasis is {{the most}} common disease of salivary glands. It is a {{condition}} characterized by the obstruction of a salivary gland or its excretory duct due to the formation of calcareous concretions, resulting in salivary ectasia and even determining the subsequent dilatation of the salivary gland. The sialolith usually measure from 1 mm to less than 10 mm. They rarely measure more than 15 mm. Infrequently giant <b>salivary</b> gland <b>calculi</b> (GSGC) > 15 mm {{have been reported in the}} literature. The submandibular gland and its duct appear to be the sites most susceptible to this disease. The aims of this article were: 1) report the cases of two patients suffering of sialolithiasis caused by giant <b>salivary</b> gland <b>calculi</b> occurring in the Wharton’s duct; and 2) present the results of the literature’s research on giant sialolith. The diagnostic approach of the two cases consisted of trans-occlusal endoral radiography, orthopantomography, CTscan. The patient’s glands were treated with conservative trans-oral surgical technique stone removal in both cases, performed under local anaesthesia. The glands recovered normal function quickly after removal of the stones.

40|$|Sialolithiasis is the {{formation}} of calculi or sialoliths in the salivary gland. It {{is the most common}} benign condition of the salivary gland. Sialolithiasis can occur in all salivary glands. The submandibular gland is most commonly affected followed by the parotid gland. Calculi commonly measure less than 10 mm. Calculi of more than 15 mm are termed giant <b>salivary</b> gland <b>calculi</b> and are infrequently reported in the literature.

40|$|Sialolithiasis is {{the most}} common salivary gland disease, occurs most {{commonly}} in middle aged patient. There is a slight male predominance. More than 80 % of <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> occur in the submandibular glands or its duct. It is estimated that sialolithiasis affect 12 of every 1000 patients in the adult population. It is believed that deposition of mineral salts around a nidus of bacteria, mucous, or desquamated cells develops a <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi.</b> The possible aetiological factors for <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> formation are salivary stagnation, increased alkalinity of the saliva, increased calcium content of the saliva, infection or inflammation, or physical trauma of the salivary duct or gland. The submandibular gland is most susceptible for sialolith formation because its saliva is more alkaline,has a higher mucus content,has a greater concentration of calcium and phosphate, has a longer and irregular duct, has antigravity flow.

50|$|Apart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial, {{can cause}} {{parotitis}} (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). These infections may cause blockage of the duct by <b>salivary</b> duct <b>calculi</b> or external compression.

40|$|Introduction Recurrent {{parotitis}} {{is frequently}} encountered in Otolaryngology practice. Parotid calculi, however is extremely uncommon {{as compared to}} submandibular calculi. Hence parotid duct calculi {{as a cause of}} recurrent parotitis need a special emphasis. Case Report We present here a rare case of recurrent parotitis due to parotid duct calculi in a 35 yr old female patient, who initially had presented to ENT OPD with recurrent pain and swelling for last eight months. Clinical examination was suggestive of calculi in the left parotid duct area which was confirmed by relevant radiological evaluation including USG, CT scan and parotid sialography. Patient was treated by superficial parotidectomy along with removal of the calculi from the parotid duct.   Discussion Calculi arising from the submandibular duct and gland are well established and quite easy to diagnose, but parotid calculi are quite unheard of in clinical practice. According to Western literature, parotid calculi account for 15 - 20 % of all <b>salivary</b> gland <b>calculi.</b>  We present here the case along with the relevant review of the literature...|$|R
30|$|The {{definitive}} {{cause of}} sialolithiasis is unknown, however, several theories have been proposed. Symptomatic <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> only cause problems {{when there is}} an obstruction of the ductal system [1]. Contributing factors include saliva stagnation, sialadenitis, and ductal inflammation or injury. Salivary calculus composition is mainly calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, often combined with small proportions of magnesium, zinc, ammonium salts, and organic materials or debris [2].|$|E
40|$|<b>Salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> are {{frequently}} {{formed in the}} submandibular duct. The most common sires are where the duct turns round the distal edge of the mylohyoid. where the duct crosses the lingual nerve, and just distal to the duct orifice. Untreated calculi can cause obstruction and glandular atrophy, and then may exfoliate through {{the floor of the}} mouth, An unusual case of cutaneous exfoliation of a salivary gland stone is presented. The importance of early diagnosis and treatment of sialolithiasis are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Radiographs {{can be used}} to {{diagnosis}} radiopaque stones. However, due to variable calcium content, not all <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> are radiopaque. Traditionally sialography using salivary duct {{dye injection}} and X-ray was utilized. Currently, CT scans are often the imaging modality of choice due to their increased sensitivity and resolution of anatomic relationships. One disadvantage of CT includes ionizing radiation which has been associated with increased risk of subsequent malignancy [5]. Magnetic resonance imaging has a limited role for this diagnosis in the ED due to the availability, cost and time.|$|E
40|$|Sialolithiasis is {{a common}} disease of the salivary glands and {{a major cause of}} salivary gland dysfunction. It {{commonly}} affects middle-aged and has male predominance.

40|$|Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of {{the head}} and neck are {{relatively}} rare tumors, consisting of approximately 10 - 15 % of all salivary gland neoplasms. ACC, a slow-growing aggressive malignant tumor of salivary gland commonly seen in the submandibular, sublingual, minor salivary glands is seldom found in the parotid. Calculus, the common cause of salivary gland dysfunction is usually identified in submandibular salivary gland because of its duct anatomy and physiochemical characteristic serous secretion. We report an unusual case of co-existent presentation of ACC with <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> in the parotid gland which is never been reported in the literature. Co-existence of ductal calculi and ACC is rare. Presence of parotid calculus could be due to long standing ductal obstruction by the slow-growing ACC of the parotid or other possibility is that the malignancy could have developed because of chronic irritation by parotid calculi.

A review has been made of the literature to establish current opinions in diagnosis and treatment of sialolithiasis. The role of ultrasonography, radiography and, in particular, of sialomagnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of salivary lithiasis has been evaluated. The greater efficiency of the {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} treatment for parotid, compared to submandibular calculi, has been demonstrated (57 % versus 33 %).

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: To {{identify}} {{the factors that}} affect outcome (stone clearance, partial clearance without symptoms, and residual stone with symptoms unchanged) of {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} (ESWL). To develop and validate a predictive model for outcome of treatment. Study Design: Prospective controlled trial. Methods: There were 142 <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> (78 submandibular, 64 parotid) entered into a prospective clinical trial of ESWL. The results were analyzed and a predictive model generated, which was validated using a second group of patients treated by the same technique. Results: ESWL achieved complete success (stone and symptom free) in 67 (47. 15 %) of cases (subman-dibular 28 / 78, 35. 9 %; parotid 39 / 64, 60. 9 %). Partial success (residual stone and symptom free) was obtained in a further 49 (34. 5 %) (submandibular 29 / 78, 37. 2 %; parotid 20 / 64, 31. 3 %). Failure occurred in 26 (18. 3 %) of cases (submandibular 21 / 78, 26. 9 %; pa-rotid 5 / 64, 7. 8 %). Conclusions: ESWL can eradicate salivary cal-culi but its effectiveness is dependant mainly on size of the stone. Using a regression analysis model stone clearance can be reliably predicted based on stone size. A less important factor is the radioden-sity of the stone, whereas a greater proportion of parotid calculi are eliminated by ESWL than sub-mandibular calculi...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifteen years, {{increasing}} public demand for minimally-invasive surgery and recent technological advances {{have led to the}} development of a number of conservative options for the therapeutic management of obstructive salivary disorders such as calculi and duct stenosis. These include extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, sialoendoscopy, laser intra-corporeal lithotripsy, interventional radiology, the video-assisted conservative surgical removal of parotid and sub-mandibular calculi and botulinum toxin therapy. Each of these techniques may be used as a single therapeutic modality or in combination with one or more of the above-mentioned options, usually in day case or one-day case under local or general anaesthesia. The multi-modal approach is completely successful in about 80 % of patients and reduces the need for gland removal in 3 %, thus justifying the combination of, albeit, time-consuming and relatively expensive techniques as part of the modern and functional management of <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi.</b> With regard to the management of salivary duct anomalies, such as strictures and kinkings, interventional radiology with fluoroscopically controlled balloon ductoplasty seems to be the most suitable technique despite the use of radiation. Operative sialoendoscopy alone is the best therapeutic option for all mobile intra-luminal causes of obstruction, such as microliths, mucous plugs or foreign bodies, or for the local treatment of inflammatory conditions such as recurrent chronic parotitis or autoimmune salivary disorders. Finally, in the case of failure of one of the above techniques and regardless of the cause of obstruction, botulinum toxin injection into the parenchyma of the salivary glands using colour Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring should be considered before deciding on surgical gland removal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the predictive value of sonographic fragmentation in the successful treatment of sialolithiasis. The main {{objective was to}} streamline the management by treating the patients with three sessions of ultrasonic lithotripsy, and to compare the success rate and complications with data from the literature. A second objective was to analyse the predictive value of data from the post procedure and follow-up sonography related to therapeutic success with regard to size, site and location of stones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up of 25 patients (mean age of 43 ± 17. 2 years old 11 - 68; 13 women, 10 men) {{over a period of}} 31 months (October 2009 -April 2012) with one or more <b>salivary</b> <b>calculi</b> (19 parotid, submandibular 6) treated with extracorporeal lithotripsy (electromagnetic MINILITH SL 1, Storz Medical, Switzerland). No anaesthesia or analgesia was used. Each session of lithotripsy lasted on average 30 min. Minor complications were collected on an anonymised sheet. RESULTS: Complete success (absence of clinical symptoms 3 months after the end of treatment (or the last session) and residual stones 2 mm) in 48 % and failure (persistence of same or increased symptoms at 3 months or no change in size of the calculi) in 17 % of patients. Sonographic fragmentation of the stone (p = 0. 004), total energy delivered (p = 0. 008) and the total number of shock waves (n = 0. 045) are predictive factors of complete success. Size, salivary topography, ductal topography, mobilization of the stones, occurrence of minor side effects and total duration of treatment had no predictive value of complete success (p > 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the first 5 and the last 20 patients (p = 0. 367). In agreement with the literature data, the efficacy of treatment was greater for parotid than submandibular calculi. CONCLUSION: Extracorporeal lithotripsy is an alternative to conventional surgery with no major complications. Sonographic fragmentation of calculi, total energy and total number of shock waves are predictive factors of successful treatment...|$|E
