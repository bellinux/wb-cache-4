5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled <b>Sexual</b> <b>Behavior</b> in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E

We used data from a multisite survey of emerging adults aged 18 to 29 studying at four universities in Hong Kong between September and December 2015. Structural equation modeling (SEM) {{was used to examine}} the pathways from childhood adversities to risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Participants who had higher childhood adversity scores reported more severe adult anxiety symptoms (Î²Â =Â  0. 20, pÂ =Â  0. 002); and adult anxiety symptoms were associated with significantly more risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> (Î²Â =Â  0. 46, pÂ  < Â  0. 0001). The model with adult anxiety symptoms as the mediator between childhood adversities and risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> showed good fit (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]Â =Â  0. 04, comparative fit index [CFI] Â =Â  0. 96, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI]Â =Â  0. 94 and standardized root mean square residual [SRMSR] Â =Â  0. 04). However, adult depressive symptoms failed to mediate between childhood adversities and risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> This study demonstrates the link between childhood adversities and risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> via adult anxiety but not adult depressive symptoms.

Results also suggest that, for young women, social media and sexting facilitate alternative intimate communication, without physical intimacy. As interactions in online settings become more common within intimate and committed relationships, attitudes toward conventional, unconventional, and riskier <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> may also become more positive. Thus, present findings are valuable for understanding technology’s role in young adult women’s <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R

5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior</b> and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{homosexual}} relationships {{responded to}} this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity that developed in Europe and the United States. Following World War II, {{during a period of}} social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second wave feminism and growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of lesbian broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior; sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or <b>sexual</b> <b>behavior,</b> due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.|$|E

40|$|Background: Risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among youth. Youth in military families may be especially at risk for engaging in risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> because they are exposed to factors that are unique to the military culture, such as multiple relocations and parental deployment. However, data on <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> among military-dependent youth are limited and few studies have examined how these factors influence the <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> among youth. Purpose: The purpose of this dissertation was to estimate the prevalence of risky <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> among military-dependent youth and to describe how military factors may influence their <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Methods: Youth, aged 15 – 19 years, who attended a military health facility in the southern United States between June 2011 and September 2011 were recruited to complete a short, paper-based survey (N= 208, males and females) and to participate in an in-depth interview (N = 25, females).

40|$|Objectives: Although ample {{research}} associates {{drug use}} and sexual risk-taking of {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), very little research attempts to understand MSM’s subjective meanings and overall intended functions of drug use during <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> This qualitative study explored (1) the relationship between substance use and <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> and (2) the perceived role of drug use in unsafe <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> among MSM. Method: This exploratory study utilized a maximum variation sampling strategy with respect to age, <b>sexual</b> identity, <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> occupation, and drug use to recruit a diverse group of MSM. In response to 17 open-ended semistructured interview items, participants described their drug use behaviors, affiliation with drug “scenes,” and drug use during sexual play. Analysis of audiotaped and transcribed interviews of participants’ accounts revealed common themes consistent across the participants’ experiences. Results: The research participants consisted of 27 MSM who were sexually active and used recreational substances within the last 3 months of their interview. Regardless of their sexual identity, participants believed in a widely held assumption that drug use is pervasive within the urban gay male community and highly characteristic of most gay men. Such an assumption stressed the intimate connection between {{drug use and}} the “gay lifestyle” that not only described, but also prescribed gay male <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Participants used drugs not only to initiate anonymous or casual MSM sexual encounters, but also to incorporate recreational substance use as part of the sexual act as a means to accomplish specific desired effects. Despite the importance of recreational substance use during their MSM <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors,</b> many participants were skeptical of the persistent expectation that drug use necessarily “causes” unsafe sex. Instead, participants attributed unsafe <b>sexual</b> <b>behaviors</b> to an individual’s personal choice, maturity, or experience with MSM.
