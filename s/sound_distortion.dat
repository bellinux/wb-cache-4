5|$|The player's {{character}} gradually loses sanity when {{he looks}} directly at upsetting aspects of the game world. The character's mental degradation can lead him to hearing hallucinations and visions, which manifest as graphical anomalies and <b>sound</b> <b>distortion,</b> and changes in control sensitivity.

40|$|We {{present a}} new error {{concealment}} technique for audio transmission over packet networks with high packet loss rate. Unlike other techniques it modifies the time-scale of correctly received packets instead of repeating them. This {{is done by}} a time-domain algorithm, WSOLA, whose parameters are redefined so that short audio segments like lost packets can be extended. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the additional delay introduced by the new technique. For subjective hearing tests, single and double packet loss is simulated at high packet loss rates, and the new technique is compared to previous proposals by category judgment and component judgment of sound quality. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) curves show that <b>sound</b> <b>distortions</b> due to packet repetition can be reduced. 1 INTRODUCTION In a packet network which is not designed for real-time applications, such as the Internet, audio-packets may be lost due to either congestion or excessive delay.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{treatment}} Overt self-correction of incorrect speech production reflects {{an awareness of}} manifested speech errors. The outcome of production can be monitored by means of response-produced feedback of tactile-kinesthetic and auditory stimuli. However, self-correction may also occur before speech is executed. During speech motor planning the speaker can centrally monitor the efference (reference) copy of the planned utterance through internal feedback. For accurate production of the speech sound, comparison with an internal model of the motor plan in the sensorimotor memory may take place. Internal feedback may perform an error-correction function before speech is produced (Van der Merwe, 1997). The focus {{of this study is}} on self-correction of speech errors in the apraxic speaker. Speech errors such as <b>sound</b> substitutions, <b>sound</b> <b>distortions,</b> distorted substitutions, slow speech rate and start-restart behavior are characteristic of apraxia of speech (AOS) (Duffy, 2005; McNeil, Robin & Schmidt, 1997).

50|$|Often a palatal {{obturator}} is {{used because}} a palatal fistula can affect development and proper articulation. As fistula sizes vary, small fistulae tend {{to result in}} little to no speech alterations whereas large fistulae tend to result in audible nasal emissions and weak pressure with and/or without hypernasality. Misarticulations, abnormal nasal resonance and nasal escape or air often results from the problem. Fistulae may decrease intraoral air pressure during production of oral pressure consonants causing <b>distortion</b> of <b>sounds</b> as well as increase in nasal airflow. It is common for an individual with a fistula to compensate for a loss of pressure during speech sound production by attempting to regulate intraoral air pressure with increasing respiration effort and using compensatory articulation. Middorsum palatal stops (atypical place of articulation) often results from palatal fistulae causing <b>sound</b> <b>distortions</b> during speech. Occlusion for the fistula is attempted by speakers with deviant tongue placements during these palatal stops.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Navy's Integrated Underwater Surveillance System (IUSS) monitors hydrophones {{in the northeast}} Pacific.

The current means of identifying and correlating sounds is a laborious visual examination of the data on a graphics workstation.

Also presented in this thesis is a blackboard architecture for correlating sound 'shapes' between hydrophones using a time-shift transform. The methods in this thesis properly identify approximately 90 % of apparent whale moans and 100 % of seismic events.
