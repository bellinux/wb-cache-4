6000|$|... § 22. I {{have also}} been more and more convinced, the more I think of it, that in general pride {{is at the bottom}} of all great mistakes. All the other passions do {{occasional}} good, but whenever pride puts in its word, everything goes wrong, and what it might really be desirable to do, quietly and innocently, it is mortally dangerous to do, proudly. Thus, while it is very often good for the artist to make studies of things, for the sake of knowing their forms, with their high lights all white, the moment he does this in a haughty way, and thinks himself drawing in the great style, because he leaves high lights white, it is all over with him; and half the degradation of art in modern times has been owing to endeavors, much fostered by the metaphysical Germans, to see things without color, as if color were a vulgar thing, the result being, in most <b>students,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> end by not being able to see anything at all; whereas the true and perfect way of studying any object is simply to look what its color is in high light, and put that safely down, if possible; or, if you are making a chiaroscuro study, to take the grey answering to that color, and cover the whole object at once with that grey, firmly resolving that no part of it shall be brighter than that; then look for the darkest part of it, and if, as is probable, its darkest part be still a great deal lighter than black, or than other things about it, assume a given shade, as dark as, with due reference to other things, you can have it, but no darker. Mark that for your extreme dark on the object, and between those limits get as much drawing as you can, by subtlety of gradation. That will tax your powers of drawing indeed; and you will find this, which seems a childish and simple way of going to work, requires verily a thousandfold more power to carry out than all the pseudo-scientific abstractions that ever were invented.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of the environmental education of elementary school students in Da Nang city, Vietnam. In January 2014, the study surveyed 247 students in two elementary schools. An evaluation of the students' knowledge of solid waste management was conducted. Students had basic knowledge about the environment, but their knowledge was limited with regard to solid waste management. In February 2015, an environmental education workshop was conducted for the students. The result showed that 96 % of the students were interested in solid waste management activities. In addition, the study found that there were changes in the students' knowledge before and after environmental education activities. Before the activity 29 % of the <b>students</b> said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew about eco-bags, and 55 % of the <b>students</b> said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew “that plastic bags are difficult to decompose naturally. ” After environmental education 87 % of the <b>students</b> answered <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew about eco-bags, and 71 % of the <b>students</b> said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew “that plastic bags are difficult to decompose naturally. ” Given these results, this study was successful in increasing students' knowledge about solid waste management...|$|R
