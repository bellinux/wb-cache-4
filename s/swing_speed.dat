50|$|Advanced {{balls are}} made of {{multiple}} layers (three or more), with a soft cover and firm core. They induce a greater amount of spin from lofted shots (wedges especially), {{as well as a}} sensation of softness in the hands in short-range shots. However, these balls require a much greater <b>swing</b> <b>speed</b> that only the physically strong players could carry out to compress at impact. If the compression of a golf ball does not match a golfer's <b>swing</b> <b>speed,</b> either the lack of compression or over-compression will occur, resulting in loss of distance. There are also many brands and colors to choose from, with colored balls and better brands generally being more expensive, making an individual's choice more difficult.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of golf balls on the market, and {{customers}} often face a difficult decision. Golf balls are divided into two categories: recreational and advanced balls. Recreational balls are oriented toward the ordinary golfer, who generally have low <b>swing</b> <b>speeds</b> (80 mph or lower) and lose golf balls on the course easily. These balls are made of two layers, with the cover firmer than the core. Their low compression and side spin reduction characteristics suit the lower <b>swing</b> <b>speeds</b> of average golfers quite well. Furthermore, they generally have lower prices than the advanced balls, lessening the financial impact of losing a ball to a hazard or out of bounds.|$|R
50|$|Shaft flex {{has a very}} {{pronounced}} effect on the power and accuracy of a wood. Every wood {{is somewhere in between}} the two extremes of flex, from the extra whippy, to the extra stiff. Whippy shafts are used by those who have low <b>swing</b> <b>speeds</b> and stiff by those who have faster <b>swing</b> <b>speeds.</b> The flex of a shaft allows it to store energy from a player's downswing, and release it as the head makes contact for increased club speed at impact. A shaft that is too stiff cannot be flexed by the golfer during their downswing, which reduces club speed at impact. A shaft that is too whippy will retain some of its stored flex at contact, wasting energy.|$|R

The effect of hit angle, barrel surface friction, bat circumferential moment of inertia, barrel diameter and ball inertia were observed using four different bat constructions and two different ball types. Ball spin increased with hit angle and bat speed, and decreased with ball inertia.

5000|$|As a result, {{some players}} who had {{upgraded}} to these newer de-lofted iron sets began carrying the pitching wedge {{of an older}} set, lofted around 50-52°, to [...] "fill the gap". This additional wedge, with a full swing, falls between the average distances of a sand and pitching wedge, allowing the player to fine-tune their approach shot's distance without needing excessive variations in <b>swing</b> <b>speed.</b> Clubmakers, sensing an opportunity, began to offer a purpose-built wedge in this general loft range starting {{in the early to}} middle 1990s. These have become known colloquially as [...] "gap wedges" [...] due to their origin, despite various proprietary names applied to wedges in this class by their manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{size and}} design of each face: The D2 {{actually}} has a smaller face than the D3. The D2 chose to stretch its volume back and pull its mass away from the face. This leads to a shallow face which produces less compression, putting more spin on the ball. The D3 moved its volume toward the front and has a more circular face than the D2. This allows for the club to produce more compression and therefore less spin. However, due to the difference in compression, the D2 can be launched higher with ease, which could benefit amateur golfers more. The D3 tends to require better players, who can produce more <b>swing</b> <b>speed,</b> to launch the ball at the right height. The D2 also has a slight draw bias while the D3 does not.|$|E
5000|$|The typical loft for woods {{ranges from}} 7.5 to 31 degrees. Driver lofts {{generally}} center around 10.5° but the desired loft is very {{dependent upon the}} player's <b>swing</b> <b>speed</b> (low swing speeds need higher lofts); men's lofts vary between 8 and 11 degrees while women's drivers are between 10 and 13 degrees, and seniors' lofts trend toward the upper range by gender. The average 3-wood has a 13-16 degree loft (typically 15°) and the average 5-wood has an 18-21 degree loft. Higher lofts than that overlap with irons in distance, but many players prefer high-number woods to low-number irons wherever {{they can be used}} as the wood is easier to hit than a [...] "long iron". The loft of any given club number varies between manufacturers, model lines, and the target player.|$|E

The player can supplement {{the gaps in}} distance with either higher-numbered woods such as the 5 and even the 7-wood, or may replace the long irons with equivalently-numbered hybrid clubs. If hybrids are used, higher-lofted woods are often omitted as redundant, but ladies' and seniors' sets commonly feature both hybrids and high-lofted woods, omitting the long irons entirely {{in favor of the}} lofted woods, and replacing the mid-irons (5-7) with hybrids. The combination allows for higher launch angles on the long-distance clubs, which gives better distance with slower <b>swing</b> <b>speeds.</b> Where a club is omitted and not replaced with a club of similar function, players may add additional clubs of a different function such as additional wedges.|$|R

Comprehensive theoretical analyses and simulation results followed by experimental investigations into the feasibility of using the FSR for detecting micro-Doppler signatures are presented in this paper.

50|$|Stiffness is {{much less}} complex {{than the other two}} topics. This is {{directly}} and solely tied to your <b>swing</b> <b>speed.</b> The faster the swing, the stiffer the shaft. This is because the faster you swing, the more the club will bend; if the club bends too much, it will whip through impact and the face will be square for a very short time. Stiffer shafts don't flex as much and keep the face squarer through contact. The other side is less stiff shafts will produce a higher ball speed off the face. So the goal is to get the most flexible shaft that fits your swing, but stiff enough so it doesn't hurt your control. This is why it is important that you make sure you are swinging the right shafts for you. Possible options are junior, women, senior, regular, stiff, and xstiff.|$|E
5000|$|The modern {{pitching}} wedge {{is typically}} used from the fairway or rough for [...] "approach" [...] or [...] "lay-up" [...] shots requiring {{a distance of}} between 100 and 125 yards (exact distance will vary, as with any golf club's distance, {{on a number of}} variables such as exact club design, player skill and <b>swing</b> <b>speed,</b> and course conditions).

50|$|Holcombe Ward and Dwight Davis {{introduced}} the kick/American twist {{serve in the}} late 1800s. The kick (or topspin) serve is generated by tossing the ball over the head, then hitting it laterally on the server's non-dominant side brushing upward toward the dominant side. When hit correctly, the ball clears the net in a high arc with heavy topspin, causing the ball to dive into the service box. Upon hitting {{the surface of the}} court, the ball may bounce high directly toward the receiver for a kick serve, or to the left for the receiver for an American twist serve. The physics of the spinning ball in flight involves the Magnus effect because the spinning ball creates a whirlpool of air around itself. The twist serve is a more extreme version of the kick serve, which involves more brushing of the ball from the 7-8 o'clock position to the 1-2 o'clock position, and faster <b>swing</b> <b>speeds.</b> If performed exceptionally, it can completely change the direction of the ball movement away from the other player, although this requires a very strong and flexible back.|$|R
5000|$|Being a {{new class}} of club, there is no {{generally}} accepted principle governing design. So while a [...] "true" [...] hybrid is as described above, many manufacturers cut production costs by marketing irons as hybrids by adding one or more features {{to make it look like}} a hybrid. Some have a club face that looks very similar to an iron, but instead of the cavity-back or muscle-back design these clubs have a slightly bulging back to appear more wood-like in shape. These [...] "iron replacements" [...] swing and perform almost exactly like irons, except the difference in the added weight which slows clubhead speed but increases force applied at a given club <b>speed,</b> allowing a <b>swing</b> to cut through turf or sand with more momentum remaining at contact. These clubs are preferred by players with slower <b>swing</b> <b>speeds.</b> Other club manufacturers produce [...] "true" [...] hybrids as previously described. The first equipment manufacturer to produce a full set of these true hybrids, in both left and right hand, was Thomas Golf. Hybrids are now also available in traditional (teardrop) and square head shapes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{player with}} a stronger-than-average swing (>100 mph at impact) will {{typically}} want a stiff-flex shaft {{and a lower}} loft, around 9.5°, which will respond better to the faster swing tempo and will launch the ball lower so the energy is spent sending the ball outward instead of keeping it in the air. The same player might also benefit from a [...] "Tour driver", which has a 1-2° offset to [...] "open" [...] the clubface (angle {{it away from the}} player), and a higher, further-rearward centre of mass. These changes can correct certain problems with a strong swing, such as torquing in the clubhead [...] "closing" [...] it at impact causing draws, and the normally low and forward centre of gravity causing excessive backspin which can make drives [...] "balloon"; the shot will start low but curve upwards in flight, then [...] "stall" [...] and drop onto the turf, reducing total distance. Most stiff driver shafts are marked usually X-Stiff or even more. These are commonly professional-level stiffnesses due the rarity of amateur players capable of hitting <b>swing</b> <b>speeds</b> over 110 mph, although these also occur sometimes.|$|R
5000|$|Hitters {{have a wide}} {{variation}} of swings, {{but in the end}} staying balanced and having stable posture is {{the most important aspect of}} hitting a baseball. If the hitter becomes unbalanced throughout the swing the chance of making solid contact with the baseball is very slim. Once balanced throughout the swing, bat speed comes into the next most important aspect of the baseball swing. The faster the bat speed, the faster the ball will come off the bat. [...] Furthermore, researchers have long established that home run hits are dependant on <b>swing</b> <b>speed.</b> Most notably, one can logically assume that a faster swing will result in the ball traveling farther. A 3-6% increase in bat speed can significantly affect the distance a ball travels after contact in competition (7). [...] In terms of simple physics and mathematics, the conservation of momentum (E1) and a kinematic equation (E2) also reinforces this idea.|$|E

Now the player is only limited to the space around them in order to swing properly; if there is no object a web can attach to, the player will be unable to web swing and fall. Additionally, the method of web-swinging has also been changed. Players playing on console systems will now web swing using the left and right triggers of the controllers. The left and right triggers take control of Spider-Man's left and right hands, respectively (example, if a building appears on the left, the player is better suited to use the left trigger and if one appears on the right, the player would be better suited to use the right trigger to swing.) Both triggers can be held at the same time which allows players to boost Spider-Man´s <b>swing</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While 14 clubs is a maximum, {{it is not}} a minimum; {{players are}} free to use any lesser number of clubs they think will be useful, so substitutions for the common {{omissions}} above are not always made; a player may simply choose to play without a 5-wood or 2-4 irons, instead using a 4-wood and moving directly to their 5-iron as desired distance decreases (a 4-wood in a skilled golfer's hands averages 200 yards; a 5-iron in the same player's hands would be about 160, which is a large gap but not unplayable). Other clubs may be omitted as well. On courses where bags must be carried by the player, the player may take only the odd-numbered irons; without the 4, 6 or 8 irons (the 3 is sometimes removed instead of the 4) the bag's weight is considerably reduced. Carrying only a driver, 3-wood, 4-hybrid, 5-7-9 irons, pitching and sand wedges, and a putter reduces the number of clubs in the bag to 9; this is a common load-out for a [...] "Sunday bag" [...] taken to the driving range or to an informal game. A skilled player can usually overcome the lesser selection of club lofts by reducing their <b>swing</b> <b>speed</b> on a lower-loft iron and/or placing the ball further forward in their stance to get the same carry distance and/or launch angle as the next higher loft number.|$|E
5000|$|Hybrids are a {{cross between}} a wood and an iron, giving these clubs the wood's long {{distance}} and higher launch, with the iron's familiar swing. The club head of a hybrid has a wood-inspired, slightly convex face, and is typically hollow like modern metal woods to allow for high impulse on impact and faster <b>swing</b> <b>speeds.</b> The head is usually smaller than true woods, however, not extending as far back from the face, and the lie and shaft length are similar to an iron giving similar swing mechanics. These clubs generally replace low-numbered irons in a men's set (between 2 and 5, most commonly 3-4), which are typically the hardest clubs in a player's bag to hit well. By doing so they also generally make higher-lofted woods redundant as well. However, some manufacturers produce [...] "iron replacement" [...] sets that use hybrid designs to replace an entire set of traditional irons, from 3 to pitching wedge. Ladies' and seniors' sets commonly feature a combination of high-lofted woods (up to 7w) and hybrids to replace the 5, 6 and 7-irons, allowing these players to get greater carry distances with slower swings.|$|R

Body weight was compared using unpaired t-tests. Knee joints were histologically evaluated using species-specific criteria; indices were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons. A generalized linear model followed by Tukey’s posttests juxtaposed gait parameters; walking speed was a covariate for other outcome measures. Body weight was not different between strains; OA-prone animals demonstrated more progressive chondropathy. At baseline, OA-prone animals had slower walking speeds, narrower hind limb bases of support, shorter stride lengths, and slower limb <b>swing</b> <b>speeds</b> relative to OA-resistant animals. These differences were not detected 4 or 24 hours after treatment. By 72 hours, OA-prone animals had returned to baseline values.

5000|$|Shafts are {{quantified}} in {{a number}} of different ways. The most common is the shaft flex. Simply, the shaft flex is the amount that the shaft will bend when placed under a load. A stiffer shaft will not flex as much, which requires more power to bend and [...] "whip" [...] through the ball properly (which results in higher club speed at impact for more distance), while a more flexible shaft will whip with less power required for better distance on slower swings, but may torque and over-flex if swung with too much power causing the head not to be square, resulting in lower accuracy. Most shaft makers offer a variety of flexes. The most common are: L (Lady), A (Soft Regular, Intermediate or Senior), R (Regular), S (Stiff), and X (Tour Stiff, Extra Stiff or Strong). A regular flex shaft is generally appropriate for those with an average head speed (80-94 mph), while an A-Flex (or senior shaft) is for players with a slower <b>swing</b> <b>speed</b> (70-79 mph), and the stiffer shafts, such as S-Flex and X-Flex (Stiff and Extra-Stiff shafts) are reserved only for those players with an above average swinging speed, usually above 100 mi/h km/h. Some companies also offer a [...] "stiff-regular" [...] or [...] "firm" [...] flex for players whose club speed falls in the upper range of a Regular shaft (90-100 mph), allowing golfers and clubmakers to fine-tune the flex for a stronger amateur-level player.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{early years}} of sport {{psychology}} included isolated studies of motor behavior, social facilitation, and habit formation. During the 1890s, E. W.

Despite Scripture's previous experiments, the first recognized sports psychology study {{was carried out by}} an American psychologist Norman Triplett, in 1898. The work of Norman Triplett demonstrated that bicyclists were more likely to cycle faster with a pacemaker or a competitor, which has been foundational in the literature of social psychology and social facilitation. He wrote about his findings in what was regarded as the first scientific paper on sports psychology, titled “The Dynamogenic Factors in Pacemaking and Competition”, which was published in 1898, in the American Journal of Psychology. Research by ornithologists Lashley and Watson on the learning curve for novice archers provided a robust template for future habit formation research, as they argued that humans would have higher levels of motivation to achieve in a task like archery compared to a mundane task. Researchers Albert Johanson and Joseph Holmes tested baseball player Babe Ruth in 1921, as reported by sportswriter Hugh S. Fullerton. Ruth's <b>swing</b> <b>speed,</b> his breathing right before hitting a baseball, his coordination and rapidity of wrist movement, and his reaction time were all measured, with the researchers concluding that Ruth's talent could be attributed in part to motor skills and reflexes that were well above those of the average person.|$|E

2500|$|Calculating a {{handicap}} is often complicated, the general reason being that golf courses are not uniformly challenging from course to course or between skill levels. A player scoring even par on Course A might average four over par on course B, while a player averaging 20 over par on course A might average only 16 over on course B. So, to the [...] "scratch golfer", Course B is more difficult, {{but to the}} [...] "bogey golfer", Course A is more difficult. The reasons for this are inherent {{in the types of}} challenges presented by the same course to both golfers. Distance is often a problem for amateur [...] "bogey" [...] golfers with slower <b>swing</b> <b>speeds,</b> who get less distance with each club, and so typically require more shots to get to the green, raising their score compared to a scratch golfer with a stronger swing. However, courses are often designed with hazard placement to mitigate this advantage, forcing the scratch player to [...] "lay up" [...] to avoid bunkers or water, while the bogey golfer is more or less unaffected as the hazard lies out of their range. Finally, terrain features and fairway maintenance can affect golfers of all skill levels; narrowing the fairway by adding obstacles or widening the rough on each side will typically increase the percentage of shots made from disadvantageous lies, increasing the challenge for all players.|$|R
5000|$|These customizations are {{typically}} grouped in certain common configurations.
