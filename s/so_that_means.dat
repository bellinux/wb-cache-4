So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was much}} {{controversy}} to Dan being revealed as Gossip Girl {{in the season}} finale. Dan had always struggled to be an insider among the Upper East Side and had supposedly created Gossip Girl to gain more power and {{had been the one}} “pulling the strings the whole time” as mentioned by Serena in the finale. However, there was much speculation and controversy regarding this decision. Penn Badgley who played Dan, stated {{in an interview that he}} himself found it funny that they had decided to make him be Gossip Girl as there were too many loopholes in the show for this to make sense. There were times during the show where he would be alone and read a Gossip Girl post and be completely blown away by it. In the interview he stated, “All those times that he was alone, that was him acting. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> he was completely schizophrenic and transgender." ...|$|E

A party of the crowd coming up that way, just as they entered, John had double-locked the door again, and made off for the soldiers, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>means</b> of retreat was cut off from under them.|$|E

Since this problem is strongly NP-hard, dierent constructive and iterative heuristic algorithms are developed and discussed.
