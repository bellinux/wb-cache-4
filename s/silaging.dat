The concentration of ammonia-N was found lower (P< 0. 04) in S 2 and S 3 <b>silages</b> in comparison with the rest of <b>silages.</b> Clostridia spore count was significantly reduced (P< 0. 001) in all additive treated <b>silages</b> in comparison with the control <b>silage.</b> The DM losses in control <b>silages</b> were found to be higher (P< 0. 001) during the whole storage time in contrast with treated <b>silages.</b> No differences in aerobic stability were found between additive treated and control <b>silages.</b> There were no statistical differences between gross energy of all <b>silages</b> and gross energy of fresh forage in both after fermentation and after the stability test. Energy losses expressed in % of initial energy concentration in the silo showed no significant variations among both <b>silages,</b> after fermentation (P= 0. 5) and after the stability test (P= 0. 2). The improved the <b>silage</b> fermentation by the application of <b>silage</b> additives was reflected in reduced DM losses. However, the improvement in <b>silage</b> fermentation had no effect on energy losses formation in <b>silages...</b>|$|R
40|$|LCA of <b>Silage</b> – {{comparison}} of Tower silo, Bunker silo and Round-bales The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the differences in environmental impact from three types of <b>silage</b> (<b>silage</b> from tower silo, bunker silo and round-bales) used in Swedish dairy production. The <b>silage</b> was studied from ley cultivation, via harvesting and <b>silage</b> making up to and including delivery at the feeding table. The environmental impact categories studied were: energy use, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP). The results showed only small differences between the studied <b>silage</b> alternatives, with round-bale <b>silage</b> as the most energy efficient and tower <b>silage</b> as the least contributing to GWP, AP and EP. Ley cultivation was the dominant source to GWP, AP and EP for all alternatives. For energy use, the subsequent <b>silage</b> handling chain was more important, including a surprisingly high energy use for producing <b>silage</b> agents. A sensitivity analysis indicated that losses can have a large impact on the environmental outcome of <b>silage</b> production, and that the systems therefore should be optimized to reduce losses...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the relationship between the}} dry matter level or physical form of forage and the quality of <b>silage.</b> One experiment was carried out to find the effect of the dry matter content of forage on the quality of resultant <b>silage.</b> Namely, green oats, of which dry matter was adjusted to five levels (15 ％, 24 ％, 33 ％, 410 ％ and 61 ％) by means of wilting or adding of water, were stored in the experimental silos, respectively. Each silo was opened after 158 days and the fermentative quality and the dry matter loss of <b>silages</b> produced were estimated. And the other experiment was carried out to confirm the relationship between the form of forage and the quality of <b>silage.</b> In this experiment, Italian ryegrass, of which a part was chopped at the length of 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm and the rest. was lacerated and bruised after chopped at 2 cm length, were stored in laboratory miniature-sealed silos, respectively, and then each silo was sealed completely. Of resulant <b>silage,</b> fermentative quality and carotene content were estimated. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) The score by Flieg's appraisal method of the <b>silages</b> was 15 in the <b>silage</b> of 15 ％ dry matter, 58 in the <b>silage</b> of 24 ％ dry matter, 70 in the <b>silage</b> of 33 ％ dry matter and 95 in both <b>silages</b> of 41 ％ and 61 ％ dry matter. And a positive significant correlation, r = + 0. 880 (p< 0. 05), was found between the dry matter level of forage and score by Flieg's appraisal method of <b>silage.</b> 2) The invisible loss of dry matter during storage was more in a low dry matter <b>silage</b> than in a high dry matter <b>silage</b> and the dry matter loss by top spoilage of <b>silage</b> was more in a high dry matter <b>silage</b> than in a low dry matter <b>silage.</b> Therefore, no significant difference of the conservation ratios of edible dry matter between <b>silages</b> was found. 3) The fermentative quality of <b>silages</b> made from fine-chopped grass (1 - 2 cm) was better than that of <b>silages</b> made from rough-chopped grass(5 - 10 cm), and the preserved carotene in the <b>silage</b> was increased by chopping grass. 4) The <b>silages</b> made from lacerated and bruised grass were superior in quality to the chopped <b>silage,</b> and contained the carotene of high level, when compared with the chopped <b>silages.</b> These data suggest that the quality of the <b>silage</b> in affected remarkably by dry matter level and physical form of forage...|$|R
40|$|Whole-plant corn <b>silages</b> {{were treated}} with Ecosyl® or Foraform® in one trial and Biomate® or Biomate + Cold-flo® in the second trial. In both trials, the <b>silages</b> were well preserved, but all were highly {{unstable}} in air during the first 3 to 4 weeks of the feed-out period. Foraform-treated <b>silage</b> was 2 to 6 degrees F cooler than its control, but Cold-flo-treated <b>silage</b> was 2 to 8 degrees F warmer during the first 10 days post-filling. Laboratory silo results showed that both control <b>silages</b> fermented extremely fast; however, inoculated <b>silages</b> had slightly lower pH and higher lactic acid values through the first 4 to 7 days postfilling. Foraform lowered the initial pH of the ensiled material, restricted subsequent fermentation, and produced a <b>silage</b> with about one-half the acid content compared to its control. Cold-flo raised the initial pH and delayed the start of fermentation, but resulted in a <b>silage</b> with greater acid content and an increased dry matter loss. Though not significant, calves fed Ecosyl, Foraform, and Biomate <b>silages</b> had about 6 percent better feed conversion than those fed control <b>silages</b> and gain per ton of crop ensiled was also higher for the three treated <b>silages.</b> Cold-flo-treated <b>silage</b> produced 3. 5 lb less gain per ton of crop ensiled than its control. Whole-plant forage sorghums {{were treated with}} TriLac® in one trial and Silagest® in the second trial. Inoculated <b>silages</b> had slightly lower ensiling temperatures than controls. All <b>silages</b> fermented rapidly, but both inoculants increased ensiling efficiency as indicated by higher lactic to acetic acid ratios (in laboratory silos) and decreased dry matter losses (in farm-scale silos). Calves fed Silagest <b>silage</b> outperformed those fed control <b>silages,</b> and both inoculants increased gain per ton of crop ensiled over control <b>silages...</b>|$|R
