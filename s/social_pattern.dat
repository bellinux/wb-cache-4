25|$|Count Leo Tolstoi is {{a classic}} example of an {{individual}} in potential and actual conflict with his group. He was talented and had immense vitality. Until young manhood he accepted his place in the Tsarist <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> and generally conformed to it. After some drastic experiences and much soul searching, Leo Tolstoi challenged the social system under which he lived to mortal combat. From that point until the day he left home and died in a railway station in his final attempt to win out against group pressures, his life consisted of combats with members of his family, with members of the neighboring nobility, with the army, with the Tsarist autocracy and with the established church.|$|E
500|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{described}} as solitary but social, foraging alone at night, but frequently sleeping in groups during the day. [...] This <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> varies by gender, season, and location. [...] Females tend to share nests with other females and their offspring, whereas males tend to sleep alone or in pairs outside of the breeding season. [...] Groups of females sharing a nest can be relatively stable, consisting of two to nine individuals, although a male may be found {{with a group of}} females outside the breeding season. [...] During the breeding season (September through October), males and females may sleep in the same tree hole. [...] Mixed sex groups can be common at this time, with single males sharing nest sites with three to seven females or single females sharing nest sites with one to three males.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} ten, he {{was sent}} off to {{boarding}} school, as was common for boys of his social status. Bowlby’s parents decided to send both him {{and his older brother}} Tony off to the preparatory boarding school in order to protect them from the bombing attacks due to the ongoing war. In his 1973 work Separation: Anxiety and Anger, he revealed that he regarded it as a terrible time for him. He later said, [...] "I wouldn't send a dog away to boarding school at age seven". However, earlier Bowlby had considered boarding schools appropriate for children aged eight and older. In 1951, he wrote: If the child is maladjusted, it may be useful for him to be away for part of the year from the tensions which produced his difficulties, and if the home is bad in other ways the same is true. The boarding school has the advantage of preserving the child's all-important home ties, even if in slightly attenuated form, and, since it forms part of the ordinary <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> of most Western communities today , the child who goes to boarding-school will not feel different from other children. Moreover, by relieving the parents of the children for part of the year, it will be possible for some of them to develop more favorable attitudes toward their children during the remainder.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{principles}} of the Bahá'í Faith that comes about from the unity of humanity is {{the elimination of all}} forms of prejudice, and it entails non-discrimination against individuals on such things like race, religion, gender or class. `Abdu'l-Bahá states that while the challenge is large, social prejudices including religious, political, and patriotic lead to war, and thus the elimination of prejudice was essential for human well-being. In that regard, the Bahá'í teachings state that the elimination of all forms of prejudice is a fundamental requirement to achieve world unity and peace. Two prime examples of this in action exist - one comes from the American South, and the other from South Africa. Arriving {{in the face of the}} rise of Jim Crow laws and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as a broad-based national movement and in contrast to Protestant, Catholic and Jewish organizations in South Carolina, the Bahá’ís explicitly promoted racial integration from the local level up. Called by the scriptures of their faith to “associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance,” they deliberately sought converts from diverse backgrounds, forging bonds of shared religious identity across traditional social boundaries even when their meetings were raided. By the end of the twentieth century, the Bahá’í Faith was the largest non-Christian religion in South Carolina, and it was well known for its longstanding commitment to promoting racial harmony, interfaith dialogue, and the moral education of children and youth. In South Africa, faced with the segregated <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> and laws of Apartheid, the integrated population of Bahá'ís had to decide how to be composed in their administrative structures [...] whether the National Spiritual Assembly would be all black or all white. The Bahá'í community decided that instead of dividing the South African Bahá'í community into two population groups, one black and one white, they instead limited membership in the Bahá'í administration to black adherents, and placed the entire Bahá'í community under the leadership of its black population. In 1997 the National Spiritual Assembly presented a Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa which said in part: ...|$|E

40|$|Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) {{architectures}} {{are gaining}} popularity over traditional ones for building open, distributed, and evolving software.

50|$|Another theme {{analyzed}} using the Metaphysics of Quality is {{the interaction between}} intellectual and <b>social</b> <b>patterns.</b> Pirsig states that {{until the end of}} the Victorian era, <b>social</b> <b>patterns</b> dominated the conduct of members of the American culture.

50|$|Robert K. Merton made {{important}} refinements to functionalist thought. He fundamentally {{agreed with}} Parsons' theory. However, {{he acknowledged that}} it was problematic, believing that it was over generalized 2005:100. Merton tended to emphasize middle range theory rather than a grand theory, meaning {{that he was able}} to deal specifically with some of the limitations in Parsons' theory. Merton believed that any social structure probably has many functions, some more obvious than others. He identified 3 main limitations: functional unity, universal functionalism and indispensability in Gingrich, 1999. He also developed the concept of deviance and made the distinction between manifest and latent functions. Manifest functions referred to the recognized and intended consequences of any <b>social</b> <b>pattern.</b> Latent functions referred to unrecognized and unintended consequences of any <b>social</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Merton criticized {{functional}} unity, {{saying that}} not all parts of a modern complex society work for the functional unity of society. Consequently, there is a social dysfunction referred to as any <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> that may disrupt the operation of society. Some institutions and structures may have other functions, and some may even be generally dysfunctional, or be functional for some while being dysfunctional for others. This is because not all structures are functional for society as a whole. Some practices are only functional for a dominant individual or a group 2005:91. There {{are two types of}} functions that Merton discusses the [...] "manifest functions" [...] in that a <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> can trigger a recognized and intended consequence. The manifest function of education includes preparing for a career by getting good grades, graduation and finding good job. The second type of function is [...] "latent functions", where a <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> results in an unrecognized or unintended consequence. The latent functions of education include meeting new people, extra-curricular activities, school trips. Another type of social function is [...] "social dysfunction" [...] which is any undesirable consequences that disrupts the operation of society. The social dysfunction of education includes not getting good grades, a job. Merton states that by recognizing and examining the dysfunctional aspects of society we can explain the development and persistence of alternatives. Thus, as Holmwood states, [...] "Merton explicitly made power and conflict central issues for research within a functionalist paradigm" [...] 2005:91.|$|E

40|$|Detecting {{communities}} {{has long}} been popular in the research on networks. It is usually modeled as an unsupervised clustering problem on graphs, based on heuristic assumptions about community characteristics, such as edge density and node homogeneity. In this work, we doubt the universality of these widely adopted assumptions and compare human labeled communities with machine predicted ones obtained via various mainstream algorithms. Based on supportive results, we argue that communities are defined by various <b>social</b> <b>patterns</b> and unsupervised learning based on heuristics is incapable of capturing all of them. Therefore, we propose to inject supervision into community detection through Community Oriented Network Embedding (CONE), which leverages limited ground-truth communities as examples to learn an embedding model aware of the <b>social</b> <b>patterns</b> underlying them. Specifically, a deep architecture is developed by combining recurrent neural networks with random-walks on graphs towards capturing <b>social</b> <b>patterns</b> directed by ground-truth communities. Generic clustering algorithms on the embeddings of other nodes produced by the learned model then effectively reveals more communities that share similar <b>social</b> <b>patterns</b> with the ground-truth ones.

5000|$|Carol R. Ember {{was born}} on 13 May 1948 in New York City. Initially, she studied at the Antioch College with {{chemistry}} major. She then pursued studies and research in social science. After studying sociology for one year in the graduate school at Cornell University she moved to Harvard University for doctoral studies on anthropology, basically {{under the guidance of}} John and Beatrice Whiting. For her doctoral thesis, she went to Kenya to work and study the <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> of the Luo people. This study indicated that several boys were engaged in duties which otherwise the girls would perform, like caring for children and domestic works as their mothers were mostly engaged in agriculture work and there were not so many girls in the family who could help her. Ember studied this <b>social</b> <b>pattern</b> in depth by systematic behavioral observations of the boys in comparison with the girls. She noted that boys who did the work normally assigned to girls were [...] "intermediate in many social behaviors, compared with the other boys and girls". Following this study, she continued her research in the field of cross-cultural study on [...] "variation in marriage, family, descent groups, and war and peace." [...] She did this study in association with Melvin Ember who later became her husband; they got married in 1970. This study was also correlated with similar cross-cultural studies done {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E

We then compare the newly generated <b>social</b> contact <b>patterns</b> with the mixing patterns that are often used in the literature, and draw the following conclusions. First, the generation of <b>social</b> contact <b>patterns</b> based on a hierarchical district structure allows for simulations at different district levels.
