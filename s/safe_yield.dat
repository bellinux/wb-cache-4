40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a rural domestic defluoridation technology for the removal of fluoride from groundwater using locally available raw bauxite. Drinking groundwater sample of high fluoride concentration (6. 17 mg/L) was collected from a borehole in Machinga district of Southern Malawi where dental fluorosis is prevalent due to the high fluoride. Defluoridation of the water sample was done in a model domestic defluoridation unit in batch mode to optimize raw bauxite dosage and contact time. Sand and charcoal were used for water clarification. Optimum bauxite dosage and optimum contact time were determined as 0. 150 kg/L and 15. 0 min respectively. An optimum combined dosage of sand and charcoal for water clarification was found to be 0. 720 kg/L. The specific <b>safe</b> water <b>yield</b> for this system was found to be 36. 0 L/kg adsorbent.

40|$|Growing water {{scarcity}} in agriculture {{is an increasing}} problem in future in many regions of the world.

However, those climate predictions are associated with high uncertainty and therefore, e. g. stochastic methods are required to analyze the impact of changing climate patterns on future crop water requirements and water availability. For assessing irrigation as a measure to increase agricultural water security a generalized stochastic approach for a spatial distributed estimation of future irrigation water demand is proposed, which ensures <b>safe</b> <b>yields</b> and a high water productivity at the same time. The developed concept of stochastic crop water production functions (SCWPF) can serve as a central decision support tool for both, (i)  a cost benefit analysis of farm irrigation modernization on a local scale and (ii)  a regional water demand management using a multi-scale approach for modeling and implementation.

40|$|According {{to climate}} data Dobrogea is the warmest and the driest region of Romania. Due to climate, the {{productive}} potential of soils is poorly capitalized; productions depend mostly of the precipitations regime. The phenomenon {{is known for}} a long time, but the first steps to combat drought took just in the mid twentieth century when there was planted windbreak forest in the area Comorova and Ciocarlia - Cobadin. In the 50 s of the twentieth century windbreak forest was planted on about 3, 800 hectares that protected an agricultural area of over 75, 000 ha. The latter these were cleared during 1962 - 1965, when work began planning for irrigation. In the period 1967 - 1989, were equipped more than 420 thousand hectares representing over 82 % of the arable land of the county of Constanta and close to 160 thousand ha - about 48 % of the arable land of the county Tulcea. Due to improper operation yields were much lower than those projected. After 1990, facilities were destroyed and abandoned, so that in the recent years have been irrigated between 10, 000 - 20, 000 ha, although meanwhile were performed numerous analyzes and studies of rehabilitation. The lack of a clear strategy in the field, lack of funding for rehabilitation and sometimes of the interest of farmers to irrigate - in years of abundant precipitation - lead to the conclusion of an uncertain future while irrigation in Dobrogea is the main factor that depends on achieving high and <b>safe</b> <b>yields.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Water service {{delivery}} to most residents of peri-urban areas of greater Maputo {{depends largely on}} alternative service providers. mostly {{in the form of}} small-scale independent providers (SSIPs). This paper discusses the present and long-term challenges facing SSIPs in supplying quality water of sufficient quantity in peri-Urban Maputo and possible human health risks associated with the consumption of water provided by SSIPs. Extensive water sampling and analyses were conducted to evaluate the physicochemical and bacteriological quality of water provided by independent providers and the associated human health risks. Borehole pumping tests, the results of which were interpreted using the graphical method of Jacob, were used to evaluate the regional aquifer potential, the long-term impacts of its exploitation and the aquifer Vulnerability to external contamination. From the results of bore hole pumping tests it was concluded that the present yields are in average 33 % lower than estimated <b>safe</b> <b>yields</b> and that larger than present yields therefore can be exploited. The aquifer Vulnerability to external contamination (e. g. by E. coli and nitrates) is low, mainly because of low hydraulic loads and the existence of a rather thick (10 to 30 m) sandy unsaturated stratum where bacteria die-off and biological denitrification probably Occurs. However, the aquifer vulnerability to sea sea-water intrusion is high. Currently, the health risks posed to Consumers relying on services provided by SSIPs are small; even so, 13 out of 35 controlled boreholes had either total coliform or faecal coli form levels higher than the WHO standard. In the long run SSIPs may face more serious water quality problems due either to over-exploitation of the aquifer system or increased hydraulic loads resulting from increased Population density...|$|R
