Its first project was the development of the Virtual Library, that, among other activities, carries out a join purchase of electronic journals and databases. At the same time, the Virgen de la Torre Hospital was included into this project (after having had closed its library during the year 2002). Objective of this poster: To evaluate the implications that for the library of a small size hospital (< 200 beds) has its integration in a libraries consortium. Method: A cross study in 2001 and 2004 (before and after joining the consortium) was carried out. Analysis of the library services (<b>serials</b> <b>catalogue,</b> document delivery, access to electronic resources) and the information resources (journals and databases). Questionnaire for users. Results: The serials collection of Virgen de la Torre Hospital library has increased significantly from 2001 to 2004 by the incorporation of the centre to the libraries consortium of the Laín Entralgo Agency. The number of titles in all the medical specialities of interest for the hospital has increased, as well as the number of accessible databases. Besides, various automated library services (service of interlibrary loan, among others) have been implemented. The users value the accessibility to the new resources and they ask for training sessions in order to do an optimal usage. Conclusions: The numerous advantages obtained by small size libraries joining a library consortium are shown, since it allows to have access to a greater number of information resources, facilitates the equity in the access to these resources and enables the library cooperation. On the other hand, it implies a greater work load and new roles for the librarians...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about two {{important}} Italian web-resources for document delivery: ACNP (i. e. Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici), the collective <b>serials</b> Italian <b>catalogue,</b> and NILDE, a document transmission network based on Internet technologies and standardized operations. Our library {{is part of the}} database of ACNP since 2002, which has allowed us to better exploit our resources and to meet successfully our users’ requests. Results have been progressively improving from the end of 2003, when we joined the NILDE project. Participation in this network has supported the working flow of our activities in the entire DD process – from the request to the delivery of a document – considerably elevating the Document Delivery Service (DDS) management performance. To show you how we can obtain such operative results, we will describe both the structure of the collective <b>serials</b> Italian <b>catalogue</b> (ACNP) and the architecture of the e-mail/web gateway server used for NILDE. ACNP, developed by Italian National Research Council (CNR) and by the University of Bologna, has a Web OPAC where users can retrieve serials from the Italian libraries participating to the project – presently rated to be 2510. Even though ACNP assures by itself an efficient exchange of the documents, NILDE permits further costs reduction, time shortening and simplification of the documents transmission procedure. NILDE is a web-based Document Delivery Service that has been developed by the Research Area of Bologna Central Library in order to experiment the use and to suggest a model of DD service promoting inter-library mutual exchange and cooperation procedure. The high performance of the Network is possible especially because NILDE is accessible through ACNP, allowing the librarian to check which libraries participate to the Network among those that have the document he needs. Once checked the datum, the librarian can find out which library offers the best conditions and finalize his request accordingly, simply clicking on the link to NILDE...|$|R

40|$|The National Research Council (CNR) Bologna Research Area Library is a {{multidisciplinary}} scientific library serving {{a community of}} about 1. 500 local and remote users among researchers staff, PhD, undergraduate students and visiting scientists. The Library became operative in 1997, progressively integrating the existing resources of the Institutes belonging to the Research Area thus reducing costs whilst increasing {{the quantity and quality}} of advanced library services, such as: access to over 6. 000 online journals, access to specialised bibliographical databases, document delivery, etc [...] . Library online collections cover, among the Earth Sciences, the fields of Geology, Ocenography, Climatology, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. Among library services, the Document Delivery Service allows rapid supply of scientific documents, books, theses and other documents not owned by the Library through Inter-Library loan and exchange or purchase. This service is for internal users. On the other side, the Library offers rapid and comprehensive document supply and interlibrary loan to other Italian libraries from its extensive collection. Document Delivery (DD) plays an important role in Italian research and university libraries. The main Internet resources for Document Delivery and Resource Sharing are the Archivio Collettivo Nazionale dei Periodici (ACNP, the collective <b>serials</b> Italian <b>catalogue),</b> the Sistema Bibliotecario Nazionale Catalogue (SBN) and the MetaOpac Azalai Italiano (MAI). In 1999 the Library started a project aiming at the development of an Internet-based Document Delivery Service, in order to: - exploit the new Internet technologies; - promote cooperation among CNR and Italian university libraries; - reduce service costs; - achieve short turnaround times and higher user satisfaction. The resulting system, NILDE (Network Inter-Library Document Exchange), is a web based software for libraries and end-users, that allows libraries to manage the entire work-flow of document delivery activities. The main advantages for libraries are the provision of synthetic and analytical statistics, provision of performance indicators such as ?fill-rate? and ?turn-around time?, and support for secure electronic delivery via Internet by means of a file-uploading/web-server. The main advantages for end-users are the possibility to forward a document delivery request to their library from any OpenURL-compliant bibliographical database (e. g. Web of Science, Scopus, Scifinder, PubMed, CSA Illumina and SFX platforms) and to check the status of their requests. NILDE is presently used by more than 500 Italian libraries and counts about 3. 000 registered end-users. It has allowed to build up a large library network, based on cooperation, resource sharing and a degree of standard quality of service and fair behaviours. Technical-scientific and bio-medical libraries represent the core of the NILDE network, performing more than 80 % of the total number of document exchanges. The most recent progress and implementation of the NILDE project and software will be presented. We will also focus on the important contribution made by earth-science libraries to the NILDE network and how it will be possible to increase it, by actively involving even more libraries and complying with the user-needs of earth-scientists...|$|R
40|$|T {{he use of}} library {{transliteration}} {{of foreign}} languages has alwaysgenerated controversy and debate. For those opposed to translit-eration, especially in an age where computerization has introduced Uni-code in which native scripts can be displayed, entered, and searched in library catalogues, the practice is wholly unsatisfactory, serves no-one, and should probably be abolished. The critics point out that, especially for native users of languages with non-Roman scripts, searching for data in transliterated script is time-consuming and frustrating. Bilingual and multi-lingual catalogues, they note, have rendered transliteration unnecessary and obsolete. Why would a native speaker even bother searching for an item using transliteration, when searching using the original script {{is so much more}} reliable and efficient? For opponents of transliteration, transliteration is unreliable and serves neither librari-ans, bibliographers nor users of bibliographic systems. The time spent transliterating text in a record, when it could simply be entered in its native script, is wasteful and unproductive. Those who support library transliteration, even with the adoption of Unicode, however, argue that there are many reasons to continue the practice, inefficient as it is. Most of the arguments in favor of transliter-ation assert that while it is useless for native speakers to use translitera-tion, many other people need to search for records in any particular lan-guage employing non-Roman script. For example, transliteration is the only realistic way for Western-speaking librarians to maintain control over non-Roman materials. Moreover, at least a single transliteration scheme allows some degree of uniformity, even it requires learning that particular scheme. If there were no single transliteration scheme, there would be a large number of mutually inconsistent conversion systems. Many library workers, including those in <b>cataloguing,</b> <b>serials,</b> acquisi-tions, and circulation need to handle items in non-Roman script, even if they are unfamiliar with that script and language. How, for example, would a cataloguer with of item in French translated from the Arabic know where to shelf-list the item beside the Arabic original were it no...|$|R

The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) is South Africa’s {{statutory}} {{research agency}} {{dedicated to the}} social sciences. Information Services (IS) {{plays a significant role}} in advancing social science research through the provision of its proactive desk research and its library service. HSRC IS is looking at implementing a library solution that will better serve its users. The existing library system no longer meets the needs of the HSRC Library staff or the research staff. The functionality and efficiency of an ILS is critical to the smooth operation of IS in fulfilling its mandate within the HSRC, i. e. to provide access to information, in an efficient, useful, and timely manner, the focus being on ease of accessibility to a whole range of library and other online resources. The ILS must be able to handle many formats, accommodate searching on the Internet, provide a variety of functions including manipulating electronic data, working with graphics and expediting resource sharing. IS identified the following three ILS solutions, together with their add-on components 1) Innovative Interfaces’ Millennium solution, 2) SIRSI’s Unicorn solution and 3) Ex Libris’s ALEPH solution. The user and system requirements for ILS at the HSRC are sketched. The unique requirements, as well as the requirements the HSRC shares with other research organisations, are pointed out. The three ILS are evaluated against the criteria established. All three the ILS suppliers specialise exclusively in library automation software and have many years of experience in the provision and support of ILS, Innovative Interfaces Inc and Ex Libris for 25 years each and SIRSI for 15 years. Innovative Interfaces Inc has the largest customer base in South Africa. Ex Libris has one academic consortium as a client (CALICO) and some smaller utilisers, while SIRSI is just breaking into the South African market. All three systems comply fully with all the <b>Cataloguing,</b> <b>Serials</b> and Acquisitions modules requirements, that is, the more traditional library functionalities.
