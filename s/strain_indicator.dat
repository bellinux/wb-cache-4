40|$|International audience[1] Wet-based {{portions}} of ice sheets may move primarily by shearing their till beds, resulting in high sediment fluxes {{and the development}} of subglacial landforms. This model of glacier movement, which requires high bed shear strains, can be tested using till microstructural characteristics that evolve during till deformation. Here we examine the development of magnetic fabric using a ring shear device to deform two Wisconsin-age basal tills to shear strains as high as 70. Hysteresis experiments and the dependence of magnetic susceptibility of these tills on temperature demonstrate that anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) develops during shear due to the rotation of primarily magnetite particles that are silt sized or smaller. At moderate shear strains ($ 6 – 25), principal axes of maximum magnetic susceptibility develop a strong fabric (S 1 eignevalues of 0. 83 – 0. 96), without further strengthening at higher strains. During deformation, directions of maximum susceptibility cluster strongly in the direction of shear and plunge ''up-glacier,'' consistent with the behavior of pebbles and sand particles studied in earlier experiments. In contrast, the magnitude of AMS does not vary systematically with strain and is small relative to its variability among samples; this is because most magnetite grains are contained as inclusions in larger particles and hence do not align during shear. Although processes other than pervasive bed deformation may result in strong flow parallel fabrics, AMS fabrics provide a rapid and objective means of identifying basal tills that have not been sheared sufficiently to be compatible with the bed deformation model. fabric of sheared till: A <b>strain</b> <b>indicator</b> for evaluating the bed deformation model of glacier flow...|$|E

The different stress relief methods included: two water quenched samples at temperature ranges of 60 °- 90 °F and 120 °- 130 °F and two samples plastically deformed by forging at room temperature 1 % and 3 %. For accurate measurements, a strain gauge rosette, CEA- 06 - 062 UL- 120, was applied to the samples and drilled with a RS- 200 Milling Guide by Micro-Measurements.

Each sample was tested and results confirmed the residual stress to be non-uniform through the cross-section of the forged plates. The two water quenched samples had residual stress in tension at the surface; the two plastically deformed samples had residual stress in compression at the surface.

40|$|Understanding the {{physicochemical}} conditions extant {{and mechanisms}} operative during explosive volcanism {{is essential for}} reliable forecasting and mitigation of volcanic events. Rhyolitic pumices reflect highly vesiculated magma whose bubbles {{can serve as a}} <b>strain</b> <b>indicator</b> for inferring the state of stress operative immediately prior to eruptive fragmentation. Obtaining the full kinematic picture reflected in bubble population geometry has been extremely difficult, involving dissection of a small number of delicate samples. The advent of reliable high-resolution tomography has changed this situation radically. Here we demonstrate via the use of tomography how a statistically powerful picture of the shapes and connectivity of thousands of individual bubbles within a single sample of tube pumice emerges. The strain record of tube pumice is modelled using empirical models of bubble geometry and liquid rheology, reliant on a constraint of magmatic water concentration. FTIR analysis reveals an imbalance in water speciation, suggesting post-eruption hydration, further supported by hydrogen and oxygen isotope measurements. Our work demonstrates that the strain recorded in the tube pumice dominated by simple shear (not pure shear) in the late deformational history of vesicular magma before eruption. This constraint in turn implies that magma ascent is conditioned by a velocity gradient (across the conduit) at the point of origin of tube pumice. Magma ascent accompanied by simple shear should enhance high eruption rates inferred independently for these highly viscous systems. © Author(s) 2016.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{density of}} electronics within {{portable electronic devices}} provides the motivation to develop more compact power electronics, such as DC-DC converters. Typically, integrated circuits and each passive component, such as inductors, are discreetly packaged and mounted on printed circuit board (PCB), to implement the converter. Hence for further size reduction there has been growing interest for integration schemes such as Power supply in package (PwrSiP). However, {{the ultimate goal is}} the monolithic integration of the power supply solution, in an integration scheme known as Power Supply on Chip (PwrSoC). The economic effectiveness of the converter will be determined by the device footprint and number of processing steps required to fabricate the inductor. Hence, the motivation behind this thesis is the need for microinductors with large inductance density (inductance per device footprint) while maintaining low losses, which can be integrated with silicon IC. Furthermore, the need for thick layers will result in issues with yield and reliability of the fabricated device. Hence {{there is a need to}} identify, characterise and integrate materials with low residual stress into the microinductor fabrication process. A typical choice of inter-coil dielectric is the photo-definable epoxy SU- 8. However, SU- 8 suffers from intrinsic issues with high residual stress and adhesion. One possible replacement for SU- 8 as a structural and dielectric layer is Parylene-C. The first objective of this thesis proposes a test-bed inductor process, which incorporates Parylene as a structural and dielectric layer and has a short turnaround time of one week. This fabrication process involves the filling of high aspect ratio gaps between copper structures with Parylene and subsequent chemical mechanical planarisation, and a test chip has been designed to characterise these processes. Additionally, Scotch-tape testing has been used to confirm suitable Parylene adhesion to patterned and unpatterned films used in this process. Subsequently, complete microinductors, with magnetic cores, have been fabricated, characterised and benchmarked against other inductor technologies and architectures reported in the literature. Parylene is expected to produce films with low residual stress due to its room temperature deposition process. However, the test-bed inductor process requires thermal treatments up to 140 °C. Hence it was necessary to characterise the stress in Parylene films as a result of processing temperature and compare this to stress levels in SU- 8 5 and 3005 films. This study has determined the spatial variation of residual stress in Parylene-C and SU- 8 films, by combining automated measurements of <b>strain</b> <b>indicator</b> test structures and local nanoindentation measurements of Young’s modulus. These measurements have been used to wafer map strain, Young’s modulus, and subsequently residual stress in these films, as a result of processing parameter variation. It is well known that placing ferromagnetic material in close proximity to current carrying coils can further enhance the measured inductance value. However, the conductive magnetic core is also a source of loss for the microinductor. Hence, magnetic permeability, electrical resistivity and mechanical stress in the magnetic core influence the inductance value, eddy current losses and reliability of the fabricated microinductor, respectively. The ability to characterise these properties on wafer is essential for process control and verification measurements. This thesis details a test chip capable of routine measurements on NiFe films to characterise the spatial variation of these properties. Furthermore, wafer mapping measurements are reported to identify the correlation between high frequency permeability, electrical resistivity, mechanical strain and the chemical composition of two-component Permalloy film (NixFe(100 -x)) electroplated on the surface of 100 mm silicon wafers. Finally, MEMS-based inductor fabrication processes typically require a number of electrodeposition steps, which require conductive seed layers for the deposition of the coils and magnetic core material. A typical choice of seed layer is copper. However, due to copper’s paramagnetic behaviour (μ = 1) and low electrical resistivity (ρ= 6. 69 μΩ. cm) this layer contributes to eddy current losses, while acting as a thin ‘screening layer’. It is very likely that using a magnetic seed layer, within the magnetic core, will noticeably reduce eddy current related losses. However, detailed systematic experimental studies on any such improvement have not been documented in the literature. This study involves compositional, structural, electrical and magnetic characterisation of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on non-magnetic and magnetic seed layers (i. e. copper and nickel respectively). Mechanical strain test structures and X-ray analysis have been used to characterise the stress levels and structural properties of Ni 80 Fe 20 films electro-deposited on both copper and nickel seed layers. In addition, planar spiral micro-inductors, both with and without patterned magnetic cores, have been fabricated to determine the effect of patterning on their performance. This is in addition to quantifying the improvement in the electrical performance resulting from the enhanced magnetic and resistive contribution provided by magnetic seed layers...|$|E

Apart from high cost of treating water in sub-Saharan Africa, waterborne microorganisms are developing resistance to currently used disinfectants such as chlorine. To meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of providing safe drinking water, alternative and complimentary approaches such as the application of Moringa oleifera plant materials and sand filters are being studied. Previous research regarding the application of Moringa oleifera (MO) seeds have focused on the isolation of bioactive coagulant ingredients for more than four decades, with little attention directed toward field application in small and large scale water treatment applications. Slow sand filters take more than two weeks to generate clean water but there have been few studies directed towards integrating Moringa oleifera and other plant disinfectants with sand filters to generate clean water in a relatively short retention times at faster flow rates, generating a more compact filter unit. This research sought to fill this knowledge gap. Quantitative research techniques were applied to test a Moringa-sand filter column for its disinfection activity on separate synthetic contaminated water containing E. coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, total heterotrophic soil bacteria and fungi. The constructed Moringa-sand filter column was analyzed for its coagulant activity using synthetic turbid water made from bentonite and soil. Further research into documentation of indigenous knowledge and the use of indigenous medicinal plants in Cameroon with a history of use in purifying water was carried out at both the Phytobiotechnology Research Laboratories in Bamenda, Cameroon and the Microalgae Research Laboratory of the School of Chemical Engineering, Adelaide University. The coagulant and disinfection ability of the plants using surface contaminated water was carried out at the Phytobiotechnology Research Laboratories in Cameroon, followed by in-vitro antimicrobial activity of the organic extracts using microbial isolates from stream water in Bamenda, Cameroon. The coagulant and disinfection potential of Moringa oleifera seed extracts were superior to other plant materials. To this effect, further studies on Moringa oleifera seeds were planned and executed at the Microagae Laboratory, School of Chemical Engineering, Adelaide University. Extracts of Moringa seed powder using solvents of varying polarity revealed more than 85 % in-vitro antibacterial activity against E. coli (ATCC 11775) <b>strain</b> (<b>indicator</b> of faecal contamination of water) and 95 % against Aeromonas hydrophila strain (known to resist chlorination) compared to control of both organisms of 65 % for aluminum sulphate and 80 % for sodium hypochlorite. Phytochemical screening and chromatographic analyses were carried out to elucidate the possible bioactive disinfectant ingredient in Moringa seeds. These experiments were conducted as proof of concept and were preceeded by an evaluation of the microbial content of surface water at Bambui and Mile 6 Mankon water sources used for household chores in Bamenda, Cameroon, for total bacterial counts, E. coli and coliform counts. A pilot low cost disinfectant sand filter system was set up at the Government Technical College, Njinikom, in Cameroon; to test its disinfectant and coagulant efficiency using total bacterial count, E. coli, coliform and fungal counts, pH, turbidity and to provide a capacity building on dissemination of this knowledge at household level in Cameroon. Data was collected every 24 hours for a period of a month for the bench experiments using sand filters and for field work for 12 months on the pilot plant. The mean bacterial counts, pH, turbidity and a catalogue of plant materials used in water treatment were recorded. The main findings of this research are presented as a series of six publications consisting of four peer-reviewed journal articles, a book, a book chapter as well as two manuscripts submitted for publication: The main findings of this research were applied in a pilot water project at Government Technical School Njinikom, Boyo division, Cameroon. It was found in the pilot study that Moringa pretreated water filtered through sand media met both the Australian and the World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water. The broad lessons for water purification are that the use of locally available natural coagulants and disinfectants in resource limited countries has a great potential of improving the economy and health of the people. This research has demonstrated the efficacy of both plant based coagulants, disinfectants and sand filter media through extraction, in vitro bioassay, purification and integration of the two systems. It is highly recommended that governments in poor countries should take up this technology. It will require commitment of countries to strengthen the natural water coagulation technology in a holistic, integrated approach and to support initiatives including empowering and enabling local scientists to build up this system at the grassroots level.

40|$|We {{describe}} the bacteriolytic activity of 377 group D Enterococcus isolates expressed towards 25 Enterococcus strains belonging to different species and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698. Of the 26 <b>indicator</b> <b>strains</b> {{used to reveal}} bacteriolytic activity, 5 were lysed {{by all of the}} strains of some species and were not lysed by all of the strains of other species. The use of these <b>indicator</b> <b>strains</b> allowed us to devise a new method to differentiate group D Enterococcus strains, based on qualitative analysis (lysis or no lysis of the <b>indicator</b> <b>strains)</b> of bacteriolytic activity. The bacteriolytic patterns obtained fell into six bacteriolytic groups corresponding (98 % agreement) to species or groups of enterococci as determined by a comparison with data from a phenetic similarity study...|$|R

Four isolated strains (MBTU_PB 1, MBTU_PB 2, MBTU_PB 3 and MBTU_PB 4) showed moderate to strong antagonistic activities against the tested five <b>indicator</b> <b>strains</b> (Aeromonas hydrophila 1739, Vibrio cholera 3906, Flavobacterium 2495, Acinetobacter 1271 and Alcaligenes 1424) and these isolates were further identified using biochemical tests and 16 S rDNA gene sequence analysis. Except the whole cell product, {{the other three}} cellular components, namely, heat-killed whole cell product, intracellular product and extracellular product of all the four selected isolates were equally effective, as revealed by the zone of inhibitions to the tested <b>indicator</b> <b>strains.</b> The in vitro adhesion property or the ability of colonization is often considered as a selection criteria for probiotics.

40|$|SUMMARY: Two new {{compounds}} inhibited {{the increase}} of phage when two phages of Pseudomonas pyocyanea were grown on an <b>indicator</b> <b>strain.</b> These compounds also inhibited the appearance of iridescence in a lysogenic strain of this organism. One iridescent lysogenic strain showed a rise in phage titre a t 1 & 2 hr., which corresponded to the latent period of the phage when it acted on an <b>indicator</b> <b>strain.</b> Both these increases were inhibited by the compounds. This lysogenic strain also showed a rise in phage titre a t 4 hr. but this was unaffected by the compounds. The final phage titre of the lysogenic culture was not affected significantly, unlike the complete and permanent suppression of phage increase when free phage acted on an <b>indicator</b> <b>strain.</b> Cultures and filtrates of three lysogenic strains of Ps. pyocyanea showed a great increase in phage titre when assay plates (against an <b>indicator</b> <b>strain)</b> were incubated for a further period after the initial reading at 18 hr. Many workers have described iridescent strains of Pseudomonas pyocyaneu. Warner (1950) gave a. detailed description {{and concluded that the}} iridescent clearing was not caused by bacteriophage action but was a distinct lyti...|$|R
