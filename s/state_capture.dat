2500|$|In 2015, KPMG {{issued a}} {{controversial}} report that implicated former finance minister Pravin Gordhan {{in the creation}} of an illegal intelligence gathering unit of the South African Revenue Service (SARS).

[...] The report was withdrawn by KPMG in September 2017, earning the ire of the Commissioner of SARS, Tom Moyane.|$|E
2500|$|Ognyan Minchev {{stressed}} {{that one of}} the main reasons behind the lack of legitimacy of the Oresharski government is that its coming to power was made possible by the actions of an oligarchic structure (formerly allied to Borisov) which used underhanded maneuvers to discredit GERB (including on the days prior to the parliamentary election), for example by demonizing Tsvetan Tsvetanov in the media, with this smear campaign unwittingly aided by the economic grievances against the GERB administration on the part of the citizens. He insists that currently the major issues are connected to Bulgaria being in a political crisis attributable to <b>state</b> <b>capture.</b> Kozhouharov concurred with this viewpoint and in addition to that appraises the February protests as part of an orchestrated strategy to depose GERB and pave the way for the ascent of the current governing coalition. Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Simeon Dyankov characterizes the formation of the Oresharski government as a [...] "soft coup" [...] due to the collusion of the other parties in the National Parliament against GERB. Suspicions regarding the increased role played by the Movement for Rights and Freedoms party (whose support base is predominantly ethnically Turkish, Muslim Roma and Bulgarian Muslim) in the governance of the country were also identified as a catalyst for some elements of the protest movement. Staunchly anti-communist politician Edvin Sugarev alleged that the Oresharski government intended to distance Bulgaria from the European Union and set the stage for bringing the country in the Eurasian sphere of influence in the long-term.|$|E
