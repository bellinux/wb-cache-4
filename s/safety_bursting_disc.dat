Prior to the accident, the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the Lunar Module forward by three hours. This was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium (SHe) tank in the LM descent stage, which had been suspect since before launch. After the abort decision, the helium pressure continued to rise and Mission Control predicted the time that the <b>burst</b> <b>disc</b> would rupture. The helium tank <b>burst</b> <b>disc</b> ruptured at 108:54, after the lunar flyby.

50|$|A rupture disc, {{also known}} as a <b>burst</b> <b>disc,</b> <b>bursting</b> <b>disc,</b> or <b>burst</b> diaphragm, is a onetime use, non-reclosing {{pressure}} relief device that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from over pressurization or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A rupture disc is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost effective, but can become time consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out.|$|R
40|$|During the {{development}} {{stage of the}} 1 X Acorn <b>burst</b> <b>disc,</b> <b>burst</b> pressure test results exhibited an unexpected increase of 8 to 14 % over times of 90 [...] 100 days from initial fabrication. This increase is a concern where design constraints require stability. The disc material, 316 L stainless steel sheet, is formed to a dome-like geometry and scored to produce a thin-walled, high-strength ligament. The fracture events controlling burst occur in that ligament. Thus it has been characterized both for tensile properties and microstructure through nanoindentation, magnetic measurements, optical and transmission electron microscopy. These results compare favorably with finite element simulation of {{the properties of the}} ligament. The ligament exhibits a highly heterogeneous microstructure; its small volume and microstructural heterogeneity make it difficult to identify which microstructural feature controls fracture and hence burst pressure. Bulk mechanical test specimens were fabricated to emulate mid-ligament properties, and aged at both room and elevated temperatures to characterize and accelerate the temporal behavior of the <b>burst</b> <b>disc.</b> Property changes included yield and ultimate tensile strength increases, and fracture strain decreases with aging. Specimens were subjected to a reversion anneal identical to that given the <b>burst</b> <b>disc</b> to eliminate the martensite phase formed during rolling. Reversion-annealed samples exhibited no change in properties in room temperature or accelerated aging, showing that the reversion-anneal eliminated the aging phenomenon. Aging was analyzed in terms of diffusion controlled precipitate growth kinetics, showing that carbon migration to dislocations is consistent with the strength increases. A vacancy-assisted diffusion mechanism for carbon transport is proposed, giving rise to rapid aging, which replaces interstitial carbon diffusion until excess vacancies from deformation are consumed. Mechanical activation parameters in stress relaxation were measured, indicating that the deformation structures formed at high strains typical of the score ligament are resistant to annealing, and mimic the behavior of a thermal obstacles. This model also qualitatively explains the different rates of aging resulting from a range of levels of cold work...|$|R

5000|$|The {{importance}} of materials {{design and the}} understanding of grain boundaries was highlighted during the operation of Hinkley point. In 1969 there was a catastrophic failure of the Hinkley Point ‘A’ turbine-generator at near normal speeds (3200 rev/min). The interaction of fragments of the <b>burst</b> <b>disc</b> and the shaft caused the adjacent <b>disc</b> to <b>burst</b> almost immediately afterwards, and in the general disruption that followed another disc disintegrated completely and the entire unit was irreparably damaged. This {{is thought to be}} the first catastrophic failure of a turbine-generator in Britain. The characteristics of the material from which the <b>burst</b> <b>discs</b> were made were a contributory factor in the failure. The 3 Cr-Mo steel made by the a.0.h. process was temper embrittled during slow furnace cooling after heat treatment and therefore had poor fracture toughness, i.e. low tolerance of very sharp crack-like defects in highly stressed regions. Such material can of course be used quite safely in highly stressed regions in the absence of cracks. A material of higher fracture toughness would have tolerated larger cracks without succumbing to their unstable propagation, and the failure would have been postponed if not avoided. At the time of the manufacture of these discs, almost 15 years ago, {{it was not possible to}} quantify the effect of embrittlement on the material’s ability to tolerate small cracks in the most highly stressed regions. The reason for the failure was down to transport of phosphor towards the grain boundaries which embrittled the chromium steel causing it to fail ...|$|R

The results show that the development and change of vessel pressure exhibit different characteristics in the venting explosion process of different flammable gas, and vessel pressure will take on a double-peak phenomenon during the explosion process of highly reactive gas. The turbulent flow produced in the process of venting explosion will elongate the flame along the vessel surface near vent and enhance the burning rate...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the CAR68, Gun f/x was approached by the Monterey Bay Corporation to provide concept and development for a less-lethal projectile launcher for use by military and law enforcement. Working with Airgun Designs, this project produced the concept less-lethal weapon known as the UTPBS, which eventually became FN Herstal's FN 303. This design could be attached to an M16 rifle and was conceived as a less-lethal weapon coupled with a lethal weapon system, providing a wide range of response capabilities that were immediately available. A stand-alone version was also developed. The UTPBS also featured a rotating barrel magazine, allowing {{for a wide range of}} different projectiles to be available and selectable without the need to change magazines. The company is currently working on further development of the <b>burst</b> <b>disc</b> concept, as well as a variety of less-lethal weapons and simulators.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} clear that, in {{addition}} to conventional anterograde transmission, signaling in neural circuits can occur in a retrograde manner. This suggests the additional possibility that postsynaptic release of neurotransmitter might be able to act in an autocrine fashion. Here, we show that brief depolarization of a cerebellar Purkinje cell triggers a slow inward current. This depolarization-induced slow current (DISC) is attenuated by antagonists of mGluR 1 or TRP channels. DISC is eliminated by a mixture of voltage-sensitive Ca 2 + channel blockers and is mimicked by a brief climbing fiber <b>burst.</b> <b>DISC</b> is attenuated by an inhibitor of vesicular glutamate transporters or of vesicular fusion. These data suggest that Ca 2 +-dependent postsynaptic fusion of glutamate-loaded vesicles evokes a slow inward current produced by activation of postsynaptic mGluR 1, thereby constituting a useful form of feedback regulation...|$|R

50|$|Burst Disk Valve: Used {{in a few}} {{pneumatics}} but {{primarily in}} hybrid cannons, burst valves are considered the ideal pressure release mechanism as they allow an unobstructed flow of high pressure air. Burst disks have no moving parts, making them very reliable. They are very appealing for hybrid cannons because they can withstand the low pressure gas mix in the chamber before ignition, yet fail as planned upon successful ignition. The high pressure combustion gases are released into the barrel at a rate which generates greater velocities than a mechanical valve could allow. Pneumatic cannon <b>burst</b> <b>discs</b> work similarly. The disc and projectile are loaded, and the chamber is pressurised until the disc ruptures. Unfortunately, this usually does not give the operators {{much in the way}} of control over timing, although a puncturing mechanism can be used. Burst disks are of no specific material and may consist of plastic or thin sheet metal or foil.|$|R
40|$|The {{shock tube}} is a device {{in which a}} normal shock wave is {{produced}} by the interaction of fluids at significantly high-pressure difference. The shock tube is comprised of two sections known as driver and driven sections. These two sections are interacted with the high-speed valve or a <b>bursting</b> <b>disc.</b> When the interaction happens, a shock wave forms almost instantaneously and propagates into the driven section, while simultaneously an expansion wave propagates {{in the opposite direction}} into the driver section. The most commonly used technique to set-up such initial conditions is the use of a bursting diaphragm; however, a high-speed valve provides better control over the event. In the given setup, a high-speed valve is used for the generation of the shock wave. In this setup, solenoid valves are placed at various locations to control the filling and the safe operation. The shock tube is fitted with three pressure sensors. First pressure sensor is placed in the driver section whereas two other pressure sensors are placed in the driven section. A T-joint is placed in the driven section to mount a specimen for the study. The particular setup has computerized data acquisition system, which can record information up to 1 MHz. The operation of the shock tube and its various sensors is programmed to auto-trigger to gather the information...|$|R
40|$|Spring related {{pressure}} relief valves, mounted at ambient temperature, are {{state of the}} art to protect cryogenic apparatuses and installations against excessive pressure. However experiences shows limitations in applications on cryogenic pressure vessels: Set pressure varies in a wide range, unauthorized increase of set pressure, seat not tight etc. Alternatively, in some applications, spring related relief valves with cold seating, so called “Quench Relief Valves” (QRV) are used. Beside their relief function further functionalities like tight seating for system isolation as well as shut-off function for bypass precooling may be requested. So QRV’s shall be used in parallel to a cold or warm <b>bursts</b> <b>disc</b> at higher set pressure because of its rules non-conformity.

Pressure vessel rules allows also the choice for an active triggered pressure relief valve (Controlled Safety Pressure Relief Systems, CSPRS) e. g. with a fast opening cryogenic shut-off valve. Valve and its switching and control components used for such a smart relief design should fulfil similar reliability requests to qualify for use in SIL 3 applications. For mechanical devices functional qualification tests at service conditions are to be considered. Mechanical design and function of such pressure relief valves will be shown and discussed considering its limitations regarding applications of pressure vessel rules...|$|R
50|$|Most rocket {{launchers}} {{require a}} large clear area behind the gunner to prevent injury from backblast. To address this shortcoming, without increasing recoil to an unacceptable level, the Javelin system uses a soft launch mechanism. A launch motor using conventional rocket propellant ejects the missile from the launcher, but stops burning before the missile clears the tube. The flight motor is ignited {{only after a}} delay to allow for sufficient clearance from the operator. To save weight, the two motors are integrated with a <b>burst</b> <b>disc</b> between them; {{it is designed to}} tolerate the pressure of the launch motor from one side, but to easily rupture from the other when the flight motor ignites. The motors use a common nozzle, with the flight motor's exhaust flowing through the expended launch motor. Because the launch motor casing remains in place, an unusual annular (ring-shaped) igniter is used to start it; a normal igniter would be blown out the back of the missile when the flight motor ignited and could injure the operator. Since the launch motor uses a standard NATO propellant, the presence of lead beta-resorcinol as a burn rate modifier causes an amount of lead and lead oxide to be present in the exhaust; for this reason, gunners are asked to hold their breath after firing.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA Round Robin {{test was}} set up to obtain a cross {{comparison}} of participant's methods regarding a typical pressure relief device (<b>bursting</b> <b>disc)</b> sizing problem. The problem in question was a 'gassy' runaway reaction system: decomposition of 40 % w/w dicumyl peroxide in 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 - pentanediol diisobutyrate. The objective of the Round Robin exercise was to highlight the disparities in the participant's approaches and identify barriers and research needs. Two broad methods were used: one was the implementation of the DIERS method; the other was to follow a similarity or scale-up approach. The scale-up approach consists experimentally determining a minimum safe vent area and scaling up maintaining the vent area/volume ratio. This approach is similar to the one adopted by the UN committee on the Transport of Dangerous Goods for vent sizing of peroxide tankers using a 10 litre vessel. Very different results in terms of vent area were obtained from the seven participants. Analysis of the vent sizing calculations based on calorimetric data showed that the experimental conditions and their interpretation can significantly influence the estimated gas production rate and therefore the final vent area. However, the calculation of the vented mass flux stays largely responsible for the differences in calculated vent area. The critical factor lies in the assumption of single-phase (gas only) venting or two-phase (liquid and gas) venting. The reasons for assuming single-phase venting, which gives a lower vent area, are unclear and may not be justified. The comparison showed that the calorimetric and the similarity approaches diverged significantly when two-phase only venting was assumed. The Round Robin test highlighted the need for more experimental and modelling work towards predicting the nature of the vented fluid at large scale, and in the use of adiabatic calorimetry to determine the maximum gas production rate. Large-scale tests would allow the comparison, the validation and the improvement of the calorimetric and similarity approaches...|$|R
