30|$|Bronchiectasis alone, or in {{combination}} with mucus plugging, is given the highest weighting in most scoring systems and is thus commonly {{considered to be the}} most <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> when evaluating cystic fibrosis lung disease.|$|R
25|$|The {{ability of}} animals to encode and {{retrieve}} past experiences {{relies on the}} circuitry of the medial temporal lobe, a structure including the hippocampus. Animal lesion studies have provided <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> related {{to the importance of}} particular brain structures in episodic-like memory. For example, hippocampal lesions have severely impacted all three components (what, where, and when) in animals, suggesting that the hippocampus is responsible for detecting novel events, stimuli, and places when forming new memories and on retrieving that information later on.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{panel of}} EFSA experts noted that this review's {{conclusions}} were partially based on Internet sources and therefore were not scientifically robust. These experts also concurred with a critique that significant scientific errors {{were made in the}} critical review that led to unsubstantiated and misleading interpretations. A review of studies on children did not show any <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> for safety concerns with regard to neuropsychiatric conditions such as panic attacks, mood changes, hallucinations or with ADHD or seizures.|$|E
25|$|Enteroclysis {{has shown}} to be very {{accurate}} in diagnosing small bowel diseases, with a sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 96.9%. It permits detection of lesion {{which may not be}} seen with other imaging techniques. There is no significant difference in terms of detection of clinically <b>significant</b> <b>findings,</b> sensitivity or specificity between enteroclysis and CT enterography. Enteroclysis compares favorably with wireless capsule endoscopy and double-balloon endoscopy in the diagnosis of mucosal abnormalities of the small bowel.|$|E

30|$|The most <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> of {{this study}} was that the lever sign test is a new test with higher {{sensitivity}} than the Lachman test which can be applied easily both under anaesthesia and without anaesthesia.|$|R
30|$|The <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> is {{that the}} {{specific}} costs vary strongly depending on the chosen scenarios but that even excluding transportation the production cost per kg hydrogen is currently too high to be profitable with both assessed systems.|$|R
25|$|Social Reward Dependence {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the temporal lobes, the caudate Grey Matter Density (GMD) in the orbitofrontal cortex and the basal ganglia of the ventral striatum. These structures, which are rich in dopamine receptors, are known to {{play a crucial role in}} reward receipt, Incentive anticipation and simple and discrete primary and secondary rewards prediction errors. These <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> show a correlation between primary reward processing circuits and reward dependence, keeping with the fMRI research studies that demonstrated that, following the experience of complex rewards the activation of the striatal circuits occur.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{intellectual}} effect {{of being a}} TCK {{has not yet been}} widely explored, there has been such research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> was conducted on young native Koreans who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were looking to see how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their originality and fluency and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of creativity demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for problem solving than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. This study has implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional curriculum to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the Bar Kokhba revolt encompassed all of Judea, namely {{the villages of}} Judean hills, the Judean desert and northern parts of the Negev desert. The minimalistic approach limits {{the borders of the}} war to these areas, but there are also <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> which may support a wider view of the extent of the revolt. Among those findings are the rebel hideout systems in the Galilee, which greatly resemble the Bar Kokhba hideouts in Judea, and though are less numerous, are nevertheless important. Several historians theorize that the Tel Shalem arch depicted a major battle between Roman armies and Bar Kokhba's rebels in Bet Shean valley, thus extending the battle areas some 50km northwards from Judea. The 2013 discovery of the military camp of Legio VI Ferrata near Tel Megiddo, and ongoing excavations there may shed light to extension of the rebellion to the northern valleys. A 2015 archaeological survey in Samaria identified some 40 hideout cave systems from the period, some containing Bar Kokhba's minted coins, suggesting that the war raged in Samaria at high intensity. There is also evidence to support war operations on the coastal plain and as far as Transjordan.|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} study was undertaken of 35 asymptomatic postmenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy, {{dilatation and curettage}} (H D&C) for an incidental finding of thickened endometrium to assess the rate of <b>significant</b> pathological <b>findings,</b> cost per finding and complication rate of any procedures performed. This study found one case of endometrial adenocarcinoma (1 / 35; 3 %) at an estimated cost per <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> of $ 507, 116 with an estimated 11. 6 complication events per finding...|$|R
30|$|Interpretation {{problems}} were rare and included: variable prosthetic artefact, an {{increased number of}} clinically doubtful lesions, and difficulty confidently differentiating between reconstruction artefact and a <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> –mostly related to small foci of calcification and very small lesions.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if communication majors had greater communication competency than non-majors. Additionally, for majors, the number of communication courses and types of course, were also examined for their effect on communication competence. Subjects were 200 students at the University of Memphis. The impact of these independent variables on two micro-measures of competence was non-significant for all hypotheses tested. Thus, there was no <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> revealing discrimination between majors and non-majors, and no <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> revealing discrimination among majors who had one course, a few, or many. Implications for communication pedagogy and curriculum evaluation are addressed. (Contains 24 references.)

2500|$|It was {{reported}} that {{the driver of the}} minibus, teacher Eleanor Fry, had fallen asleep at the wheel moments before it crashed into the lorry on the hard shoulder. An inquest into the crash in June 1994 recorded a verdict of accidental death on each of the victims. The inquest's most <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> were that the minibus was not fitted with seatbelts, as legislation did not require minibuses or coaches to be at the time. The law was changed in 1997 to make seat-belts standard equipment on all minibuses and coaches as well as outlawing the [...] "crew bus" [...] – a minibus in which two opposing benches face towards each other – and promoting the forward facing coach.|$|E
2500|$|Layers of {{philosophical}} concerns. The probability of statistical significance {{is a function}} of decisions made by experimenters/analysts. If the decisions are based on convention they are termed arbitrary or mindless while those not so based may be termed subjective. To minimize type II errors, large samples are recommended. In psychology practically all null hypotheses are claimed to be false for sufficiently large samples so [...] "...it is usually nonsensical to perform an experiment with the sole aim of rejecting the null hypothesis.". [...] "Statistically <b>significant</b> <b>findings</b> are often misleading" [...] in psychology. Statistical significance does not imply practical significance and correlation does not imply causation. Casting doubt on the null hypothesis is thus far from directly supporting the research hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} {{religions}} and spirituality may, hypothetically, promote or hinder certain psychological virtues that increase resilience. Research has not established connection between spirituality and resilience. According to the 4th edition of Psychology of Religion by Hood, et al., the [...] "study of positive psychology {{is a relatively}} new development...there has not yet been much direct empirical research looking specifically at the association of religion and ordinary strengths and virtues". In {{a review of the literature}} on the relationship between religiosity/spirituality and PTSD, amongst the <b>significant</b> <b>findings,</b> about half of the studies showed a positive relationship and half showed a negative relationship between measures of religiosity/spirituality and resilience. The United States Army has received criticism for promoting spirituality in its new [...] program as a way to prevent PTSD, due to the lack of conclusive supporting data.|$|E
25|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>finding</b> of the {{research}} is that intervention depends {{on whether or not}} a victim asked for help by specifying a screen name. The group size effect was inhibited when the victim specifically asked a specific person for help. The group size effect was not inhibited if the victim did not ask a specific person for help.|$|R
25|$|This {{exposure}} {{of the body to}} substantial amounts of previously isolated thyroid enzymes is thought to contribute to the exacerbation of tolerance breakdown, giving rise to the more pronounced symptoms seen later in the disease.
