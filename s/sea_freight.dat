5|$|The {{north-east}} {{coast of}} the United States depended on these supplies of oil, importing both crude and refined products. Across most of Texas, there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil, and petroleum was typically moved from the south-west to the north-east coast using a mixture of <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> and railroad transport. In early 1941, 70,000 barrels of oil were moved on the railroads each day, but this method was expensive, and {{the bulk of the}} oil was moved using barges, some with a capacity of up to 15,000 barrels, operating up and down rivers and the Atlantic Coast.|$|E

For books that tie into movie release-dates (particularly for children's films), publishers will arrange books to arrive in store up to two months prior to the movie release to build interest in the movie.|$|E

Next, expansion is executed as for the case single supply site and multiple demand sites. Formulation expansion is executed as for the case multiple supply sites and single demand site.

30|$|The Swedish {{research}} company Sweco [58] has forecasted a total drop of 9 percent {{in demand for}} freight transport in Sweden for 2015, mainly due to the SECA decision. The company anticipates that demand for maritime freight transport will fall by 21 percent, and heavy road transports by 8 percent, while still expecting rail freight transport demand to increase by 11 percent. The total drop in freight transport demand would be dramatic and similar {{in comparison with the}} 14 percent fall in demand after the financial crisis during 2008. Overall in the Nordic countries, the cost impacts to the whole export sector logistics chain from ports to <b>sea</b> <b>freights</b> will be large, and the cargo volumes lower. The existing service providers in the logistics chain have to compete more heavily in the logistics market. The sulphur directive may in the long run change the industrial structure in the Nordic regions from heavy products to lighter and more expensive ones per weight unit.|$|R

These price variations are dependent on much these expensive deliveries in €/T may consists both smaller packages of paper and many intermodal stages.
