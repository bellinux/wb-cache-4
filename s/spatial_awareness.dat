5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness.</b> The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|As {{he began}} the third orbit, Schirra {{disconnected}} the spacecraft's gyroscopes, turned off part of the electrical power system, and let the capsule drift. He took advantage of this quiet period to test his <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> and motor control, which he found was broadly unaffected by weightlessness, and to eat a light meal. He powered the spacecraft back up over the Indian Ocean, and continued over the Pacific. At Hawaii, he was given clearance for a full six-orbit mission, and as he crossed over towards California shut down the electrical power for a second period of drifting flight, during which he occupied himself taking photographs with the onboard camera.|$|E
5|$|The Shapes in Space segment {{focuses on}} visual and <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness,</b> with the {{presenter}} exploring shapes, colour and everyday {{materials such as}} boxes and playdough. Musicality is explored through Making Music, {{with an emphasis on}} pitch, rhythm, beat, melody, and using a variety of real and pretend instruments. The presenter of Body Move encourages children to participate in movement and dance, developing physical coordination and motor development. Linguistics and aural skills are at the centre of the Word Play segment, featuring a puppet named Chatterbox who assists in the exploration of language through stories and rhymes. Puzzles and Patterns has a focus on logical thinking and mathematics, with a puppet named Jup Jup used as a tool for the presenter to complete puzzles or solve problems.|$|E
5000|$|An {{incomplete}} view of <b>spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness</b> {{would render}} it {{as simply a}} contributor to or an element of contextual awareness - that which specifies a point location on the earth. This narrow definition omits the individual cognitive and computational functions involved in a complex geographic system. Rather than defining the myriad of potential factors contributing to context, <b>spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness</b> {{defined in terms of}} cognitive processes permits a unique, user-centered perspective in which [...] "conceptualizations imbue spatial structures with meaning." ...|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{examples}} of LBS applications exist which require {{the ability to}} leverage <b>spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness.</b> These applications are in demand {{by the general public}} and are {{examples of}} how maps are being used by individuals to help better understand the world and make daily decisions.|$|R
50|$|Context awareness, {{geographic}} awareness, and ubiquitous cartography or Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) all {{contribute to}} the understanding of <b>spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness.</b> They are also key elements in a map-based, location-based service, or LBS. In cases in which the user interface for the LBS is a map, cartographic design challenges must be addressed in order to effectively communicate the spatial context to the user.|$|R
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness.</b> The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
25|$|The dorsal stream commences with purely visual {{functions}} in the occipital lobe before gradually transferring to <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> at its termination in the parietal lobe.|$|E
25|$|The dorsal {{stream is}} {{involved}} in <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> and guidance of actions (e.g., reaching). In this it has two distinct functional characteristics—it contains a detailed map of the visual field, and is also good at detecting and analyzing movements.|$|E
5000|$|Applications {{which require}} the use of <b>spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness</b> in LBS are confronted with a {{multitude}} of cartographic challenges and decisions. Some of these challenges are due to the small displays of the typical PDA user interface and method of use. [...] Other problems result from the large volume of potentially relevant contextual data as difficult choices need to be made on the most important content to display.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness</b> can {{describe}} present context - {{the environment of}} the user at the present time and location, or that of a future context - where the user wants to go and what may be of interest to them in the approaching spatial environment. Some location-based services are proactive systems which can anticipate future context. [...] Augmented reality is an application which guides a user through present and into future context by displaying spatial contextual information in their visual system as they traverse through real space.|$|R
40|$|With {{just one}} {{quick glance at}} the scene, a sighted person can {{obtained}} enough spatial information to navigate through the scene. A wall {{on the left and}} the right, a ball is situated just right in the front. This is the spatial information that helps us navigate through any unfamiliar environment. As sighted person, we are taking this spatial information for granted. This much-needed information is lost on the visually impaired and the blind. Preliminary literature investigations have shown how spatial information of the facing scene can greatly benefit individuals with impairments. This paper investigated the possibility of extracting <b>spatial</b> information <b>awareness</b> of the facing scene given its disparity image. After the whole disparity image is analysed using gradient operator, it is broken into three equal sections, foreground, mid-ground and background. Each section is analysed independently according to the needed spatial information. The relative size of the object occupied in the three sections contains needed information of the facing scene spatial information and also information regarding the type of the facing scene, close range, mid range or outer range. Experiments, which extracted <b>spatial</b> information <b>awareness,</b> were conducted on both a synthetic disparity image and real disparity images, yielding promising results. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{main cause}} of death among {{adolescents}} {{as a result of}} binge drinking is road traffic accidents; a third of all fatal road traffic accidents among 15- to 20-year-olds are associated with drinking alcohol. Cyclists and pedestrians are likely to have less <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> and concentration while travelling after binge drinking and, also, it is more common that adolescents that binge-drink drive drunk or are the passenger of a drunk driver. It has been found that 50 percent of all head injuries in adolescents in the USA are associated with alcohol consumption. Violence and suicide combine to become the third-most-common cause of death associated with binge drinking among adolescents. The suicide risk in adolescents is more than 4 times higher among binge drinkers than non-binge drinking adolescents.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1972 Genie scored between the level an 8-year-old and an adult on all right-hemisphere tasks the {{scientists}} tested her on, and showed extraordinarily rapid improvement on them. Her ability {{to piece together}} objects solely from tactile information was exceptionally good, and on <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> tests her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded. Similarly, on a Mooney Face Test in May 1975 she had {{the highest score in}} medical literature at that time, and on a separate gestalt perception test her extrapolated score was in the 95th percentile for adults. On several other tests involving right-hemisphere tasks, her results were markedly better than other people in equivalent phases of mental development; in 1977 the scientists measured her capacity for stereognosis at approximately the level of a typical 10-year-old, significantly higher than her estimated mental age. The scientists also noted in 1974 that Genie seemed to be able to recognize the location she was in and was good at getting from one place to another, an ability which primarily involves the right hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|The Last of Us: Left Behind {{is played}} from a third-person perspective; players use firearms, improvised weapons and stealth {{to defend against}} hostile humans and zombie-like creatures {{infected}} by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. Stealth combat utilizes a gameplay mechanic called [...] "Listen Mode" [...] that allows players to effectively locate enemies through {{a heightened sense of}} hearing and <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness.</b> The game also features a crafting system, allowing players to customize weapons through the use of upgrades.|$|E

5000|$|New, {{innovative}} ideas {{continue to}} add to the types of questions in which LBS can answer for a user. For example, computer vision and object based indexing can be used to both identify an object and assist a user in navigating from the location. <b>Spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness</b> {{plays a key role in}} this process as it provides an initial geo-reference of the location while simplifying the object recognition process to a manageable degree. [...] This category of LBS use can be called [...] "identification" [...] and answers the question [...] "What is it?" ...|$|R
500|$|Though {{players can}} attack enemies directly, {{they can also}} use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. [...] "Listen Mode" [...] allows players to locate enemies through a {{heightened}} sense of hearing and <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness,</b> indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, players crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. Players solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.|$|E
500|$|New {{features}} include {{the ability to}} quickly equip items using the touchscreen {{and to use the}} handheld's built in gyroscope to aim precisely in first-person point of view while using items such as the slingshot. The fixed 3D is no longer present, and is made with a full 3D rendering of previously fixed 3D areas. In addition to the original game, the Master Quest is included, as well as a new [...] "Boss Challenge" [...] mode that allows players to fight all of the bosses one at a time, or in sequential order. However, this version of Master Quest differs {{in the fact that the}} entire map is mirrored, similar to what Nintendo did for the Wii port of [...] Instructional videos are built into the 3DS version to guide the players who are lost or stuck in certain puzzles. The original Water Temple was noted for its difficulty, being described as [...] "arguably the greatest challenge of <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> in a 3D adventure game". The 3DS version contains new elements to reduce this difficulty.|$|E
2500|$|The dorsal stream pathway {{begins with}} purely visual {{information}} in the occipital lobe, and then this information is transferred to the parietal lobe for <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> functions. Specifically, the posterior parietal cortex is essential for [...] "the perception and interpretation of spatial relationships, accurate body image, and the learning of tasks involving coordination {{of the body in}} space." ...|$|E
25|$|These {{cells were}} first {{discovered}} in the brain, and specifically in the hippocampus, by O'Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971). Though the hippocampus {{plays a role in}} learning and memory, the existence of place cells within the hippocampus demonstrates the role it plays with <b>spatial</b> adaptation and <b>awareness.</b> There have been recorded increases in firing patterns of rats in open environments and recorded <b>spatial</b> learning and <b>awareness</b> impairments after damage to the hippocampus and the place cells within. Studies with rats have shown that place cells are very responsive to spatial surroundings. For example a study by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel found that place cells would fire more rapidly when rats ran past places in the environment, when a new item was added to the environment, or when an item that is usually there is not present.|$|R
40|$|The {{central nervous}} system must resolve the {{ambiguity}} of inertial motion sensory cues in order to derive accurate <b>spatial</b> orientation <b>awareness.</b> We hypothesize that multi-sensory integration will be adaptively optimized in altered gravity environments based on the dynamics of other sensory information available, with greater changes in otolith-mediated responses in the mid-frequency range {{where there is a}} crossover of tilt and translation responses.

5000|$|<b>Spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness</b> consociates contextual {{information}} such as an individual's or sensor's location, activity, the time of day, and proximity to other people or objects and devices. [...] It is also defined as the relationship between and synthesis of information garnered from the spatial environment, a cognitive agent, and a cartographic map. The spatial environment is the physical space in which the orientation or wayfinding task is to be conducted; the cognitive agent is the person or entity charged with completing a task; and the map is {{the representation of the}} environment which is used as a tool to complete the task.|$|R
2500|$|The crew at {{the station}} {{set out to find}} the {{aircraft}} in [...] of snow, and did not manage to bring the survivor back to the station until the following day. Four military ships were dispatched to search for the aircraft. Once it was found, Andenes and Sørøy returned to Tromsø and then took the investigation commission to Bjørnøya. They concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft losing altitude through a sideslip, possibly due to the pilot losing <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> in the poor visibility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) is a cortical {{area that is}} located {{in front of the}} parieto-occipital sulcus and is known {{to play a role in}} <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> for eye and arm movements. A study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) found that the PPC also plays an important role in the amount of information held across saccades. It is believed that transsaccadic memory has the ability to hold roughly three to four items across each saccade with a fully functional PPC. When the PPC is temporarily disrupted, especially the PPC of the right hemisphere, memory across saccades is significantly weakened. [...] Disruption of the PPC leads to a reduction in the ability to store items from a span of three or four, to one item. Further research needs to be conducted in order to fully understand how the PPC is synthesized with object recognition within transsaccadic memory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{patients}} whose brain damage {{was in the}} right hemisphere, left limb activation (LLA) was another treatment that proved effective. [...] The theory behind this method of treatment is that any use of the damaged side of the brain will enhance all functions related to the damaged hemisphere and that use of the opposite (healthy) side will only cause further impairment. [...] LLA therefore is merely the concentrated use of {{the left side of the}} body in {{patients whose}} damage is in the right hemisphere (since the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body). [...] This forces the patient to exercise <b>spatial</b> <b>awareness</b> using the damaged side of the brain, increasing activity around the lesion. [...] While generally a treatment used for visual neglect (a different but related neurological disorder), LLA still increases brain activity around damaged area in patients with visual extinction and generates improvement in some patients. [...] The reason this treatment does not work in some cases of visual extinction is that damage can be on either side of the brain as opposed to in visual neglect where the damage is always on the right.|$|E
50|$|Geographic awareness, {{another term}} for <b>spatial</b> contextual <b>awareness,</b> clarifies the <b>spatial</b> and {{geographic}} aspects of context.

40|$|The {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) {{has traditionally been}} considered important for <b>awareness,</b> <b>spatial</b> perception, and attention. However, recent findings provide evidence that the PPC also encodes information important for making decisions. These findings have initiated a running argument of whether the PPC is critically involved in decision making. To examine this issue, we reversibly inactivated the parietal reach region (PRR), {{the area of the}} PPC that is specialized for reaching movements, while two monkeys performed a memory-guided reaching or saccade task. The task included choices between two equally rewarded targets presented simultaneously in opposite visual fields. Free-choice trials were interleaved with instructed trials, in which a single cue presented in the peripheral visual field defined the reach and saccade target unequivocally. We found that PRR inactivation led to a strong reduction of contralesional choices, but only for reaches. On the other hand, saccade choices were not affected by PRR inactivation. Importantly, reaching and saccade movements to single instructed targets remained largely intact. These results cannot be explained as an effector-nonspecific deficit in <b>spatial</b> attention or <b>awareness,</b> since the temporary “lesion” had an impact only on reach choices. Hence, the PPR is a part of a network for reach decisions and not just reach planning...|$|R
