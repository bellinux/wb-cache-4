5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The <b>stratum</b> <b>granulosum</b> layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E

25|$|The skin {{consists}} of two primary layers: an inner layer, the dermis, comprising largely connective tissue, and an outer, thinner epidermis. The thickness of the epidermis ranges from 0.08mm to greater than 0.6mm (from 0.003 to 0.024 inches). The epidermis comprises five strata; from outer to inner, they are the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, <b>stratum</b> <b>granulosum,</b> stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.

40|$|Secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) encoded by 10 {{genes of}} Candida albicans are {{important}} virulence factors for {{different types of}} candidiasis. Distinct SAP genes have previously been shown to contribute to tissue damage in a model of oral candidiasis. In this study a progressive SAP expression in the order SAP 1 and SAP 2 >SAP 8 > SAP 6 > SAP 3 was observed in an in vitro model of cutaneous candidiasis based on reconstituted human epidermis. Transcripts of SAP 1 and SAP 2 were detected during initial invasion of the stratum corneum by C. albicans. Deeper, extensive penetration of the corneal layer was accompanied by additional SAP 8 mRNA. SAP 6 expression occurred concomitantly with germ tube formation and extensive hyphal growth in the <b>strata</b> <b>granulosum,</b> spinosum, and basale. Ultrastructural studies using specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the gene products of SAP 1 – 3 and SAP 4 – 6 revealed predominant expression of Sap 1 – 3. The protective effect of the aspartic proteinase inhibitor pepstatin A during infection of the epidermis and an attenuated virulence phenotype of SAP-deficient mutants suggest that the observed SAP expression correlates with tissue damage in the skin...|$|R

A considerable discontinuity in water content occurred {{between these two}} regions over the <b>stratum</b> corneum-stratum <b>granulosum</b> junction and the last granular cell layer. The dominance of the water profile by a discontinuity suggests water loss is governed by a partitioning process, presumably a partitioning into the lipid domain.

500|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the most}} superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, <b>stratum</b> <b>granulosum,</b> stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. [...] Nourishment is provided to these layers by diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. [...] The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. [...] This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. [...] In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer {{to the top of}} the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.|$|E

40|$|Photomechanical waves (high {{amplitude}} {{pressure transients}} generated by lasers) {{have been shown}} to permeabilize the stratum corneum in vivo and facilitate the transport of macromolecules into the viable epidermis. The permeabilization of the stratum corneum is transient and its barrier function recovers. Sites on the volar forearm of humans were exposed to photomechanical waves and biopsies were obtained immediately after the exposure and processed for electron microscopy. Electron microscopy showed an expansion of the lacunar spaces within the stratum corneum lipid bilayers but no changes in the organization of the secreted lamellar bodies at the <b>stratum</b> corneum–stratum <b>granulosum</b> boundary. The combination of photomechanical waves and sodium lauryl sulfate enhances the efficiency of transdermal delivery and delays the recovery of the barrier function of the stratum corneum. Electron microscopy from sites exposed to photomechanical waves and sodium lauryl sulfate showed that the lacunar spaces expanded significantly more and the secreted lamellar bodies also appeared to be altered. In either case, there were no changes in the papillary dermis. These observations support the hypothesis that the photomechanical waves induce the expansion of the lacunar spaces within the stratum corneum leading to the formation of transient channels...|$|R
40|$|Previous reports {{suggested}} that ion gradients of ions such as calcium and magnesium in the epidermis {{play a crucial}} part in skin barrier homeostasis. We hypothesized that external electric potential affects the ionic gradient and skin barrier homeostasis. We demonstrated here that application of a negative electric potential (0. 50 [*]V) on hairless mice skin accelerated the barrier recovery approximately 60. 7 % of the original level within 1 [*]h compared with control (37. 5 %) after barrier disruption by acetone treatment. Even after {{the application of a}} negative potential, the skin showed accelerated repair for 6 [*]h. On the contrary, the skin that was applied a positive potential for 1 [*]h showed a significant delay in barrier recovery (25. 3 %) than the control. Ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy {{suggested that}} the extent of lamellar body exocytosis into the <b>stratum</b> corneum/stratum <b>granulosum</b> interface increased under a negative potential. Magnesium and calcium ion concentrations in the upper epidermis were relatively higher in the negative portion than in the portion where the positive potential was applied. Topical application of these ions on mice skin also accelerated the barrier recovery. These results suggest that the external electric potential affects the ionic gradients in the epidermis and also influences the skin barrier homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Current {{evidence}} suggests that lichen planus is an immunological disease. Cytotoxic CD 8 &#x 002 B; cells in the lesional epidermis recognize a unique antigen called lichen planus specific antigen. This antigen could be demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence using the patient&#x 2032;s serum and autologous lesional skin. Aim: To study indirect immunofluorescence pattern in lichen planus, among Indian patients. Methods: Twenty-five consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of lichen planus {{were enrolled in the}} study. Direct immunofluorescence was done in all patients. Indirect immunofluorescence using lesional skin as substrate was done in all 25 patients and five patients with other dermatoses. Results: A specific fluorescence pattern corresponding to the distribution of lichen planus specific antigen was observed in the <b>stratum</b> spinosum and <b>granulosum</b> in 22 (88 &#x 0025;) patients.

Thin sections were incubated with concanavalin A (Con A), peanut agglutinin (PNA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA I), dolichos bi-florus agglutinin (DBA), and soybean agglutinin (SBA). A positive {{reaction in the}} dermis, in the basal lamina (lamina densa, lamina lucida), intracellularly and within the plasma membrane including the desmosomes was obtained after incubation with Con A and WGA. PNA binding sites were found predominantly in the plasma membrane between the desmosomes. The labeling with Con A, WGA, and PNA was most pronounced in the upper <b>stratum</b> spinosum and <b>granulosum.</b> Incubation with UEA revealed heavy labeling of the keratohyalin granules and the cytoplasm of the corneocytes.

40|$|Iontophoresis {{increases}} {{the delivery of}} drugs across the stratum corneum, but the pathway by which ionized drugs transit the stratum corneum is unknown. In this study we examined the effect of iontophoresis on the skin barrier and the epidermal calcium gradient. Hairless mice were subjected to iontophoresis for 5 – 120 min and skin specimens were prepared for electron microscopy. Neither positive nor negative iontophoresis affected transepidermal water loss. Lacunar dilatation and partial distention of the intercellular layers of the stratum corneum were observed in rough proportion to applied time in iontophoresis skin as well as control skin. Additionally, using calcium capture cytochemistry, we demonstrated that {{both positive and negative}} iontophoresis caused the disappearance of the epidermal calcium gradient with marked decrease in calcium content in the upper epidermis. Positive iontophoresis was associated with increased calcium in the stratum basale and dermis, whereas negative iontophoresis increased calcium in the stratum corneum. Moreover, as previously shown after barrier disruption and sonophoresis, the decrease in calcium content in the upper epidermis was associated with an increase in lamellar body secretion and the build up of lamellar material at the <b>stratum</b> corneum–stratum <b>granulosum</b> interface. In conclusion, iontophoresis on the skin of hairless mice may induce the change of ionized molecules in the epidermis, as the loss of the calcium gradient, which causes the decrease of skin impedence, gives charged drugs the ability to cross the skin more easily. Also, the structural changes, such as lacunar dilatation, whether they result from hydration or occlusion, may help the transport of charged drugs across the stratum corneum...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal keratinocytes {{are exposed}} to a low water {{concentration}} at the <b>stratum</b> corneum-stratum <b>granulosum</b> interface. When epithelial tissues are osmotically perturbed, cellular protection and cell volume regulation is mediated by accumulation of organic osmolytes such as taurine. Previous studies reported the presence of taurine in the epidermis of several animal species. Therefore, we analyzed human skin {{for the presence of}} the taurine transporter (TAUT) and studied the accumulation of taurine as one potential mechanism protecting epidermal keratinocytes from dehydration. According to our results, TAUT is expressed as a 69 kDa protein in human epidermis but not in the dermis. For the epidermis a gradient was evident with maximal levels of TAUT in the outermost granular keratinocyte layer and lower levels in the stratum spinosum. No TAUT was found in the basal layer or in the stratum corneum. Keratinocyte accumulation of taurine was induced by experimental induction of skin dryness via application of silica gel to human skin. Cultured human keratinocytes accumulated taurine in a concentration- and osmolarity-dependent manner. TAUT mRNA levels were increased after exposure of human keratinocytes to hyperosmotic culture medium, indicating osmosensitive TAUT mRNA expression as part of the adaptation of keratinocytes to hyperosmotic stress. Keratinocyte uptake of taurine was inhibited by β-alanine but not by other osmolytes such as betaine, inositol, or sorbitol. Accumulation of taurine protected cultured human keratinocytes from both osmotically induced and ultraviolet-induced apoptosis. Our data indicate that taurine is an important epidermal osmolyte required to maintain keratinocyte hydration in a dry environment...|$|R

Moderate amounts of transcripts with a putative coding potential for E 6 /E 7, E 1, and E 2 were demonstrated from the first subrabasal cell layer throughout the <b>stratum</b> spinosum and <b>granulosum.</b> In addition very large amounts of E 4 and L 1 transcripts {{were present in the}} same epithelial layers.

Furthermore massive amplification of the viral DNA as measured by BrdU incorporation and different methods of in situ hybridization took place in the lowest 5 to 10 suprabasal cell layers. These findings are in contrast to the assumption that late gene expression and viral DNA synthesis are restricted to the more differentiated cell layers of the epithelium and point to differences in the regulation of the vegetative life cycle between different papillomavirus types...|$|R
30|$|Hypothetically, {{molecules}} may {{be transferred}} across the stratum corneum by three different pathways [33]: (1) paracellular (the substances diffuse through intercellular lipids), (2) transcellular (through the cellular compartment), and (3) transappendageal (substances circumvent keratinocytes by hair shunts or glands). For mammalian skin, the paracellular pathway {{is believed to}} be the major transfer route where substances cross the lipid-rich regions in between the corneocytes of the multi-layered, non-viable stratum corneum. The transcellular and transappendageal pathways are considered as being less likely for the transfer across the stratum corneum [33 – 35]. For amphibians, the transcellular pathway is hypothesized to be more relevant than the paracellular route since the outermost cells of the <b>stratum</b> corneum and <b>granulosum</b> are connected by tight junctional structures [30, 36]. Apart from stratum corneum differences, glandular tissue is far more pronounced in amphibian skin than in mammalian [10]. Thus, transappendageal routes might play a significant role for dermal absorption of chemicals in amphibians. Via glandular ducts of granular and mucous glands, chemicals might circumvent stratum corneum and viable epidermal layers and might be transported directly into the dermis, reaching blood vessels faster for resorption. In mammalian skin, an increased amount of appendages such as hair shafts may lead to an increased absorption of chemicals, as well [37, 38].|$|R
40|$|Why {{regeneration}} {{does not}} occur in mammals remains elusive. In lower vertebrates, epimorphic regeneration of the limb is directed by the wound epidermis, which controls blastema formation to promote regrowth of the appendage. Herein, we report that knockout (KO) or inhibition of Apoptosis Signal-regulated Kinase- 1 (ASK 1), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP 3 K 5), after full thickness ear punch in mice prolongs keratinocyte activation within the wound epidermis and promotes regeneration of auricular cartilage. Histological analysis showed the ASK 1 KO ears displayed enhanced protein markers associated with blastema formation, hole closure and regeneration of auricular cartilage. At seven days after punch, the wound epidermis morphology was markedly different in the KO, showing a thickened stratum corneum with rounded cell morphology and a reduction of both the granular cell layer and decreased expression of filament aggregating protein. In addition, cytokeratin 6 was expressed in the <b>stratum</b> spinosum and <b>granulosum.</b> Topical application of inhibitors of ASK 1 (NQDI- 1), the upstream ASK 1 activator, calcium activated mitogen kinase 2 (KN 93), or the downstream target, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SP 600125) also resulted in enhanced regeneration; whereas inhibition of the other downstream target, the p 38 α/β isoforms, (SB 203580) had no effect. The results of this investigation indicate ASK 1 inhibition prolongs keratinocyte and blastemal cell activation leading to ear regeneration...|$|R

50|$|Lamellar {{bodies are}} tubular or ovoid-shaped {{secretory}} organelles {{derived from the}} Golgi apparatus of keratinocytes in {{the upper part of}} stratum spinosum. From the site of production, lamellar bodies migrate {{to the top of the}} <b>stratum</b> <b>granulosum</b> and then into the intercellular domain of the stratum corneum to extrude their contents, which are predominantly lipids. The lipids ultimately form the lamellar lipid bilayer that surrounds corneocytes and also contribute to permeability barrier homeostasis of the stratum corneum. The homeostasis function is regulated by the calcium gradient in the epidermis. Usually the calcium level is very low in stratum corneum, but high in <b>stratum</b> <b>granulosum.</b> Once the permeability barrier is disrupted an influx of water occurs in the stratum corneum, which in turn increases the calcium levels in the stratum corneum but decreases it in the <b>stratum</b> <b>granulosum.</b> This perturbation induces lamellar bodies to undergo exocytosis and secrete lipids such as glycosylceramides, cholesterol and phospholipids to retrieve the permeability barrier function of stratum corneum.|$|E

These reconstituted tissues exhibit a number of differentiation and proliferation markers of human epidermis, including gap junctions, connexins, and K 6 and Ki 67 proteins. Immunostaining and northern blots showed that gap junctions of the epidermal equivalents were made of Cx 26 and Cx 43. Cx 26 was expressed in all keratinocyte layers, throughout {{the development of the}} epidermal equivalents. In contrast, Cx 43 was initially observed only in the basal layer of keratinocytes and became detectable in the <b>stratum</b> spinosum and <b>granulosum</b> only after the epidermal equivalents had thickened. The levels of Cx 26 and its transcript markedly increased as a function of stratification of the epidermal equivalents, whereas those of Cx 43 remained almost constant. Microinjection of Lucifer Yellow into individual keratinocytes showed that gap junctions were similarly permeable at all stages of development of the epidermal equivalents. The data show that epidermal equivalents (i) feature a pattern of connexins typical of an actively renewing human interfollicular epidermis, and (ii) provide a model that reproduces the tridimensional organization of intact epidermis and that is amenable for experimentally testing the function of junctional communication between human keratinocytes...|$|R

To study the pathogenesis of this uncommon, vitally induced cutaneous lesion, the footpads of 19 dogs with naturally occurring distemper were investigated for histologic changes and distribution pattern of CDV antigen. All dogs displayed clinical signs of distemper, which had lasted from 10 to 75 days. Overt digital hyperkeratosis was observed in 12 animals (group A), whereas the footpads of the remaining seven dogs appeared normal macroscopically (group B). Orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis (12 / 12; 100 %), irregular acanthosis (11 / 12; 92 %), thickened rete ridges (10 / 12; 83 %), and mild mononuclear perivascular (10 / 12; 83 %) and periadnexal (7 / 12; 58 %) dermatitis were the most common findings in dogs with hard pad disease. Surprisingly, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis (5 / 7; 71 %), irregular acanthosis (5 / 7; 71 %), and thickened rete ridges (4 / 7; 57 %) were also seen in the dogs without clinical evidence of digital hyperkeratosis.

Dorsal abdominal surfaces are covered with abdominal scales of varying sizes either conical or elliptical-structures, regularly arranged in rows and imbricated with each other. Each scale possessed one cylindrical lenticular epidermal sense organ containing heavy sensillia.
