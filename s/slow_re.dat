40|$|In {{response}} to ultrafast laser pulses, single-phase metals have been classified as “fast” (with magnetization quenching {{on the time}} scale {{of the order of}} 100 fs and recovery in the time scale of several picoseconds and below) and “slow” (with longer characteristic time scales). Disordered ferrimagnetic alloys consisting of a combination of “fast” transition (TM) and “slow” rare-earth (RE) metals have been shown to exhibit an ultrafast all-optical switching mediated by the heat mechanism. The behavior of the characteristic time scales of coupled alloys is more complicated and is influenced by many parameters such as the intersublattice exchange, doping (RE) concentration, and the temperature. Here, the longitudinal relaxation times of each sublattice are analyzed within the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch framework. We show that for moderate intersublattice coupling strength both materials slow down as a function of <b>slow</b> (<b>RE)</b> material concentration. For larger coupling, the fast (TM) material may become faster, while the <b>slow</b> (<b>RE)</b> one is still slower. These conclusions may have important implications in the switching time of disordered ferrimagnets such as GdFeCo with partial clustering. Using atomistic modeling, we show that in the moderately coupled case, the reversal would start in the Gd-rich region, while the situation may be reversed if the coupling strength is larger...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{differentiation}} of populations having colonized formerly unsuitable habitats after the Pleistocene glaciations depends {{to a great}} extent on the speed of expansion. Slow dispersers maintain their refugial diversity whereas fast dispersal leads to a reduction of diversity in the newly colonized areas. During the Pleistocene, almost the entire current range of the land snail Arianta arbustorum has repeatedly been covered with ice or been subjected to permafrost. Owing to the low potential for dispersal of land snails, <b>slow</b> (<b>re)</b> colonization of the wide range from southern refugia can be excluded. Alternatively, fast, passive dispersal from southern refugia or survival in and expansion from multiple refugia within the area subjected to permafrost may account for the current distribution. To distinguish between these scenarios we reconstructed a phylogeography based on the sequences of a fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I from 133 individuals collected at 45 localities and analysed the molecular variance. Seventy-five haplotypes were found that diverged on average at 7. 52 arbustorum is an old species in which the population structure, isolation and the hermaphroditic nature have reduced the probability of lineage extinction. The genetic structure was highly significant with the highest variance partition found among regions. Geographic distance and mitochondrial differentiation were not congruent. Lineages had overlapping ranges. The clear genetic differentiation and the patchy pattern of haplotype distribution suggest that colonization of formerly unsuitable habitats was mainly achieved from multiple populations from within the permafrost area...|$|E
40|$|Clobenzorex is an anorexigenic {{drug that}} {{is widely used}} in Mexicofor the {{treatment}} of obesity, since it helps to reduce body weight. This drug is available as immediate release capsules. To improve compliance to treatment, it was devel oped a new slow release formulation. In order to establish its usefulness, oral pharmacokinetics and weight reduction of slow release and immediate release formulations of clobenzorex in obese patients were compared. Sixty patients with a BMI higher than 27 kg/m 2 {{were included in the}} study. Two groups of 30 patients were formed, one of them received 30 mg immediate release formulation b. i. d. and the other group received one 60 mg slow release formulation once a day, since under this scheme these formulations are prescribed. Blood samples were obtained at selected times during the first day and once weekly during 4 weeks. After the last dose, samples were obtained at selected times during 48 h. Plasma levels were determined by HPLC-MS/MS and pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained. Reduction in C max due to increased t max, as well as, increased half-life were observed with the slow release formulation in comparison with immediate release formulation. Although lower plasma levels of clobenzorex were reached with the slow release for mulation, reduction of body weight was similar with both products.

40|$|Batchelor (Phys. Fluids, vol. 12, 1969, p. 233) {{developed}} {{a theory of}} two-dimensional turbulence {{based on the assumption}} that the dissipation of enstrophy (mean-square vorticity) tends to a finite non-zero constant in the limit of infinite Reynolds number Re. Here, by assuming power-law spectra, including the one predicted by Batchelor's theory, we prove that the maximum dissipation of enstrophy is in fact zero in this limit. Specifically, as Re -> infinity, the dissipation approaches zero no <b>slower</b> than (ln <b>Re)</b> (- 1 / 2). The physical reason behind this result is that the decrease of viscosity enhances the production of both palinstrophy (mean-square vorticity gradients) and its dissipation - but in such a way that the net growth of palinstrophy is less rapid than the decrease of viscosity, resulting in vanishing enstrophy dissipation. This result generalizes to a rich class of quasi-geostrophic models as well as to the case of a passive tracer in layerwise-two-dimensional turbulent flows having bounded enstrophy.

This was viewed by elements in the press as an attempt to deflect attention from the fall of Dark Ivy, which received only scant mention during the rerun, pointing out that horses are, by nature herd animals and that a loose horse has a natural inclination to follow a herd of other horses. Such heavy comment about loose horses as a proof the horses are enjoying what they do became increasingly unfashionable in the decade that followed and is now rarely commented on.

40|$|We {{study the}} Lagrangian {{velocity}} and acceleration statistics of light particles (micro-bubbles in water) in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Micro-bubbles with {{a diameter of}} 340 microns and Stokes number from 0. 02 to 0. 09 are dispersed in a turbulent water tunnel operated at Taylor-Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 160 to 265. We reconstruct the bubble trajectories by employing three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). It is found that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the micro-bubble acceleration show a highly non-Gaussian behavior with flatness values in the range 23 - 30. The acceleration flatness values show an increasing trend with Re, consistent with previous experiments (Voth et al., JFM, 2002) and numerics (Ishihara et al., JFM, 2007). These acceleration PDFs show a higher intermittency compared to tracers (Ayyalasomayajula et al., Phys. Fluids, 2008) and heavy particles (Ayyalasomayajula et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2006) in wind tunnel experiments.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of platelets {{in the formation of}} a thrombus, their transport in complex flows has not yet been studied in detail. In this paper we simulated red blood cells and platelets to explore their transport behaviour in aneurysmal geometries. We considered two aneurysms with different aspect ratios (AR ¼ 1. 0, 2. 0) in the presence of fast and <b>slow</b> blood flows (<b>Re</b> ¼ 10, 100), and examined the distributions of the cells. Low velocities in the parent vessel resulted in a large stagnation zone inside the cavity, leaving the initial distribution almost unchanged. In fast flows, an influx of platelets into the aneurysm was observed, leading to an elevated concentration. The connection of the platelet-rich cellfree layer (CFL) with the outer regions of the recirculation zones leads to their increased platelet concentration. These platelet-enhanced recirculation zones produced a diverse distribution of cells inside the aneurysm, for the different aspect ratios. A thin red blood CFL that was occupied by platelets was observed {{on the top of the}} wide-necked aneurysm, whereas a high-haematocrit region very close to the vessel wall was present in the narrow-necked case. The simulations revealed that non-trivial distributions of red blood cells and platelets are possible inside aneurysmal geometries, giving rise to several hypotheses on the formation of a thrombus, as well as to the wall weakening and the possible rupture of an aneurysm...|$|R
40|$|Materials {{used for}} radiation-cooled rocket {{thrusters}} must {{be capable of}} surviving under extreme conditions of high-temperatures and oxidizing environments. While combustion efficiency is optimized at high temperatures, many refractory metals are unsuitable for thruster applications due to rapid material loss from the formation of volatile oxides. This process occurs during thruster operation by reaction of the combustion products with the material surface. Aerojet Technical Systems has developed a thruster cone chamber constructed of Re coated with Ir on the inside surface where exposure to the rocket exhaust occurs. Re maintains its structural integrity at high temperature and the Ir coating is applied as an oxidation barrier. Ir also forms volatile oxide species (IrO 2 and IrO 3) but at a considerably <b>slower</b> rate than <b>Re.</b> In {{order to understand the}} performance limits of Ir-coated Re thrusters, we are investigating the interdiffusion and oxidation kinetics of Ir/Re. The formation of iridium and rhenium oxides has been monitored in situ by Raman spectroscopy during high temperature exposure to oxygen. For pure Ir, the growth of oxide films as thin as approximately 200 A could be easily detected and the formation of IrO 2 was observed at temperatures as low as 600 C. Ir/Re diffusion test specimens were prepared by magnetron sputtering of Ir on Re substrates. Concentration profiles were determined by sputter Auger depth profiles of the heat treated specimens. Significant interdiffusion was observed at temperatures as low as 1000 C. Measurements of the activation energy suggest that below 1350 C, the dominant diffusion path is along defects, most likely grain boundaries, rather than bulk diffusion through the grains. The phases that form during interdiffusion have been examined by x ray diffraction. Analysis of heated test specimens indicates that the Ir-Re reaction produces a solid solution phase of Ir dissolved in the HCP structure of Re...|$|R
40|$|Sequential data (a. k. a. time-series) {{a rise in}} a {{multitude}} of {{different fields such as}} bi oinformatics, automatic speech recognition, roboti cs, computer vision, and computational finance. Wh ile the nature of the data generated in these appl ications is highly heterogeneous, the problems ari sing from such a wide range of fields reveal a str iking similarity when seen through the lens of pro babilistic time-series models. Most of the applica tion-specific problems fit in fact into one of the two main categories of algorithms developed for probabilistic time- series models: in ference (e. g. predict future values, estimate hidden variables from observab le ones, or partition a complex time-series in a s et of elementary segments) and learning (e. g. estimate time-series model para meters from observations, or discover pattern s or anomalies in time-series). In this thesis, a Bayesian treatment o f the uncertainties involved in time-ser ies models is adopted, and a set of probabili stic time-series models (that fall in the cat egory of switching models) is applied to four seemingly distant problems, namely¨ automatic segmentation of human gait time -series, classification of pathological g ait patterns, fault detection and recogni tion in robotic assembly tasks, and gas concentration estimation in unstructured envir onments using metal-oxide sensors. All these problems can be solved as inference or learning in a Bayesian time-series model, and have in common the crucial role that dom ain-specific expert knowledge plays in their¨ solution. The most attractive feat ure offered by the Bayesian framework is perh aps its potential to incorporate domain-s pecific expert knowledge either in the f orm of informative priors on the mod el parameters (to regularize the learning process), or in terms of tailored conditional independ ence assumptions between model variables (to simplify inference). The main goal of this thesis is to investigate to whic h extent this potential can be fulfilled, and to h ighlight the scientific and pragmatic challenges i dentified and/or solved during this quest. In ¨particular, two Bayesian time-series models¨ are used in this thesis: the sticky-Hiera rchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model ¨(sticky-HDP-HMM) and the Augmented¨ Switching Linear Dynamical System model (aSLD S). The sticky-HDP-HMM is used in the gait segmentation and gait pattern cl assification applications. In both applications, r esults show that combining the HDP-HMM to an ad-hoc pre-processing step of the ga it time-series allows to transfer clinical kn owledge about human gait into the time-series model. This combined approach improves the p erformances in both applications, with respec t {{to the use of the}} HDP-HMM in isol ation. Motivated by these results, an extensi on of the HDP-HMM, named POLY-HDP-HMM is prop osed in this thesis. The sticky-HDP -HMM is also used for fault detection and recognit ion in robotic assembly tasks to learn force/torqu e sensor signature models. These mod els are used to classify faulty and succ essful task executions, allowing the robot to react on-line to errors and undertake er ror-specific recovery strategies. Finally, t he problem of estimating gas concentration in ¨unstructured envi- ronments using MOX sensor s is formulated as inference in an aSLDS model. In this application, domain-specific¨ expert knowledge is directly used in the construct ion of the model itself, rather than in estimating ¨its parameters. The proposed aSLDS model is¨ effective in overcoming the <b>slow</b> dynamical <b>re</b> sponse of MOX sensors, therefore extending their r ange of applicability in field robotics scenarios. In this thesis, we show that the adopted Bayesian time-series models can take advan tage of some of the available domain-specific expert knowledge to improve inferen ce and learning results. However, it appears¨ clear that, especially in clinical appli cations, further improvement can be achieved¨ increasing the transfer of clinical know ledge to the models. For this reason, we prop ose and discuss extensions to the time-series mode ls used in this thesis, and introduce new ones. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|U radu se opisuje obnova, proširenje i izgradnja sakralnih građevina u selima unutrašnjosti Dalmacije za austrijske uprave u XIX. i početkom XX. stoljeća. U to vrijeme pokrajina je bila siromašna i zapuštena pa su potrebe bile velike, a sredstva ograničena. Vlasti su ulagale velike napore dok se pitanje nije riješiloDuring {{the almost}} entire {{nineteenth century and}} {{until the end of}} the World War I Dalmatia was a part of the Austrian Monarchy. The long lasting wars impoverished the region of Zagora, which even before was not a rich region. Because of such dearth ecclesiastical {{buildings}} were not maintained properly, and the new ones were rarity. On the other hand, demographic situation in Zagora in this period was marked by a significant increase of population, so the existing churches could not satisfy religious needs of the local people. Therefore the state took care of parish churches and other parish buildings with the funds from the certain foundations and with the material help of few local people. Plans for renovations and new constructions were implemented through the Ministry for religion and education placed in Vienna and Protectorate that was settled in Zadar. One of the most deserving architects in these projects was Ćiril Iveković, who in 1896 came to Zadar from Sarajevo and became referent for ecclesiastical constructions. Regional churches were mostly conducted by the members of the Franciscan order from the Province of the Holy Redeemer that had its centers in the monasteries in Split, Karin, Knin, Šibenik, Sinj, Imotski and Visovac. In the surroundings of Šibenik monastery in Visovac played a significant role and the entire construction was renovated in this period. Moreover, a new house was built in Konjevrati, as well as two new churches in Slivno and Dubrava. Similarly, churches in the surroundings of Trogir were in a bad shape, and in some of them there was no possible to preform service. However, government paid attention to this problem only in 90 s of the nineteenth century, when renovation stared in villages Prgomet, Labin, Trolokve, Prapatnica, Bristivica, Blizna and Ljubitovica. By the same token, in the hinterland of Split there were communities of Lećevice and Muć with numerous population and churches in rather bad condition. Namely, community of Lećevica had almost 6000 inhabitants, and churches in Lećevica, Korušci, Vinovo Gornje and Brštane could not be used. Also in community of Muć some reconstructions were conducted in Muć, Neorić, Sutina and Prugovo. Almost same situation was in the community of Dugopolje, placed between Split and Sinj, that belonged to the diocese of Split and Makarska. In the village with the same name there was only one small grave chapel and there was a plan to build there a new bigger church. However, since World War I broke out the church, dedicated to the St. Michael, was erected much later. Situation in the community of Omiš was a bit better, since there government has built several new churches at the beginning of the twentieth century. Similarly, in the district of Sinj government has built new parish churches in Vrlika and Hrvace, and church of St. Luke in Otok and St. Rocco in Udovičić. In other parts of Zagora (Drniš and Kning including their surroundings) situation was rather similar. Intensity of building was rather good in the surroundings of Imotski. Namely, in 1881 there was erected new convent church in neo-Romanesque style with three vessels, and in Ričice there was constructed new church of St. John the Baptist. Similarly, churches of Holy Spirit in Lovreć, Lady of Carmel in Runovići, together with several churches in the parish of Zagvozd were erected in this period. One of the fi rst Iveković 2 ̆ 7 s projects in Dalmatia was the church in Vrgorac. There existed an old church, which had been transformed into mosque during the Ottoman rule. When Venetian Republic invaded this region at the end of the seventeenth century this edifice became Christian church again, but by the end of the nineteenth century it became a ruin without roof. Thus, Iveković designed several possible solutions for the reconstruction. Renovation started in 1913, and ended only in 1921. Similarly <b>slow</b> were other <b>re</b> constructional projects, too, but by the beginning of the World War I sacral infrastructure in Zagora was mostly satisfying for the contemporary needs. The new parish churches and houses were spacious and well built. Most of them were built according to, for that time, usual neo-styles with some renaissance denotations...|$|R
