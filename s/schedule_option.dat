40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of jointly {{determining}} the order size and dynamic prices for a perishable inventory system over a finite time planning horizon when firms simultaneously provide customers with a prompt delivery option and a delivery <b>schedule</b> <b>option.</b> Customers are segmented into two types, namely spot purchase customers and the forward purchase customers. Demands for both types of customers are assumed to be time and price dependent. The decision-maker of the inventory system is assumed to apply pricing policies to stimulate demand to improve revenues under the condition that customers with forward purchases may cancel their orders. A mathematical model is developed to find the optimal number of price settings, the optimal dynamic prices and the order quantity. A solution procedure is found to determine the optimal decisions...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors of}} the paper argue that a multi-component {{approach}} and employment of software are required to assure successful management of the manufacturing process in the construction industry. The authors propose different alternative models of day-to-day control and production scheduling to be implemented into the production procedures at factories engaged in the manufacturing {{of a wide range}} of reinforced products. A peculiar feature of the proposed production procedures consists in the capability of a factory to produce different types of articles within one day, although at a certain moment of time only one type of articles is manufactured. The proposed model is used to develop a production schedule for the manufacturing of different articles for each day of a month to assure such throughput and daily stock of articles in the warehouse that could meet the demand for the products and structures in question. Presently, the criterion to serve as the basis for the computer-aided identification of the production schedule within the framework of the process of manufacturing of different articles should include maximal revenues; however, the final selection of the production <b>schedule</b> <b>option</b> should be made by decision makers on the basis of the feasibility study.

40|$|This study investigates three {{hypotheses}} simultaneously: 1) {{the timing}} of the executive stock option grant dates, 2) {{the timing of}} the news around those dates, and 3) whether the option grant dates are backdated retroactively. The data comes from the Amsterdam stock exchange. The empirical results provide evidence that that there are no significant abnormal cumulative returns in the period before the option grant date. However, we find significant abnormal cumulative returns during a period of 30 trading days after the option grant date, even for <b>scheduled</b> <b>options</b> granted before September 1, 2002. In addition, we have formed four different subsamples: <b>scheduled</b> and unscheduled <b>option</b> grants, and, accounting for a change of the rulings as of September 1 st, 2002 options granted before and after the latter date. Significant differences in the means of abnormal returns of the various sub samples are observed. These disappear for <b>scheduled</b> <b>option</b> grants after September 2002, but not for unscheduled option grants. The regression estimates for the periods before and after the introduction of stricter rulings in 2002 are consistent with our findings from the t-tests. The regressions run provide not only evidence that the option grants are timed, but also that the option grants are retroactively backdated. In addition, our findings show that earnings news releases around option grant dates are managed. Our findings are consistent with timing of news being a substitute for backdating option grants and {{the timing of the}} option grant date. Although after September 2002 stricter rulings regarding the option grant date reduce the opportunities to exploit private information, they do not disappear completely, notwithstanding the requirement of immediately publishing the option grants...|$|R

In each part, a semi-Bayesian D-optimal design for the conditional logit model was used to generate the choice sets. The choice data is analyzed using a conditional logit model (assuming homogenous preferences) as well as with a mixed logit model. The models predict the utility of watching a Belgian Pro League match – either on TV or in the stadium – for every possible <b>scheduling</b> <b>option.</b> We validate the predicted utilities against real audience rating and home attendance data.

40|$|Extant {{literature}} provides mixed {{evidence about}} whether managers preempt <b>scheduled</b> stock <b>option</b> grants with negative voluntary disclosures {{to reduce the}} strike price of the option (also known as “spring-loading” or “bullet-dodging”). This study {{contributes to the literature}} by illustrating that the use and type of preemptive news disclosures (otherwise known as “expectation management”) depends on the timing of the grant relative to the earnings announcement. Specifically, managers appear to disclose negative news prior to a <b>scheduled</b> <b>option</b> grant that occurs shortly before an earnings announcement but not when the grant occurs shortly after an earnings announcement. I conjecture that managers are more likely to preempt a scheduled grant occurring after an earnings announcement with positive news, but find limited evidence to support this hypothesis. Additionally, I demonstrate that the regulatory environment plays a role in the manager’s decision to engage in expectation management prior to a scheduled equity grant. Managers appear to be more likely to use downward expectation management following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and less likely after 2006 SEC regulation increasing executive compensation disclosure...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{attaining}} a better work life balance by more flexible schedule in human resource management. Each person has different work life division during the different phases of life. People hope that flexibility of work life balance {{is provided by}} improved human resource management arrangements.

The employers hope to satisfy these requirements by providing improved human resource arrangements while maintaining efficient and productive working environment. What are causing the work life imbalance for employees {{and what are the}} more efficient <b>options</b> of flexible <b>schedule</b> that the human resource department should take to attain better balanced work life division are two basic questions to address. Firstly, the study lists out the reasons for life work imbalance and the flexible <b>schedule</b> <b>options</b> by literature review.

We point to select scheduling advantages in NCS sys-tems under normal operating conditions, where content requests can be temporarily denied owing to finite system capacity from drive I/O access or storage redundancy limitations. NCS can lead to improvements in throughput and blocking probability due to increased immediate <b>scheduling</b> <b>options,</b> and complements other well documented NCS advantages such as regeneration, {{and can be used}} as a guide for future storage system design.

40|$|The project {{management}} procedures in SAS/OR R software {{have been growing}} in scope continuously over the years. The rst part of this paper brie y lists {{some of the new}} options that are available in the CPM, GANTT, and NETDRAW procedures. The major focus of the paper, however, is to describe and illustrate some of the more advanced scheduling features of the CPM procedure. The CPM procedure allows you to specify target dates, save baseline dates, update a project that is in progress, schedule subject to scarce resources, and perform several scheduling tasks. Each of these features of the procedure can be ne tuned according to your needs using the options available. To e ectively use any {{project management}} system, it is essential to understand the heart of the system; in particular, you need to understand how all the <b>scheduling</b> <b>options</b> work together. New Features Several new options have been added in Release 6. 07 (SAS Institute Inc., 1992). Some of the highlights are logic Gantt chart time scaled and zoned network diagram alternate resources in PROC CPM baseline schedules lag calendars activity delay Software Scheduling Project Consider a simple project in a software development department.
