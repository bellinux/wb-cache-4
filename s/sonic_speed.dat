5000|$|Near the <b>sonic</b> <b>speed</b> [...] the PG {{transformation}} {{features a}} singularity. The singularity is {{also called the}} Prandtl-Glauert singularity, and the flow resistance is calculated to approach infinity. In reality, aerodynamic and thermodynamic perturbations get amplified strongly near the <b>sonic</b> <b>speed,</b> but a singularity does not occur. An explanation {{for this is that}} the linearized small-disturbance potential equation above is not valid, since it assumes that there are only small variations in Mach number within the flow and absence of compression shocks and thus is missing certain nonlinear terms. However, these become relevant as soon as any part of the flow field accelerates above the speed of sound, and become essential near [...] The more correct nonlinear equation does not exhibit the singularity.|$|E
50|$|Propelling nozzles {{accelerate}} the available gas to subsonic, transonic, or supersonic velocities {{depending on the}} power setting of the engine, their internal shape and the pressures at entry to, and exit from, the nozzle.

50|$|A de Laval nozzle {{will only}} choke at the throat if the {{pressure}} and mass flow through the nozzle is sufficient to reach <b>sonic</b> <b>speeds,</b> otherwise no supersonic flow is achieved, and it will act as a Venturi tube; this requires the entry pressure to the nozzle to be significantly above ambient at all times (equivalently, the stagnation pressure of the jet must be above ambient).|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. <b>Sonic's</b> default <b>speed</b> was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing <b>Sonic's</b> <b>speed</b> caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{the nozzle}} {{pressure}} ratio further will not increase the throat Mach number above one. Downstream (i.e. {{external to the}} nozzle) the flow is free to expand to supersonic velocities; however Mach 1 {{can be a very}} high speed for a hot gas because the speed of sound varies as the square root of absolute temperature. This fact is used extensively in rocketry where hypersonic flows are required and where propellant mixtures are deliberately chosen to further increase the <b>sonic</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, {{in order}} for a flow to become supersonic, it must pass through a duct with a minimum area, or sonic throat. Additionally, an overall pressure ratio, Pb/Pt, of approximately 2 is needed to attain Mach 1. Once it has reached Mach 1, the flow at the throat is said to be [...] "choked." [...] Because changes downstream can only move upstream at <b>sonic</b> <b>speed,</b> the mass flow through the nozzle cannot be affected by changes in downstream conditions after the flow is choked.|$|E
50|$|In the {{reference}} frame {{in which the}} shock is stationary, the flow following the shock is subsonic. Because of this, energy release behind the shock is able to be transported acoustically to the shock for its support. For a self-propagating detonation, the shock relaxes to a speed given by the Chapman-Jouguet condition, which induces the material {{at the end of}} the reaction zone to have a locally <b>sonic</b> <b>speed</b> in {{the reference}} frame in which the shock is stationary. In effect, all of the chemical energy is harnessed to propagate the shock wave forward.|$|E

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional code validation tests of the LV test section showed uniform mean flow through the test section to <b>sonic</b> <b>speeds,</b> and fluctuating pressure measurements at subsonic speeds which are consistent with facilities with good flow quality...|$|R
50|$|At {{first glance}} this wave travel {{might seem to}} be blindingly fast and not very {{significant}} but a few calculations shows the opposite is true.In an intake runner at room temperature the <b>sonic</b> <b>speed</b> is about 1100 ft/s and traverses a 12 in port/runner in 0.9 milliseconds. The engine using this system, running at 8500 rpm, takes a very considerable 46 crank degrees before any signal from the cylinder can reach the runner end (assuming no movement of the air in the runner). 46 degrees, during which nothing but the volume of the port/runner supplies the demands of the cylinder. This not only applies to the initial signal but to any and every change in the pressure or vacuum developed in the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The R.A.E. Vickers Transonic Research Rocket was {{developed}} from the Miles M.52 a British supersonic research aircraft a project which was undertaken in top secrecy between 1942 and 1945 to a Ministry of Supply specification E.24/43. The project was cancelled because the Government {{of the day was}} persuaded that with the accumulation of data it was felt that the E.24/43 aircraft was unlikely to reach <b>sonic</b> <b>speed.</b> Wind tunnel model tests apparently indicated serious loss of longitudinal stability at high subsonic speed as was then characteristic of existing aircraft. The decision was reached to acquire preliminary experience of flight under transonic conditions using rocket-driven pilotless scale models.The Ministry of Supply (MOS) formed the Guided Projectile Establishment under W. P. Cooke at Westcott,Buckinghamshire, and the Rocket Propulsion Group under A. D. Baxter at RAE, Farnborough. Work commenced in applying German technology, with the Halstead Experimental Centre of the MOS monitoring commercial exploitation.|$|E
50|$|Seebass and George {{also worked}} on the problem from a {{different}} angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused (SR-71 Blackbird, Boeing X-43) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nosecone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed (bow shock), and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique flying wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at <b>sonic</b> <b>speed).</b> To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from 40000 ft to 60,000 feet (from 12,000 m to 18,000 m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.|$|E
500|$|Daytime levels {{focus on}} <b>Sonic's</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and to this}} extent, sees the player control Sonic through {{fast-moving}} stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of gameplay. 2D sections are reminiscent of the Mega Drive/Genesis-era Sonic games, where the player controls Sonic in a side-scrolling fashion, while 3D sections see the camera placed behind Sonic, so the player may move in all directions. In addition to moves available in past games, such as the Homing Attack, new moves are also introduced. For instance, a new sidestep feature known as the Quick Step is available, allowing Sonic to dodge left and right, and a Drift feature, which allows Sonic to make tighter turns without slowing down. The game also features a gameplay mechanic previously used in the Sonic Rush series called the Sonic Boost, which greatly increases <b>Sonic's</b> <b>speed,</b> allowing him to smash through objects, destroy enemies instantly, or even access different level paths. In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, an on-screen [...] "Ring Energy" [...] meter displays how much boost is available. The amount of boost remaining may be increased by collecting more rings, and is decreased by using the Boost. In contrast, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of the game represent available Boost using bars, which may be added by performing [...] "Action Chains", destroying multiple enemies in quick succession {{through the use of}} homing attacks, or by collecting rings. Japanese game company Dimps helped design some of the stages.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the central}} protagonist and main {{character}} of the comic, Sonic's personality differed slightly from his typical portrayals in other Sonic fiction; a flawed hero, he can act arrogant, rude and somewhat self-centred, being condescending towards Tails in particular (often referring to him as [...] "pixel brain"). Despite his flaws, Sonic will always rescue the innocent from danger when the situation arises. After Johnny Lightfoot's death {{at the hands of}} Chaos, Sonic blames himself and disappears for a short while, returning from his self-imposed exile with a less egocentric attitude and a stronger will. Sonic's origin was first used in 1991 in a Disney comic then now put into Sonic the comic. Sonic was once a brown hedgehog, he then one day met the scientist Dr.Kintobor who invented a machine powered by the mysterious power of the Chaos Emeralds. Dr. Kintobor also invented <b>Sonic's</b> trademark <b>speed</b> shoes to help amplify <b>Sonic's</b> <b>speed.</b> While testing Dr. Kintobor's invention, Sonic broke the sound barrier, giving him his looks and speed. The adaptation of Sonic Adventure led to Sonic's redesign to match his modern incarnation.|$|R

5000|$|As {{an object}} accelerates from subsonic toward {{supersonic}} speed in a gas, {{different types of}} wave phenomena occur. To illustrate these changes, the next figure shows a stationary point (M = 0) that emits symmetric sound waves.

5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the Sabres necessitated a move by the IAF to send the Folland Gnat fighters to the forward base of Pathankot. IAF used Mysteres flying at slow speed as bait to lure Sabres to attack where the waiting Gnats will take them on. Two sabres were scrambled but one had to turn back without entering the fight when the pilot couldn't jettison the fuel tanks. The other one flown by Flt Lt Yusaf Ali Khan, spotted the IAF planes and tried positioning himself behind them before attacking. Just as he got his cross-hairs on them he felt thuds on his own jet, as he was surrounded {{in a cloud of}} Gnats repeatedly being attacked. A Lockheed F-104 Starfighter lurking in the area was pointed to the dog fight by base control along with scrambling another one from base. The first Starfighter crossed through the dog fight at super <b>sonic</b> <b>speed.</b> The Gnats after scoring a kill started egressing. IAF's Squadron Leader Trevor J. Keelor of No. 23 Squadron claimed to have shot down the F-86 Sabre on that day (September 3), claiming the first air combat victory for the IAF of the war and subsequently received the Vir Chakra and the title of 'Sabre Slayer'. However the sabre he 'shot down' was flown in badly damaged condition and somehow rough landed back at the base. The Sabre pilot, Flt Lt Yusaf Ali Khan, was given Sitara-e-Jurat for surviving dog fight with six Gnats (while his wingman was ordered to leave since he couldn't jettison his fuel tanks) and bringing the damaged Sabre back home. In the same incident, an IAF Gnat pilot was overheard warning others of the incoming Starfighter. [...] Also, a Gnat piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, mistakingly landed at an abandoned airstrip in Pasrur, when he thought he had safely crossed the border. His takeoff attempt was aborted due to presence of a Pakistan army jeep on the runway. He was taken POW and later handed over to PAF. A Lockheed F-104 Starfighter flown by Flt Lt Hakimullah Khan chasing in at super <b>sonic</b> <b>speed</b> was also credited with forcing the Gnat down. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. after it was flown from Pasrur by Sqn Ldr Saad Hatmi who flew the captured aircraft back to Sargodha, and later tested and evaluated its flight performance, was of the personal view that Gnat was no 'Sabre Slayer' when it came to dog fighting.|$|E

40|$|Summary. [...] A {{method is}} {{developed}} for the calculation of the pressure ctistribution and the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a wing at incidence, a wing in (steady) roll and a wing in (steady) pitch. The calculation {{is based on the}} assumption of an inviscid potential flow and is restricted to small incidence and thickness ratio, so that quadratic terms in the perturbation velocities are neglected. The results are valid, if I 1 [...] M " I- A " is small compared to 1, i. e., either for any Nach number M for wings of a small aspect ratio el, or for any aspect ratio for <b>sonic</b> <b>speeds</b> (M N 1). The aerodynamic coefficients and stability derivatives l ~ and m ~ for a wing family which is described by the parameters aspect ratio A, taper ratio Z, andsweep ratio a (Fig. 8), are given in the form of charts. The calculation indicates, that the plan-form of the wing is of similar importance as regards the pressure distribution at <b>sonic</b> <b>speeds</b> as the chordwise section of a wing at subsonic speeds for wings of larger aspect ratios. Although the calculation {{is based on the assumption}} of an inv-iscid flbw without shock-waves, the results are thought to be useful for showing the main trends of the behaviour of a wing near the speed of sound. Plan-forms, which show rapid variations of the aerodynamic properties near Mach number M [...] 1 according to the potential theory, will have to be abandoned in favour of other planforms with more favourable characteristics...|$|R
