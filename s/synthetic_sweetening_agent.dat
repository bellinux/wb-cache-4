40|$|Objective: <b>Sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> {{have been}} {{recommended}} in position statements and consensus documents for procedural pain management in neonates; however, {{it is not}} clear if this has resulted in widespread adoption in clinical practice. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate unit-specific protocols for the use of <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents.</b> Methods: Structured telephone survey with qualified personnel in special care (level II) nurseries and neonatal intensive care (level III) units across Canada. The frequency and pattern of recommended use of <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> was documented. Results: Eighty-six of 92 units (93. 5 %) participated. Sixty-four percent recommended sucrose and 2. 3 % recommended glucose for procedural pain management; 87. 7 % had a guideline. <b>Sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> were most commonly recommended for venipuncture/ venous cannulation (91. 2 % for both), lumbar puncture (87. 7 %), and heel lance (82. 5 %). Dosing guidelines ranged from 0. 05 mL of 24 % sucrose solution to 3 mL of 25 % sucrose solution. Sweeteners were not recommended for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (77. 2 %) or those who were nil per os (75 %). Conclusions: <b>Sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> were recommended for procedural pain management in two-thirds of special care nurseries and neonatal intensive care units across Canada with extensive variability in specific dosing guidelines. Audits of pain management practices should therefore account for unit-specific practice guidelines. This study was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) research studentship to Ms A Yiu, a CIHR New Investigator Award to Dr A Taddio, and a CIHR Canada Research Chair in Health Psychology to Dr J Katz. The funding did not include any input into the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of data; preparation, review, or approval of manuscript.

40|$|AbstractThe {{safety of}} {{patients}} with epilepsy consuming <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents,</b> which is becoming increasingly prevalent for various reasons, is a topic that should be emphasized as sensitively {{as it is for}} other diseases. Patients with epilepsy consume <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> for different reasons such being diabetic or overweight. They can occasionally be exposed to <b>sweetening</b> <b>agents</b> unrestrainedly through consuming convenience food, primarily beverages. This study aimed to investigate the effects of rebaudioside A (Reb-A), which is a steviol glycoside produced from the herb Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni), on epileptic seizures and convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Forty-eight male rats were used. Twenty-four rats were administered 35  mg/kg PTZ to trigger epileptiform activity; the remaining 24 rats were administered 70  mg/kg PTZ to trigger the convulsion model. The epileptiform activity was evaluated by spike percentage, whereas convulsion was evaluated by Racine's Convulsion Scale and the onset time of the first myoclonic jerk. Statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease in the Racine's Convulsion Scale score and increase in the latency of first myoclonic jerk in a dose-dependent manner for the rat groups in which PTZ epilepsy had been induced and Reb-A had been administered. For the groups that were administered Reb-A, the spike decrease was apparent in a dose-dependent manner, based on the spike percentage calculation. These results indicated that Reb-A has positive effects on PTZ-induced convulsions...|$|R
