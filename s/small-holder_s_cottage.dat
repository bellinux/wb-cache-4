40|$|The Spatial Practices of Privilege {{focuses on}} the {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cottage</b> that stands {{on the grounds of}} the Breakers, in Newport, Rhode Island. Designed by Peabody and Stearns in 1886, the cottage was the first of several changes Cornelius Vanderbilt made to the property after he purchased it in 1885. While the main house (designed by Richard Morris Hunt after the first Breakers burned in 1892) has long been interpreted as the architectural reflection of the Vanderbilts 2 ̆ 7 class status, the cottage has been ignored. Bringing together the methodologies of cultural landscape studies, performance theory, and the history of childhood, Abigail A. Van Slyck argues that the estate played an active role in establishing, maintaining, and enhancing the family 2 ̆ 7 s class status, and that children - and their spatial management - were integral to the process. In its form and content, the cottage evoked middle-class domesticity, but did so in the service of an upper-class identity that sought to distinguish itself from the middle class. Ostensibly a site of play, it was also a place of work, both for the Vanderbilts 2 ̆ 7 servants as well as for the Vanderbilt offspring. Modeled on an almshouse and devoted to the homely skills of cooking and sewing, the building made claims to humbleness that were refuted by its size, expense, and its spatial arrangements that supported the Vanderbilt children and their parents in the performance of their privileged status...|$|R

40|$|My {{paintings}} rely on discovery [...] excavating {{into the}} surface to find the painting beneath. I work in an actual space that dimensionally inhabits the picture plane. The process begins with acrylic paint applied in thick layers, creating a sedimentation of color that is later unearthed. The painting emerges as I carve, gouge and dig away dry paint to reveal and investigate a world in paint alone. The process allows for a journey through {{the depth of the}} paint, subtracting and adding to the supports until the painting is ultimately resolved. I see the layers of paint revealing their own history, some layers becoming more significant than others. Thousands of paint chips are made in the creation of each painting, which become remnants of the process. Embedding these discarded chips into my next painting allows for a sense of shared history. Some of my process is predetermined, mapping out color layered substrates and other aspects of the painting arrive through an element of surprise, thought the process itself. I want the viewer to see the painting in multiple ways - in the way our memory allows us to experience the same place again in a slightly different way. The imagery comes from fragments of memories that I have collected throughout my life. Most of the memories are related to experiences that I have had in nature and with the people around me.

Present {{study focused on}} cultivation of S. commune on different wood substrates since it is not commercially cultivated. A pure culture of S. commune was obtained by growing a tissue of the mushroom on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium. Spawns were produced by growing the mycelium on paddy grains. Mushroom was cultivated on sawdust of seven different wood substrates. The maximum yield was observed in sawdust of jackfruit (Artocarpusheterophyllus) followed by sawdust of rambutan (Nepheliumlappaceum) and country almond (Terminaliacatappa). A significant difference was not observed when mango (Mangiferaindica) elephant apple (Dilleniaindica), tulip wood tree (Harpulliaarborea) and thungfaa (Alstoniamacrophylla) sawdust used as substrate. The lowest yield was observed in thungfaa (Alstoniamacrophylla) sawdust.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{a collection}} of five short stories and a critical essay. Each story focuses on an aspect of Westem Australia 2 ̆ 7 s colonial penal system between the years of 1853 and 1871 and foregrounds those who are conventionally marginalised or silenced in narratives of this time: the convict, the prison warder and the prison warder 2 ̆ 7 s wife. Using symbols of contested spaces, the stories highlight the nature of imprisonment {{as it applies to}} each of the characters. 2 ̆ 7 The Confession 2 ̆ 7 deals with themes of sexual jealousy, violence and forgiveness. Depicting a condemned murderer and a jaded prison warder, it attempts to show the potential for cruelty that lies beneath the surface of human beings, thus blurring the lines of demarcation between prisoner and free man. In 2 ̆ 7 Sunday Best 2 ̆ 7, a prison warder 2 ̆ 7 s wife must fight for space in the cramped Fremantle terrace cottage she and her husband share with another couple. The story foregrounds aspects of identity, and how old ideas of the self are useless and ultimately dismantled in the new culture. 2 ̆ 7 Punishment 2 ̆ 7 describes a flogging and its effect on both convict and prison warder. By using both points of view the story resists the idea of a centralist narrative and humanises that which is conventionally positioned as 2 ̆ 7 Other 2 ̆ 7 : the convict. 2 ̆ 7 The Verandah 2 ̆ 7 shows the construction of a verandah on a warder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cottage</b> in York. It highlights the possibility of reinvention, the formation of new social structures and the collapse of class boundaries in the new colony. 2 ̆ 7 Where Two Rivers Meet 2 ̆ 7 {{tells the story of a}} woman rescuing her daughter from a river. It explores ideas of where 2 ̆ 7 home 2 ̆ 7 is and the importance of familial connections. Using the motif of a woman merging with the landscape it suggests new possibilities for belonging. IV The c 1 itical essay focuses on how man-made structures such as houses, verandahs and prisons work in fiction and in the material world to reinforce an accepted social order. It also demonstrates how such structures can be read as metaphors for containment and entrapment, and how writers make use of these structures to dismantle colonial notions of identity. The essay examines three short stories: 2 ̆ 7 Cousin Lucy 2 ̆ 7 s Story 2 ̆ 7 by Ellen Liston, written circa 1860, 2 ̆ 7 The Ghost of Wanganilla: Founded on Fact 2 ̆ 7 by Ellen Augusta Chads (1891) and 2 ̆ 7 Conversation in a Pantry 2 ̆ 7 by Henry Handel Richardson (1934), and makes some connections with my stories 2 ̆ 7 Sunday Best 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 The Verandah 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Punishment 2 ̆ 7...|$|R

Am J Epidemiol 104 : 88 - 92, 1976. A double-blind controlled field trial of live, oral, streptomycin-dependent Shigella sonnei vaccine was begun in an institution with endemic S. sonnei disease. Considerable unexpected child-to-child transmission of the vaccine strains inadvertantly caused the field trial to resemble a mass vaccination campaign.

40|$|Agricultural {{practices}} are changing at an unprecedented rate in small {{pockets of the}} dry zone of Sri Lanka. Commercial vegetable production is flourishing underwritten by groundwater accessed via agro-wells, increased market access and new business opportunities. Since the early 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>small-holder</b> farmers have been excavating agro-wells for highland field irrigation and reaping unprecedented returns. Highland fields were previously subject to rain-fed shifting cultivation with long fallow periods. Water from agro-wells {{with the addition of}} chemical inputs, along with the advent of mobile phones, reliable road transport, new markets, greater access to credit and a more secure post-conflict environment, have now made frequent highland cropping viable and profitable. This has ignited the entrepreneurial spirit of farmers whose financial inputs and investments and labour is bringing rapid socio-economic transformation. In a country where the dry zone constitutes roughly a third of the land area, and where many dry zone households lack surface water for dry season cropping, these pockets of groundwater driven dry season production may pose a way out of poverty. While acknowledging the significant impact of agro-well-based farming in lifting farmers out of poverty, the paper ends on a cautionary note. This type of agricultural intensification is predicated on a social-ecological system linked to a specific institutional architecture and an aquifer with highly variable water availability. Current success in poverty alleviation masks an inherent fragility and risk that warrants further investigation before attempts are made to scale out groundwater based dry season farming {{to other parts of the}} dry zone.

This leads to spoilage {{and growth of}} pathogenic microorganisms in the food, thereby reducing its shelf life or spreading of food borne diseases. Several methods are tried and {{one of which is}} use of antimicrobial packaging. Here, papain, a protease enzyme, is covalently immobilized with the help of glutarldehyde on polyurethane and used as a food wrap to protect food from microbial contamination. Covalent immobilization of papain was achieved at a pH of 7. 4; temperature of 4 °C; glutaraldehyde concentration of 0. 5 %; incubation time of 24 h; and 50 mg of papain. The formation of-C=N-observed in the Fourier transform infrared spectrum confirmed the immobilization of the enzyme on the polymer. Immobilized enzyme retained higher activity than the native free enzyme. The modified polyurethane showed better reduction of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm than bare polymer film (eight folds reduction in live colonies, two times reduction in protein and 6 times reduction in carbohydrates). The efficacy of this was studied by wrapping it over <b>S.</b> aureus contaminated <b>cottage</b> cheese (paneer) and cheese and stored at a temperature of 4 °C for 7 days.

U vinskim regulama vidi on istodobno i utonuto kulturno dobro i izum tradicije i procese prepletanja dviju kultura.

The {{author has}} been {{inspired}} {{by the idea of}} Dunja Rihtman-Augustin that emphasizes the need of researching both present and past everyday life throughout the social strata. The theme of the paper are the wine statutes and table customs in northern Croatia [...] the traditional phenomenon that has been ignored by the scientific writings but is very much present in art literature. The statutes, as well as the wine associations, have escaped from the attention of classical, historically based ethnological (and folklore, too) research which had dealt mainly with the peasant culture. The wine statutes are "somewhere in- between" even today — although their origin could make them a part of European Latin Middle Ages, in Croatia they found their sinking way from the manor-houses, through bourgeois homes, to the peasant houses, wine-huts and today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> weekend <b>cottages</b> as gesunkenes Kulturgut [...] They can be found as a part of living Martinmas custom of baptising must, and {{as a part of a}} renewed tradition and tourist hotel attraction. The author follows the echoes of the wine statutes and wine associations in writings (and partly also in lives) of four great Croatian poets and prose-writers of nineteenth and twentieth centuries: romantic-realistic poet and prose-writer August Senoa (1838 — 1881), best known for themes from Croatian history; one of the rare noblemen among the Croatian realist writers, Ksaver Sandor Gjalski (1854 — 1934), whose short stories owe a lot to Turgenev, but also offer a detailed picture of everyday noblemen country world in the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje; then the greatest modernist writer - an aesthete, cosmopolitan and enfant terrible Antun Gustav Matos (1873 — 1914), and finally Miroslav Krleza (1893 — 1981), an erudite, leftist, and best-known Croatian writer of the 20 th century, the author of the matchless kaikavian ballads Balade Petrice Kerempuha [...] By trailing the excerpts from literary works, but also by having insight into scientific, popular and other publications, the author manages to sketch roughly the history of the wine statutes and drinking associations in northern Croatia, since the founding of the elitist aristocratic association Pinta in 1696, throughout the bourgeois stage of the invention of tradition during the last decades of the last and the beginning of this century, different editions of the prominent Krizevacki staluti, the attitude towards the wine customs and statutes during the socialist period, until the latest publishing undertakings and attempts of renewing bourgeois and aristocratic wine values that took place during the last couple of years. Having noted the pronounced processes of interweaving of two cultures, the constantly ambivalent position of wine statutes in changing "official" systems of social values, and having in mind the parody, "laughing" and "carnivalesque" character of the statutes, the author leans against the M.
