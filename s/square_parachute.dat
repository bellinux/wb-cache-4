50|$|Mieussy {{became known}} as the birthplace of {{paragliding}} when in June 1978 three friends Jean-Claude Bétemps, André Bohn and Gérard Bosson were inspired by an article on ‘slope soaring’ in the Parachute Manual magazine. They calculated that on a suitable slope, a <b>square</b> <b>parachute</b> could be inflated by running down a slope; Bétemps launched from Pointe du Pertuiset, Mieussy, and flew 100 m. Andre Bohn followed him and glided down to the football pitch in the valley 1000 metres below.6 ‘Parapente’ was born (pente being French for slope).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} e.g. some alpine skiers used a rebridled <b>square</b> <b>parachute</b> to ski upwind on a frozen bay in Erie, PA. In the late 1990s {{small groups of}} French and North American riders started pushing the {{boundaries}} of modern freestyle snowkiting. The Semnoz crew from France began hosting events at the Col du Lautaret and other European sites where the mountainous terrain lent itself to [...] "paragliding" [...] down the hills. In North America, riders were mainly riding snow-covered lakes and fields where tricks were being done on the flat ground, jumps, rails and sliders.|$|E
50|$|The {{oral and}} {{practical}} exams include questions about common rigging practices. The practical test consists of inspecting and repacking 20 reserves, along with hand sewing {{and a simple}} machine-sewn patch on a canopy. Candidates {{have the option of}} testing on back, chest, seat or lap type parachutes. The FAA does not distinguish between round and (modern) <b>square</b> <b>parachutes.</b>|$|R
50|$|CFLAWC {{currently}} delivers, {{as part of}} the Army National Individual Training Calendar, {{the following}} courses: the Arctic Operations Advisor Course, Drop Zone/ Landing Zone Controller, Aerial Delivery, Basic Helicopter Operations, Basic Parachuting, Jump Master, Parachute Instructor, Static Line <b>Square</b> <b>Parachuting,</b> the three different phases of Parachute Rigger training, the Advanced Mountain Operations Course, the Helicopter Insertion Instructor Course, Military Freefall Parachuting, Military Freefall Jump Master, Military Freefall Parachute Instructor and a revised Patrol Pathfinder Course.|$|R
50|$|The basic AM-490 program, {{which was}} using round parachutes since its conception, evolved {{with the use}} of modern piggy back {{container}} systems and <b>square</b> <b>parachutes</b> for both the main and reserve. Each student is equipped with a radio so all landings can be assisted from the ground. The basic program trains 1,200 students per year with the majority of positions given to USAF Academy cadets. ROTC cadets are assigned positions on an availability and timing basis.|$|R
50|$|The {{parachute}} landing fall is {{most commonly}} performed by jumpers who are using round canopies. Such parachutes allow less directional control and less lateral- or vertical-speed control than <b>square</b> <b>parachutes.</b> When <b>square</b> canopies are used, experienced jumpers can often land in a standing or short run position at a low vertical speed, so they can remain in a standing position on arriving at the ground. When arriving at greater vertical speed under a round canopy, the {{parachute landing fall}} prevents injuries to the feet, ankles, legs, hips, or upper body.|$|R
5000|$|Canadian Rigger As {{are limited}} to {{assembling}} and packing sport parachutes. They can replace components and do simple hand-sewing. At {{the end of the}} Rigger A Course candidates can choose to be tested on round or <b>square</b> <b>parachutes</b> and they can choose which type of container for their practical test (one-pin sport, two-pin sport, Pop-Top or chest). New CSPA Rigger A licensees are issued a temporary rating and must pack 10 reserves within the next 12 months to earn their [...] "continuous" [...] rating. Additional certifications are available to permit rigger As to pack tandem and Pilot Emergency Parachutes (PEP). The Rigger A1 and A2 sub-classes allow use of sewing machines to patch parachutes and change lines.|$|R
5000|$|André-Jacques {{held the}} {{position}} of Official Aeronaut of France and was unofficially known as the aérostatier des fêtes publiques, so the couple visited England in 1802 during the Peace of Amiens. They completed a number of demonstration flights, including his first flight ascending from the Volunteer Ground in North Audley Street, Grosvenor <b>Square</b> and a <b>parachute</b> descent to a field near St Pancras. [...] This {{gave rise to the}} popular English doggerel: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1963 Space Data Corporation (SDC) {{formed to}} provide small {{sounding}} rockets {{to the various}} defence agencies. They used the meteorological rockets and created an instrument payload for the Loki {{in place of the}} chaff dispenser. There were at least three variants of the instrument payload, PWN-10, PWN-11, and PWN-12. [...] The instruments consisted primarily of a thermistor to collect temperature, which was broadcast via a small radio operating in the 1680 MHz Meteorological Band. Altitude was tracked from the ground, by reflecting radar off the probe's [...] "starute", a <b>square</b> mylar <b>parachute</b> and radar reflector, or with the PWN-10 by means of a ranging transponder. The SDC version was slightly heavier than the original Loki in order to improve stability during [...] "cruise", which lowered maximum altitude by about 10,000 ft. Production of the Loki Datasonde started in 1966, and more than 20,000 were built until production ended in 1985.|$|R
500|$|The pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{externally}} {{similar to the}} Fat Man bomb in size and shape, and both had the same [...] California <b>Parachute</b> <b>square</b> tail assembly and single-point attachment lug. The pumpkin bomb had three contact fuzes arranged in an equilateral triangle around {{the nose of the}} bomb while the atomic bomb had four fuse housings. The atomic bomb had its shell sections bolted together and sealed with externally-applied, sprayed-on liquid asphalt, but most if not all of the pumpkin bombs were welded, with a [...] hole used for filling the shell. The Fat Man also had four external mounting points for radar antennas which the pumpkin bombs did not have.|$|R
40|$|A 40 -foot-nominal-diameter (12. 2 meter) disk-gap-band {{parachute}} was flight tested {{as part of}} the NASA supersonic {{high altitude}} parachute experiment (SHAPE) program. The test parachute (which included an experimental energy absorber in the attachment riser) was deployed from an instrumented payload by means of a deployment mortar when the payload was at a Mach number of 3. 31 and a free-stream dynamic pressure of 10. 6 pounds per square foot (508 newtons per <b>square</b> meter). The <b>parachute</b> deployed properly, the canopy inflating to a full-open condition at 1. 03 seconds after mortar firing. The first full inflation of the canopy was immediately followed by a partial collapse with subsequent oscillations of the frontal area from about 30 to 75 percent of the full-open frontal area. After 1. 07 seconds of operation, a large tear appeared in the cloth near the canopy apex. This tear was followed by two additional tears shortly thereafter. It was later determined that a section of the canopy cloth was severely weakened by the effects of aerodynamic heating. As a result of the damage to the disk area of the canopy, the parachute performance was significantly reduced; however, the parachute remained operationally intact throughout the flight test and the instrumented payload was recovered undamaged...|$|R
40|$|Transonic wind-tunnel {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with modified cross, hemisflo, and disk-gap-band parachute models {{in the wake of}} a cone-cylinder shape forebody. The basic cross design was modified with the addition of a circumferential constraining band at the lower edge of the canopy panels. The tests covered a Mach number range of 0. 3 to 1. 2 and a dynamic pressure range from 479 Newtons per square meter to 5746 Newtons per <b>square</b> meter. The <b>parachute</b> models were flexible textile-type structures and were tethered to a rigid forebody with a single flexible riser. Different size models of the modified cross and disk-gap-band canopies were tested to evaluate scale effects. Model reference diameters were 0. 30, 0. 61, and 1. 07 meters (1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 5 ft) for the modified cross; and nominal diameters of 0. 25 and 0. 52 meter (0. 83 and 1. 7 ft) for the disk-gap-band; and 0. 55 meter (1. 8 ft) for the hemisflo. Reefing information is presented for the 0. 61 -meter-diameter cross and the 0. 52 -meter-diameter disk-gap-band. Results are presented in the form of the variation of steady-state average drag coefficient with Mach number. General stability characteristics of each parachute are discussed. Included are comments on canopy coning, spinning, and fluttering motions...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were made}} to study the water-landing and certain grounds-surface landing {{characteristics}} of a Gemini spacecraft model. The water landing experiments were made by simulating paraglider and parachute letdowns with two 1 / 6 - scale model configurations. Parameters included various combinations of attitude, horizontal speed, vertical speed, and landing skids extended and retracted. Investigations were made in calm water and in waves. The paraglider landings at horizontal speeds of 63 feet per second (19. 8 m/sec) {{which resulted in a}} noseover or tumbling shortly after initial water contact. The maximum longitudinal acceleration of the model in calm water was about 14 g units, and the maximum angular acceleration was 66 radians per second <b>squared.</b> In the <b>parachute</b> landings with the heat shield forward, the model skidded along the water surface on the heat shield. Parachute landings with the small end forward resulted in behavior {{similar to that of the}} paraglider landings. The ground-surface landings were made with a 1 / 3 -scale model by simulating a parachute letdown with braking rockets, which were fired prior to touchdown to dissipate vertical velocity. In these landings, control of timing and aligning the rockets on the model was very critical, and violent behavior resulted when either rocket alignment or timing was in error. In the landings that were correctly controlled, the model either remained upright or slowly rolled over on its side...|$|R
