The electron-paramagnetic-resonance data are compatible with two orientations of the principal g-axes in the copper center, {{one of which is}} preferred on the basis of an analysis of the copper coordination and the d-orbitals that are involved in the unpaired-electron orbital. For this orientation, the principal z-axis of the g-tensor makes an angle of 19 ° with the Cu-N(His 112) bond and the N of His 112 may be considered the axial ligand. The singly occupied molecular orbital contains a linear combination of copper dxy and dyz-orbitals, which are antibonding with atomic orbitals of histidine nitrogens and diethyldithiocarbamate <b>sulfurs.</b> The orientation of the g-tensor for the quercetin 2, 3 -dioxygenase is compared with that for type 1 copper sites...|$|R

40|$|Metallodithiolate ligands play an {{important}} role in providing the appropriate electronic environment for the catalytic function of various metalloenzymes; acetyl coA synthase serves as paradigm. Using tetradentate N_(2) S_(2) ligands to bind transition metals, a library of well-characterized synthetic analogues has been established. These metal-bound cis-dithiolates, display a wide range of reactivity, including S-based metallation, oxygenation, and alkylation. <b>Sulfur?s</b> affinity for gold(I) is well known and typically follows Pearson?s HSAB theory. With this in mind, the NiN_(2) S_(2) moieties were used to synthesize propeller-type nickel-gold complexes within a group of [Ni(N_(2) S_(2)) _(x) Au_(y) ] (x = 1 or 2; y = 1, 2, or 4) complexes. The solid-state molecular structures of these square planar cis-dithiolate nickel complexes to which gold(I) is bound contain within them classical aurophilic interactions. Electrochemical studies reveal a positive shift in the Ni^(II/I) couple for the [Ni(N_(2) S_(2)) _(x) Au_(y) ] complexes as compared to the NiN_(2) S_(2) precursors. The incorporation of the paramagnetic vanadyl ion, [V?O]^(2 +), in N_(2) S_(2) motifs has been studied in our laboratory. Previous studies of M(N_(2) S_(2)) complexes where M is Ni^(2 +), ZnCl^(+), and Fe(NO) with the W(CO) _(x) reporter unit have been explored to determine the donor ability of these metallodithiolate ligands. According to their response or binding to a tungsten carbonyl unit, we have found that the <b>sulfurs</b> of the dianionic [(V?O) (ema) ]^(2 -) are activated as nuclephilies. To further investigate the donor ability of the neutral vanadyl-bound thiolate <b>sulfurs,</b> the oxidized {Fe(NO) _(2) }^(9) unit was used. Cleavage of the (?-I) _(2) [Fe(NO) _(2) ]_(2) dimer (in the {Fe(NO) _(2) }^(9) form) was achieved with two metalloligands, Ni(bme-daco) and (V?O) bme-daco, and also N-heterocyclic carbene, IMes. Using infrared spectroscopy, the ?(NO) stretching frequencies of the LFe(NO) _(2) I (L = Ni(bme-daco), (V?O) bme-daco, and IMes) complexes were used to report the donor ability of the ligands. Cyclic voltammetry for the LFe(NO) _(2) I complexes show a more accessible {Fe(NO) _(2) }^(9 / 10) couple for stronger donors. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of the LFe(NO) _(2) I complexes demonstrate super-hyperfine coupling of the ^(127) I to the unpaired electron on iron, and complex equilibria that indicates dissociation of the metallodithiolate ligand from the dinitrosyl iron unit...|$|R
