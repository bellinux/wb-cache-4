40|$|AeSTiACr: From {{a review}} of the recent {{literature}} and our own observations, the different morphologies of needle-fiber calcite are classified. They can be characterized as monocrystalline rods (with or without serrated edges) or as polycrystalline chains. The simplest monocrystailine habit of needle-fiber calcite is the individual micro-rod (M). Larger monoerystalline rods (MA) exist in multiples of two. More complex forms are found as paired monocrystalline rods with <b>serrated</b> <b>plates</b> along their length (MB). This group includes three habits, which can be distinguished by the number of plates and their orientation relative to the rod. Finally, there is a moan-crystalline form (MAB), intermediate between the categories MA and MB, which shows the transition from the simple coupled rods to rods with <b>serrated</b> <b>plates.</b> Although polycrystalline needles (P) have rarely been re-ported in the literature, three types of morphologies have been identified. Each type of crystal has a specific origin. The M micro-rods are phys-icochemical nuclei or calcified bacteria. They do not seem to evolve toward...|$|E
40|$|Evidence of wall {{slip and}} {{magnitude}} of yield stress are examined for colloidal gels consisting of hydrophobic silica, polyether, and lithium salts using geometries with serrated, smooth, hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. <b>Serrated</b> <b>plates,</b> which provide minimal wall slip, are used to compare different methods of measuring yield stress: conventional extrapolation of shear stress in steady shear experiments and dynamic experiments at large strain amplitudes. In the latter, the yield stress is denoted by the maximum in the elastic stress, {{the product of the}} elastic modulus and strain (G 8 g), when plotted as a function of strain amplitude. Although excellent agreement is observed in the yield stress values using both these techniques, the dynamic method seems preferable considering its experimental ease, accuracy, and lack of extrapolation. In the presence of smooth geometries, the silica gels show evidence of wall slip with a concomitant decrease in yield stress. Using underestimation of yield stress as a measure of wall slip, we find slip to be unaffected by changes in the gel modulus obtained through incorporation of additional silica or salts. The use of smooth surfaces compared to serrated surfaces leads to approximately a 60 % reduction in yield stress for all such samples. Finally, control of wall slip is attempted using plates modified to have different surface energies. Hydrophobic plates reduce slip significantly and produce data comparable to those with the <b>serrated</b> <b>plates.</b> In contrast, hydrophilic plates have minimal effect on slip and produce data analogous to those obtained using smooth plates. These results can be explained {{based on the fact that}} the particle-lean layer, responsible for slip, remains so with hydrophilic plates as it repels the hydrophobic silica particles in favor of the polar solvent. In contrast, the hydrophobic silica interacts with the hydrophobic plates, thus reducing slip. © 2003 The Society of Rheology...|$|E
40|$|Mozzarella {{cheese is}} a pasta filata type of cheese. Its {{manufacture}} includes a kneading – stretching step {{that creates a}} fibrous protein network and distributes fat-serum channels to attain desirable melt functionality on a pizza. During processing and manufacturing of pasta-filata cheese, large deformations take place. For appropriate characterization of a food material, rheological evaluation should be conducted in similar operating conditions, length scales and time scales to those {{taking place in the}} actual process. Development of the typical fibrous pasta-filata structure of mozzarella cheese depends on composition and process variables. Critical process variables in the development of cheese structure are time, temperature and shear. In this study we studied the effect of shear work on rheology, structure and melt functionality of model Mozzarella cheese. Three types of model cheeses (full-fat, non-fat and full-fat with added tri-sodium citrate) were prepared by working cheese components together at 70 oC in a twin screw Blentech cooker. Varied amounts of shear work input (2. 8 - 185 kJ/kg) were given to the cheese samples using 50, 150 and 250 rpm screw speeds. Samples were subjected to a range of rheological tests, confocal laser scanning microscopy, fat particle size measurements (DLS) and melt functionality evaluation. While measuring steady shear viscosity of Mozzarella-type cheeses in a rotational rheometer at 70 oC, three main difficulties were encountered; wall slip, structural failure during measurement and viscoelastic time dependent effects. A flow curve method was successfully devised to measure steady shear rheology by using <b>serrated</b> <b>plates</b> as surface modification to avoid wall slip, giving enough measurement duration at low shear rate to avoid viscoelastic effects and selecting limited shear steps to cause minimum structural changes. These techniques enabled successful measurement of steady shear viscosity of molten Mozzarella-type cheeses at 70 oC at shear rates up to 250 s- 1. Strong work thickening was observed for full fat Mozzarella cheese from steady shear rheology, oscillatory rheology, creep, elongational viscosity and tensile testing data. Steady shear rheology and melt functionality were found to be strongly dependent on total shear work input. An exponential increase in consistency coefficient (K from power law model) was observed with increasing amounts of accumulated shear work, indicating work thickening behaviour. An exponential work thickening equation is proposed to describe this behaviour. Excessively worked cheese samples exhibited liquid exudation, poor melting and poor stretch. Nonfat cheese exhibited similar but smaller changes after excessive shear work input. At lower shear work inputs (70 kJ/kg) it behaved like a viscoelastic solid with low frequency dependence. A definite critical point for structural and viscoelastic transition was identified at a medium shear work level (~ 58 kJ/kg at 150 rpm). Similar viscoelastic property changes occurred in non-fat cheese suggesting that major changes were taking place in the protein matrix during working. Confocal microstructures plus macroscopic observations showed systematic changes in structure with increased shear work inputs with unmixed buttery liquid observed at 58 kJ/kg. At very high shear work inputs, > 75 kJ/kg, striations or anisotropy in the microstructures had disappeared and small micro-cracks were evident. Volume-weighted mean fat particle size decreased with shear work input and particle size distributions also changed. To account for the short and long term relaxation response behaviour, a 4 -element Burger‘s model was found adequate for fitting the creep data of model cheese at 70 oC but a 6 -element model was required at 20 oC. As shear work input increased, retarded compliance decreased and zero shear viscosity increased indicating the more elastic behavior of the cheeses with higher shear work input. Fracture stress and strain for longitudinal samples from elongated full fat cheese did not vary significantly with shear work input up to 26. 3 kJ/kg then decreased dramatically at 58. 2 kJ/kg. Longitudinal samples with shear work input G‘ > elongational viscosity > consistency coefficient, K. It was concluded that the dominant contributor to the changes in rheology, structure and melt properties with increased shear work was shear induced structural changes to the protein matrix. An increase in calcium induced protein-protein interactions after high shear work at 70 oC. In summary, this thesis provides useful insights to shear work induced changes in material properties. It proposes useful linkages between the manufacturing process and the application of model Mozzarella cheese using appropriate rheological methods. Since the linkages were validated for only one composition and in only one processing environment, it is proposed that they should be tested in other conditions. In order to build a more complete picture, a molecular level study is proposed for future work to elucidate chemical changes during working and find appropriate linkages with physical and functional characteristics...|$|E

The refrigerant flows in three passes and the air flows in a single pass. The principle of the model was to divide the evaporator into 3 zones corresponding {{to each of the}} three refrigerant flow passes and to divide the third zone (the last zone before the refrigerant leaves the evaporator) into two sub zones - the two-phase sub zone and the single phase vapor sub zone. The fluid properties in a given zone are considered to be constant and uniform in that zone. The energy conservation equations were solved in each zone. Each zone's air flow outlet properties were the airflow inlet properties for the next zone while each zone's refrigerant outlet properties were the refrigerant inlet properties for the next zone.

40|$|Oscillatory data {{obtained}} for mashed potatoes made from fresh tubers from measuring geometries of different designs and sizes were analyzed and compared at the sample temperatures of 25 and 55 C. The measuring geometries used were smooth parallel plates (PP 40 and PP 20, 40 - and 20 -mm-diameter plates, respectively); truncated cone and plate (CP 4 / 40, 40 -mm-diameter cone having an angle of 4 °); FL 25 four-bladed vane tool (diameter: 25 mm, height: 55 mm); and <b>serrated</b> parallel <b>plate</b> (SPP 40, 40 -mm-diameter plate). Three different gaps between plates were used (2, 1. 5 and 1 mm) {{to simulate the}} range of aggregate spacing in fresh mashed potatoes. The measured oscillatory rheological properties were significantly affected {{not only by the}} sample temperature but also by the test geometry used and the friction of and gap between its shearing surfaces. Dynamic parameter values were higher at 55 than at 25 C, possibly indicating the onset and propagation of gelatinization of the potato starch grains. Unexpectedly, test geometries with higher friction capabilities, such as the <b>serrated</b> <b>plate</b> and vane tool, presented lower viscoelastic properties compared with results of other test geometries with lower friction capabilities. This result provides evidence of the influence of other factors on the measured oscillatory rheological properties of the mashed potato, such as measurement accuracy of the rheometer at different very small strains, homogeneity of the temperature for the different samples, existence of a complex dependency on the possibly complex stress condition that is imposed on the material upon loading, or even samples being prone to drying. The effect of the variation of the gap between parallel plates on oscillatory parameters depended on the shearing wall friction. The study highlights the difficulty in reconciling rheological results from different sources and the need for standardized rheological test methods so that rheological interlaboratory results can be critically analyzed and compared. © 2007, The Author(s); Journal compilation © 2007, Blackwell Publishing.

The shear dependent behaviour was examined at different concentrations ranging from 33 to 48 %, by weight. Viscosity data treatment was performed to determine the most suitable rheological model to provide the best approximation of the debris-flow behaviour.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the rheological behaviour of three different lead-free solder pastes used for surface mount applications in the electronic industry. Design/methodology/approach – This study concerns the rheological measurements of solder paste samples and is made up of three parts. The first part deals with the measurement of rhelogical properties with three different measuring geometries, the second part looks into the effect of frequencies on oscillatory stress sweep measurements and the final part reports on the characterisation and comparison of three different types of Pb-free solder pastes. Findings – Among the three geometries, the <b>serrated</b> parallel <b>plate</b> was found effective in minimising the wall-slip effect. From the oscillatory stresssweep data with different frequencies; it was observed that the linear visco-elastic region is independent of frequency for all the solder paste samples. To understand the shear thinning behaviour of solder paste, the well known Cross and Carreau models were fitted to the viscosity data. Moreover,creep-recovery and dynamic frequency-sweep tests were also carried out without destroying the sample’s structure and have yielded useful information on the pastes behaviour. Research limitations/implications – More extensive research is needed to fully characterise the wall-slip behaviour during the rheological measurements of solder pastes. Practical implications – The rheological test results presented in this paper will be of important value for research and development, quality control and facilitation of the manufacturing of solder pastes and flux mediums. Originality/value – This paper shows how wall-slip effects can be effectively avoided during rheological measurements of solder pastes.

40|$|The {{market for}} solder paste {{materials}} in the electronics sector is very large and consists of material and equipment suppliers and end users. These materials are used to bond electronic components (e. g. flip-chip, BGA) to printed circuit boards (PCB’s) {{across a range of}} dimensions where the solder interconnects can be 50 microns to 1 mm in size. For materials suppliers, the trends in the market are towards environmentally friendly materials (e. g. lead-free solders) that can be used at ever-smaller dimension where the properties of the materials must ensure reliable product performance. Equipment suppliers, for example printing machine manufacturers, are continually updating their equipment characteristics to ensure better print yield of solder paste onto a PCB. Whilst the End Users must ensure that the combination of materials and equipment used will provide the required product quality in terms of reliable interconnection performance. This study concerns the rheological characterisation of different lead-free solder paste formulations used for flip-chip interconnections, and is made up of three parts. The first part deals with the measurement of rheological properties with three different measuring geometries, the second part looks into the effect of frequencies on oscillatory stress sweep measurements and the final part reports on the characterisation and comparison of three different lead-free solder paste formulations.

Our study shows that of the three <b>plate</b> geometries evaluated,the <b>serrated</b> parallel <b>plate</b> geometry was more effective in minimizing the wall-slip. Our results also show that for the oscillatory stress-sweep measurement, the linear visco-elastic region (LVR) is independent of frequency for the three solder paste formulations.

40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal self-lock nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal self-lock nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge.
