5000|$|In contrast, newer [...] "constant mesh" [...] {{transmissions}} use gears {{that are}} held axially, but gears on one shaft spin freely on the <b>shaft.</b> <b>Gear</b> pairs in the transmission {{are always in}} mesh, though at most one is engaged at any time.

5000|$|Truck {{transmissions}} use many physical layouts. For example, {{the output}} of an N-speed transmission may drive an M-speed secondary transmission, giving a total of N*M gear combinations; for example a 4-speed main box and 3-speed splitter gives 12 ratios. Transmissions may be in separate cases with a shaft in between; in separate cases bolted together; or all in one case, using the same lubricating oil. The second transmission is often called a [...] "Brownie" [...] or [...] "Brownie box" [...] after a popular brand. With a third transmission, gears are multiplied yet again, giving greater range or closer spacing. Some trucks thus have dozens of gear positions, although most are duplicates. Sometimes a secondary transmission is integrated with the differential in the rear axle, called a [...] "two-speed rear end". Two-speed differentials are always splitters. In newer transmissions, there may be two countershafts, so each main <b>shaft</b> <b>gear</b> can be driven from {{one or the other}} countershaft; this allows construction with short and robust countershafts, while still allowing many gear combinations inside a single gear case.|$|E
5000|$|For the He 177, Günter {{decided to}} employ {{two of the}} complex Daimler-Benz DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] setups for propulsion. He had already {{employed}} these engines on the record-breaking Heinkel He 119 reconnaissance aircraft prototypes. They consisted {{of a pair of}} DB 601 liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted-vee inline engines mounted side by side in a nacelle - for the He 119, centrally within the fuselage, just behind its heavily glazed cockpit enclosure - driving one propeller. The two engines were inclined inwards by 30° when mounted onto either side of their common, vertical-plane space-frame primary engine mount, so that the inner cylinder banks were disposed almost vertically. A common gear-housing connected the front ends of the two crankcases, with the two crankshaft pinions driving a single airscrew <b>shaft</b> <b>gear.</b> The outer sides of each of the component engines' crankcases were connected to the nacelle firewall through forged mountings similar to what would be used for either a single DB 601 or DB 605 engine-powered aircraft installation. When combined with the central space-frame mount designed especially for the [...] "power system" [...] format, this resulted in a Daimler-Benz [...] "coupled" [...] twin-crankcase [...] "power system" [...] having a trio of engine mount structures within its nacelle accommodation. The starboard DB 601 component engine had to be fitted with a mirror-image version of its mechanically driven centrifugal supercharger, drawing air from the starboard side of the engine. Two of the DB 606s, each of which initially developed 2,600 PS (2,564 hp, 1,912 kW) for take-off and weighing some 1,515 kg (3,340 lb) apiece, were to power the He 177. The DB 606 — and its eventual replacement, the Daimler-Benz DB 605-based [...] "DB 610" [...] — were to be the only two production German aviation powerplants designed to surpass 1,500 kW of power, something that the Germans had considerable challenges in developing during the war into production-ready, combat-reliable aviation engines.|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques in condition evaluation of wind turbine equipped with gearbox. On the other side, gearbox {{is one of the}} key components of wind turbine drivetrain. Due to the stochastic operation of wind turbines, the gearbox shaft rotating speed changes with high percentage, which limits the application of traditional vibration signal processing techniques, such as fast Fourier transform. This paper investigates a new approach for wind turbine high speed <b>shaft</b> <b>gear</b> fault diagnosis using discrete wavelet transform and time synchronous averaging. First, the vibration signals are decomposed into a series of subbands signals with the use of a multiresolution analytical property of the discrete wavelet transform. Then, 22 condition indicators are extracted from the TSA signal, residual signal, and difference signal. Through the case study analysis, a new approach reveals the most relevant condition indicators based on vibrations that can be used for high speed <b>shaft</b> <b>gear</b> spalling fault diagnosis and their tracking abilities for fault degradation progression. It is also shown that the proposed approach enhances the gearbox fault diagnosis ability in wind turbines.
