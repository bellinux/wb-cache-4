In 1936, testing began of three further V3 prototypes, built in Porsche's Stuttgart shop. A batch of thirty W30 development models, produced for Porsche by Daimler-Benz, underwent 1800000 mi of further testing in 1937. All cars had the distinctive round shape and the air-cooled, rear-mounted engine. Included in this batch was a rollback soft top called the Cabrio Limousine. A further batch of 44 VW38 pre-production cars produced in 1938 introduced split rear windows; both the <b>split</b> <b>window</b> and the dash were retained on production Type 1s until 1953.

50|$|In about 1966, Gamda {{partnered with}} another firm, Koor, which {{was owned by}} the Histradrut, the Israeli trade union (Schellekens 2003). This formed a company called Gamda Koor Export (Bickford 2013). The new company mainly existed to {{introduce}} {{a new line of}} mainly American automobiles aimed at foreign markets. At the time, export taxes had been lowered, helping Israeli businesses to break into international markets (Model Marque 2010). These were called Sabra Super Cars and were mainly unique tooling of vehicles not made by other European model makers. Most Sabras were manufactured between 1969 and 1972, but some perhaps a tad earlier (Richardson 1999, p. 161). There were 24 models in the series and they were numbered from 8100 to 8123 (Schellekens 20003). Models included a 1965 Plymouth Barracuda, a 1966 Charger, a 1965 Chrysler Imperial convertible (Corgi Toys also offered a convertible Imperial, see comparison below), a 1966 Buick Riviera, a 1965 Corvette Coupe (not <b>split</b> <b>window,</b> but the convertible hardtop), a 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle station wagon, a 1966 Olds Toronado, a 1967 Cadillac Eldorado, a 1967 Cadillac Coupe deVille, a 1967 Pontiac GTO, a 1968 Pontiac Firebird, a 1967 Chevy pickup and tow truck, a 1965 Ford Mustang, a Ford GT, a 1967 Ford Torino, a 1966 Chevrolet Impala coupe, a 1967 Camaro, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird, a Volkswagen Beetle and a Jeep Willys. Models were often available in a stock, police, or taxi livery. Some of these, like the Barracuda, Charger, Torino and GTO are more rare and sought after.|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{applications}} require processing high-volume on-line {{streams of}} numerical data from instruments and simulations. We present an extensible stream database {{system that allows}} scalable and flexible continuous queries on such streams. Application dependent streams and query functions are defined through an Object-Relational model. Distributed execution plans for continuous queries are described as high-level data flow distribution templates. Using a generic template we define two partitioning strategies for scalable parallel execution of expensive stream queries: <b>window</b> <b>split</b> and <b>window</b> distribute. <b>Window</b> <b>split</b> provides operators for customized parallel execution of query functions whose complexity depends on size of the data units on which they are applied. It reduces the size of stream data units using application dependent functions as parameters. By contrast, window distribute provides operators for customized distribution of entire data units without reducing their size. We evaluated these strategies for a typical high volume scientific stream application and show that <b>window</b> <b>split</b> is favorable when computational resources are limited, while window distribute is better when there are sufficient resources. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} algorithm for cloud field detection {{over the}} Antarctic region is presented. The algorithm {{is a combination}} of a conventional <b>split</b> <b>window</b> method and a spatial coherence method. The conventional <b>split</b> <b>window</b> method utilizes the brightness temperature and the brightness temperature difference between <b>split</b> <b>window</b> channels. The spatial coherence method makes use of the standard deviation of the brightness temperature difference between <b>split</b> <b>window</b> channels as an index of cloud field homogeneity. The algorithm, in principle, enables us to detect an inhomogeneous cloud field which has not been well detected with only the conventional <b>split</b> <b>window</b> method. This algorithm was applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data during the polar night over the Antarctic region. It is found that the improved algorithm seems to work well for an inhomogeneous cloud field as expected, although there still remains uncertainty related to the vertical structure of the cloud field. In order to investigate the vertical structure in detail, further analyses are needed such as comparison of the result to ground-based meteorological observation, radiative transfer simulation, and analysis of TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) data...|$|E

O processamento das imagens incluiu o geo-referenciamento e as correções quanto aos efeitos atmosféricos e de emissividade, para as quais se utilizou o método de correção <b>split</b> <b>window.</b> A equação de <b>split</b> <b>window</b> usada considerou o parâmetro de emissividade da superfície cultivada estimada diretamente no campo pelo método da caixa. Este método foi comparado a um método alternativo de estimativa de emissividade no campo baseado na proporção de cobertura vegetal e solo descoberto. Os dois métodos apresentaram resultados equivalentes quanto à estimativa de emissividade da superfície. A alta correlação entre a temperatura de superfície medida no campo e a obtida a partir das imagens indicou que as equações de <b>split</b> <b>window</b> usadas corrigiram satisfatoriamente as imagens quanto aos efeitos atmosféricos e de emissividadeAbstract: Diurnal and nocturnal image series {{have been}} used in this work.

The processing work includes both the images geo-referencing and their atmospheric correction applying the "split window method". The <b>split</b> <b>window</b> equation used takes into account the crop surface emissivity parameter, estimated directly on the field by the "box method". This one was compared to an alternative emissivity estimate on the field method, which is based on the crop covering/bared soil relation. Both methods when compared presented similar results. A terrestrial radiometer was used to the surface temperature measurements carried out in situ, during the satellite passes. The correct surface temperature satellite data were submitted to a regression analysis against the terrestrial data about the same parameter. High association level between surface temperature measured at the field and the near air temperature was observed.

The algorithm is used to analyze a time series of VAS <b>split</b> <b>window</b> radiances observed at 15 km horizontal resolution over eastern North America during a 12 hr period on 13 July 1981. Results of the color coded images of the derived precipitable water fields are found to show vivid water vapor features whose broad structure and evolution are verified by the radiosonde and surface networks. The satellite moisture fields also show significant mesoscale features and rapid developments which are not resolved by the conventional networks. The VAS <b>split</b> <b>window</b> is determined to clearly differentiate those areas in which water vapor extends over a deep layer and is more able to support convective cells from those areas in which water vapor is confined to a shallow layer and is therefore less able to support convection. It is concluded that the VAS split windows can be used operationally to monitor mesoscale developments in the low-level moisture fields over relatively cloud-free areas of the United States...|$|E
