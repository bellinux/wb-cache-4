5|$|The {{males of}} {{many species of}} Papilionoidea are {{furnished}} with <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> These consist of scent-producing organs, brushes, and brands or pouches of specialised scales. These presumably meet the function of convincing the female that she is mating with a male of the correct species.|$|E
5|$|Usually males, {{mainly in}} {{polygynous}} species, have shorter lifespans than females. This {{can be attributed}} to several reasons: early dispersal of young males, aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of young males during adolescence.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of puberty, {{androgen}} levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development of masculine <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{as well as the}} activation of spermatogenesis and fertility and masculine behavioral changes such as gynephilia and increased sex drive. Masculine <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam's apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and penile growth.|$|E

25|$|The kype {{functions}} as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> and influences the formation of dominance hierarchies at the spawning grounds. The size of the kype is believed to determine male spawning frequency.|$|R
50|$|Its {{development}} {{is considered a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of males that appears {{as a result of}} hormonal activity. Its level of development varies among individuals and the widening of that area in the larynx can occur very suddenly and quickly.|$|R
25|$|Gamete production: Organisms that undergo sexual {{reproduction}} must first produce gametes, cells which have half the typical number of chromosomes of the species. Often immunity that prevents gamete production also inhibits <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{and so has}} effects similar to castration.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for the development of female <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> during puberty, including breast development, widening of the hips, and female fat distribution. Conversely, androgens {{are responsible}} for pubic and body hair growth, as well as acne and axillary odor.|$|E
25|$|Leydig cells â€“ cells {{localized}} between {{seminiferous tubules}} that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for sexual development and puberty, <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> like facial hair, sexual behavior and libido, supporting spermatogenesis and erectile function. Testosterone also controls testicular volume.|$|E
50|$|Although vellus hair {{is already}} {{present in the}} area in childhood, chest hair is the {{terminal}} hair that develops as an effect of rising levels of androgens (primarily testosterone and its derivatives) due to puberty. Different from the head hair it is therefore a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Men tend to be covered with far more terminal hair, particularly on the chest, the abdomen, and the face.|$|R
50|$|Pickerel frogs display sexual dimorphism; {{the females}} are {{typically}} larger and darker in color than the males. During {{the summer and}} breeding season males can be recognized by their swollen thumbs. Males also have internal vocal sacs located between the tympanum and the foreleg. In general, <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> are not typically evident outside of the breeding season; therefore, pickerel frogs can be rather difficult to sex.|$|R

25|$|Most {{species of}} palaeontinids exhibit cryptic coloration. The {{patterns}} on their wings protected {{them as they}} perched on branches and fed on sap.

25|$|Gender dysphoria, by {{producing}} secondary male characteristics, {{such as a}} deeper voice, increased bone and muscle mass, facial hair, and clitoral enlargement in transgender men, among females or those who develop female <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> but desire to rather be read as male or look more ambiguous, such {{as a number of}} non-binary transgender people, both intersex and dyadic, and dysphoric non-transgender intersex men.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy {{such as the}} birth control pill, has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Estrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health. Women with Turner Syndrome {{who do not have}} spontaneous puberty and who are not treated with estrogen are at high risk for osteoporosis and heart conditions.|$|E
50|$|Biologists {{characterize}} beards as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{because they}} are unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction. Charles Darwin first suggested possible evolutionary explanation of beards in his work The Descent of Man, which hypothesized {{that the process of}} sexual selection may have led to beards. Modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of beards, concluding that there is evidence that a majority of females find men with beards more attractive than men without beards.|$|R
5000|$|Males are {{characteristically}} {{smaller than}} females. The smallest male I. aurelioi measured to be 45.1 mm. Males reach sexual maturity when they contain <b>sexual</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{such as a}} swollen tail-base caused {{by the development of}} the hemipenes. Females reach sexual maturity when they contain <b>sexual</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as large oviductal eggs.|$|R
50|$|Terminal hair {{growth on}} arms is a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> in boys and {{appears in the}} last stages of puberty. Vellus arm hair is usually {{concentrated}} on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on {{the lower part of}} the upper arm. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.|$|R
25|$|Gonadal steroidgenesis {{in girls}} starts with {{production}} of testosterone which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However {{the rate of}} conversion from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Production of progesterone in the ovaries begins {{with the development of}} ovulatory cycles in girls (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of progesterone are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls.|$|E
25|$|While estrogens {{are present}} in both men and women, they are usually present at {{significantly}} higher levels in women of reproductive age. They promote the development of female <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> such as breasts, and are also involved in the thickening of the endometrium {{and other aspects of}} regulating the menstrual cycle. In males, estrogen regulates certain functions of the reproductive system important to the maturation of sperm and may be necessary for a healthy libido. Furthermore, there are several other structural changes induced by estrogen in addition to other functions.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) of the female-to-male (FTM) type {{is a form}} of hormone therapy and sex reassignment therapy that is used to change the <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of transgender and transsexual people from feminine (or androgynous) to masculine. It is one of two types of HRT for transgender and transsexual people (the other being male-to-female), and is predominantly used to treat transgender men. Some intersex people also receive this form of HRT, either starting in childhood to confirm the assigned sex or later if the assignment proves to be incorrect.|$|E
500|$|Another theory, {{the sexual}} {{selection}} hypothesis, proposes {{that the long}} necks evolved as a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> giving males an advantage in [...] "necking" [...] contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and the former do not employ other forms of combat. However, one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.|$|R
500|$|Aside {{from the}} vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly {{wrinkled}} and thick, up to [...] {{around the neck}} and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to [...] thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> males also acquire significant nodules, called [...] "bosses", particularly around the neck and shoulders.|$|R
50|$|A {{competing}} {{hypothesis is}} that, {{rather than being}} principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities {{might have been a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by dominance displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size (see below). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males. The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.|$|R
25|$|In {{his third}} book, Why is Sex Fun?, also {{published}} in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features {{of human sexuality}} that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers {{as well as by}} mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female but not male menopause, and distinctive <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mild {{androgen}} insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is {{a condition}} that results in a mild impairment of the cell's {{ability to respond to}} androgens. The degree of impairment is sufficient to impair spermatogenesis and / or the development of <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> at puberty in males, but does not affect genital differentiation or development. Female genital and sexual development is not significantly affected by the insensitivity to androgens; as such, MAIS is only diagnosed in males. The clinical phenotype associated with MAIS is a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect and / or reduced secondary terminal hair.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{estrogen}} {{replacement therapy}} {{is used to}} spur the growth of <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{at the time when}} puberty should onset. While very few women with Turner Syndrome menstruate spontaneously, estrogen therapy requires a regular shedding of the uterine lining ("withdrawal bleeding") to prevent its overgrowth. Withdrawal bleeding can be induced monthly, like menstruation, or less often, usually every three months, if the patient desires. Estrogen therapy does not make a woman with nonfunctional ovaries fertile, but it {{plays an important role in}} assisted reproduction; the health of the uterus must be maintained with estrogen if an eligible woman with Turner Syndrome wishes to use IVF (using donated oocytes).|$|E
50|$|Kerengga ant-like jumpers {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Female jumpers, {{measuring}} about 6-7 mm, {{are the best}} mimics of the weaver ants while the males which usually measure about 9-12 mm in length {{give the appearance of}} a weaver ant carrying a minor worker due to their elongated chelicerae which may be as long as one-third to half their body length. These elongated chelicerae are a <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the males. The males use their long fangs like swords to fight off rivals. They can split their jaws, normally held closed, to unfold their fangs when required.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly {{wrinkled}} and thick, up to 10 cm {{around the neck}} and shoulders of males.

25|$|One {{pleasure}} of Huxley's life in Texas was {{the sight of}} his first hummingbird, though his visit to Edward Avery McIlhenny's estate on Avery Island in Louisiana was more significant. The McIlhennys and their Avery cousins owned the entire island, and the McIlhenny branch used it to produce their famous Tabasco sauce. Birds were one of McIlhenny's passions, however, and around 1895 he had set up a private sanctuary on the Island, called Bird City. There Huxley found egrets, herons and bitterns. These water birds, like the grebes, exhibit mutual courtship, with the pairs displaying to each other, and with the <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> equally developed in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of gametes is induced in {{both male and}} female mammals by the same two hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The {{production of}} these in turn is induced by a single releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which {{has been the focus of}} most of the research into immunocontraception against gamete production. GnRH is secreted by the hypothalamus in pulses and travels to the anterior pituitary gland through a portal venous system. There it stimulates the production of FSH and LH. FSH and LH travel through the general circulatory system and stimulate the functioning of the gonads, including the production of gametes and the secretion of sex steroid hormones. Immunity against GnRH thus lessens FSH and LH production which in turn attenuates gamete production and <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> such as a deep voice, broad shoulders, and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
2500|$|BDSM {{parties are}} events on which BDSM {{practitioners}} and other similarly interested people meet {{in order to}} communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to [...] "play" [...] in an erotic atmosphere.

50|$|The {{carrying}} angle {{permits the}} arm to be swung without contacting the hips. Women on average have smaller shoulders and wider hips than men, {{which tends to}} produce a larger carrying angle (i.e., larger deviation from a straight line than that in men). There is, however, extensive overlap in the carrying angle between individual men and women, and a sex-bias has not been consistently observed in scientific studies. This could however {{be attributed to the}} very small sample sizes in those cited earlier studies. A more recent study based on a sample size of 333 individuals from both sexes concluded that carrying angle is a suitable <b>secondary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic.</b>|$|R
