5|$|<b>Seeds</b> are {{the primary}} way that trees {{reproduce}} and their <b>seeds</b> vary greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest <b>seeds</b> come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces {{one of the smallest}} tree <b>seeds.</b> The great diversity in tree fruits and <b>seeds</b> reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{presence}} of living insects on <b>seeds</b> are an issue for the export market as no living insects are allowed for export. The presence of weevils in the <b>seeds</b> after harvest thereby decreases faba bean commercial value.|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the <b>seeds</b> {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for <b>seeds</b> targeting market for human consumption. Damaged <b>seeds</b> (<b>seeds</b> from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged <b>seeds</b> have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. <b>Seeds</b> that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those <b>seeds.</b> The diversity {{of these types of}} <b>seeds</b> {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the <b>seeds</b> extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used <b>seeds</b> legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation <b>seeds</b> were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation <b>seeds</b> were.|$|E
5|$|Fruits are {{released}} in the summer, containing about 16 <b>seeds</b> on average. These <b>seeds</b> are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (Vespula vulgaris) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the <b>seeds</b> at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided {{by the presence of}} a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and oleic acid. The oleic acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing them to bring the <b>seeds</b> to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable <b>seeds</b> back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how <b>seed</b> size influences <b>seed</b> density in persistent <b>seed</b> banks of Arctostaphylos to extend current theories on life history trade-offs related to <b>seed</b> size. Large variation of <b>seed</b> and fruit size within this genus suggests {{the potential for}} different <b>seed</b> or seedling ecology strategies. The <b>seed</b> banks of 10 obligate <b>seeding</b> Arctostaphylos species were examined. To determine <b>seed</b> bank density, soil <b>seed</b> banks were collected from beneath 10 - 20 individuals of each species at two different levels (0 - 2 cm deep and 2 - 5 cm deep) from 400 cm 2 plots. <b>Seed</b> size was found to negatively correlate with the density of <b>seed</b> banks in that larger <b>seeded</b> species tended to have smaller <b>seed</b> banks than smaller <b>seeded</b> species. This extends our understanding on trade-offs related to <b>seed</b> size and <b>seed</b> numbers to persistent <b>seed</b> banks, which represent a highly selective point in {{the life cycle of}} these plant populations...|$|R
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop <b>seeds</b> {{from a local}} grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved <b>seeds</b> from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean <b>seeds</b> from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as <b>seeds</b> for planting. He tested the new <b>seeds,</b> and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted <b>seeds</b> from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small <b>seeds</b> {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its <b>seeds</b> widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other <b>seeds</b> in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of <b>seeds</b> may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} elucidate the physiological factor determining the association of <b>seed</b> size and <b>seed</b> coat quality with varietal differences in <b>seed</b> vigour, and to pursue an alternative on the mechanism of varietal differences in <b>seed</b> resistance to field weathering.

The mechanism of varietal differences in <b>seed</b> resistance to field weathering, therefore, seemes to be mainly controlled by <b>seed</b> coat quality (<b>seed</b> coat-seed weight ratio and <b>seed</b> coat colour) through controlling the magnitude of <b>seed</b> polymer change during moisture absorption at postphysiological maturity, which in turn determine the degree of membrane damage in the <b>seed...</b>|$|R

5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} <b>seeds</b> are produced. The tiny black <b>seeds</b> germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while <b>seeds</b> of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. <b>Seeds</b> of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist winter to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} {{tree species}} have <b>seeds</b> that are dispersed by ants. Seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations. Some plants in fire-prone grassland systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the <b>seeds</b> are transported to safety below the ground. Many ant-dispersed <b>seeds</b> have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 <b>seeds,</b> {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. <b>Seeds</b> take five to six weeks to mature. The <b>seeds</b> of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black.
