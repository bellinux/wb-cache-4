5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may {{be accompanied by a}} triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking {{full advantage of the}} fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E

5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without <b>slowing,</b> <b>the</b> batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief agencies were forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> recovery process.|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with the Navier-Stokes equation between planar plates, the equation of motion of the Binghamian grouts is deduced in smooth and inclined fissures. The model indicates that the velocity of flow gradually reduce {{with the development of}} time. And the greater the pressure is, the greater the speed is, as a result, the Binghamian grouts has a further infiltration. The velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts {{has nothing to do with}} fissure inclination. In addition, in the circumstance of the same parameters, the wider the fissure is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts is; the bigger the viscosity of grouts is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; the smaller the initial shear strength is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; the bigger the Binghamian grouts density is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; and vice versa. 特集 : 「資源、新エネルギー、環境、防災研究国際セミナー...|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus Löb {{writes that}} {{proposals}} and counter-proposals flew between Istanbul, London and Washington. The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans {{along in the}} hope of <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same. Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} quality and craft {{that went into the}} compilation's design.

Reviewers considered Rare Replay a high-water mark for video game compilations—Kotaku called it the best since Valve's The Orange Box. On the other hand, Jeremy Parish (USgamer) found the contemporaneous Mega Man Legacy Collection Criterion Collection-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante (The Verge) saw Rare Replay slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and <b>slowing</b> <b>the</b> tide of unlicensed downloads.|$|E
