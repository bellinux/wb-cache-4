40|$|A novel {{processing}} method {{was developed for}} sub- 50 nm structures by integrating quantum dots (QDs) on patterned polymer substrates. Poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PSMa) was prepared by the initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) method, an alternative to <b>spin-on</b> <b>deposition.</b> The sub- 50 nm PSMa polymer patterns were prepared by low energy oxygen plasma etching by using CNTs as the masks. The water soluble, amine-functionalized QDs underwent the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction with the PSMa containing anhydride functional groups. This integration method is use to incorporate high performance QDs on inexpensive, lightweight flexible substrate. by Chia-Hua Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Initiated {{chemical}} vapor deposition (iCVD) is a novel {{technique for}} depositing polymeric thin films. It is able to deposit thin films of application-specific polymers in one step without using any solvents. Its uniqueness of in situ surface polymer synthesis distinguishes iCVD from conventional processes such as <b>spin-on</b> <b>deposition</b> and plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}}. It allows engineering polymers to be made with specific microscale properties translating to well-defined macroscale behaviors. In this thesis work, two application-specific polymers based on poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) and poly(cyclohexyl methacrylate) (PCHMA) were synthesized using iCVD. PHEMA thin films with specific degrees of cross-linking leading to well-defined structural, thermal, wetting, and swelling properties were made in a single vacuum step by simply adjusting chamber conditions. Cross-linked PCHMA thin films were synthesized for use as sacrificial layers for microfabrication. Such films of engineering polymers cannot be made using conventional methods. A study of the polymerization mechanism was included {{to serve as a}} groundwork for increased understanding of iCVD as a thin- film deposition method. (cont.) Growth rates and molecular weights, crucial parameters for polymeric thin films, were found to be highly dependent on the surface concentrations of monomers, leading to the conclusion that polymer formation occurs predominantly {{on the surface of the}} substrate. This conclusion also infers that controlling the surface concentrations of monomers can lead to copolymers/terpolymers with well-defined compositions, which was demonstrated in the iCVD of PHEMA-based thin films. iCVD therefore can be extended to complex polymer systems with multiple monomeric building blocks. Photo- initiatied chemical vapor deposition (piCVD) using a volatile photoinitiator is introduced for the first time in this thesis. piCVD possesses all the benefits of iCVD over conventional processes but uses a photochemical initiation mechanism that simplifies chamber design and potentially allows self-patterning during deposition. by Kelvin Chan.

30|$|Crystalline silicon {{solar cells}} {{currently}} dominate the photovoltaic market, while ongoing research is mainly focused on increasing the conversion {{efficiency of the}} solar cells and the reduction of production costs. Junction formation {{is one of the}} most crucial steps during the solar cell fabrication process. Various methods are used to form homogenous phosphorus-diffused emitters for p-type silicon solar cells. These methods differ according to the technique used to deposit the phosphorus source onto the silicon surface, including deposition of phosphorus oxychloride (POCl 3) [1, 2], diluted orthophosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) by spray [3, 4], sol-gel sources through <b>spin-on</b> <b>deposition</b> techniques [5], or by using the screen-printing technique [6]. However, the diffusion of phosphorus atoms to the rear surface cannot be avoided by either out-gas diffusion, regardless of the used phosphorus dopant source, or direct diffusion, such as in cases using POCl 3. Therefore, it is necessary to mask the surfaces that one does not want to be diffused by phosphorus-doping atoms. SiO 2 films are in use for many silicon device fabrications for either masking or passivation purposes. Conventionally, the deposition of SiO 2 films using gas-phase deposition methods (atomic layer deposition [7, 8], chemically catalyzed chemical vapor deposition [9], atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) [10, 11], low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) [10, 11], and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [10]) have been performed. However, particle contamination and substrate surface damage come along as disadvantages [10] using CVD. Moreover, in some case, the use of dangerous silane gas is introduced [10, 11]. Thermally growing oxide at high temperatures is another technique used to form oxide layers, either by dry oxidation using pure oxygen gas [12] or wet oxidation using oxygen/hydrogen steam [13]. Both are widely used in the fabrication of solar cells, especially for masking [2, 14] and passivation purposes [15]. In order to pursue simple, high-performance and cost-effective production, the development of high-performance/low-cost materials and their adaption into the silicon solar cell fabrication process is crucial. This paper introduces a spin-coating silica-sol barrier material to protect against phosphorus diffusion. The silica sol barrier layer can be also applied by spray deposition or the screen printing method, should the proper modifications and improvements be made. However, such materials have yet to be investigated and reported sufficiently. It can be simply spun on the substrate surface prior to phosphorus diffusion and directly annealed simultaneously with phosphorus after the drying step. The performance evaluation of the silica-sol barrier material was carried out mainly in terms of sheet resistance measurements, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements. P-type CZ-Si solar cells were also fabricated both with and without using the silica-sol material during the phosphorus diffusion process.|$|E
