60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> me. She {{had given}} up. I {{thought she was}} going to drop, and drew her toward the stone. I cursed the day I ever saw Neal and the service.

5000|$|From {{the late}} 1780s, Robinson became {{distinguished}} for her poetry and was called [...] "the English Sappho." [...] In addition to poems, she wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete {{at the time}} of her death. The Poems of 1775 was published, while Robinson’s husband was in prison. Then she published a poem in 1777, which was simply titled Captivity; a poem and Celadon and Lydia, a Tale. The subject matter in this poem was influenced by a situation with Robinson's husband Thomas Robinson and Lord Lyttleton. According, to Robinson's Memoirs, Lord Lyttleton was not concerned with the marital status of Robinson revealed that her husband had a mistress. Later it was proved to be true among other multitudes of lies that unraveled and consequently lands himself in Jail for debt. Robinson's affair was broadcast and was the center of town gossip and many believed the scandal that encompassed her significantly undermined her literature's worth. Robinson was on her way to establishing a new poetic identity for herself, when <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> her Della Cruscan style when she wrote the Poems volumes published in 1791 and 1793. A review was written by the Gentleman's Magazine and the reviewer stated that if Robinson had been less blessed with [...] "beauty and captivating manners","her poetical taste might have been confined in it's influence" [...] and at the end of the review describes her poetry as elegant and harmonious. In 1795, Robinson wrote a satirical poem titled London's Summer Morning. This poem showcased Robinson's critical perspective of the infrastructure and society of London. Robinson describes the busy and loud sounds of the industrialized city in the morning. She employs characters such as the chimney-boy, and ruddy housemaid to make a heavy critic on the way society treats children as innocent fragile creatures. In 1796 Robinson argues eloquently for women's rationality and right to education and illustrates ideas of free will, suicide, rationalization, empiricism and relationship to sensibility in Sappho and Phaon: In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets. She was an ardent admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft, and her Letter to the Women of England against Mental Subordination still makes powerful reading." [...] Robinson reiterates the rights women have to live by sexual passion. Lastly, In 1800 she writes a series of poems titled the Lyrical Tales, which explores themes of domestic violence, misogyny, violence against destitute characters, and political oppression. Robinson's main objective was to respond to Lyrical Ballads written by authors Wordsworth and Coleridge; who were not as well known at the time.|$|E
