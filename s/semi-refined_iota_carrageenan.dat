Iota-carragenan, a polymer derived from red seaweed, has reduced viral load in nasal secretions and alleviated symptoms in adults with common cold. Methods We have assessed the antiviral and therapeutic activity of a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan in children with acute symptoms of common cold. A cohort of 153 children between 1 – 18 years (mean age 5 years), displaying acute symptoms of common cold were randomly assigned to treatment with a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan (0. 12 %) as verum or 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution as placebo for seven days. Symptoms of common cold were recorded and the viral load of respiratory viruses in nasal secretions was determined at two consecutive visits. Results The {{results of the present study}} showed no significant difference between the <b>iota</b> <b>carrageenan</b> and the placebo group on the mean of TSS between study days 2 – 7. Secondary endpoints, such as reduced time to clearance of disease (7. 6 vs 9. 4 days; p[*]=[*] 0. 038), reduction of viral load (p[*]=[*] 0. 026), and lower incidence of secondary infections with other respiratory viruses (p[*]=[*] 0. 046) indicated beneficial effects of iota-carrageenan in this population. The treatment was safe and well tolerated, with less side effects observed in the verum group compared to placebo. Conclusion In this study iota-carrageenan did not alleviate symptoms in children with acute symptoms of common cold, but significantly reduced viral load in nasal secretions that may have important implications for future studies.

User acceptability of microbicides can be incorporated early in the product formulation and design process. Previous qualitative research revealed women had strong preferences regarding product shape, while preferences related to size and firmness were less clear. Here, we explored the effect of size and firmness on the acceptability of semisolid ovoid microbicide prototypes intended for vaginal use. Sexually active women (n = 74) were randomized {{to one of two}} conditions: with and without applicator. Nine different prototypes were evaluated; they were formulated to low, medium and high firmness using mixtures of kappa and <b>iota</b> <b>carrageenan</b> and potassium chloride. Three sizes were produced at each firmness level. Women manipulated all nine prototypes, rating them for perceived effectiveness, imagined ease-of-insertion and willingness-to-try on visual analog scales. The influence of size and firmness on these three outcome measures were assessed using ANOVA and response surface models. Results indicated size and firmness both influenced the outcome measures, but firmness was more influential than size. Also, the specific effects of size and firmness depended strongly on presence or absence of an applicator. Generally, women in the without applicator condition wanted a larger, firmer product. Collectively, these data suggest efforts to rationally design of microbicides for enhanced user acceptability must consider factors like size and firmness. Also, the decision to include or forego an applicator should be addressed early in the design process, as it strongly influences other design decisions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{in vitro}} {{antioxidant}} {{activities of the}} following six sulfated polysaccharides were investi-gated: iota, kappa and lambda carrageenans, which are widely used in the food industry, fucoidan (homofucan) from the edible seaweed Fucus vesicu-losus and fucans (heterofucans) F 0. 5 and F 1. 1 from the seaweed Padina gymnospora. With respect to the inhibition of superoxide radical formation, fucoidan had an IC 50 (the half maximal inhibitory concentra-tion) of 0. 058 mgImLj 1, while the IC 50 for the kappa, <b>iota</b> and lambda <b>carrageenans</b> were 0. 112, 0. 332 and 0. 046 mgImLj 1, respectively. All of the samples had an inhibitory effect on the formation of hydroxyl radicals. The results of peroxidation tests showed that fucoidan had an IC 50 of 1. 250 mgImLj 1 and that the kappa, <b>iota</b> and lambda <b>carrageenans</b> had an IC 50 of 2. 753 and 2. 338 and 0. 323 mgImLj 1, respectively. Fucan fractions showed low antioxidant activity relative to fucoidan. These results clearly indicate the beneficial effect of algal polysaccharides as antioxidants.

40|$|In this study, {{polymeric}} dispersions {{composed of}} methylcellulose (MC) and either kappa <b>carrageenan</b> (KC) or <b>iota</b> <b>carrageenan</b> (IC) were proposed {{as a platform}} for transscleral delivery of macromolecules. The additive effects of the two polymers were investigated using oscillatory rheometer and FT-IR spectroscopy. Mechanical spectra demonstrated a conformation dependent association of the two polymers at 37 °C {{in the presence of}} selected counter ions. The polymer association was also confirmed by the shifts in MC peaks at 1049. 5, 1114 and 1132. 9 cm(- 1) in the presence of carrageenans, which corresponds to the stretching vibrations of C-O-C bonds of the polysaccharides. The MC-IC polymeric system displayed the highest bio-adhesion, owing to the relatively high negative charge. However, the MC-IC system did not affect the in-vitro scleral permeability of sodium fluorescein and 10 kDa FITC-dextran. Nonetheless, the formulation properties had a substantial impact on the results of the in-vivo studies. The efficacy of transscleral drug delivery was determined using rats with altered connexin 43 (Cx 43) levels, a gap junction protein, in the choroid. Periocular injection of Cx 43 antisense oligonucleotides (AsODN) incorporated in the MC-IC system lead to a significant reduction in the Cx 43 levels in the choroid of rats at 24 h of treatment. AsODN incorporated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) also demonstrated a trend towards reduced Cx 43 levels; however this was not statistically significant owing to great variability between treated animals. Consequently the in-vivo data suggests the transscleral route to be of value in delivering therapeutics to the choroid. Moreover this study identified a new polymeric system based on MC and IC which provides aqueous loading of therapeutics and prolonged retention at the site of administration...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} food {{systems have}} been studied: emulsion/polymer mixtures, gelatin gels and carrageenan gels. Typically, samples are trapped, or jammed, far from equilibrium. The simple jamming paradigm suggests that, once in the jammed state, these systems are static. This useful approximation is often too simple, since these systems frequently evolve in time. Their evolution has been measured systematically. Where possible, these results {{have been placed in}} the context of the physics of out-of-equilibrium systems. The emulsion/polymer mixtures are a model for salad dressing. The emulsions alone are colloidally stable, but become inhomogeneous, due to the effects of gravity. With sufficient polymer, they can be apparently stable (jammed) for months, but then quite suddenly start to sediment – the system unjams. The kinetics of this delayed sedimentation is measured as a function of the key parameters. A new model is proposed for the mechanism by which polymers stabilize emulsions. Solutions of gelatin form gels when cooled, due to the formation of portions of helix. A new model relating the amount of helix to the elasticity is described. The gels always evolve slowly. At steady state, the rate of evolution of the elasticity is constant in log(time), so this system conforms to Struick’s physical aging scenario. The effect of temperature changes on the evolution of gels is extremely complex. The results show that there is a deep analogy between this behavior and that of spin glasses, which are exotic magnetic phases. Gels of <b>iota</b> <b>carrageenan,</b> a seaweed polysaccharide, have unique rheological properties: they regel almost instantly after strong mixing. This property is used in the dairy industry, but has not been studied previously. The kinetics of recovery after shear has been measured for water gels and milk gels...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand?s {{isolation}} {{makes it}} a natural home to many unique species. One {{of them is the}} now cultivated New Zealand green shell mussel (Perna canaliculus) which is sought after by seafood lovers around the world. This mussel is by far the largest seafood export from New Zealand accounting for about 85 % and exported to 78 countries in 2011. This research was conducted to create a variant of an existing value-added product: lactic-fermented comminuted mussel meat. This product has been named Perna. The existing knowledge relates to a spreadable form of Perna, which is currently undergoing commercial evaluation. This work is mainly about developing a gelled form of Perna using hydrocolloids, specifically carrageenans and gelatine. The proposition was that a gelled, sliceable form of Perna would expand its culinary potential. The spreadable form would be used for crackers and breads, while a slice of Perna could be part of an entr?e in domestic cuisine or food service. However, as the project progressed it became clear that unacceptable variations in pH of Perna were affected by the time the mussels were cooked in boiling water prior to comminution and fermentation. Because of the fundamental importance of this variation in terms of odour/flavour, {{the first part of the}} thesis explores the chemistry of how pH could be better controlled. It was found that the buffering capacity of mussel proteins changed with cooking. Although no explanations were obtained at a biochemical level, the empirical outcome was that cooking live mussels between 7 to 10 minutes would predictably result in a desired final pH of around 4. 5 that yields superior organoleptic properties such as pleasant smell, taste and texture. Moving to gelation as a goal, it was found that kappa and <b>iota</b> <b>carrageenans</b> were incapable of forming useful gels in Perna, the former producing excessive syneresis and latter a soft, spongy product. Experiments with gelatine were initially unsuccessful, inadvertently because of the low gelatine concentrations tested. After a more concentrated gelatine colloidal suspension of about 8 % was incorporated into the mussel mince, a useful gel was finally created, although the texture was crumbly. However, this final success is considered an excellent starting point for sliceable product refinement...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} {{over a period}} of 60 days to evaluate the effect of dietary carrageenan on growth, hematology, biochemistry, and innate immunity in rohu Labeo rohita. A basal diet supplemented with <b>iota</b> (i) <b>Carrageenan</b> at 5, 10 and 20 g/kg was fed to three different groups of fish for 60 days. The fish were examined 15, 30, 45, and 60 days after commencement of the study. Parameters for growth (absolute growth, specific growth rate, and percentage weight gain), hematology (total erythrocyte count, total leucocyte count, thrombocyte count and hemoglobin value), biochemistry (total serum protein, albumin, globulin and albuminglobulin ratio), and innate immunity (nitroblue tetrazolium NBT, and myeloperoxidase MPO, activity) were monitored to assess the effect of the iCarrageenan based diet in L. rohita. All the parameters examined (growth, hematology, biochemistry, and innate immunity) increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in carrageenan-fed groups compared to the control group. However, the highest values for those parameters were found on the 60 th day in the group which was fed a 10 g/kg i-Carrageenan diet. The study suggests that a 10 g/kg diet of i-carrageenan enhances immunity and the overall health status in L. rohita...|$|R

For all brines, the cooked ham was prepared and extended to 100 %, and characteristics of hardness and elasticity were evaluated 14 and 28 days after manufacturing, through a texture analysis profile (TAP); along with syneresis in the packaging (purges) by gravimetric analysis and, hardness, elasticity and general appearance; and sensory attributes through a sensory analysis. The lowest syneresis was shown for T 11 and the lowest predicted syneresis by a third grade polynomial was shown in the mixtures 18. 12 : 64. 46 : 17. 42 and 16. 36 : 65. 56 : 18. 08 of LBG: KC: IC for days 14 and 28, respectively, with a syneresis value of 0. 88 % and 2. 83 %; the highest instrumental hardness (TAP) was found in T 7, and the highest predicted hardness at 14 days was found in mixture 24. 72 : 75. 28 of LBG: KC, with a value of 22. 74 N, while the highest predicted elasticity coinciding with a high hardness region was found in mixture 26. 21 : 67. 82 : 8. 98 of LBG: KC: IC, with a value of 0. 93.
