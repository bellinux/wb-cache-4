40|$|Abstract – Two {{different}} methods to elucidate the dependent or independent {{nature of the}} autonomic nervous system influence on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes are considered. ECG PP and PR intervals are extracted from 20 normal, young healthy subjects using a wavelet based technique. The first analysis technique focuses upon a supine to stand transition. This transient event serves to highlight the uncoupled nature of PP and PR interval duration for about five beats, suggesting an independent ANS drive to each node. Secondly, sections of quiet supine and <b>standing</b> <b>data</b> are analyzed. Parametric spectral analysis shows variable LF and HF component behavior across different subjects. The relative distribution of recovery RP intervals versus PR for supine and standing are clearly separate for 10 different subjects and borderline for 5. Large intersubject variation is evident...|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} sitting {{have been linked}} with poor health outcomes. Previously a pragmatic MTI {{accelerometer}} data cut-point (100 count/min- 1) {{has been used to}} estimate sitting. Data on the accuracy of this cut-point is unavailable. PURPOSE: To ascertain whether the 100 count/min- 1 cut-point accurately isolates sitting from standing activities. METHODS: Participants fitted with an MTI accelerometer were observed performing a range of sitting, standing, light & moderate activities. 1 -min epoch MTI data were matched to observed activities, then re-categorized as either sitting or not using the 100 count/min- 1 cut-point. Self-report demographics and current physical activity were collected. Generalized estimating equation for repeated measures with a binary logistic model analyses (GEE), corrected for age, gender and BMI, were conducted to ascertain the odds of the MTI data being misclassified. RESULTS: Data were from 26 healthy subjects (8 men; 50 % aged < 25 years; mean BMI (SD) 22. 7 (3. 8) m/kg 2). MTI sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>data</b> mode was 0 count/min- 1, with 46 % of sitting activities and 21 % of standing activities recording 0 count/min- 1. The GEE was unable to accurately isolate sitting from standing activities using the 100 count/min- 1 cut-point, since all sitting activities were incorrectly predicted as standing (p= 0. 05). To further explore the sensitivity of MTI data to delineate sitting from standing, the upper 95 % confidence interval of the mean for the sitting activities (46 count/min- 1) was used to re-categorise the data; this resulted in the GEE correctly classifying 49 % of sitting, and 69 % of standing activities. Using the 100 count/min- 1 cut-point the data were re-categorised into a combined ‘sit/stand’ category and tested against other light activities: 88 % of sit/stand and 87 % of light activities were accurately predicted. Using Freedson’s moderate cut-point of 1952 count/min- 1 the GEE accurately predicted 97 % of light vs. 90 % of moderate activities. CONCLUSION: The distributions of MTI recorded sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>data</b> overlap considerably, as such the 100 count/min - 1 cut-point did not accurately isolate sitting from other static standing activities. The 100 count/min - 1 cut-point more accurately predicted sit/stand vs. other movement orientated activities...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{a web-based}} {{software}} architecture and framework for management and diagnosis of {{large amounts of}} medical data in an ophthalmologic reading center is proposed. Data management for multi-center studies requires merging of <b>standing</b> <b>data</b> and repeatedly gathered clinical evidence such as vital signs and raw data. If ophthalmologic questions are involved the data acquisition is often provided by non-medical staff {{at the point of}} care or a study center, whereas the medical finding is mostly provided by an ophthalmologist in a specialized reading center. The study data such as participants, cohorts and measured values are administrated at a single data center for the entire study. Since a specialized reading center maintains several studies, the medical staff must learn the different data administration for the different data center. With respect to the increasing number and sizes of clinical studies, two aspects must be considered. At first, an efficient software framework is required to support the data management, processing and diagnosis by medical experts at the reading center. In the second place, this software needs a standardized user-interface that has not to be trained/taylore /adapted for each new study. Furthermore different aspects of quality and security controls have to be included. Therefore, the objective of this work is to establish a multi purpose ophthalmologic reading center, which can be connected to different data centers via configurable data interfaces in order to treat various topics simultaneously...|$|E

This study is aimed {{to evaluate the}} possible mechanism for changes to ventilation following passive head-up tilt (HUT) and active standing by comparison {{of a range of}} ventilatory, metabolic and mechanical parameters. Ventilatory parameters (V (T), V (E), V (E) /VO 2, V (E) /VCO 2, f and PetCO(2)), functional residual capacity (FRC), respiratory mechanics with impulse oscillometry; oxygen consumption (VO 2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO 2) were measured in 20 healthy male subjects whilst supine, following HUT to 70 degrees and unsupported <b>standing.</b> <b>Data</b> were analysed using a linear mixed model. HUT to 70 degrees from supine increased minute ventilation (V (E)) (P < 0. 001), tidal volume (V (T)) (P= 0. 001), ventilatory equivalent for O- 2 (V (E) /VO 2) (P= 0. 020) and the ventilatory equivalent for CO 2 (V (E) /VCO 2) (P < 0. 001) with no change in f (P= 0. 488). HUT also increased FRC (P < 0. 001) and respiratory system reactance (X 5 Hz) (P < 0. 001) with reduced respiratory system resistance (R 5 Hz) (P= 0. 004) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO(2)) (P < 0. 001) compared to supine. Standing increased V (E) (P < 0. 001), V (T) (P < 0. 001) and V (E) /VCO 2 (P= 0. 020) with no change in respiratory rate (f) (P= 0. 065), V (E) /VO 2 (P= 0. 543). Similar changes in FRC (P < 0. 001), R 5 Hz (P= 0. 013), X 5 Hz (P < 0. 001) and PetCO(2) (P < 0. 001) compared to HUT were found. In contrast to HUT, standing increased VO 2 (P= 0. 002) and VCO 2 (P= 0. 048). The greater increase in V (E) in standing compared to HUT appears to be related to increased VO 2 and VCO 2 associated with increased muscle activity in the unsupported standing position.

Pastures were grazed by 50 to 100 cow-calf pairs with both single (DR system) and multiple (SDG system) grazing periods from 15 May to 15 October. Livestock performance {{data were collected from}} spayed heifers substituted into each grazing system during the last 3 years of the study.

Average daily gain of the spayed heifers (0. 84 kg∙day- 1) did not differ between grazing systems and years. The DR grazing system had minimal increases of standing crop and frequency of occurrence of desirable plant species. Standing crop and frequency of occurrence were more affected by topographic position and year than by grazing system treatments. Effect of timing of grazing on subsequent-year standing crop was also determined with the DR and SDG grazing systems. <b>Standing</b> crop <b>data</b> were used to determine effect of time of grazing on plant functional groups.

40|$|A study, {{carried out}} in non-wooded parts of savanna and in desert grassland, {{demonstrated}} that herbaceous standing crop can decrease with increasing surface rock cover. However, such decreases corresponded more directly to a soil volumetric decrease than to a decrease in soil surface area per se. The relationship was also found to depend strongly on subsurface rock weathering patterns which may reverse the indicated relationship between standing crop and surface rock cover. The application of surface rock cover data without regard to profile stoniness, is, therefore, likely to be of limited use for comparing plant production across different geological substrates. The role of different rock types in giving rise to soils of different fertility with corresponding plant responses, was also indicated by the data. Sensitivity of plant standing crop to surface rock cover was possibly dependent on mean annual rainfall, but further data are required.

In its 2013 decision Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, the Supreme Court, in a case involving alleged electronic surveillance by the U. S. government’s National Security Agency, declared that a plaintiff alleging that it will suffer future injuries from a defendant’s allegedly improper conduct must show that such injuries are “certainly impending. ” Since the Clapper decision, a majority of the lower federal courts addressing “lost data” or potential identity theft cases in which there is no proof of actual misuse or fraud have held that plaintiffs lack standing to sue the party who failed to protect their data. But a significant minority of lower court decisions have disagreed that the Clapper decision requires denial of <b>standing</b> in <b>data</b> breach cases in which there is no proof of present harm because a footnote in Clapper acknowledged that the Court had sometimes used a less strict “substantial risk” test when plaintiffs allege that a defendant’s actions increase their risk of future harm. Demonstrating its concern for digital privacy, the Court in Riley v. California recently required police to obtain a Fourth Amendment warrant before examining the digital data on the cell phones of arrested suspects. It would be easy for courts to distinguish the government’s seizure of digital data from arrestee’s in Riley from a third party’s hacking of data from a retailer or employer. The Riley decision involves Fourth Amendment warrant issues that are not relevant to private data breach cases.

The proposed approach examines {{a level of}} simultaneous achievement on economic prosperity and environmental protection, so measuring the level of “sustainability.” DEA, <b>standing</b> for <b>Data</b> Envelopment Analysis, has been widely applied for performance assessment {{in the past five}} decades.

These difficulties include (a) how to incorporate two separated (natural and managerial) disposability concepts into a unified framework of DEA environmental assessment, (b) how to reorganize unified disposability concepts in the proposed approach, (c) how to incorporate an occurrence of undesirable congestion (e.g., a line capacity limit on transmission) and desirable congestion (e.g., possible occurrence of green technology innovation) and (d) how to manage a data set that contains zero and negative values.

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the role of}} a flood in particulate organic matter (POM) dynamics of the Little Tennessee river/floodplain ecosystem in western North Carolina, USA. I measured litter inputs, leaf breakdown, floodplain litter, and aboveground herbaceous net primary production at 12 sites. Annual litter inputs (274 - 625 g m- 2 y- 1) were typical of a temperate deciduous forest, but lower than other floodplain forests in the eastern United States. Mean aboveground herbaceous net primary production ranged from 61 - 439 g m- 2 y- 1 and leaf breakdown rates of 4 tree species ranged from 0. 001 - 0. 010 d- 1. Following a flood on 8 January 1998, sites were separated into three inundation classes: inundated, partially-inundated, and non-inundated. Sites inundated by a January flood had significantly less forest floor leaf litter and coarse woody debris after the flood. There was no significant change at the partially-inundated or non-inundated sites. In addition, {{there was no significant difference}} in herbaceous material between pre- and post-flood collections for any inundation classes. Litter input, leaf breakdown, and floodplain litter <b>standing</b> crop <b>data</b> suggest that flood entrainment of POM from the floodplain of Littl...|$|R
40|$|The Tobacco Control Economics Project is {{a project}} that seeks to gather {{evidence}} on tobacco use and economics in southern Africa. It {{is a project}} of the University of Cape Town {{with support from the}} DataFirst repository based at the University of Cape Town. Its aim is to gather data that already exists, sometimes in digital form, frequently in offline records or in some cases paper records, and bring them together as an open resource. The project faces challenges of data gathering as well as permissions. Frequently data is or should be “available” in some form but control over the data is relinquished only unreluctantly. In many cases the legal <b>standing</b> of <b>data</b> is unclear. Many of the challenges relating to the bringing together of the data involve ascertaining what the legal standing of a dataset is or gaining permissions for its re-use. DataFirst is a longstanding data sharing infrastructure with professional and experienced data management staff. Challenges of ensuring continued funding and maintenance {{are similar to those of}} data infrastructures globally. The infrastructure meets international standards and provides leadership to other services and platforms in this space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The goal of {{this study}} was to use LiDAR data to assess damage to trees from a December, 2007 ice storm {{affecting}} the city of Norman, Oklahoma (USA). Pre- and post-storm LiDAR data was collected for the city and it was processed and analyzed in a GIS platform. Results indicate that for single <b>standing</b> trees, LiDAR <b>data</b> can accurately assess and quantify damage with an accuracy of 90 %. However, it is yet to be examined how the accuracy would change if the proposed methodology was applied to grouped trees or with trees with overlapping branches. The proposed method suggests that in the future, LiDAR data would allow foresters and researchers to assess tree damage from not only ice storms, but also other natural disasters...|$|R

Over 4 years later, a team of European experts have generated a new report "The Data Harvest: How sharing research data can yield knowledge, jobs and growth" with an update on the landscape described in the previous report aiming to sound a warning on how Europe must act now to secure its <b>standing</b> in future <b>data</b> markets. In this report, we outline the benefits and challenges, and offer recommendations to European policy makers. The seeds have been sown. Now is the time to plan the harvest...|$|R
40|$|Although {{previously}} {{proposed that}} chronic scleroderma should {{be cared for}} clinically and early rehabilitation should be performed in hospital by a chest physical therapist, little evidence is currently available on its benefits. Therefore, this study demonstrated the benefits of short-term pulmonary rehabilitation during hospitalization in a female patient with chronic scleroderma. The aim of rehabilitation was to improve ventilation and gas exchange by using airway clearance, chest mobilization, and breathing-relearning techniques, including strengthening the respiratory system and {{the muscles of the}} limbs by using the Breath Max® device and elastic bands. Gross motor function and activities of daily life were regained by balancing, sitting, and <b>standing</b> practices. <b>Data</b> on minimal chest expansion, high dyspnea, high respiratory rate, and low maximal inspiratory mouth pressure were recorded seven days before rehabilitation or at the baseline period. But there was a clinically significant improvement in dyspnea, chest expansion, maximal inspiratory mouth pressure, and respiratory rate, when compared to baseline data, which were recorded by a chest physical therapist during seven days of rehabilitation. Furthermore, physicians decided to stop using a mechanical ventilator, and improvement in functional capacity was noted. Therefore, in the case of chronic and stable scleroderma, short-term rehabilitation during hospitalization for chest physical therapy possibly shows clinical benefits by improving both pulmonary function and physical performance...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The role of detritivores in the {{conversion}} of allochthonous leaf material in two small streams in the Cascade Range of Oregon was studied. Their importance {{in relation to other}} consumers was estimated from emergence and benthic <b>standing</b> crop <b>data.</b> Ingestion rates and efficiencies of utilization of bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and red alder (Alnus rubra) leaves by several species of stream detritivores, one species of stonefly and several species of caddis lies, were measured under field or laboratory conditions. Mean consumption rates varied from 0. 04 mg/mg/day for Halesochila taylori larvae (Trichoptera:Limnephilidae) feeding on maple leaves to 0. 60 mg /mg /day' for Lepidostoma sp. larvae (Trichoptera :Lepidostomatidae) feeding on alder and maple leaves. Ecclisomyia sp. larvae (Trichoptera:Limnephilidae) consumed 0. 10 mg/mg/day of maple leaves in the field. All consumption rates were calculated assuming constant feeding rates by the insects and constant rates of leaf decomposition without insects, but a model is discussed that allows non-linear feeding and leaf decomposition rates. Efficiency of food utilization was measured either as assimilation efficiency, the ratio of assimilated food (ingestion minus egestion) to consumption; or as gross growth efficiency, the slope of the growth:consumption line calculated by linear regression analysis. Assimilation efficiencies ranged from 7. 4...|$|R
