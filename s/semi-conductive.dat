50|$|The {{process through}} which these {{technologies}} emerged is called Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation (DGU). DGU {{has been used for}} some time in biological and medical applications but Dr. Mark Hersam utilized this process with carbon nanotubes which allowed for those nanotubes with <b>semi-conductive</b> properties to be separated from those with conductive properties. While the DGU method {{was the first one to}} convincingly produce high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotubes, the rotation speeds involved limit the amount of liquid, and thus nanotubes, that can be processed with this technology. NanoIntegris has recently licensed a new process using selective wrapping of semiconducting nanotubes with conjugated polymers. This method is scalable thus enables the supply of this material in large quantities for commercial applications.|$|E

50|$|An aligned carbon {{nanotube}} ultrasensitive biosensor for DNA detection was developed. The design and fabrication of the biosensor {{was based on}} aligned single wall {{carbon nanotube}}s (SWCNTs) with integrated single-strand DNAs (ssDNA). The fabricated ultra-sensitive biosensor provided label-free real-time electronic detection of DNA hybridization between surface immobilized ssDNA and target ssDNA. Hybridization kinetics between complementary and target ssDNA nucleotide base pairs resulted in a local charge generation between base pairs that was injected into the SWCNTs resulting in a detectable change in SWCNT electrical conductance. This conductance change was amplified electrically through {{the integration of the}} functionalized SWCNTs as the <b>semi-conductive</b> channel in a silicon-silicon oxide based field effect transistor (FET). Based on previous Langmuir DNA kinetics calculations, the projected sensitivity level of the SWCNT-DNA sensor was considerably higher than traditional fluorescent and hybridization assays.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common pc-AFM setups {{incorporates}} a light source, which emits in the visible spectrum along with an indium tin oxide (ITO) <b>semi-conductive</b> layer (used as the bottom cathode). The use of a gold plated silicon AFM probe is often used as the top anode in pc-AFM studies. This electrode which carries relatively small current within it, is able to generate nano-scale holes within the sample material to which the two electrodes are able to detect the relatively small change in conductance due to the flow from the top electrode to the bottom electrode. The combination of these elements produced laser intensities in the range of 10 to 108 W/m2 and decreased the size of the laser spot to sub-micrometer dimensions making this technique useful for the application of nm thin OPV films.|$|E

50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} bus wires which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a <b>semi-conductive</b> polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an inner jacket which separates the bus wires from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability {{to cut to length}} in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based on the type of polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to high inrush currents on starting up similar to an 'induction' motor so a higher rated contactor is required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest in monitoring and controlling of pH. It has become {{an important aspect of}} many industrial wastewater treatment processes. At the same time, the demand for smaller electronic devices used for various industrial and commercial applications has greatly increased. Micro and nano materials, such as Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), are known for their excellent electrical and mechanical properties, as well as for their small size, therefore they are good candidates to manufacture micro or nano electronic devices. These devices can be used for pH control. However, this cannot be achieved unless CNTs with metallic or <b>semi-conductive</b> band structures can be successfully deposited and separated. In these processes, microchip fabrication and deposition of CNTs using Dielectrophoresis are involved. Besides the application of DEP, an Atomic Force Microscope is used to test the conductivity of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with a conductive cantilever-tip structure. Then, the resistance map and the I-V characteristic curve of a carbon nanotube can be obtained to describe its electrical properties. Thus, an accurate and efficient approach to verify CNTs metallic or <b>semi-conductive</b> has been achieved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fundamental {{studies on}} the thermoelectricity have been mainly done in the pseudo binary systems of Mg 2 Si – Mg 2 Ge – Mg 2 Sn. In recent years, their thermoelectricity is {{revisited}} because of light-weight, low initial const and short turning back time in addition to high potential in figure-of-merit for ZT approaching to unity or more.

The time-evolution of the current strongly depended {{on the quality of}} the inoculum. Inoculating with young cells significantly shortened the initial lag-phase and using the same inoculum improved the reproducibility of the current–time curves. The whole set of experiments showed that 254 SMO stainless steel provided higher current densities (on average 14. 1 A/m 2) than biofilms formed on 316 L stainless steel (on average 4. 5 A/m 2). Biofilm coverage assessed by epifluorescent microscopy showed that coverage ratios were generally higher for 316 L than for 254 SMO. It must be concluded that 254 SMO is more efficient in transferring electrons to bacterial cells than 316 L. Mott–Schottky diagrams recorded on both materials under conditions of electrolysis in the absence of microorganisms showed that the surface oxide layers had similar n-type <b>semi-conductive</b> behaviour for potential values higher than the flat band potential. In contrast, 316 L exhibited slight p-type behaviour at potential lower than the flat band potential, while 254 SMO did not. The higher electrochemical performances of biocathodes formed on 254 SMO are explained by <b>semi-conductive</b> properties of its passive layer, which prevented the p-type behaviour occurring in cathodic electrolysis conditions...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} work, we reported the high field effect mobility of ZnO-doped In 2 O 3 (IZO) thin film transistors (TFTs) irradiated by excimer laser annealing (ELA) [M. Fujii et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 102, 122107 (2013) ]. However, {{a deeper understanding}} of the effect of ELA on the IZO film characteristics based on crystallinity, carrier concentrations, and optical properties is needed to control localized carrier concentrations for fabricating self-aligned structures in the same oxide film and to adequately explain the physical characteristics. In the case of as-deposited IZO film used as the channel, a high carrier concentration due to a high density of oxygen vacancies was observed; such a film does not show the required TFT characteristics but can act as a conductive film. We achieved a decrease in the carrier concentration of IZO films by crystallization using ELA. This means that ELA can form localized conductive or <b>semi-conductive</b> areas on the IZO film. We confirmed that the reason for the carrier concentration decrease was the decrease of oxygen-deficient regions and film crystallization. The annealed IZO films showed nano-crystalline phase, and the temperature at the substrate was substantially less than the temperature limit for flexible films such as plastic, which is 50 °C. This paves the way for the formation of self-aligned structures and separately formed conductive and <b>semi-conductive</b> regions in the same oxide film...|$|E
