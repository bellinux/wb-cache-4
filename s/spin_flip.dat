5000|$|A major {{drawback}} of {{this method}} with the single <b>spin</b> <b>flip</b> choice in systems like Ising model is that the tunneling time scales as a power law as [...] where z is greater than 0.5, phenomenon known as critical slowing down.|$|E
50|$|An {{example is}} {{phosphorescent}} {{glow in the}} dark materials, which absorb light and form an excited state whose decay involves a <b>spin</b> <b>flip,</b> and is therefore forbidden by electric dipole transitions. The result is emission of light slowly over minutes or hours.|$|E
50|$|Spin {{transmission}} {{depends on}} the alignment of magnetic moments in the ferromagnets. If a current is passing into a ferromagnet whose majority spin is spin up, for example, then electrons with spin up will pass through relatively unhindered, while electrons with spin down will either 'reflect' or <b>spin</b> <b>flip</b> scatter to spin up upon encountering the ferromagnet to find an empty energy state in the new material. Thus if both the fixed and free layers are polarised in the same direction, the device has relatively low electrical resistance, whereas if the applied magnetic field is reversed and the free layer's polarity also reverses, then the device has a higher resistance due to the extra energy required for <b>spin</b> <b>flip</b> scattering.|$|E

After determining the resonance’s frequency, we varied the dipole’s strength, frequency range, and frequency ramp time. At the rf-dipole’s maximum strength, and optimum frequency range and ramp time, we measured a spin-flip efficiency of 99. 3 %± 0. 1 %.

5000|$|The {{goal of the}} Japanese/German BASE {{collaboration}} [...] are high-precision {{investigations of}} the fundamental properties of the antiproton, namely the charge-to-mass ratio and the magnetic moment. To this end single antiprotons are stored in an advanced Penning trap system, which has a double-trap system at its core. It consists of a precision trap and an analysis trap. The precision trap is for high precision frequency measurements, the analysis trap has a strong magnetic field inhomogeneity superimposed, which is used for single particle <b>spin</b> <b>flip</b> spectroscopy. By measuring the <b>spin</b> <b>flip</b> rate {{as a function of}} the frequency of an externally applied magnetic-drive, a resonance curve is obtained.

50|$|With micro-canonic choice, the {{metropolis}} method must be employed. Because {{there is no}} right way of choosing which state is to be picked, one can particularize and choose to try to flip one spin at the time.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of Wolff algorithm over other algorithms for magnetic spin simulations like single <b>spin</b> <b>flip</b> {{is that it}} allows non-local moves on the energy.

This sort of activity led Mott to writing two books. The first one, which was edited together with Ian Sneddon, gives a simple and clear description of quantum mechanics, {{with an emphasis on}} the Schrödinger equation in real space. The second describes atomic and electronic collisions in gases, using the rotational symmetry of electronic states in the Hartree-Fock method.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the area}} of spectroscopy, singlet fission is a spin-allowed process whereby a singlet excited state {{converts}} to two triplet states. The phenomenon is observed in molecular crystals, aggregates, disordered thin films, and covalently-linked dimers, where the chromophores are oriented such that the electronic coupling between singlet and the double triplet states is large. The process often occurs on a picosecond or femtosecond timescales, thereby out-competing fluorescence. The process is distinct from intersystem crossing, in that singlet fission does not involve a <b>spin</b> <b>flip,</b> but results in two triplets coupled into an overall singlet. [...] It has been proposed that singlet fission in organic photovoltaic devices could improve the photoconversion efficiencies.|$|E

This component leads to asymmetry in the nuclear <b>spin</b> <b>flips,</b> providing a way to produce a stable and precise value of the nuclear spin polarization.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variant of}} Glauber dynamics of Ising spins on a one-dimensional lattice, where each <b>spin</b> <b>flips</b> according to the relative state of the spin to its left.

In addition, the leftmost <b>spin</b> <b>flips</b> depending on the spin at that site. We explicitly calculate all eigenvalues of the transition matrix for all system sizes and conjecture a formula for the normalization factor of the model. We then analyze two limits of this model, which are analogous to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic behavior in the Ising model for which {{we are able to}} prove an analogous formula for the normalization factor.

5000|$|We {{discuss the}} {{mechanism}} of the spin transition {{by focusing on the}} specific case of iron(II) complexes.

This difference is in the range 1.4-2.4 pm for iron(II) compounds.|$|E
