Based on the statistical examination of <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> reliability, the authors have worked out a range of parts and assembly units with limited failure-free lifetime and subject to operational control. There have been developed techniques for expeditious diagnostics of executive unit drive technical condition based on values of engine current with measured data presented in frequency domain, diagnostics being performed without interrupting the technological process of underground development. There have been found identification frequencies in current range corresponding to defects and failures of separate parts of the electro-mechanical drive of the executive unit. There has been developed a microprocessor diagnostic complex that analyses compliance of hardware-obtained amplitude-frequency characteristics with actual technical conditions of the examined <b>heading</b> <b>machine</b> unit...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling with mild systemic hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborn infants. Study design Infants with HIE {{were randomly assigned to}} the <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling or control group. <b>Selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling was initiated within 6 hours after birth to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 34 degrees +/- 0. 2 degrees C and rectal temperature of 34. 5 degrees to 35. 0 degrees C for 72 hours. Rectal temperature was maintained at 36. 0 degrees to 37. 5 degrees C in the control group. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 18 months of age. The primary outcome was a combined end point of death and severe disability. Results One hundred ninety-four infants were available for analysis (100 and 94 infants in the <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling and control group, respectively). For the <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling and control groups, respectively, the combined outcome of death and severe disability was 31 % and 49 % (OR: 0. 47; 95 % CI: 0. 26 - 0. 84; P =. 01), the mortality rate was 20 % and 29 % (OR: 0. 62; 95 % CI: 0. 32 - 1. 20; P =. 16), and the severe disability rate was 14 % (11 / 80) and 28 % (19 / 67) (OR: 0. 40; 95 % CI: 0. 17 - 0. 92; P =. 01). Conclusions <b>Selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling combined with mild systemic hypothermia for 72 hours may significantly decrease the combined outcome of severe disability and death, as well as severe disability.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimal control of pull manufacturing systems. We study a fluid model of a flow shop, with buffer holding costs non-decreasing along the route. The system is subject to a constant exogenous demand, thus incurring additional shortfall/inventory costs. The objective {{is to determine the}} optimal control for the production rate at each machine in the system. We exhibit a decomposition of the flow shop into "sections" of contiguous machines, where, in each section, the <b>head</b> <b>machine</b> is the bottleneck for the downstream system. We exhibit the form of an optimal control, and show that it is characterized by a set of "deferral times," one for each <b>head</b> <b>machine.</b> Machines which are upstream of a <b>head</b> <b>machine</b> simply adopt a "just [...] in [...] time" production policy. The <b>head</b> <b>machines</b> initially stay idle for a period equal to their deferral time, and thereafter produce as fast as possible, until the initial shortfall is eliminated.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTherapeutic {{hypothermia}} reduces cerebral {{injury and}} improves the neurological outcome secondary to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in newborns. It has been indicated for asphyxiated full-term or near-term newborn infants with clinical signs of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). SourcesA search was performed for articles on therapeutic hypothermia in newborns with perinatal asphyxia in PubMed; the authors chose those considered most significant. Summary of the findingsThere are two therapeutic hypothermia methods: <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling and total body cooling. The target body temperature is 34. 5 °C for <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling and 33. 5 °C for total body cooling. Temperatures lower than 32 °C are less neuroprotective, and temperatures below 30 °C are very dangerous, with severe complications. Therapeutic hypothermia must start {{within the first}} 6 h after birth, {{as studies have shown}} that this represents the therapeutic window for the hypoxic-ischemic event. Therapy must be maintained for 72 h, with very strict control of the newborn's body temperature. It has been shown that therapeutic hypothermia is effective in reducing neurologic impairment, especially in full-term or near-term newborns with moderate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. ConclusionTherapeutic hypothermia is a neuroprotective technique indicated for newborn infants with perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1950s, guitar {{performance}} techniques evolved, {{and aggressive}} usage of a vibrato bar ("tremolo") became widespread. However, the original <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> couldn't withstand {{the rigors of}} constant string tension changing, and strings could go out of tune after using a vibrato mechanism several times. Several manufacturers, including Grover and Floyd Rose, introduced a new design, commonly named locking <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> nowadays: a <b>machine</b> <b>head</b> with additional mechanism to lock it in place and stabilize tuning while playing and using a vibrato bar. However, such <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> reached limited success, mostly because of their price: , locking ones are about 50% more expensive than original. Many break strings when tension is increased while the mechanism is locked and later unlocked, which frequently happens in music stores.|$|R

40|$|Background: Hypothermia {{has been}} shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of hypoxia-ischaemia. It is {{currently}} being evaluated as a potentially therapeutic option in the management of neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. However, significant hypothermia has adverse systemic effects. It has also recently been found that the stress of being cold can abolish the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia. It is hypothesised that <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling (SHC) while maintaining normal core temperature would enable local hypothermic neuroprotection while limiting the stress and side effects of hypothermia...|$|R
30|$|From {{the case}} analysis, {{architectural}} knowledge {{is the important}} role to innovation, {{even though it has}} not been used for radical innovation. The K had changed particularly {{the way in which the}} Pick and Place system was integrated with the rest of the aligner. These changes dealt with component interactions. As a result, Pick and Place machines, particularly the second-generation (i.e., Double <b>Head)</b> <b>machines,</b> were incremental innovation.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the unit during its production, {{including}} an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the <b>head</b> <b>machining</b> (T-Vents), and modified valve lifters to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the cam belt arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving. Around 1998, the spin-on metal canister oil filter was changed to a disposable paper element.|$|R

The patient was treated with <b>selective</b> <b>head</b> cooling, and monitored with transcranial doppler (TCD) studies of cerebral blood flow velocity, and electroencephalograms (EEG). The duration of head cooling was influenced by absent diastolic flow on TCDs, which subsequently improved during hypothermia.

While these protocols initiated therapy within 6  hours of delivery, we began treatment on DOL 8 based on the clinical evidence of increased ICP and the poor prognosis for survival in disseminated HSV infections in the newborn period.|$|R
