2500|$|In March 2012, the USDA {{published}} {{its fifth}} report {{in a series}} of periodic analyses to estimate the extent of trafficking in SNAP; that is, selling or otherwise converting SNAP benefits for cash payouts. Although trafficking does not directly increase costs to the Federal Government, it diverts benefits from their intended purpose of helping low-income families access a nutritious diet. [...] Also trafficking may indirectly increase costs by encouraging participants to stay in the program longer than intended, or by incentivizing new participants seeking to profit from trafficking. The FNS aggressively acts to control trafficking by using SNAP purchase data to identify <b>suspicious</b> <b>transaction</b> patterns, conducting undercover investigations, and collaborating with other investigative agencies.|$|E

40|$|Money {{laundering}} is a {{crime that}} makes it possible to finance other crimes, for this reason, it is important for criminal organizations and their combat is prioritized by nations around the world. The anti-money laundering process has not evolved as expected because it has prioritized only the signaling of <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions.</b> The constant increasing in the volume of transactions has overloaded the indispensable human work of final evaluation of the suspicions. This article presents a multiagent system that aims to go beyond the capture of <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions,</b> seeking to assist the human expert in the analysis of suspicions. The agents created use data mining techniques to create transactional behavioral profiles; apply rules generated in learning process in conjunction with specific rules based on legal aspects and profiles created to capture suspicious transactions; and analyze these <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions</b> indicating to the human expert those that require more detailed analysis.

40|$|The risk {{assessment}} system {{was introduced in}} the Republic of Croatia in 2009, as a result of harmonization with international standards, especially the Directive 2005 / 60 /EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. Risk assessment is an extensive concept which requires not only a legislative framework, but also the application of numerous criteria for its effective implementation in practice. Among these criteria are <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions,</b> closely related to the assessment of the customer, transaction, product or service. The undeniable contribution of <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions</b> {{to the quality of the}} {{risk assessment}} system will be confirmed by a statistical analysis of a number of West and East European countries. A combination of strict, but sufficiently flexible legal provisions governing the system for prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and a statistical analysis of reported <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions</b> will lead to conclusions that either support or represent criticism of the efficiency of application of the risk assessment system in practice. The aforementioned statistical analysis will show whether <b>suspicious</b> <b>transactions</b> are a reliable criterion for the risk assessment analysis, and whether they can be considered the only such criterion. There is a possibility that the findings of the analysis will be contradictory to those of some international studies...|$|R

50|$|When {{the first}} version of the CTR was introduced, the only way a <b>suspicious</b> <b>transaction</b> less than $10,000 was {{reported}} to the government was if a bank teller called law enforcement. This was primarily due to the financial industry's concern about the right to financial privacy. On October 26, 1986, {{with the passage of the}} Money Laundering Control Act, the right to financial privacy was no longer an issue. As part of the Act, Congress had stated that a financial institution could not be held liable for releasing suspicious transactional information to law enforcement. As a result, the next version of the CTR had a <b>suspicious</b> <b>transaction</b> check box at the top. This was in effect until April 1996 when the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) was introduced.|$|E
