5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E

25|$|Coulter later {{stated that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to mistrust {{the motives of}} Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a {{favorable}} settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would {{give the impression that}} Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.|$|E
25|$|The Orissa Gazette of 1956 {{mentions}} some occasions {{where the}} devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would {{dance at the}} Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, after breakfast, would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar). This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badashringhar, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. After they would leave, a Bhitar Gaauni would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijay) and sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. After a while, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> out and announce that the Lord has gone to sleep and then the guard would close the main gate.|$|E

500|$|That night, {{when the}} group arrives at a {{roadside}} truck stop, {{one of the girls}} sneaks out and poisons the sodas the agents ordered. Mulder realizes the girls' plan and manages to keep Scully from drinking her soda. The agents then pursue the girls through the truck stop, with Mulder eventually capturing them. Teena and Cindy, now known as [...] "Eve 9" [...] and [...] "Eve 10," [...] end up sharing the psychiatric ward with Eve 6 in the mental hospital. Eventually, a woman wearing a lab coat—identified as Eve 8—comes to the ward. When Eve 8 asks the girls how they knew <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> for them, the girls each respond, [...] "We just knew." ...|$|E
500|$|Moffat {{also brought}} back the {{character}} of River Song from his fourth series episodes [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead". In the former, River asks the Doctor if he had done the [...] "crash of the Byzantium" [...] with her yet. Actress Alex Kingston did not expect the return, but stated that Moffat [...] "always intended that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back". Moffat was influenced by Audrey Niffenegger's novel, The Time Traveler's Wife, {{in which a woman}} {{falls in love with a}} man who unintentionally moves through time. Moffat used this inspiration in his episode [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace", but Alex Kingston, as well as reviewers have compared River to The Time Traveler's Wife.|$|E
500|$|Turner's {{discovery}} in Hollywood {{is considered by}} film historians to be a show-business legend, [...] and has been recounted numerous times with slight variations. One {{version of the story}} has her discovery occurring at Schwab's Pharmacy, but according to both Turner and a 1995 Los Angeles Times article, this was a reporting error that began circulating after the publication of articles by columnist Sidney Skolsky. According to Turner, as a junior at Hollywood High School, she skipped a typing class and bought a Coke at the Top Hat Malt Shop located on the southeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and McCadden Place. While in the shop, Turner was spotted by William R. Wilkerson, publisher of The Hollywood Reporter. Wilkerson was attracted by her beauty and physique, and with the permission of her mother, referred her to the actor/comedian/talent agent Zeppo Marx. In December 1936, Turner was introduced by Marx to film director Mervyn LeRoy, who signed her to a fifty-dollar weekly contract with Warner Bros. on February 22, 1937. At the suggestion of LeRoy, she would take the stage name Lana Turner, a name <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to legally adopt several years later.|$|E

500|$|When Lillian Walden {{retired in}} 1950, {{the price for}} {{a woman at the}} brothel was $5. Afterwards, the Dumas's {{operations}} went to Elinore Knott. The Nadeaus also ceased being owners of the brothel around this time. Knott's management of the Dumas was short. In 1955 she committed suicide after her lover died of a heart attack. When the late 1960s came about, several local police officers were taking the initiative to close the three operating high-class sex houses: Hotel Victoria, Windsor Hotel and the Dumas. The Dumas did not remain closed for long however, with its next madam, Bonita Farren, operating it from 1955 until her death from cancer in 1969. In 1970 the Dumas was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a [...] "Victorian Brothel" [...] and an active house of prostitution. By the following year, Ruby Garret, a local resident of Butte for some thirty years, had purchased the Dumas. Garret would pay local police officers and officials $200 to $300 a month in return for their silence about the Dumas's activities. Under Garrett, the cost of a prostitute was $20. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> upon financial difficulties however, being charged with tax evasion in 1981. The Dumas Brothel was closed the following year.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} created by Kazuma Kaneko. In keeping with the [...] "MegaTen Detective" [...] theme, Kaneko emulated the genre's hard-boiled elements in his character designs. Kuzunoha's character design {{was inspired by the}} first animated version of Japanese character Lupin III, the main protagonists of Tantei Monogatari and , and the titular character from The Adventures of Ford Fairlane. Rei Reiho, who Kaneko later referred to as his favorite female character design, was created to be the main character's sidekick and consequently was portrayed as a strong character. Her appearance was influenced by Japanese model Kitaura Tomoe. Her choker necklace, which was hung with coins needed to cross the Sanzu River after death, was part of how Kaneko expressed the story's hard-boiled elements. The character Sid Davis was created as Ito wanted a black character in the game: the star mark on his forehead represented a pentagram, which resulted in him getting the production nickname [...] "shooting star". The name of true antagonist Inaruna was influenced by Sumerian mythology. She was originally going to be Princess Takiyasha, the legendary daughter of Taira no Masakado: while the explicit details were changed, Inaruna's character was still influenced by the tales surrounding Takiyasha. Her reincarnation in the form of Kumiko was a conscious reference to the Megami Tensei series' titular concept of reincarnation. Kumiko's early portrayal was far gentler than she was in the final game: given a high-class background, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> across as a Yamato nadeshiko. Supporting character Dr. Victor was based on the titular protagonist of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Future character designer Shigenori Soejima worked on the game a sprite designer. Devil Summoner would be his very first work within the Megami Tensei franchise.|$|E
500|$|... "Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a very natural way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge to me. All of Taylor's world is very far away from my culture, but I saw something in her that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't want to go for a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E

While they were engaged, Balanchine made extravagant romantic gestures and treated Tallchief with great affection. [...] "He was obviously trying to convince me [...] was inevitable", she wrote.

2500|$|Tilley {{was born}} in Commandery Street, Worcester, Worcestershire in 1864. Her father, known as Harry Ball, was a comedy actor, {{songwriter}} and music hall chairman; with his encouragement, Tilley first appeared on stage {{at the age of}} three and a half. At the age of six she did her first role in male clothing, billed as [...] "The Pocket Sims Reeves", a reference to the then-famous opera singer. She also performed songs from his repertoire, to add to the illusion. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to prefer doing male roles exclusively, saying that [...] "I felt that I could express myself better if I were dressed as a boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macleod {{relied on}} Peter Walker for advice; Walker {{described}} him as not “at ease on economics”. He planned to hold down nationalised industry prices {{in an attempt to}} control inflation. Macleod bequeathed his successors a detailed plan for tax reform, much of which was put into action. He also left behind him an outline budget which some observers found surprisingly hard-line in its proposals for control of public spending. This included the infamous abolition of free school milk, which became the first significant Ministerial act of the new Education Secretary and future Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to be known as [...] "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher", as a result.|$|E

2500|$|Brooks was {{the first}} known American {{sculptor}} working in the medium of butter, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{to be identified as}} [...] "The Butter Woman". In 1867, she created her first butter sculpture, when, after the failure of the farm's cotton crop, she sought a source of supplemental income. Farm women of the time often created decoratively shaped butter using butter molds, but rather than molding, Brooks sculpted the butter into shapes such as shells, animals, and faces. Rather than traditional sculpting tools, she used [...] "common butter-paddles, cedar sticks, broom straws and camel's-hair pencils". Her customers appreciated the skillfully sculpted butter, and there was a good market for her works. She continued producing her butter sculptures for {{about a year and a}} half, then took a break from it for a few years.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Amber {{discovered}} she was pregnant, {{forcing her to}} admit to Daniel {{that she had a}} one-night stand with Josh. Rosenow commented that it was not [...] "an ideal situation" [...] and that Amber hoped the baby was Daniel's, as she wanted their relationship to work. Amber later took a paternity test and Daniel assured her that no matter what the result was, he would support her. However, Daniel was [...] "devastated" [...] when Josh was confirmed to be the father. He tried [...] "to put a brave face on things", but soon realised that he could not support Amber and the baby financially. This gave Josh an opportunity to try and prove himself to Amber, hoping <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back to him. But Daniel sold some shares in Off Air to lessen his financial troubles. As their relationship became more strained, Daniel attempted to [...] "get things back on track" [...] with a romantic gesture. But they soon realised that too much had changed and decided to break-up.|$|E
2500|$|Kuk Harrell, {{one of the}} {{producers}} of Talk That Talk, spoke on the recording of the album saying: [...] "In addition to touring, we are recording Rihanna's new album. We have a portable studio that we set up at the different hotels that we are staying at. We set up shop anywhere in the hotel. Before {{we went on the}} European leg of Rihanna's Loud tour, we started recording the album in Los Angeles. Rihanna likes to work late hours, so <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> into the studio at 9pm and work until 6am." [...] Continuing Harrell stated [...] "The show was the priority, and then the album. That's how the day was broken up." [...] Expanding on this Harrell stated that Rihanna would perform every night, finish her meet [...] and greet by 1 a.m. Then go to the studio for around two or three a.m. During these session Harrell stated [...] "I’d make the decision based off where I felt her voice was. Knowing she just did two hours of a show and meet-and-greets, I would suggest capturing the stuff that was easier to get like the lower-range stuff so we wouldn’t hurt or damage her voice." ...|$|E
