Within these generic types of assemblies there are variations within the cladding type as well as assembly configuration. Investigations of exterior <b>wall</b> <b>assemblies</b> using infrared thermographic radiometers are carried out to obtain information related to: 1) moisture accumulation, 2) air leakage, 3) variations within thermal resistances of similar assembly configuration and 4) structural thermal bridging.

The temperature profile inside the enclosure was measured by thermocouples whereas a CCD camera was employed to obtain the mean flame height of the ejected flames.

The effects of the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> on the mean flame height are pronounced for a relative larger flame than a small one having the same separation distance of the <b>side</b> <b>walls.</b> In addition as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance decreases, the effects become larger leading to flame heights much higher than those without sidewalls. A global dimensionless parameter K is proposed to account for the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects, based characteristic length scales of the opening, and the distance between the <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> D.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> normal to the façade wall. By changing the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> the facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> decreases the behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as the dominant entrainment is from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) independent of the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as both the entrainment from the two side directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect on the flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> separation distance.
