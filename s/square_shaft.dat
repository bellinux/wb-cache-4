500|$|The Chrysler Building did {{not have}} the {{standard}} 1920s-skyscraper design of columns with a decorative base, plain shaft and decorative capitals; instead, the entire skyscraper contains ornate ornamental features. The building's height and the legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen toward this design. The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from the sidewalk property lines, except for a hole on one side that gives the building a [...] "U"-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor. There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a ziggurat {{on one side and a}} U-shaped palazzo on the other. Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, upon which the structure funnels into a Maltese cross shape that [...] "blends the <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> to the finial", according to author and photographer Cervin Robinson. The fa√ßade of the building is mostly covered in white brick, while dark gray brick is used mostly as a horizontal decoration to highlight the rows of windows.|$|E

He also designed the new Pinhead as wearing a white priest's robe rather than the original black leather, as a homage to {{the origins of the}} word [...] "cenobite" [...] which implies a religious connection.|$|R
2500|$|The arch {{is located}} below the Chain Road leading to today's Chain Gate, and a <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> cut {{down under the}} arch allows {{sighting}} of the wall's original massive foundations, [...] "with fourteen courses of dressed stone below the present ground level." [...] Over the prayer hall area within the Arch is the large building known as the [...] "Makhkama" [...] or [...] "Tankiziah," [...] that includes a porch looking over the Temple Mount.

2500|$|A path leads {{up through}} a Solomonic gateway {{overlooking}} the excavations of the Oriental Institute. A solid circular stone structure has been interpreted as an altar or a high place from the Canaanite period. Further on is a grain pit from the Israelite period for storing provisions in case of siege; the stables, originally thought to date {{from the time of}} Solomon but now dated {{a century and a half}} later to the time of Ahab; and a water system consisting of a <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> [...] deep, the bottom of which opens into a tunnel bored through rock for [...] to a pool of water.|$|E
2500|$|The memorial, {{commissioned}} by the War Memorial Committee and designed by Philip B. Bennison, commemorates the servicemen and civilians {{who lost their lives}} in World War I. The main figure on the memorial is the draped Winged Victory (also called Triumphant Youth). The unveiling program describes it as: [...] "The winged figure of Triumphant Youth which crowns the column, symbolizes a spiritual freedom and regeneration which comes through pain and sacrifice." [...] It is sculpted in bronze and sits upon several pedestals made of limestone and ashlar. First below the sculpture is a chamfered plinth and cornice that carries on each of its four faces the bronze: the Hartlepool town seal, the Brus family (Hartlepool overlords) coat of arms, the coat of arms of Prince Bishops of Durham and, representing the Raid on Hartlepool, a 1914 dated cartouche of the lighthouse. The bronze panels were made by R.H. Machin. The pedestal at the base is a <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> that is rockfaced and coursed.|$|E

60|$|Then {{for an hour}} we raced over true prairie, great yellow-green plains crossed by old buffalo trails, {{which do}} not improve motor springs, till a single chimney broke the horizon like a mast at sea; and thereby were more light-hearted men and women, a shed and a tent or two for workmen, the ribs and frames of the brick-making mechanism, a fifteen foot <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> sunk, sixty foot down to the clay, and, stark and black, the pipe of a natural-gas well. The rest was Prairie--the mere curve of the earth--with little grey birds calling.|$|E
60|$|They are {{noticed by}} Mr. Whewell as forming {{the figure of}} the fleur-de-lis, always a mark, when in tracery bars, of the most debased flamboyant. It occurs in the central tower of Bayeux, very richly in the buttresses of St. Gervais at Falaise, and in the small niches of some of the {{domestic}} buildings at Rouen. Nor is it only the tower of St. Ouen which is overrated. Its nave is a base imitation, in the flamboyant period, of an early Gothic arrangement; the niches on its piers are barbarisms; there is a huge <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> run through the ceiling of the aisles to support the nave piers, the ugliest excrescence I ever saw on a Gothic building; the traceries of the nave are the most insipid and faded flamboyant; those of the transept clerestory present a singularly distorted condition of perpendicular; even the elaborate door of the south transept is, for its fine period, extravagant and almost grotesque in its foliation and pendants. There is nothing truly fine in the church but the choir, the light triforium, and tall clerestory, the circle of Eastern chapels, the details of sculpture, and the general lightness of proportion; these merits being seen to the utmost advantage by the freedom of the body of the church from all incumbrance.|$|E

Behind it runs {{the route of}} the Metrolink to East Didsbury and Manchester Airport, and Chorlton Brook runs past it on the north side (Mauldeth Road West passes it on the southern side). It is a brick, three-storey brick building with gabled wings which are ornamented with balls. The central portion of the house is surmounted with a parapet in the form of three smaller gables with similar finials. The chimneys are <b>square</b> <b>shafts</b> set diagonally on square bases.|$|R

Arne {{by means of}} eight <b>square</b> <b>shafts</b> (10 x 10 m; square E was 10 x 15 m) in 1933, witnesses three main periods of development. The earliest (Shah III) is dated back to the Chalcolithic period and is represented by numerous graves containing black or grey ware and painted pottery decorated by black patterns on a reddish ground. Shah IIB and IIA are both referred to the Bronze Age and contain burials characterized by black or grey pottery and alabaster vessels. The uppermost layer (Shah I) contained Muslim graves in association with other material of the same period.|$|R

50|$|The present Carew Tidal Mill has two water wheels, {{one with}} the date of 1801, so was {{probably}} built around that time.The floodgates in the causeway dam were opened as the tide rose and filled the mill pond, then closed to contain {{the water in the}} pool when the tide began to ebb. When there was enough difference between the water levels the miller opened the sluice gates so the water would run from the pond through sluices under the mill, driving the water wheels.There are two 4.8 m undershot water wheels with wooden bucket paddles.One water wheel is 1.65 m wide and the other is 2.1 m wide. Both have 225 mm <b>square</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{south side}} of the {{building}} was mostly constructed in the 17th century and consists of a variety of materials that meet with vertical seams and straight joints. The east end has about 9 ft of the original brickwork which meets with a yellow ashlar walling, which extends 60 ft, the same length as the original higher part of the north front. Then there is 40 ft of stone-rubble walling which is believed to be where the former west range of the manor adjoined the north range and contains modern windows and doors.

It was carved in 1630 by John Mylne the King's Master Mason.Obelisk dials are made up of three parts. The base element is a <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> with four or five square panels on each side. In these panels are often sunken dials of bowl-hollows, hearts or {{triangular}} and rectangular shapes. The middle element is an octangonal section boss. The corners may be cut away and have dials inscribed in the hollows. The crowning element is a square tapering finial which when viewed with the lower <b>square</b> <b>shaft</b> produces the obelisk appearance. This finial also has panelled sides with up to seven or eight on each side. There can be 70 or 80 surfaces in total available for dials.|$|E
40|$|AbstractChemical wet-etching is a {{standard}} technique for microelectrode arrays (MEA) fabrication. However its manufacturing reproducibility continues to be hindered by its dependence on several process parameters. Following previous works on aluminum-based MEA fabrication [1], this paper provides the first insight on a parametric study of the wet-etching process for an aluminum neural MEA. By playing around with some process parameters, one can achieve more homogeneous shafts with vertical or pyramidal profiles. High width uniformity (96 %) along the high-aspect-ratio shafts was accomplished through {{the introduction of a}} sacrificial frame around the array. At the same time, the new fabrication approach transforms vertical <b>square</b> <b>shafts</b> into sharpened shafts with pyramidal geometries. Through fine control of the etching dynamics, different shafts geometries are feasible, allowing customized neural MEA designs for each application...|$|R
500|$|A small statue only [...] in height, but {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to its larger neighbour, is located inside the artificial cave named the Vidyhadhara Guha. The cave {{was created by}} carving [...] into the rock, leaving four <b>square</b> <b>shafted</b> stone columns {{at the sides of}} the [...] wide and [...] high opening. The base of the lotus shaped seat of the Buddha image here is also decorated with designs of lions. A throne and a parasol are carved behind it, more elaborate in design than the larger image. A prabhamandala, or halo, is carved behind the head of the statue, which rests between two four-armed deities. According to archaeologist H. C. P. Bell, the god on the right is Brahma, and the god on the left is Vishnu. The walls of the cave were once decorated with frescoes, traces of which remain in the two corners {{at the back of the}} cave.|$|R
50|$|In {{the church}} yard is a sundial (with the gnomon missing) dating {{probably}} {{from the early}} 19th century. It consists of a copper dial on a short tapered <b>square</b> gritstone <b>shaft</b> with a <b>square</b> head standing on a weathered red sandstone base. Churchwardens' initials are engraved on the dial. It is listed at Grade II. The churchyard contains the war grave of a First World War Canadian soldier.|$|R

25|$|The {{tower is}} early 14th-century, Perpendicular, and of two stagesa tall lower stage, with belfry aboveand is partly clasped {{by the north}} and south aisles. Angled buttresses of three steps run at each corner to the belfry stage and are {{continued}} to near the parapet by <b>square</b> <b>shafts,</b> topped by crocketed pinnacles set away from the tower face. On both west corners the buttresses sit on a moulded socle (plinth) topped by a cill bandangled projection that allows water to flow from a building facethat continues in this style around the tower and south aisle only. The north-east and south-east buttresses spring from {{the north and south}} aisle and nave roofs. The north-west corner has a five-sided stair turret built out from the tower, with a slit window at the west, and belfry stairs within. Between each angle buttress, except those at the stair turret corner, is a projecting gargoyle {{at the height of the}} clerestory parapet. The tower 14th-century west doorway is pointed, with four set-back continuous mouldings set on a single running plinth. Around the doorway, from the spring, is a hood mould. Within the doorway is a plank double door with large decorative iron face hinges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} a two-story, Georgian Revival, tan brick building. [...] It {{is built on}} a {{concrete}} foundation. The building features a stylized Greek temple front on {{the north and south}} elevations, which emphasizes the building‚Äôs entrances. The temple features four columns that are attached to the building with tapered, <b>square</b> <b>shafts</b> and stylized capitals. The columns support a Classical entablature that includes dentils, round medallions, and stepped fascia. A heavy cornice crowns the perimeter of the building. The building features rectangular windows on both floors, but the first floor windows are framed with arches. Keystones made of concrete highlight the windows. Deep awnings are above the primary entrances. [...] The Burlington Freight House is a single-story building that is constructed with the same materials as Union Station. [...] As mentioned above the building featured docks, with oversized doors on both {{the north and the south}} sides of the building. The south dock, however, has been removed to accommodate an access ramp. The architectural style is the same as that of the station.
