50|$|Unlike with {{ordinary}} gear trains, {{the direction of}} transmission (input shaft vs output shaft) is not reversible when using large reduction ratios, due to the greater friction involved between the worm and worm-wheel, when usually a single start (one <b>spiral)</b> <b>worm</b> is used. This can be an advantage when it is desired to eliminate any possibility of the output driving the input. If a multistart worm (multiple spirals) is used then the ratio reduces accordingly and the braking effect of a worm and worm-gear {{may need to be}} discounted, as the gear may be able to drive the worm.|$|E

5000|$|Universal Dividing heads: some manual {{indexing}} {{heads are}} equipped with a power drive provision. This allows {{the rotation of the}} dividing head to be connected to the table feed of the milling machine instead of using a hand crank. A set of change gears is provided to select the ratio between the table feed and rotation. This setup allows the machining of spiral or helical features such as <b>spiral</b> gears, <b>worms,</b> or screw type parts because the part is simultaneously rotated {{at the same time it}} is moved in the horizontal direction. This setup is called a [...] "PTO dividing head".|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{chemical}} gardens is studied experimentally in a horizontal confined geometry when {{a solution of}} metallic salt is injected into an alkaline solution at a fixed flow rate. Various precipitate patterns are observed - <b>spirals,</b> flowers, <b>worms</b> or filaments - depending on the reactant concentrations. In {{order to determine the}} relative importance of the chemical nature of the reactants and physical processes in the pattern selection, we compare the structures obtained by performing the same experiment using different pairs of reactants of varying concentrations with cations of calcium, cobalt, copper, and nickel, and anions of silicate and carbonate. We show that although the transition zones between different patterns are not sharply defined, the morphological phase diagrams are similar in the various cases. We deduce that the nature of the chemical reactants is not a key factor for the pattern selection in the confined chemical gardens studied here and that the observed morphologies are generic patterns for precipitates possessing a given level of cohesiveness when grown under certain flow conditions.
