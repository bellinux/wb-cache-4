This study describes research conducted with a large (600 + students) first year accounting course during March-April 1998. The research focused on the impact of a web learning environment on student learning. The research used multiple methods to gain insight into the learning phenomenon including: case study, experimental and survey work. The research design generated both quantitative and qualitative data with which to test a research model and a series of hypotheses. Major findings included a <b>supporting</b> <b>chain</b> of evidence that the web learning environment had a significant positive impact on student learning working through the intervening variable of student attitude towards the subject content area. The positive impact on student learning was significant for both deep and surface learning, using Bloom's taxonomy for measuring depth of learning. Students also appeared to learn more with less time-on-task. Student participants were largely enthusiastic about the system. However a significant minority preferred more human contact than was provided. Outcomes of the study included formative recommendations for future research and development of web based courses including collaborative and quality recommendations...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} use and presence of ECR technologies and ideas in Finnish grocery retailing. Efficient Consumer Response is a strategy for grocery business to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} whole supply chain by working in co-operation and using accurate data to control the process. The main idea of it is to integrate the physical material flow and data flow between the members of the supply chain. The study gives an overview of the ECR concept and the basic ideas of it in the grocery business and a comparison of it with ideas of other leading authors in the field of logistics. Finnish storekeepers and persons from the <b>supporting</b> <b>chain</b> organisations were interviewed during this study and the collected data was used in quantitative and qualitative analysis and conclusions of the present situation in Finland. The study indicates that in terms of ECR knowledge of storekeepers there is no difference between studied store chains. Basic technologies are relatively well known but more sophisicated technologies should be known better. Attitudes of the persons in supporting organisations of the more advanced chain indicates that the use of information technology is seen as a competitive matter. In general, Finnish grocery retailers are trying to find a competitive edge via more sophisticated and accurate use of information technology which dives deep into the needs of the final customer...|$|E

This approach is termed eclectic because it is based on a toolbox of mini-theories integrating existing strategic (IS) planning a n d management theories. The core component of this approach is an IOS scenario and strategic option generator" based on forcing relationships between interactive IT capabilities and so-called business impact areas in an inside-out analysis on the intra-organisational company level, and an outside-in analysis on inter-organisational company network level. These impact areas embrace, on a company level, (i) the internal IT service chain structure (IT chain. focus), (ii) the value chain structure (value chain focus), and (iii) the competitive industry structure (value system focus). n company network level they embrace, (iv) the intermediating <b>support</b> <b>chain</b> structure !<b>support</b> <b>chain</b> focus), (v) the inter- organisational supply chain structure (supply chain focus) and (vi) the customer cummunity structure (demand chain focus) 'Zadanie pt. „Digitalizacja i udostępnienie w Cyfrowym Repozytorium Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego kolekcji czasopism naukowych wydawanych przez Uniwersytet Łódzki” nr 885 /P-DUN/ 2014 zostało dofinansowane ze środków MNiSW w ramach działalności upowszechniającej nauk...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany {{researchers}} have recognized {{a lack of}} common framework to <b>support</b> supply <b>chain</b> modelling and analysis and proposed their solutions accordingly. Majority of the approaches proposed {{are more concerned with}} building an object model of a supply chain than identifying processes which realistically describe a supply chain. Though object models provide means or building blocks necessary to model and analyse different elements of a supply chain, an absence of supply chain processes promotes a 'black box' view on the supply chain. This paper proposes an ontology model specifically developed to <b>support</b> supply <b>chain</b> process modelling and analysis. It is founded on a premise that prior identification of processes the ontology is supposed to support facilitates the ontology development and validation.
