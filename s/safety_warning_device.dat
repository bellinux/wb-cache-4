40|$|The {{purpose of}} this effort was to apply signal {{detection}} theory to descriptively model the impact of five grade crossing safety factors to understand their effect on driver decision making. The safety factors consisted of: improving commercial motor vehicle driver safety through federal regulations, increasing locomotive conspicuity with alerting lights, increasing locomotive conspicuity with reflectors, increasing sight lines, and improving warning device reliability. We estimated d ' and β for eight warning devices associated with each safety factor {{using data from the}} Federal Railroad Administration’s Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident database and Highway-Rail Crossing Inventory. We also calculated ω 2 for each safety factor and device type to examine the reliability of each independent variable on grade crossing safety. The analysis indicated that the first four safety factors listed above were generally equally effective in improving grade crossing <b>safety.</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>device</b> reliability (which pertained to active warning devices only) still contributed to improvements in grade crossing safety, but the effects were more muted. Grade crossing devices (and particularly active warning devices) are an important safety tool because they increase drivers ’ inclinations to stop, and this bias to stop has a greater impact than improving the driver’s ability to detect the train...|$|E

40|$|Based on an {{extended}} Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB, Ajzen, 1985, 1991), we conducted surveys inorder {{to explain and}} predict violations at a railroad crossing, among pedestrians (n = 153) and car drivers(n = 151). Measures were made with respect to three chronologically related railroad crossing situationsthat varied in risk level. The situations were described in scenarios and depicted on photographs. Theparticipants were recruited {{in the suburbs of}} Paris, at two automated railroad crossings with four half-barriers. We found that the pedestrians had stronger crossing intentions than did car drivers, especiallyat the more congested crossing of the two under study. For both categories of road users, intentions andthe amount of intention variance explained by the extended TPB factors decreased significantly with risklevel. In the most dangerous situations, risk-taking was the most unlikely and the least predictable Self-reported past frequency of crossing against <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> was the main predictor of the intentionto commit this violation again, especially among males, followed by the attitude and the injunctive normin favor the violation. Moreover, car drivers were influenced in their crossing intentions by the descriptivenorm. The presence of another vehicle on the tracks when the <b>safety</b> <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> were activated wasperceived not as facilitating, but as an additional risk factor. The discussion addresses the importance oftaking into account these determinants of violations in conceiving countermeasures. Our findings couldbe especially useful for conceiving risk-communication campaigns...|$|R

30|$|In California, CalTrain {{developed}} their own design criteria regarding grade crossings and began implementing them in 1999 [6]. These standard practices utilize active <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> similar to those at vehicular crossings: signal equipment modified from that of vehicular crossing, crossing gate arm, and a crossing configuration which channels pedestrians. Different design criteria apply for pedestrian crossings in general regarding warning time, center fence, <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>safety</b> buffer zone, <b>warning</b> assemblies, gate recovery, as well as pedestrian crossings at stations, at stations and roadway, and crossings between roadway crossings.|$|R

40|$|Background: Throughout 2007 and January 2008, several glitazones health {{warnings}} {{were published}} on rosiglitazone myocardial infarction risk. The {{impact of such}} warnings on glitazones prevalence of utilization has been extensively studied in the United States but only in one European country (England), which has showed different pattern from US studies. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the impact of such <b>safety</b> <b>warnings</b> on glitazones utilization in an area of another European country. Methods: We calculated the number of defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day of glitazones each month during the period from 2006 to 2008 in a health area of Spain. We analyzed the data graphically and through a segmented regression analysis. Results: Rosiglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day were growing before the <b>safety</b> <b>warnings,</b> after the warnings a change in trend occurred and rosiglitazone utilization showed a downturn slope. Pioglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day were stable before the <b>safety</b> <b>warnings,</b> and a linear growth was observed after the <b>safety</b> <b>warnings.</b> Throughout the study period, rosiglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day were higher than pioglitazone defined daily doses per thousand inhabitants per day until near the end of 2008. Conclusion: Despite the fact that cardiovascular warnings affected rosiglitazone and not pioglitazone, rosiglitazone was more utilized than pioglitazone until near the end of 2008 which is a pattern similar to the one found in another European studies in England, but very different from studies in the United States, where rosiglitazone was less utilized than pioglitazone from the first month after rosiglitazone cardiovascular <b>safety</b> <b>warnings...</b>|$|R
