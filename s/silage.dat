5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world commodity prices and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by <b>silage,</b> particularly baled <b>silage</b> wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in <b>silage</b> making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale <b>silage</b> is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} <b>silage,</b> hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century {{saw many}} {{changes in farming}} on Shapinsay. Mechanised {{implements}} came to the island, particularly after the Second World War. In common {{with the rest of}} Orkney, the amount of land given over to growing grass increased. The growing of grain (with the exception of barley) and turnips steadily declined as these were replaced as winter fodder for livestock by <b>silage,</b> usually harvested by mechanical forage harvesters.|$|E

40|$|Whole-plant corn <b>silages</b> {{treated with}} either Pioneer 1174 ® or Biotal® {{inoculants}} were preserved {{more efficiently than}} control <b>silages.</b> They had slightly higher dry matter (DM) recoveries; more lactic acid; higher lactic to acetic acid ratios; and less acetic acid, ethanol, and ammonia-nitrogen. Laboratory silo results showed that both inoculated <b>silages</b> produced lactic acid faster than control <b>silages</b> during the first 7 days and had more desirable fermentation profiles {{at the end of}} 90 days. Applying 5 or 10 times the recommended rate of Biotal inoculant had only a small and nonsignificant effect on rate and efficiency of fermentation.

40|$|The aim was {{to compare}} the effects of {{additives}} on direct cut <b>silages</b> of pure timothy and timothy mixed with tetraploid red clover. First and second growth cuts were ensiled during three consecutive years, 1994, 1995 and 1996, either without any additive or {{with the addition of}} formic acid, or lactic acid bacteria in combination with molasses. Effects of the additives on the degradation characteristics of the herbage and the <b>silages</b> were analysed using an automatic in vitro gas production (GP) technique. At the end of the in vitro procedures, organic matter and neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) degradabilities were determined. The tetraploid red clover persisted in the leys during the 3 years and was the dominant species at the second growth in the mixed leys. The herbage from the mixed crops had lower dry-matter contents, higher crude protein concentrations and higher buffering capacity compared with the pure timothy at both cuts. In general, the additives reduced pH, and the concentrations of ammonium-N and acetic acid in the <b>silages.</b> The treated <b>silages</b> had a more rapid faster GP in both crops. The <b>silages</b> from the mixed crop benefited more from the additives compared with the grass <b>silages.</b> The additives affected the soluble fractions as well as the NDF degradability of the <b>silages</b> of the mixed crop more than those fractions of the grass <b>silages.</b> The addition of molasses in combination with a commercial inocula resulted in increased production of lactic acid and ethanol in <b>silages</b> from both crops. The <b>silages</b> without additives could not meet the requirements for good <b>silages</b> according to the standards of the Swedish dairy industr...|$|R
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, <b>silage</b> or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being <b>silage.</b> Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of <b>silage.</b> Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
40|$|Six {{different}} cotton gin trash <b>silages</b> {{were studied}} which varied {{according to the}} rehydrating medium (water or whey) and the strain of L. plantarum, if any, used for inoculation. <b>Silages</b> were incubated at 34 °C and analyzed at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 for counts of lactobacilli, total anaerobes, and sporeforming anaerobes. Biochemical measurements included pH, proximate analysis, volatile fatty acid analysis, and lactic acid analysis. Counts of lactobacilli and total anaerobes followed similar trends in all experimental <b>silages</b> with numbers greatly increasing {{by the end of}} week one and then subsequently declining. Counts of sporeforming anaerobes increased ten-fold {{by the end of the}} second week. Subsequent counts showed that the water-rehydrated <b>silages</b> maintained this increase whereas the whey <b>silages</b> decreased in numbers to their original magnitude. Whey-rehydrated <b>silages</b> had a significantly lower pH, higher dry matter content, a lower level of fiber, lignin, and cellulose, and a higher concentration of carbohydrate. These <b>silages</b> showed only traces of butyric acid and significantly higher concentrations of lactic acid. Thus the whey, as a rehydrating medium, produced <b>silages</b> of desirable pH and exhibited biochemical parameters indicative of good quality and feeding value.

40|$|Maize {{and grass}} <b>silages</b> are {{commonly}} used as major feed materials for dairy cows in Europe and are becoming common parts of dairy cow rations {{in other parts of}} the world. Thenutritive value of maize and grass <b>silages</b> varies greatly due to variation in chemical composition. A combination of different factors such as the use of various cultivars, fertilization practices, growing conditions, harvesting technology, maturity at harvest and ensiling conditions cause this variation in chemical composition. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ rumen degradation characteristics and in situ mobile nylon bag digestibility of dietary nutrients of maize and grass <b>silages.</b> Maize and grass <b>silages</b> with a broad range in chemical composition and quality parameters were selected from different Dutch commercial farms. The broad range in the chemical composition of the maize and grass <b>silages</b> resulted in a large variation in rumen degradable fractions of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch. The intestinal digestibility of CP, NDF and/or starch was affected by the concentration of these components in the maize and grass <b>silages,</b> by the rumen incubation time and the rumen escape content. Regression equations were developed describing relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and grass <b>silages.</b> A number of the developed regression equations presented in this thesis can be used for accurate and rapid estimation of the ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and grass <b>silages,</b> without conducting time consuming and expensive in situ experiments. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether three cows are sufficient to cover the variation between individual cows in in situ rumen degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and grass <b>silages.</b> Significant differences (P 0. 05) between individual cows were found for all the parameters of DM, OM, CP and NDF. The results suggest that using three cows are sufficient for nylon bag incubations of grass <b>silages</b> and pooling of rumen incubated residues is allowed to obtain a representative sample. The third aim of this thesis was to compare two fractionation methods; the washing machine method and a modified method, for nitrogen (N) and starch fractions of maize <b>silages</b> and N fractions of grass <b>silages.</b> The N and/or starch fractions of maize and grass <b>silages</b> determined, using the washing machine method (washing with water for 40 min) and the modified method (shaking with buffer solution for 60 min) were compared. The different methodological approaches of both methods resulted in different values for the washout (W), the soluble (S) and the non-washout (D+U) fractions of N of maize and grass <b>silages</b> and for the W, the insoluble washout (W-S) and the D+U fractions of starch of maize <b>silages.</b> The loss of insoluble small particles of starch was less during shaking of nylon bags in buffer solution, compared to washing nylon bags in the washing machine. Therefore, large differences were found between the D+U fractions of starch determined by both methods compared to the D+U fractions of N of maize <b>silages.</b> The developed regression equations for W, S and D+U fractions of N in grass <b>silages</b> and for D+U fractions of starch in maize <b>silages</b> determined by both methods can be used for rapid estimation of these fractions from chemical characteristics of maize and grass <b>silages.</b> The information on nutrient bioavailability of maize and grass <b>silages</b> presented in this thesis can be used to more accurately formulate dairy ration in terms of maintenance, health and production of dairy cows...|$|R
5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy <b>silage</b> made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E

Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

5|$|The two Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn crake was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in western Europe, but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan. In {{much of the}} western half of the corn crake's breeding range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue. The main cause of the decline is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers.
