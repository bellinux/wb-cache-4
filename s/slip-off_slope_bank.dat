50|$|On {{the inside}} of a meander is a gentle slope of sedementation {{referred}} to as the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope.</b> It is often marked by a point bar in the river.|$|R
50|$|Deposition on the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> occurs {{due to the}} helical flow in {{meandering}} reaches that {{is constantly}} transferring sediment from the undercut slope {{on the outside of}} the meanders to the inside river banks.|$|R
50|$|North of the Kniebreche on {{both sides}} of the river are more {{historic}} sites. On the right hand bank is the ruined Nidberg Castle on the crags of the Löwenkopffelsen that rise 50 metres above the valley floor, and the deserted village of Schwedengraben, an old mining settlement, on a <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> of the river valley.|$|R
5000|$|A {{point bar}} is a depositional feature made of {{alluvium}} that accumulates {{on the inside}} bend of streams and rivers below the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope.</b> Point bars are found in abundance in mature or meandering streams. They are crescent-shaped and located {{on the inside of}} a stream bend, being very similar to, though often smaller than, towheads, or river islands.|$|R
50|$|Helicoidal flow is a {{contributing}} factor {{to the formation of}} <b>slip-off</b> <b>slopes</b> and river cliffs in a meandering section of the river. The helicoidal motion of the flow aids the processes of hydraulic action and corrasion {{on the outside of the}} meander, and sweeps sediment across the floor of the meander towards the inside of the meander, forming point bar deposits.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> is {{the inside}} bank of a meander on a river where {{sedimentary}} material is deposited {{as a result}} of the slower flow rate. It is on the opposite side of the channel to a river-cut cliff or cut bank which is formed by the erosive forces of the stronger current on that side. The terms are used in connexion with the formation of meanders on a river.|$|R
50|$|A cut bank, {{also known}} as a river cliff or river-cut cliff, is the outside bank of a water channel (stream), which is {{continually}} undergoing erosion. Cut banks are found in abundance along mature or meandering streams, they are located on the outside of a stream bend, known as a meander, opposite the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope</b> {{on the inside of the}} bend. They are shaped much like a small cliff, and are formed by the erosion of soil as the stream collides with the river bank. As opposed to a point bar which is an area of deposition, a cut bank is an area of erosion.|$|R

6000|$|... "Two {{hundred yards}} farther up," [...] the boy said, [...] "is the {{beginning}} of the deep; if you take the water there you will get across so as to climb up by that <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> just opposite." ...|$|R
50|$|The pair {{builds a}} bulky domed nest {{with a side}} {{entrance}} on a <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> next to a stream or path, and the female lays two white eggs which are incubated for 16-17 days with another 13-14 days to fledging.|$|R
6000|$|He {{confined}} {{the rivers}} within their <b>sloping</b> <b>banks,</b> [...] Which {{in different places}} are part absorbed by the earth, [...] Part reach the sea, and being received within the plain [...] Of its freer waters, beat the shore for banks.|$|R
60|$|On {{the fourth}} day after this event we came in sight of the village of Aylmer, which lay calmly on the <b>sloping</b> <b>banks</b> of the river, its church spire {{glittering}} in the sun, and its white houses reflected in the stream.|$|R
60|$|Girths were loosened, and {{the horses}} were at work {{cropping}} the sweet grass near the water's edge. The whole party threw themselves down on a <b>sloping</b> <b>bank,</b> pipes were taken out and lit, and the probable direction of the chase discussed.|$|R
60|$|A whiz and a {{rattle of}} grapeshot among the {{branches}} high {{above his head}} roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the <b>sloping</b> <b>bank,</b> and plunged into the forest.|$|R
50|$|Most meanders {{occur in}} the region of a river channel with shallow gradients, a {{well-developed}} floodplain, and cohesive floodplain material. Deposition of sediment occurs on the inner edge, because the secondary flow of the river sweeps and rolls sand, rocks and other submerged objects across the bed of the river towards the inside radius of the river bend, creating a point bar below the <b>slip-off</b> <b>slope.</b> Meandering morphology is dependent upon similar bank erosion and bar growth rates. Erosion is greater {{on the outside of the}} bend where the soil is not protected by deposits of sand and rocks. The current on the outside bend is more effective in eroding the unprotected soil, and the inside bend receives steadily increasing deposits of sand and rocks, and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a small cliff called a cut bank. This can be seen in areas where willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the inside of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river. This demonstrates the river's movement. Slumping usually occurs on the concave sides of the banks resulting in mass movements such as slides.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{light had}} flickered onwards, now {{stopping}} and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon {{the other side}} of the moat. I let them scramble down the <b>sloping</b> <b>bank,</b> splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.|$|R
60|$|A stage {{had been}} {{constructed}} among some trees and bushes {{with a background}} of the river, and here scores of lamps and lanterns twinkled forth.

6000|$|... § 9. This, then, is {{the problem}} to be considered,--How {{mountains}} of such rugged and precipitous outline, and at the least 3000 feet in height, were originally {{carved out of the}} hardest rocks, and set in their present position {{on the top of the}} green and <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> which sustains them.|$|R
50|$|Between 143.17 km and 143.39 km is {{a section}} of stone {{retaining}} wall. The wall is rubble coursed, less than one metre high and is set into {{the base of a}} grassed, <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> approximately 2.5m high. A small rectangular metal QR sign has been attached to a stone along the wall.|$|R
50|$|The Kairatos is {{a natural}} {{watercourse}} {{on the island of}} Crete in Greece. In the Minoan era, aqueducts diverted water to Kephala hill from spring water sources at Archanes, which springs are the headwaters of the Kairatos River; in fact, the Bronze Age palace of Knossos lay upon the gently <b>sloping</b> <b>banks</b> of the Kairatos.|$|R
50|$|Lake Ubinskoye is an oval-shaped {{lake with}} gently <b>sloping</b> <b>banks.</b> The lake bottom {{consists}} of clayey sand {{covered by a}} thick layer of gray fine-grained silt. There are several islands in the lake, the largest of which is called Medyakovsky. The western part of the Ubinskoye basin also contains a number of other small lakes.|$|R
50|$|It is {{normally}} found in oak forests with a dense bamboo understory from 2500 m altitude to the timberline, but occasionally occurs {{as low as}} 1600 m. The breeding pair builds a bulky domed nest with a side entrance on a <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> or in a gully, and the female lays two white eggs.|$|R

50|$|The <b>sloping</b> <b>banks</b> of {{the lake}} have shrubs {{interspersed}} with grasses and vacant patches, and woody species, generally of acacia species. Akkagoun and Dentaka are the forested areas surrounding the lake and the delta, which are home for many water birds. Algal blooms are also reported from the lake which could result in reduction of the water transparency.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now follow me," [...] said Her Majesty, {{when they}} had all landed. So they walked up the <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> and found {{themselves}} upon a big, circular plain as flat as a platter, which was thickly covered with {{thousands and thousands of}} pins. There were no trees at all, but lying scattered upon the ground were heaps and stacks of the most curious things.|$|R
60|$|The rafts of European rivers {{are usually}} built on shore, and {{launched}} into the water: three slides are laid for the purpose, on the <b>sloping</b> <b>bank</b> of the river; upon these are laid the four poles, secured together by their ends, which are {{to form the}} framework of the raft (fig. 2). Other poles are put in between, until the whole is complete.|$|R
