50|$|A {{submission}} to the ICZN {{was put in}} by Thomson (2006) to maintain the prevailing usage of Chelodina rugosa over the name Chelodina oblonga for the Northern <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> with further comments by several authors. However, in 2013 the ICZN handed down its Opinion on the issue where they deemed that the Principle of Priority should be followed. As such the correct name for the Northern <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> is Chelodina oblonga and for the South-western <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> is Chelodina colliei. This has required considerable effort over the ensuing 12 months to establish this correct nomenclature. As part of this it {{is now seen as}} less than desirable to continue using the name Oblong Turtle for the South-western <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtle,</b> since {{it is based on the}} scientific name of another species.|$|R

50|$|Argentine <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> live in slow-moving ponds, rivers, streams, and marshes, preferably with aquatic vegetation. In coastal areas, {{they will}} enter {{brackish}} water, {{and they may}} hibernate in colder areas of their distribution.

It attacks its prey {{with a combination of}} the Matamata's vacuum suction and the stabbing neck motions of other <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtles.</b> Courtship and mating has not been extensively observed in this species, although it is known that nesting occurs in the spring at the riverbanks.

50|$|The Argentine snake-necked turtle, {{also known}} as the South American snake-necked turtle (Hydromedusa tectifera) is a species of turtle, known for the long neck which gave it its name. Despite appearances, the Argentine snake-necked turtle is {{probably}} more closely related to the Mata mata (Chelus fimbriatus) than to the Australian <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> in the genus Chelodina. It is found in northern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. Not much is known about them, as they have not been extensively researched. They are a popular pet in the exotic pet trade.|$|E
50|$|Chelodina, collectively {{known as}} <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{is a large}} and diverse genus of long-necked Chelid turtles with a {{complicated}} nomenclatural history. Although in the past Macrochelodina and Macrodiremys have been considered separate genera and prior to that all the same, they are now considered subgenera of the Chelodina. Chelodina is an ancient group of Chelid turtles native to Australia, New Guinea, the Indonesian Rote Island, and East Timor. The turtles within this subgenus are small to medium-sized, with oval shaped carapace. They are side-necked turtles, meaning they tuck their head partially {{around the side of}} their body when threatened instead of directly backwards.|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Aquatic feeding {{strikes on}} agile prey in <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> involve fast neck extension, bucco-pharyngo-oesophageal expansion, and head retraction. The ultimate, {{rectilinear}} {{acceleration of the}} head towards the prey requires com-plex vertebral rotations, that vary widely from strike to strike. This poses complex motor control issues for the numerous intrinsic neck-muscles, which are the sole neck extensors. Mathematical modelling reveals that extensor activity might be superfluous for {{this phase of the}} strike. The ultimate acceleration of the head {{at the end of the}} strike always coincides with forceful oropharyngeal expansion. The momentum of the induced flow of water is sufficient to pull the head (and the neck) straight towards the prey. This buccal expansion proceeds identically to that ob-served in primary aquatic feeders: a rostro-caudal expansion sequence character-ized by an optimal timing of the functional components supporting the expansion wave. Yet distinct structural solutions, both at the skeletal, and muscular level, are involved. This points towards prominent hydrodynamic constraints. Head and neck are retracted by extrinsic neck muscles. Given the high number of degrees of freedom, this musculo-skeletal system is obviously under-determined, which com-promises control. We propose that erroneous folding of the neck (i. e., diverging from the highly persistent retracted configuration) might be avoided through the presence of a subtle click system at the level of the joint between cervical vertebrae 5 and 6...|$|E

40|$|Northern <b>snake-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> (Chelodina rugosa) {{traditionally}} {{provided an}} important seasonal {{source of protein}} for indigenous communities in Arnhem Land, northern Australia. Harvest techniques today differ little from those used historically, harvesting being applied in the late dry season when ephemeral waters have drawn down and turtles are aestivating. Radio-telemetry was used to quantify survival rates of C. rugosa at a traditional turtle harvest site and relate them to harvest, predation by feral pigs (Sus scrofa) and environmental factors. Although turtle survival {{was positively correlated with}} body size, the survival of turtles of all sizes and stages of maturity was compromised by pig predation. Seasonal variation in the onset, duration and severity of rainfall and associated influences on periodic drying, are important for C. rugosa survival because such variation influences the timing and intensity of both Aboriginal harvest and pig predation. Contemporary harvest rates of C. rugosa in Arnhem Land by Aboriginal people are very low because pig predation depletes available stocks immediately before Aboriginal harvesting. Aboriginal harvest rates are regulated also by the frequency and timing of ceremonies and other cultural activities that interfere with harvests. Before the arrival of pigs, such relaxation of harvest pressure in years when harvest would otherwise be possible would have contributed to the local abundance and persistence of C. rugosa. In contrast, pig predation is unrelenting, and years of high turtle survival are now restricted only to years of high wet season rainfall...|$|E
