All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite <b>summations</b> to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} some {{applications of}} <b>summation</b> equations {{with regard to}} the calculation prognosis of micro-bearing wear parameters. <b>Summation</b> equations are presented in a new form of difference and recurrence equations where the unknown micro-bearing wear function occurs as the argument of the reciprocal unified operator of <b>summation</b> (UOS). In this paper the properties of the UOS and reciprocal UOS as well as the unitary translation operator (UTO) are defined and applied to a micro-bearing wear determination.
