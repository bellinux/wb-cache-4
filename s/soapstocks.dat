To stabilize shoulders and reduce the number of necessary maintenance cycles per season, one possible stabilizing agent - acidulated soybean oil <b>soapstock</b> (referred to as 2 ̆ 2 <b>soapstock</b> 2 ̆ 2) is investigated in this research. By the end of the study, researchers were able to determine whether and under what conditions this <b>soapstock</b> could be effective in mitigating edge rutting and pot holes for granular shoulders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the effects of the addition of by-products from the refining of vegetable oil on the behavior of co-digestion reactors treating a mixture of grass, cow dung and fruit and vegetable wastes. Three by-products were used: one <b>soapstocks,</b> one used winterisation earth and one skimming of aeroflotation of the effluents. Three 15 -L reactors were run in parallel and fed 5 times a week. In a first phase of 4 weeks, the three reactors were fed with the co-digestion substrates alone (grass, cow dung and fruit and vegetable wastes) at an OLR of 1. 5 g VS/kg. d. Then, one of the three by-products from the refining of oil was added to the feed of each reactor generating a 33 % increase in the OLR (2 gVS/kg. d). The results show that the addition of by-products from the refining of oil is an efficient way to increase the methane production of co-digestion reactors thanks to their high methane yield (0. 77 – 0. 80 l CH 4 /gVS). Indeed, in this work, it was possible to increase by 60 to 65 % the methane production of the reactors by a 33 % increase in the OLR thanks to the addition of the by-products...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} with prime tallow (PT) and Tower rapeseed <b>soapstocks</b> (TSS) to determine the possible synergism between these fats by the total collection and chromic oxide (Cr 2 0 3) apparent metabolizable energy (AME) methods {{as well as the}} true metabolizable energy (TME) assay and to examine the effect of inclusion level on the metabolizable energy (ME) values of fats. Graded levels of 0, 3, 6, and 9 % of each of PT, TSS, and a 1 : 1 blend of the two were fed to groups of adult roosters, and the ME values of the test fats and the mixture were evaluated from a linear regression of the ME of the diets and the levels of fat inclusion. The total collection and Cr 2 0 3 methods gave essentially the same AME values for PT as well as for TSS when these fats were fed separately. The 1 : 1 blend of these fats gave a somewhat higher value with the index meth-od than with the total collection procedure. A positive synergistic effect of blending PT with TSS was observed in all three methods. Increases in the observed ME of the mixture over the calculated ME were 3. 94, 5. 26, and 5. 72 %, respectively, for the total collection, C r j 0 3, and TME assays. When calculated by difference, the ME values of the two fats and the blend varied widely with in-clusion level in all three assay procedures.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of biodiesel production from <b>soapstock</b> containing {{high water content}} and fatty matters by a solid acid catalyst was investigated. <b>Soapstock</b> was converted to high-acid acid oil (HAAO) by the hydrolysis by KOH and the acidulation by sulfuric acid. The acid value of soapstock-HAAO increased to 199. 1 mg KOH/g but {{a large amount of}} potassium sulfate was produced. To resolve the formation of potassium sulfate, acid oil was extracted from <b>soapstock</b> and was converted to HAAO by using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). The maximum acid value of acid oil-HAAO was 194. 2 mg KOH/g when the mass ratio of acid oil, sulfuric acid, and water was 10 : 4 : 10 at 2 % of SDBS. In the esterification of HAAO using Amberylst- 15, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) concentration was 91. 7 and 81. 3 % for <b>soapstock</b> and acid oil, respectively.

National transportation agencies have expressed interest in asphalt binder modifiers from renewable resources. Acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> with its surfactant qualities and soybean vulcanized vegetable oil (VVO) with its elastic properties are two possible soybean oil-based modifiers that may improve asphalt binder performance. Research with vegetable oil-based asphalt binder modifiers has shown chemical changes which affect high and low temperature properties in addition to moisture susceptibility. The purpose of this examination is first to demonstrate {{the high and low}} rheological properties and moisture susceptibility of these asphalt binder soybean oil-based modifier blends. Since modifying asphalt binder will alter its chemical functionality, the second aim {{of this study is to}} verify the chemical mechanism(s) of asphalt binder modification. ^ High temperature testing demonstrates that soybean VVO produces harmful sulfur emissions at high temperatures and does not behave as an elastomer in asphalt binder contrary to expectations. Additional high temperature testing indicates that asphalt binders modified with acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> show a reduction in softening point, viscosity and complex modulus, as well as an increase in phase angle. However, low temperature results of binder modification are source specific with no clear trend in stiffness or flexural creep flow rate. Asphalt binders modified with 1 percent acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> generally perform better than unmodified asphalt binders or asphalt binders with a 3 percent modification level. Results from moisture susceptibility testing suggest that asphalt binders modified with 1 percent acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> perform as well or better than unmodified asphalt binders. ^ Regarding chemical functionality, evidence suggests that the soy fatty acids in acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> may have two functions. One function is to act as a low molecular weight solvent and the second is to act as molecular lubrication. Additionally, results suggest that moisture resistant divalent bonding may be facilitated by the adding 1 percent acidulated soybean <b>soapstock.</b> ^ It is the recommendation of this investigation that binders modified with 1 percent acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> be considered for engineering applications using polymer modified binders and 3 percent acidulated soybean <b>soapstock</b> for recycled asphalt pavements. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{different}} processing steps of refining on retention or {{the availability of}} oryzanol in refined oil and the oryzanol composition of Indian paddy cultivars and commer-cial products of the rice bran oil (RBO) industry were investi-gated. Degumming and dewaxing of crude RBO removed only 1. 1 and 5. 9 % of oryzanol while the alkali treatment removed 93. 0 to 94. 6 % of oryzanol from the original crude oil. Irrespec-tive {{of the strength of}} alkali (12 to 20 ° Be studied), retention of oryzanol in the refined RBO was only 5. 4 – 17. 2 % for crude oil, 5. 9 – 15. 0 % for degummed oil, and 7. 0 to 9. 7 % for degummed and dewaxed oil. The oryzanol content of oil extracted from the bran of 18 Indian paddy cultivars ranged from 1. 63 to 2. 72 %, which is the first report {{of its kind in the}} literature on oryzanol content. The oryzanol content ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 74 % for physically refined RBO while for alkali-refined oil it was 0. 19 – 0. 20 %. The oil subjected to physical refining (commercial sample) retained the original amount of oryzanol after refining (1. 60 and 1. 74 %), whereas the chemically refined oil showed a considerably lower amount (0. 19 %). Thus, the oryzanol, which is lost during the chemical refining process, has been carried into the soapstock. The content of oryzanol of the commercial RBO, soapstock, acid oil, and deodorizer distillate were in the range: 1. 7 – 2. 1, 6. 3 – 6. 9, 3. 3 – 7. 4, and 0. 79 %, respectively. These results showed that the processing steps—viz., degum-ming (1. 1 %), dewaxing (5. 9 %), physical refining (0 %), bleach-ing and deodorization of the oil—did not affect the content of oryzanol appreciably, while 83 – 95 % of it was lost during alkali refining. The oryzanol composition of crude oil and soapstock as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in-dicated 24 -methylene cycloartanyl ferulate (30 – 38 %) and campesteryl ferulate (24. 4 – 26. 9 %) as the major ferulates.

40|$|The general {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the effect of inclusion of different co-products from the bioenergy industry in poultry diets on nutrient digestibility, growth performance, and production. To this end, the influence of glycerin, lecithins, and re-esterified oil from soy oil industry, were developed in three studies. In first study (chapter 2), the influence of source and level of inclusion of raw glycerin (GLYC) in the diet on growth performance, digestive traits, total tract apparent retention (TTAR), and apparent ileal digestibility of nutrients was studied in broilers from 1 to 21 d of age. There was a control diet based on corn and soybean meal and 8 additional diets that formed a 2 × 4 factorial with 2 sources of GLYC and 4 levels of inclusion (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, and 10 %). The GLYC used {{were obtained from the}} same original batch of soy oil that was dried under different processing conditions and contained 87. 5 or 81. 6 % glycerol, respectively. Type of processing of the GLYC did not affect any of the variables studied except DM and organic matter retention (P < 0. 05) that was higher for the 87. 5 % glycerol diet. From d 1 to 21, feed conversion ratio (FCR) improved linearly (L, P ≤ 0. 01) as the GLYC content of the diet increased, but ADG was not affected. On d 21, the relative weight (% BW) of the liver and the digestive tract increased (L, P < 0. 01) as the level of GLYC in the diet increased, but lipid concentration in the liver was not affected. The TTAR of DM and organic matter increased quadratically (Q, P < 0. 05) and the AMEn content of the diet increased linearly (L, P < 0. 01) with increases in dietary GLYC. Also, the apparent ileal digestibility of DM (L, P < 0. 05; Q, P = 0. 07) and gross energy (L, P < 0. 01) increased as the GLYC content of the diet increased. It is concluded that raw GLYC from the biodiesel industry can be used efficiently, up to 10 % of the diet, as a source of energy for broilers from 1 to 21 d of age and that the energy content of well-processed raw GLYC depends primarily on its glycerol content. In second study (chapter 3), the effects of the inclusion of raw glycerin (GLYC) and lecithin in the diet on egg production, egg quality and total tract apparent retention (TTAR) of dietary components was studied in brown egg-laying hens from 23 to 51 wk of age. The experimental design was completely randomized with six diets combined as a 2 × 3 factorial with two levels of GLYC (0 vs. 70 g/kg) and three animal fat to lecithin ratios (40 : 0, 20 : 20 and 0 : 40 g/kg). Each treatment was replicated eight times and the experimental unit was a cage with ten hens. Production was recorded by replicate every 28 -d period and cumulatively. For the entire experiment, the inclusion of GLYC in the diet hindered feed conversion ratio per kilogram of eggs (2. 071 vs. 2. 039; P < 0. 05) but did not affect any of the other production or egg quality traits studied. The replacement of animal fat by lecithin (40 : 0, 20 : 20 and 0 : 40 g/kg) increased egg weight(60. 1, 60. 7 and 61. 8 g, respectively; P < 0. 001) and egg mass production (56. 8, 57. 5 and 58. 8 g/d, respectively; P < 0. 01) and improved yolk color as measured by the DSM color fan (9. 2, 9. 2 and 9. 5, respectively; P < 0. 001) and feed conversion ratio per kilogram of eggs(2. 072, 2. 068 and 2. 027, respectively; P < 0. 05). Feed intake, egg production and body weight gain, however, were not affected. The inclusion of GLYC in the diet did not affect nutrient retention but lecithin inclusion improved TTAR of dry matter (P < 0. 05), organic matter (P < 0. 05), ether extract (P < 0. 001) and gross energy (P < 0. 001). In summary, the inclusion of 70 g glycerol/kg diet hindered feed conversion ratio per kilogram of eggs but did not affect any other production or digestibility trait. The replacement of animal fat by lecithin improved egg weight, egg yolk color and nutrient digestibility. Consequently, lecithin {{can be used as a}} lipid source in laying hen diets with beneficial effects on egg production. In third study (chapter 4), the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) of traditional and re-esterified lipid sources and the effects of its inclusion in the diet on nutrient retention and broilers performance were studied in two experiments (Exp) from 7 to 21 d of age. In Exp 1 there was a control diet without any supplemental fat and three extra diets that included 25 g/kg of soy oil (SO), re-esterified monoacylglycerol (RMAG) or re-esterified triacylglycerol (RTAG) at the expense (wt:wt) of the control diet. The gross energy (GE, MJ/kg) of the oils was 39. 66, 38. 06 and 38. 56, respectively. The AME of the lipid sources was determined by two methods: a) multiplying its GE by the digestibility of the ether extract (EE) of their respective diets and b) by difference between the AME of the control and the corresponding experimental diet. Nutrient retention was not affected by fat supplementation, except for EE that was higher for the oil supplemented diets than for the control diet (P < 0. 001). The AME of the SO, RMAG and RTAG was 35. 44, 33. 89 and 34. 05 MJ/kg when measured directly from digestibility data and 37. 70, 35. 68 and 35. 83 MJ/kg when calculated by difference between the control and the oil containing diet. Fat supplementation improved feed to gain ratio (P ˂ 0. 01) from 7 to 21 d of age, with effects being more pronounced for SO than for RMAG or RTAG. In Exp 2, the design was the same than in Exp 1 but the experimental diets included 50 g/kg of SO, acidulated <b>soapstocks</b> (ASO), lard, RMAG, RTAG or a 20 : 80 mixture of SO and RMAG (SO-RMAG). The AME of the supplemental fats was greater for the SO, SO-RMAG and lard than for the RMAG, with RTAG and ASO being intermediate (P < 0. 01). Fat inclusion improved the retention of all nutrients. The AME content of the supplemental fats was higher when calculated by difference between the AME of the control and the fat containing diet than when measured directly from the GE and EE digestibility data and higher when included at 50 g/kg than when included at 25 g/kg. Supplemental fat improved ADG and F:G of the broilers, irrespective of the lipid source used (P ˂ 0. 001). In conclusion, the re-esterified monoacylglycerol and triacylglycerol oils were well digested by broilers, with AME values within the range of those of traditional fat sources. RESUMEN El objetivo general de esta Tesis doctoral fue estudiar la influencia de la inclusión de co-productos de la industria bioenergética en piensos para aves sobre la digestibilidad de los nutrientes, los rendimientos productivos y la producción. A este respecto, la influencia de glicerina, lecitina, y los aceites re-esterificados producidos a partir de aceite de soja, se llevaron a cabo tres estudios. En el primer estudio (capítulo 2) se estudió la influencia de la fuente y el nivel de inclusión de la glicerina bruta (GLYC) en el pienso sobre los parámetros productivos, las características del tracto digestivo, la retención de nutrientes, y la digestibilidad ileal aparente de los nutrientes en pollos de 1 a 21 d de edad. Se formularon un pienso control a base de maíz y harina de soja y 8 piensos adicionales que siguiendo un diseño factorial 2 × 4 con 2 fuentes de GLYC y 4 niveles de inclusión (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, y 10 %). El GLYC utilizado se obtuvo a partir del mismo lote original de aceite de soja que se secó bajo diferentes condiciones de procesado y contenía 87, 5 u 81, 6 % de glicerol, respectivamente. El tipo de procesado de la GLYC no afectó a ninguna de las variables estudiadas, excepto a la retención de materia seca y materia orgánica (P < 0, 05) que fue mayor para la pienso de glicerol 87, 5 %. De 1 a 21 d de edad, el índice de conversión (IC) mejoró de forma lineal (L, P ≤ 0, 01) con el aumento de GLYC del pienso, pero la ganancia media diaria no se vio afectada. A los 21 d, el peso relativo del hígado y del tracto digestivo aumentó de manera lineal con el aumento de GLYC en el pienso (L, P < 0, 01), pero la concentración de lípidos en el hígado no se vio afectada. La retención de la materia seca (MS) y materia orgánica (MO) aumentó de forma cuadrática (Q, P < 0, 05) con la inclusión de GLYC, mientras que el contenido de la energía metabolizable aparente, corregida en nitrógeno (EMAn) lo hizo de manera lineal (L, P < 0. 01). Además, la digestibilidad ileal aparente de la MS (L, P < 0, 05; Q, P = 0, 07) y la energía bruta (EB) (L, P < 0, 01) aumentaron con el incremento de GLYC del pienso. Se concluye que GLYC obtenido a partir de la industria del biodiesel se puede utilizar de manera eficiente, hasta un nivel de incorporación en la dieta del 10 %, como fuente de energía para los pollos de 1 - 21 días de edad y que el contenido de energía de GLYC depende principalmente de su contenido de glicerol. En el segundo estudio (capítulo 3) se estudió el efecto de la inclusión de la glicerina bruta (GLYC) y la lecitina de soja en el pienso sobre la producción y calidad del huevo y la retención de nutrientes en gallinas ponedoras rubias de 23 a 51 semanas de edad. El experimento siguió un diseño completamente al azar con 6 piensos organizados en un factorial 2 x 3 con dos niveles de glicerina (0 vs 70 g/kg) y 3 ratios grasa animal: lecitina (40 : 0, 20 : 20 y 0 : 40 g/kg). Cada tratamiento se repitió 8 veces y la unidad experimental fue la jaula con diez gallinas. La producción fue estudiada por replica cada periodo de 28 días y de forma acumulativa. Durante todo el experimento, la inclusión de GLYC en el pienso empeoró el IC por kilogramo de huevos (2. 071 vs 2. 039; P < 0, 05), pero no afectó a ninguno de los otros parámetros de producción o calidad de huevo del estudiado. El reemplazo de la grasa animal por lecitina (40 : 0, 20 : 20 y 0 : 40 g/kg) aumentó el peso del huevo (60, 1, 60, 7 y 61, 8 g, respectivamente; P < 0, 001), la masa del huevo (56. 8, 57. 5 y 58. 8 g / d, respectivamente; P < 0, 01) y mejoró el color de la yema medido mediante el abanico de color DSM (9. 2, 9. 2 y 9. 5, respectivamente, P < 0, 001) y el IC por kilogramo de huevos (2. 072, 2. 068 y 2. 027, respectivamente; P < 0, 05). Sin embargo, el consumo de pienso, la producción de huevos y la ganancia de peso, no se vieron afectados. La inclusión de GLYC en el pienso no afectó a la retención de nutrientes, mientras que la inclusión de lecitina mejoró la retención de MS (P < 0, 05), MO (P < 0, 05), extracto etéreo (EE) (P < 0, 001) y EB (P < 0, 001). En resumen, la inclusión de 70 g de glicerol/kg de pienso empeoró el IC por kilogramo de huevos, pero no afectó a ningún otro parámetro productivo o a la digestibilidad. El reemplazo de la grasa animal por lecitina mejoró el peso del huevo, el color de la yema de huevo y la digestibilidad de los nutrientes. En consecuencia, la lecitina se puede usar como una fuente de lípidos en piensos de gallinas ponedoras con efectos beneficiosos sobre la producción de huevo. En el tercer estudio (capítulo 4) la energía metabolizable aparente (EMA) de fuentes de lípidos tradicionales y re-esterificados y los efectos de su inclusión en el pienso sobre la retención de nutrientes y el rendimiento de los pollos fueron estudiados en dos experimentos (Exp) de 7 a 21 días de edad. En el Exp 1 se formularon un pienso control sin ningún tipo de grasa suplementaria y tres piensos adicionales que incluyeron 25 g/kg de aceite de soja (AS), monoacilglicerol reesterificado (RMAG) o triacilglicerol reesterificado (RTAG) a expensas (wt:wt) del pienso control. La EB (MJ/kg) de los aceites fue 39. 66, 38. 06 y 38. 56, para AS, RMAG y RTAG respectivamente. La EMA de las fuentes de lípidos se determinó mediante dos métodos: a) multiplicando la EB por la digestibilidad del EE de sus respectivos piensos y b) por diferencia entre el EMA del pienso control y el pienso experimental correspondiente. La retención de nutrientes no se vio afectada por la administración de suplementos de grasa, a excepción de la digestibilidad del EE que fue mayor para las piensos de aceite suplementados que para el pienso control (P < 0, 001). La EMA de la AS, RMAG y RTAG fue 35. 44, 33. 89 y 34. 05 MJ/kg, respectivamente, cuando se determinó directamente de los datos de digestibilidad y 37. 70, 35. 68 y 35. 83 MJ/kg cuando se calculó por diferencia entre el pienso control y el pienso que contenía aceite. La suplementación con grasas mejoró el IC (P ˂ 0, 01) de 7 a 21 días de edad, con efectos más marcados para los pollos que consumieron los pienso que contenían AS que para aquellos que consumieron RMAG o RTAG. En el experimento 2, el diseño fue el mismo que en el Exp 1, pero los piensos experimentales incluyeron 50 g/kg de AS, oleínas aciduladas, manteca, RMAG, RTAG o mezcla 20 : 80 de AS y RMAG (AS-RMAG). La EMA de las grasas suplementadas fue mayor para el AS, AS-RMAG y manteca que para la RMAG, con RTAG y oleínas aciduladas mostrando valores intermedios (P < 0, 01). La inclusión de grasa mejoró la retención de todos los nutrientes.

40|$|Granular {{shoulders}} need to {{be maintained}} {{on a regular basis}} because edge ruts and potholes develop, posing a safety hazard to motorists. The successful mitigation of edge-rut issues for granular shoulders would increase safety and reduce the number of procedures currently required to maintain granular shoulders in Iowa. In addition, better performance of granular shoulders reduces the urgency to pave granular shoulders. Delaying or permanently avoiding paving shoulders where possible allows more flexibility in making investments in the road network. To stabilize shoulders and reduce the number of maintenance cycles necessary per season, one possible stabilizing agent—acidulated soybean oil soapstock—was investigated in this research. A pilot testing project was conducted for selected problematic shoulders in northern and northeastern Iowa. <b>Soapstock</b> was applied on granular shoulders and monitored during application and pre- and post-application. Application techniques were documented and the percentage of application success was calculated for each treated shoulder section. As a result of this research, it was concluded that soybean oil <b>soapstock</b> can be an effective stabilizer for granular shoulders under certain conditions. The researchers also developed draft specifications that could possibly be used to engage a contractor to perform the work using a maintenance-type construction contract.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} tested {{was that}} supplemental lipid from nonenzymatically browned soybeans and soy lipid coproducts {{would reduce the}} negative impact of lipids on ruminal metabolism compared with soybean oil and would improve the milk fatty acid composition compared with calcium salts of fatty acids. In the first experiment, the soybean oil diet reduced the rate and apparent extent of ruminal NDF digestion and decreased the acetate to propionate ratio. The diets containing 4 and 6 % lipid from nonenzymatically browned soybeans had an intermediate rate and apparent extent of ruminal NDF digestion. Additionally, the nonenzymatically browned soybean diets increased milk C 18 : 2 fatty acids by 35 % compared with soybean oil, whereas C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 0 fatty acids were reduced. In the second experiment, increasing nonenzymatically browned soybean concentration in the diet linearly increased milk fat production. All levels of the nonenzymatically browned soybeans tested resulted in FCM similar to the calcium salts of fatty acid diet, and higher than the soybean oil diet, but with more desirable milk fatty acid profiles. Two experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} soyhull:soy lecithin:soapstock mixtures on ruminal fermentation, milk composition, and ruminal bacterial and protozoal populations. In experiment 1, cows fed the lecithin and <b>soapstock</b> diets had higher milk C 18 : 2 fatty acids and higher rate of ruminal NDF digestion than cows fed the soybean oil diet. When tested in a semi-continuous in vitro system, substrates containing 18 % of a mixture of lecithin and <b>soapstock</b> had higher acetate to propionate ratio than substrates containing a similar concentration of soybean oil. Also, higher total protozoal counts were observed for the lecithin and <b>soapstock</b> treatments than those with no lipid added.

The yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was studied at oil to methanol molar ratios of 1 : 3 and 1 : 6 and reaction temperatures of 60 and 80 degrees C. The rate of esterification of oleic acid significantly decreased as the initial water content increased to 20 % of the oil. The activity of Amberlyst- 15 decreased more rapidly than that of sulfuric acid, due to the direct poisoning of acid sites by water. Esterification using sulfuric acid was not affected by water until there was a 5 % water addition at a 1 : 6 molar ratio of oil to methanol. FAME content of HAAO prepared from <b>soapstock</b> rapidly increased for the first 30 min of esterification.
