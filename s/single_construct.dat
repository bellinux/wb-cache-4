Study in this area focuses on whether aptitude can be broken into subsets or represented as a <b>single</b> <b>construct,</b> whether aptitude can be measured prior to significant achievement, whether high aptitude can predict achievement, to what extent aptitude is inherited, and what implications questions of aptitude have on educational principles.|$|E
25|$|Internals were {{believed}} by Rotter (1966) to exhibit two essential characteristics: high achievement motivation and low outer-directedness. This {{was the basis}} of the locus-of-control scale proposed by Rotter in 1966, although it was based on Rotter's belief that locus of control is a <b>single</b> <b>construct.</b> Since 1970, Rotter's assumption of uni-dimensionality has been challenged, with Levenson (for example) arguing that different dimensions of locus of control (such as beliefs that events in one's life are self-determined, or organized by powerful others and are chance-based) must be separated. Weiner's early work in the 1970s suggested that orthogonal to the internality-externality dimension, differences should be considered between those who attribute to stable and those who attribute to unstable causes.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{trend in}} academia for {{universities}} to be their own drug discovery enterprise. These facilities, which normally are found only in industry, are now increasingly found at universities as well. UCLA, for example, features an open access HTS laboratory Molecular Screening Shared Resources (MSSR, UCLA), which can screen more than 100,000 compounds a day on a routine basis. The open access policy ensures that researchers {{from all over the}} world can take advantage of this facility without lengthy intellectual property negotiations. With a compound library of over 200,000 small molecules, the MSSR has one of the largest compound deck of all universities on the west coast. Also, the MSSR features full functional genomics capabilities (genome wide siRNA, shRNA, cDNA and CRISPR) which are complementary to small molecule efforts: Functional genomics leverages HTS capabilities to execute genome wide screens which examine the function of each gene in the context of interest by either knocking each gene out or overexpressing it. Parallel access to high-throughput small molecule screen and a genome wide screen enables researcher to perform target identification and validation for given disease or the mode of action determination on a small molecule. The most accurate results can be obtained by use of [...] "arrayed" [...] functional genomics libraries, i.e. each library contains a <b>single</b> <b>construct</b> such as a single siRNA or cDNA. Functional genomics is typically paired with high content screening using e.g. epifluorescent miscroscopy or laser scanning cytometry.|$|E

50|$|One {{criticism}} of symbolic racism {{is that it}} has been conceptualized and measured inconsistently over time. Sometimes it has been conceptualized as consisting of a <b>single</b> <b>construct</b> and other times as consisting of multiple subdimensions.

Tarman and Sears posit that consistently defining it as based on those four themes will eliminate the inconsistency problems. The updated symbolic racism scale, Symbolic Racism 2000 (SR2K), is believed to have addressed many issues in measurement inconsistency.|$|E

In this theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers—which has the result that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to tick more slowly than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.|$|E
40|$|Sublaminar wires {{have been}} used for many years for {{segmental}} spinal instrumentation in scoliosis surgery. More recently, stainless steel wires have been replaced by titanium cables. However, in rigid scoliotic curves, sublaminar wires or simple cables can either brake or pull out. The square-lashing technique was devised to avoid complications such as cable breakage or lamina cutout. The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to test biomechanically the pull out and failure mode of simple sublaminar constructs versus the square-lashing technique. Individual vertebrae were subjected to pullout testing having one of two different <b>constructs</b> (<b>single</b> loop and square lashing) using either monofilament wire or multifilament cables. Four different methods of fixation were therefore tested: <b>single</b> wire <b>construct,</b> square-lashing wiring <b>construct,</b> <b>single</b> cable <b>construct,</b> and square-lashing cable construct. Ultimate failure load and failure mechanism were recorded. For the <b>single</b> wire the <b>construct</b> failed 12 / 16 times by wire breakage with an average ultimate failure load of 793  N. For the square-lashing wire the construct failed with pedicle fracture in 14 / 16, one bilateral lamina fracture, and one wire breakage. Ultimate failure load average was 1, 239  N For the <b>single</b> cable the <b>construct</b> failed 12 / 16 times due to cable breakage (average force 1, 162  N). 10 / 12 of these breakages were where the cable looped over the rod. For the square-lashing cable all of these constructs (16 / 16) failed by fracture of the pedicle with an average ultimate failure load of 1, 388  N. The square-lashing construct had a higher pullout strength than the single loop and almost no cutting out from the lamina.
