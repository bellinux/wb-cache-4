50|$|Simultaneous {{electrodeposition}} {{must overcome}} {{the fact that}} the elements' standard reduction potentials are not equal, causing preferential deposition of a single element. This problem is commonly alleviated by adding countering ions into solution for each ion to be deposited (Cu2+, Se4+, In3+, and Ga3+), thus changing that ion's reduction potential. Further, the Cu-Se system has a complicated behavior and the film's composition depends on the Se4+/Cu2+ ion flux ratio which can vary over the film surface. This requires the precursor concentrations and deposition potential, to be optimized. Even with optimization, reproducibility is low over large areas due to composition variations and potential drops along the substrate. The resulting films have small grains, are Cu-rich, and generally contain Cu2−xSex phases along with impurities from the <b>solution.</b> <b>Annealing</b> is required to improve crystallinity. Efficiencies higher than 7%, a stoichiometry correction are required. The correction was originally done via high temperature physical vapor deposition, which is not practical in industry.

The metallurgical investigation of <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> as well as sensitized stainless steels were carried out {{in order to determine}} the microstructural characteristics, hardness, grain size distribution, tensile properties, ratcheting behavior and post-ratcheting tensile properties of differently heat treated stainless steel specimens. The microstructural examinations have been done with the help of optical microscope and scanning electron microscope. The microstructure of the selected steel in <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> condition reveals that the steel owns nearly equiaxed austenite grains with annealing twins throughout the matrix. The phenomenon of plastic strain accumulation due to asymmetric cyclic loading is known as ratcheting. Stress-controlled cyclic loading experiments have been carried out at room temperature for constant mean stress levels with varying stress amplitudes after each 50 cycles. Cyclic loading rate for stress control test is 50 MPa/s. Ratcheting deformation is found to increase with increase in stress amplitude values for constant values of stress mean. However, the rate of strain accumulation increases with increasing stress amplitude.

These treatments were used in order to investigate their influence on the microstructure and mechanical properties of maraging steel 300, {{especially with regard to}} toughness. The characterization of the microstructure was performed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Mechanical properties were evaluated by Rockwell C hardness and Charpy impact tests. The results showed that there is a temperature range where one can get some improvement in toughness without a large loss of mechanical strength...|$|E
30|$|The {{investigated}} {{material was}} 304 L (UNS S 30403) {{austenitic stainless steel}} with a chemical composition: 0.019 C, 0.32 Si, 1.55 Mn, 0.029 P, 0.001 S, 18.22 Cr, 8.11 Ni, 0.011 Nb, 0.31 Cu, 0.16 Co, 0.071 N, and balance Fe (all in wt%). During production, the as-received material had been <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> at 1100  °C followed by forced air cooling and water quenching. It was then pickled in an acid bath to remove oxide scale caused by annealing and restore the corrosion resistance. After that, the material was roll leveled to improve the flatness.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{evolution}} of microstructure and crystallographic texture during cold rolling of two phase Fe-Cr-Ni alloy was investigated. Fe-Cr-Ni alloy (in initially <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> condition) was uni-directionally cold rolled {{in a laboratory}} rolling mill to different thickness reductions. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the changes in microstructure, while X-ray diffraction was used to investigate changes in crystallographic texture of austenite and ferrite (through changes in orientation distribution function). Crystallographic texture was also simulated using different crystal plasticity models (Full constraint Taylor, relaxed constraint Taylor (lath and pancake) and co-deformation Visco Plastic Self Consistent (VPSC)). With the increase in plastic deformation, there were morphological as well as crystallographic changes in the microstructure. Strong a-fibre (RD//) texture was developed in ferrite, while brass ({ 110 }) and Goss ({ 110 }) was dominant in austenite after 80 % cold rolling. The formation of brass type texture after deformation {{has been attributed to}} the formation of shear bands and presence of strong crystallographic texture in the initial <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> material. Both Taylor as well as VPSC models could not capture the changes in texture with deformation accurately. For ferrite: gamma-fibre (ND//) and for austenite: Cu ({ 112 }) component was always present in the simulated textures. Possible reason for this could be the pining effect of interface boundaries and non-incorporation of non-crystallographic shear banding in the Taylor and VPSC models...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to study the effect of sensitization on the mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength of a non-conventional austenitic stainless steel with special emphasis on wear properties. A set of samples has been <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> by soaking the steel at 1050 °C followed by water quenching. On the other hand, {{a total of four}} sets of samples of the steel have been given sensitization treatment by holding at 7500 C temperature for different soaking time periods ranging from 1 to 7 hours followed by water quenching. The microstructures of both the <b>solution</b> <b>annealed</b> as well as sensitized samples have been observed by optical microscope. The mechanical testing such as microhardness and macrohardness as well as tensile testing of each specimen has been performed. The wear behaviour of the non-conventional stainless steel is determined by using the ball on plate wear testing machine, with varying loads and sliding distances. It is observed that the height loss due to wear increases with increase in sensitization time, applied load and sliding distance. The hardness and yield strength of the investigated stainless steel sharply decreases with increase in sensitization time, whereas the tensile strength of this steel decreases marginally with sensitization time. It is also observed that the ductility values of the specimens decrease with increase in sensitization time...|$|R
