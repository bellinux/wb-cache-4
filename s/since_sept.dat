40|$|Abstract State-of-the-art {{treatment}} of nuclei and electrons in materials uses ab initio molecular dynamics for nuclear motion driven by Born-Oppenheimer {{forces from the}} electrons. Almost universally, those forces are calculated from density functional theory in the Kohn-Sham form. The computational costs of the conven-tional KS implementation scale at least as the cube {{of the number of}} electrons. This is a formidable barrier to complex system simulations with long MD runs on department-scale machines, since the DFT force calculation dominates the per step cost. The difficulty arises from the explicit dependence of the non-interacting ki-netic energy on the KS non-interacting orbitals. The cost scaling worsens with use of explicitly orbital-dependent exchange-correlation functionals are used. The alter-native approach, use of DFT in its basic form, dates to Thomas-Fermi-Dirac theory. The challenge is to have sufficiently accurate orbital-free expressions for the KS kinetic energy and exchange-correlation functionals.

50|$|Charles D. Hornig of Elizabeth, NJ, {{at the age}} of seventeen, {{founded the}} magazine, from the {{beginning}} seeking to secure the most prestigious weird and science fiction authors he could. Hornig had been buying and reading science fiction regulalry <b>since</b> the <b>Sept</b> 1930 issues of Amazing Stories and Wonder Stories. In Jan 1933 he decided to publish a fanzine and contacted Conrad H. Ruppert, who was then producing on letterpress with handset type the fan magazine The Science Fic-Digest. The first issue of Hornig's magazine The Fantasy Fan appeared July 29, 1933. Horning sent a complimentary copy to Hugo Gernsback, publisher of Wonder Stories. Gernsback had just fired his editor David Lasser for spending more time promoting The Workers Alliance and organizing the unemployed than on his editorial work. Gernsback felt a much better job could be done assisting the unemployed if Lasser himself was unemployed and could therefore devote full-time to it. Gernsback was impressed by the professional look and content of Hornig's first issue of The Fantasy Fan; he telegraphed Hornig to come and see him. He had been paying Lasser $75 a week. Due to Hornig's youth, Gernsback hired him at $20 a week and Hornig reported for work Aug 7, 1933. The first issue of Gernsback's Wonder Stories pulp magazine that he produced was Nov 1933, with the help of veteran associate editor C.P. Mason. This gave Hornig the resources to continue The Fantasy Fan which would have been economically difficult otherwise. Hornig stayed with Wonder Stories until 1936.|$|R
