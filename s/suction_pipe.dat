The measurement of the retracting force is desired in order to avoid damage to brain tissue due to an unexpected large force. This paper presents a force-sensing embedded silicone retractor {{that can be}} attached to <b>suction</b> <b>pipes.</b> The developed silicone retractor can provide three functions at the same time: suction, retracting, and retracting force measurement. The force-sensing system is based on a visualization mechanism that displays the force as a colored pole motion. The surgeon can then roughly estimate the retracting force. With a fiberscope, the retracting force can be measured with a resolution of 0. 05 - 0. 3 N. The retractor is made of silicone and has the advantages of disposability, low cost, and easy sterilization/disinfection.

40|$|A {{survey on}} the problem of {{corrosion}} in pipes was carried out on 761 center pivot systems. These pivots irrigated approximately an area of 38050 ha in different regions of the Kingdom. The data were collected during the period 1993 to 1994. The results showed that all farms in the Kingdom were suffering from the corrosion in center pivot systems. The results showed that the galvanized steel pipes were the most affected while the plastic were the least affected by corrosion. The corrosion problem affected the pipes near the joints or connections more than other sections of the pipe. It was also found that there was a close relationship between the quality of irrigation water, pipe material and corrosion. The survey revealed that most of the farms in the Kingdom were irrigated with saline water. The power capacity of the pumps installed in these farms ranged from 70 to 500 HP.

40|$|Turbidity is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the major}} environmental problems of dredging. To get a handle on this problem the Dutch dredging industry (VBKO) commissioned a research project to develop software capable of predicting how much sediment is released into suspension during dredging operations. Major field measurement exercises are carried out in order to provide calibration data for the software. One exercise has been carried out using a trailing suction hopper dredger (Cornelia) working in the port of Rotterdam in June 2002. During dredging by a trailing suction hopper dredger one or two <b>suction</b> <b>pipes</b> are lowered on the seabed. A mixture of sediment and water is sucked up and passes into the hopper of the dredger. When the hopper is loaded beyond capacity, excess mixture leaves the hopper by means of the overflow and is released back into the water. This overflow of sediment is the main contribution to the sediment plumes near the dredging vessel. The main objective of this thesis is to find out whether the flow rate and the solids concentrations leaving the dredging vessel can be calculated sufficiently from the measured overflow samples. Special techniques were developed to sample the hopper overflow. Three novel flowthrough samplers are constructed to sample the overflow mixture. These have been used, in combination with a bottle sampler to obtain about 500 samples taken at four different locations in the overflow during 14 trips. All samples have been analysed on particle size distribution and dry matter content, some samples also on particle specific gravity. Soil samples taken in the dredging area provide the data needed for mapping the soil conditions coming up by the <b>suction</b> <b>pipes.</b> It appears that at some locations quite homogeneous soil conditions are present. Nevertheless also significant variations in the Particle Size Distributions have been found. During all dredging operations, the vessel's TDS (Tonnes Dry Solids) system has logged the characteristics like draughts and the concentrations plus velocities of the upcoming mixture in the <b>suction</b> <b>pipes.</b> These data have been reviewed to assess their reliability. After recalibration of the datasets, the concentration leaving the vessel by the overflow is computed by using sediment balances. The computed sediment releases have been compared with the measured overflow releases in order the attempt to validate the sampling method. It appeared that validation of the samples by this comparison was not possible. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The work on which this paper is based included an extensive literature study, as well as field investigations on a surface mine in Namibia. A number of additional dust suppression interventions were identified. These improvements, listed below, will assist in reducing dust concentrations around the drill rigs: • Increase maintenance frequency on the shroud, sealing ring, <b>suction</b> <b>pipes</b> and filters of the drill rigs, • Design and install new overlapping rubber belts on the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an air-blocking shelf on the inside perimeter of the shroud of the DM 45, • Install an airflow meter to ensure that the QC: QB ratio never drops below 3 : 1, • Only allow wet drilling, • Flush the dust collector system more regularly with compressed air to ensure that it does not become blocked, • Introduce stricter supervision to ensure that the <b>suction</b> <b>pipes</b> are always connected to the shroud, • Give drill rig operators more advanced training to ensure more effective drilling in order to reduce dust levels.
