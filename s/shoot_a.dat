5|$|Raimi and Campbell grew up together, {{and have}} been friends from a young age. The duo {{directed}} several low-budget Super 8 mm film projects together. Several were comedies, including Clockwork and It's Murder!. Shooting a suspense scene in It's Murder! inspired Raimi to approach {{a career in the}} horror genre, and after researching horror cinema at drive-in theaters, Raimi was set on directing a horror film. The idea was to <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> short film first, which would attract the interest of producers, and then use the money gained from that to <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> full-length project. The short film that Raimi created was called Within the Woods. It was produced for $1,600, but for The Evil Dead, Raimi needed over $100,000.|$|E

Everything for a left-handed player would be the opposite.|$|R

5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist. That impression did not last long as Madonna would later convince Sire executives to <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> music video for the song.

5|$|Duxford {{was officially}} {{returned}} to the RAF on 1 December 1945. It remained a fighter station but by 1958 changing defence priorities saw the RAF's fighter force move to more northerly bases. Duxford's last operational flight was made in July 1961. No longer operational, the site gradually became increasingly derelict and overgrown. In 1968 the American film studio United Artists obtained {{permission to use the}} site for the filming of Battle of Britain. During the <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> single bay hangar, which had been built during the First World War, was demolished to simulate an air raid. After the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to dispose of Duxford plans were drawn up for various developments including two Young Offenders Institutes but were not implemented.|$|E

5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} involves two teams, each competing to <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> lacrosse {{ball into}} the opposing team's goal. A lacrosse ball {{is made out of}} solid rubber, measuring 7.75 to 8inches (19.7–20cm) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5.25ounces (140–149g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end.

5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on the player's ability to make Robbit jump. Robbit can jump up to three times in mid-air, which allows him to reach extreme heights. Unlike other platform games that continue to face horizontally when the player jumps, in Jumping Flash! the camera tilts downwards when a double-jump or triple-jump is performed to allow the player to see Robbit's shadow and easily plan a landing spot. The player has the ability to <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> low-powered laser beam at a target indicator {{in the middle of the}} screen. The player can find and use fireworks for Robbit to damage enemies. These include cherry bombs, rockets, Roman candles and spinners.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} had {{twelve days}} to film two episodes each, equating to approximately {{five minutes of}} screen-time per day. Langan asked Father Ted director Declan Lowney to helm the first two episodes after his successful direction of the pilot.

Funding for Lowney's film fell through {{and he took the}} two episodes of Cold Feet after Langan offered them to him a second time. The other two directors were Mark Mylod and Nigel Cole.|$|E

5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their canoe over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to <b>shoot</b> <b>a</b> bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 feet above the river. Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their canoe, which had somehow drifted away while they were exploring the cave.|$|E
