25|$|In his {{continued}} pursuit and advocacy of his ideas, he further neglected his personal situation and income, falling further {{in debt and}} being shunned by his acquaintances. Despite being appointed an honorary {{member of the national}} Red Cross societies of Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Prussia and Spain, he was nearly forgotten in the official discourse of the Red Cross Movement, even as it was rapidly expanding to new countries. He lived in poverty, moving to various places between 1874 and 1886, including Stuttgart, Rome, Corfu, Basel, and Karlsruhe. In Stuttgart he met the Tübingen University student Rudolf Müller with whom he would have a close friendship. In 1881, together with friends from Stuttgart, he went to the small Swiss resort village Heiden for the first time. In 1887 while living in London, he began to receive some monthly financial support from <b>some</b> <b>distant</b> family members. This enabled him to live a somewhat more secure existence, and he moved to Heiden in July. He spent {{the rest of his life}} there, and after 30 April 1892 he lived in a hospital and nursing home led by Dr. Hermann Altherr.|$|E
500|$|By 1958, however, {{priority}} was given officially to simplified Chinese; a phonetic script, hanyu pinyin, had been developed, but its deployment {{to the exclusion}} of simplified characters was pushed off to <b>some</b> <b>distant</b> future date.

[...] It seems unlikely that pinyin will supplant Chinese characters anytime soon as the sole means of representing Chinese.|$|E
500|$|Caroline Read-Burns, {{president}} of the Lisbon Historical Society and Jerome Zuckerbraun, {{a member of the}} synagogue, discussed the Orthodox congregation's rules and noted that some rules were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World. As an Orthodox congregation, members were to walk to the synagogue, but <b>some</b> <b>distant</b> members would drive and [...] "walk the last mile or so." [...] The synagogue did not use curtains to separate men and women, as was the norm for Orthodox services in Poland and Russia. The women's seating was at a table {{on the right side of}} the sanctuary, near the door. The structure is well-preserved, but not currently in use.|$|E

The writings of Photius provide the earliest example of the name [...] "Rus" [...] (Rhos, [...] ) being mentioned in a Greek source; previously the dwellers of the lands {{to the north of}} the Black Sea were referred to archaically as [...] "Tauroscythians". The patriarch reported that they had no supreme ruler and lived in <b>some</b> <b>distant</b> northern lands. Photius called them ἔθνος ἄγνωστον, [...] "unknown people", although some historians prefer to translate the phrase as [...] "obscure people", pointing out the earlier contacts between Byzantines and the Rus'.|$|E
500|$|Romney's {{greatest}} weakness {{was a lack}} {{of foreign}} policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the Vietnam War. [...] The press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam and reporters were frustrated by Romney's initial reluctance to speak about it. [...] The qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate; he had difficulty being articulate, often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not. [...] Reporter Jack Germond joked {{that he was going to}} add a single key on his typewriter that would print, [...] "Romney later explained...." [...] Life magazine wrote that Romney [...] "manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal" [...] and that he was no different in private: [...] "nobody can sound more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble, inevitably away from the point and toward <b>some</b> <b>distant</b> moral precept." ...|$|E
500|$|Spin {{reviewed}} the track favourably, {{calling it a}} [...] "celebrity-at-the-crossroads soul ballad" [...] with an [...] "ambient gospel sweep that's both haunted and joyful". Mojo praised the song's musicianship, saying it was [...] "graced by swaggering performances" [...] and that the Edge's [...] "languid guitar solo" [...] was reminiscent of David Gilmour. Q echoed these sentiments, commending Bono's soulful singing and the Edge's solo. The reviewer christened the song as [...] "this album's 'One' or 'With or Without You', with added bonus points". The Washington Post called the song one of the record's highlights and enjoyed the track's gospel qualities. The reviewer wrote, [...] "The vocal harmonies on the choruses sound {{like something out of}} a church in <b>some</b> <b>distant,</b> dystopian world; the woozy, slightly detuned piano adds to that impression..." [...] Hot Press gave the song a favourable review, calling it a [...] "sweeping" [...] track and suggesting it [...] "conjure the same spiritual vibe as Marvin Gaye's 'Abraham, Martin & John'". Time gave No Line on the Horizon a negative review, but praised [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] for its [...] "heartbreaking melody" [...] and Bono's [...] "Oh-oh-oh" [...] vocals that reminded the critic of the end of [...] "With or Without You". Bono and Daniel Lanois both cited the song as their favourite track on the album, and Brian Eno thought the band should have chosen it as the album's first single. [...] Musician Gavin Friday described the song as [...] "Al Green on Irish steroids", and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes called it [...] "a modern rock classic" [...] that will [...] "stand forever as one of U2's most inspirational creations".|$|E
