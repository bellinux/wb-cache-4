Communist publications denounced her failure to take sides.

500|$|In 1937, Hemingway {{agreed to}} report on the Spanish Civil War for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), {{arriving}} in Spain in March with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens. Ivens was filming The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth,</b> a propaganda film in support of the Republican side. He wanted Hemingway to replace John Dos Passos as screenwriter, since Dos Passos had left the project when his friend José Robles was arrested and later executed. The incident changed Dos Passos' initially positive opinion of the leftist republicans, creating a rift between him and Hemingway, who later spread a rumor that Dos Passos left Spain out of cowardice.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the Spanish Civil War, {{people all over the world}} were exposed to the goings-on and effects of it on its people not only through {{standard}} art, but also through propaganda. Motion pictures, posters, books, radio programs, and leaflets are a few examples of this media art that was so influential during the war. Produced by both nationalists and republicans, propaganda allowed Spaniards a way to spread awareness about their war all over the world. A film co-produced by famous early-twentieth century authors such as Ernest Hemingway and Lillian Hellman [...] was used as a way to advertise Spain's need for military and monetary aid. This film, The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth,</b> premiered in America in July 1937. In 1938, George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, a personal account of his experiences and observations in the war, was published in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|They {{encounter}} {{each other}} again a year later in Spain, while both are covering the Spanish Civil War, and staying in the same hotel on the same floor. Initially, Gellhorn resists romantic advances made by the famous author, but during a bombing raid, the two find themselves trapped alone in the same room, and lust overcomes them. They become lovers, and stay in Spain until 1939. Hemingway collaborates with Joris Ivens to produce The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Born in Amsterdam, van Dongen met Joris Ivens in her {{teens and}} {{eventually}} became his key collaborator. She worked on Ivens' first films The Bridge (1928) and Rain (1929). In the 1930s she was credited as {{the editor of}} Ivens' films including Nieuwe Gronden (1934), Misère au Borinage (1934), The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth</b> (1937), and The 400 Million (1939). Bob Mastrangelo has written that these four films [...] "earned Ivens a worldwide reputation, and solidified van Dongen's status {{as one of the}} most important editors of her generation." [...] He suggests that van Dongen's most important credit was as the editor of The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth</b> (1937), Ivens' film about the Spanish Civil War that was narrated by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "...almost 70 years later it remains a powerful testament to the devastating effects of civil war. The intensity of van Dongen's editing is an important factor in the film's impact, particularly in the way it contrasts the horrors of war with the beauty of the Spanish countryside." [...] Her final film with Ivens was Power and the Land (1940). Van Dongen and Ivens were briefly married in the mid-1940s, after their filmmaking collaboration had ended.|$|E
5000|$|The 1937 {{convention}} {{was a more}} subdued affair than the high-profile 1935 launch, with its opening at Carnegie Hall attended by 50 [...] "writer-delegates."

Hemingway denounced fascism as [...] "a lie told by bullies" [...] and declared that [...] "a writer who will not lie cannot live or work under fascism."

50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth</b> is a 1937 {{propaganda}} film {{made during}} the Spanish Civil War {{in support of the}} democratically elected Republicans, whose forces included a wide range from the political left like communists, socialists, anarchists, to moderates like centrists, and liberalist elements. The film was directed by Joris Ivens, written by John Dos Passos and Ernest Hemingway, narrated by Orson Welles and re-recorded by Hemingway (with Jean Renoir doing the narration in the French release), with music composed by Marc Blitzstein and arranged by Virgil Thomson.|$|E
5000|$|Irving Reis {{had worked}} with Marc Blitzstein on the 1937 film The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth.</b> As Reis was {{the founder of the}} Columbia Workshop, it is {{probably}} through their collaborative work on the film that they became acquainted with one another, and how the CBS commission came about. A contract was drawn up, dated August 12, 1937, requesting a [...] "musical dramatic work … suitable for radio broadcasting" [...] and specifying limits on the number of performers. Blitzstein wrote for seven principal players and an orchestra of twenty-four.|$|E
5000|$|From 1936 to 1945, Ivens {{was based}} in the United States. For Pare Lorentz's U.S. Film Service, in the year 1940, he made a {{documentary}} film on rural electrification called Power and the Land. It focused on a family, the Parkinsons, who ran a business providing milk for their community. The film showed {{the problem in the}} lack of electricity and the way the problem was fixed. Ivens was, however, known for his anti-fascist and other propaganda films, including The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth,</b> for the Spanish Republicans, co-written with Ernest Hemingway and music by Marc Blitzstein and Virgil Thomson. Jean Renoir did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version only after Orson Welles's sounded too theatrical.. This film was financed by Archibald MacLeish, Fredric March, Florence Eldridge, Lillian Hellman, Luise Rainer, Dudley Nichols, Franchot Tone and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the Contemporary Historians. [...] <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth</b> [...] was shown at the White House on July 8, 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn, had had dinner with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. The Roosevelts loved the film but said that it needed more propaganda. This 1937 documentary was considered his masterpiece.|$|E

The 400 Million (1939) depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the Second Sino-Japanese War, including dramatic shots of the Battle of Taierzhuang. Robert Capa did camerawork, Sidney Lumet worked on the film as a reader, Hanns Eisler wrote the musical score, and Fredric March provided the narration. It, too, had been financed {{by the same people}} as those of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth.</b> Its chief fundraiser was Luise Rainer, recipient of the best actress Oscar two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, History Today, Inc [...] The Guomindang government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces. Ivens was also suspected of being a friend of Mao Zedong and especially Zhou Enlai.|$|E
50|$|Ivens {{created the}} film {{with the help}} of two other men not often {{credited}} for their assistance with the production: Cheng Fai, Ivens’s housekeeper, and a young John Ferno, known then as Fernhout. Cheng Fai often ventured out with Ivens—he outfitted in an oilskin and boots, Cheng Fai equipped with an umbrella—to assist with gathering footage in the rain, protecting the camera and film from water damage. Ferno was sent to Ivens by Ferno's mother, who was worried about her son after he performed poorly in school. She was hoping Ivens would help the boy use his time more productively and teach him a new skill. Ivens put him to work riding a bike through rainy Amsterdam while Ivens shot. Ferno went on to do more professional work with Ivens, including some work on The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

50|$|Marcus Samuel Blitzstein (March 2, 1905January 22, 1964), was an American composer, lyricist, and librettist. He won {{national}} attention in 1937 when his pro-union musical The Cradle Will Rock, directed by Orson Welles, {{was shut down}} by the Works Progress Administration. He is known for The Cradle Will Rock and for his Off-Broadway translation/adaptation of The Threepenny Opera by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. His works also include the opera Regina, an adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play The Little Foxes; the Broadway musical Juno, based on Seán O'Casey's play Juno and the Paycock; and No for an Answer. He completed translation/adaptations of Brecht's and Weill's musical play Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny and of Brecht's play Mother Courage and Her Children with music by Paul Dessau. Blitzstein also composed music for films, such as Surf and Seaweed (1931) and The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth</b> (1937), and he contributed two songs to the original 1960 production of Hellman's play Toys in the Attic.|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{political}} {{significance of the}} classic documentary The <b>Spanish</b> <b>Earth</b> {{in the context of}} the Spanish Civil War, 1936 1939, challenging Russell Campbell’s argument that it should be considered in the light of ‘an overriding need for unity in the face of the enemy’. I argue instead that the film reflected the international Communist agenda. This emphasized defence of the Republic rather than engaging with its political complexities or with the demands of urban workers. I underline the film’s rural and Castilian focus, and describe its reception in the United States and United Kingdom, before offering an explanation for its continued currency in those countries, and an overview of the consequences...|$|E
