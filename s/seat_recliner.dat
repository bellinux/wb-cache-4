5000|$|Aside {{from the}} new-for-1990 Touring Coupe model (see entry below) {{introduced}} {{later in the}} model year, {{it was a year}} of enhancement for Eldorado. A driver's side airbag was introduced as standard equipment, but as a result, the telescoping steering column was discontinued (although the tilt feature remained). Cruise control buttons were mounted on the center of the previous steering wheel, but {{with the advent of the}} air bag (mounted on a smaller diameter steering wheel), they were now moved to the turn signal stalk. A new multi-point fuel injection replaced the throttle-body style from last year, and horsepower jumped from 155 to 180, although the new system required the use of premium fuel. A new cast aluminum wheel design (not available with the Touring Suspension package) was optional for those customers who desired something different than the standard [...] "snowflake" [...] alloy wheel on the base Eldorado. Seating received numerous enhancements, including new molded trim panels, additional lateral and lumbar support, French seams, and revised front headrests. Full leather upholstery (formerly leather and cloth) was now standard on the Biarritz model, but the base model lost the seat-back map pockets. The cellular telephone disappeared from the option list, and the vinyl center armrest was revamped. The electronic climate control received an update in the form of three automatic and two manual settings. The optional leather upholstery package on the base model now included a power passenger <b>seat</b> <b>recliner.</b> Last year's [...] "Eldorado Option Package" [...] (which included new-style carpeted floor mats, body-color door edge guards, illuminated driver and passenger visor vanity mirrors, luggage compartment mat, and the illuminated entry system) was now standard. Additionally, previously optional items that were added as standard equipment this year included the rear window defogger with heated outside mirrors, and bodyside accent striping. New options for 1990 included a central-unlocking feature (from the outside door locks using the key) added to the automatic door locks. A revised deck-lid engine plaque now mentioned the port fuel injection, and the deck-lid itself held a chromed handle above the license plate opening. Also, the rear safety reflectors moved from the bumper onto the panel below the decklid this year. A new charcoal-colored vinyl strip accented the chrome bumper and bodyside moldings this year, while the front bumper guards changed from body-color to charcoal. In the front suspension, the stabilizer shaft was revised for ride and handling, while the tire jack located in the trunk had a new carpeted storage container. Price for 1990 was $28,885, with the Biarritz model an additional $3,180. Production dropped to 20,874 units, about 1/3 of which were the Biarritz model. An additional 1,507 Eldorado Touring Coupe models were made.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Automotive <b>Seat</b> <b>Recliner</b> is a {{mechanism}} that enables seat back rest {{to move forward}} and rearward about the pivot point of seat. An upgraded model of recliner with optimized dimensions is modeled so that the effort applied to unlock the mechanism reduces. The modeled Recliner was analyzed in LS Dyna to obtain the input data for fatigue calculations. Coffin Manson fatigue criterion is used to obtain results, which matches the experimental results undergone in lab...|$|E
50|$|A {{nutating}} disc {{engine was}} patented in 1993 and a prototype {{was reported in}} 2006. The engine consisted of an internal disk wobbling on a Z-shaped shaft.

500|$|Première class {{available}} on long-haul international flights operated by Airbus A330-200 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft features <b>recliner</b> <b>seats,</b> fully flat beds with personal LCD TVs and in-seat power.

50|$|Ansett International's last {{business}} class was introduced {{with the arrival}} of the Boeing 747-400. It offered 42 single <b>recliner</b> <b>seats</b> in a 2-2-2 configuration on the main deck, with around 160 degrees of recline. Ansett Australia's retrofitted two Boeing 747-400 series aircraft equipped with these <b>recliner</b> <b>seats</b> mostly served the Australia-Asia (Hong Kong and Osaka) international flights. The <b>recliner</b> <b>seats</b> were equipped with inflight entertainment including personal televisions/touch screens with AVOD, personal telephones in every seat and laptop 110 V AC power outlets.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHalf-blanking {{of thick}} steel sheets is a metal forming process used to {{manufacture}} automotive <b>seat</b> <b>recliner</b> parts. During the forming process and in-use conditions (in case of crash) the material can {{be submitted to}} {{a high level of}} plastic strain and, in some cases, ductile damage. Recliners {{play an important role in}} the safety of passengers. Accurate computation results are thus needed. Forming stages have to be taken in account and damage and failure have to be modelled accurately. Two laboratory tests are developed to study the mechanical behaviour of half-blanked components. First, a cylindrical relief is half-blanked in a steel sheet sample. Then the cylindrical relief is wrenched using a shearing tool. During the tests, load and displacement are recorded. These tests enable the observation of failure mechanisms (SEM fracture observations) and give experimental data to validate numerical computations (geometries and load-displacement curves). During the wrenching test, a competition between ductile and shear failure is observed. Damage is modeled with a continuum mechanics based model (Lemaitre) and a phenomenological model (Xue-Wierzbicki). In the second one, the third invariant of the stress tensor is used to make difference between ductile and shear failure. Mechanical tests are performed to identify parameters model by inverse analysis. Tests are performed on different samples in order to have different stress states (stress triaxiality and Lode angle). In order to take into account material history, wrenching is performed with or without accounting for the half-blanking process. During both stages, large deformations are encountered. Automatic remeshing is needed and the finite element software Forge® is used. References : [1] W. F. Fan, J. H.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{excellent}} energy absorption capacity, closed-cell metal foams are candidate materials {{to be integrated}} in cars, trucks or railway systems as crash-absorbing safety elements. In order to exploit this potential to increase the passenger safety in transport vehicles, finite element simulations {{have been carried out}} to analyze the potential benefit of metal foam applications, e. g., in car seat elements. In a first step, simulations of the behavior of aluminum foams as stiffening elements for tubes and profiles {{in the case of a}} rear crash were made. The aluminum foam shall contribute to avoid buckling of the lower tube or profile. Further aluminum foam components were tested in a simulation as light-weight reinforcement between comfort polymer foam and metal structure. Here, the foam shall be used as an energy dissipater in order to reduce moments in the front <b>seat</b> <b>recliners.</b> In addition to the numerical simulation, monotonic and cyclic loading tests as well as metallographical studies were performed using various commercially available metal foams and foam-sheet sandwiches, e. g., Alulight foam, Foamtech foam, Pohltech-AFS sandwich with aluminum foam core and aluminum sheets and IWU-sandwich with foam core and steel sheets, which are promising candidates for the above-mentioned applications. The results are used in a LS-Dyna material model for finite element calculations...|$|R
