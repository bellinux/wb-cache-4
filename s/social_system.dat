40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>systems</b> {{design is}} {{employed}} {{to plan a}} better society. This paper discusses some theoretical issues of practical <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> design {{from the perspective of}} classical structural-functional theory. <b>Social</b> <b>systems</b> design refers to three aspects: design of function, design of structure, and the design of change process. One should not concentrate on the design of structure, for example, but instead on all three simultaneously. The four types of strategy for <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> design are isomorphism, transplantation, adaptation, and innovation. How to design differs according to these strategies. Most <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> designs encounter some dilemma that is resolved not a priori but by the careful consideration of information based on actual situations. More research on integration for resolving <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> design dilemmas is required. よりよい社会を設計するという意味での社会システムデザインについて、古典的な構造＝機能主義の枠組みを出発点にして、実際にデザインを行うために必要な理論上の問題を検討する。 社会システムデザインにおいてデザインされる対象は「機能」「構造」「変動過程」の 3 つであり、「構造」だけでなく、 3 つの対象間の関連を考慮してデザインを進めるべきである。また、社会システムデザインの戦略には「同型化」「移植」「適応」「革新」の 4 つがあり、戦略ごとにデザインの方法が異なる。そして社会システムデザインにおいてさまざまなジレンマが発生するが、そのジレンマの解決は、先験的には不可能であり「現場」の情報の個別的な組み込みによってなされる。社会システムデザインにおけるジレンマの解消過程、合意形成過程についてさらに議論を深めることが残された課題である...|$|R

5|$|Long-term field {{research}} has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur <b>social</b> <b>system</b> is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the <b>social</b> <b>system</b> in order to survive.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling <b>social</b> <b>system</b> outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. 1932's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the <b>social</b> <b>system.</b> For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E

Later, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers.

The requirements engineering domain is briefly investigated to identify the applicable techniques and principles.

Our point of departure is Simondon's (1992) theory of individuation, which we integrate with the enactive theory of cognition (Di Paolo et al., 2010) and Luhmann's (1996) theory of <b>social</b> <b>systems.</b> This forges a novel view of <b>social</b> <b>systems</b> as complex, individuating sequences of communicative interactions that together constitute distributed yet distinct cognitive agencies, acquiring a capacity to exert influence over their human-constituted environment. We conclude that the resulting framework suggests several different paths of integrating AI agents into human society. One path suggests the emulation of a largely simplified version of the human mind, reduced in its functions to a specific triple selection-making which is necessary for sustaining <b>social</b> <b>systems.</b> Another one conceives AI systems that follow the distributed, autonomous architecture of <b>social</b> <b>systems,</b> instead that of humans...|$|R
