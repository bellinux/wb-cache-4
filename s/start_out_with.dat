5|$|Chocolatier is {{a casual}} {{strategy}} video game with action game elements, developed by Big Splash Games {{and published by}} PlayFirst. The game was released as a download on May 1, 2007 and was followed by CD-ROM release on September 27, 2007. Players {{assume the role of}} a young Chocolatier, who must navigate 14 cities around the globe while buying ingredients, manufacturing chocolates, and selling them to chocolate shops. Two modes of play are available: in story mode the player must rebuild an almost bankrupt chocolate empire and acquire 64 chocolate recipes from around the world; in free mode players <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> scant resources and must become successful chocolatiers.|$|E
5|$|We always <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> {{a musical}} idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, {{but in general}} Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook {{up with one of}} our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E
25|$|A person's natural {{skin color}} affects their {{reaction}} to exposure to the sun. Generally, those who <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> darker skin color and more melanin have better abilities to tan. Individuals with very light skin and albinos have no ability to tan. The biggest differences resulting from sun exposure are visible in individuals who <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> moderately pigmented brown skin: the change is dramatically visible as tan lines, where parts of the skin which tanned are delineated from unexposed skin.|$|E

25|$|For the 2015 World Cup, the ICC {{implemented}} the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern formula, which included {{work by the}} new custodian of the method, Professor Steven Stern, from the Department of Statistics at Queensland University of Technology. These changes recognised that teams need to <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a higher scoring rate when chasing high targets rather than keep wickets in hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{promotions}} {{apply only}} to pieces which <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the ranks in the left-most column, that is, pieces with these ranks written in black; promoted pieces with those same ranks written in red may not promote further. Pieces which only appear upon promotion, that is, names which only occur written in red, are marked with an asterisk. The king, queen, and lion do not promote.|$|E
25|$|As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's {{population}} were recent Hmong {{immigrants from}} Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. America's {{involvement in the}} war in Vietnam created millions of refugees from Southeast Asia. Many had aided the opposition forces; others were displaced as regimes changed. With extraordinary encouragement from Walter Mondale, Saint Paul and Minneapolis received large numbers of these new immigrants between 1976 and the present, as they found their way to Minnesota. As with each ethnic group in Saint Paul's history, the newest immigrants speak their native languages, live in somewhat segregated communities, and <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> few monetary assets.|$|E

25|$|Campaign {{scenarios}} are persistent, meaning that all player structures are 'saved' when a game is won. For example, {{if a player}} builds a base and conquers a province, only to have a neighbouring faction attack aforementioned province, the player will <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> his previous base, {{with the exception of}} having no technology researched. Also, the CPU always starts out in the same spot, rather than being random. If you build a defense around the CPU's starting point and it's too close, it will be removed {{at the beginning of the}} defense match. Players may also choose to garrison provinces with units that are instantly available should the province be attacked. These are bought with planetary requisition.|$|E
25|$|Although {{children}} perceive {{rhythmic patterns}} {{in their native}} language at 7–8 months, they {{are not able to}} reliably distinguish compound words and phrases that differ only in stress placement, such as ‘HOT dog’ vs. ‘hot DOG’ until around 12 years of age. Children in a study by Vogel and Raimy (2002) were asked to show which of two pictures (i.e., a dog or a sausage) was being named. Children younger than 12 years generally preferred the compound reading (i.e., the sausage) to the phrasal reading (the dog). The authors concluded from this that children <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a lexical bias, i.e., they prefer to interpret phrases like these as single words, and the ability to override this bias develops until late in childhood.|$|E
500|$|In October 2003, Levine told USA Today, {{regarding}} {{the success of}} the song, [...] "I didn't love or hate the song, and I didn't care if it got on the album. We have a lot of pop songs on our record, and the idea was to <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> something different. Why come out of the gate with another pop song by another pop band?" [...] The following year, the band released an EP titled 1.22.03.Acoustic (2004), which features [...] "Harder to Breathe" [...] in an acoustic version. In 2005, Maroon 5 released a live album, Live – Friday the 13th, which features the song performed live.|$|E

500|$|This {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a value of 0. [...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is not the same thing as an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns). [...] In a database table, the column reporting this answer would <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> no value (marked by Null), and it would not be updated with the value [...] "zero" [...] until we have ascertained that Adam owns no books.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll always end up with more than if you <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E
500|$|Pre-release {{reviews of}} the miniseries were largely {{positive}}. Zack Smith of Newsarama gave the miniseries a largely positive review and called it [...] "fan service writ large, one that will prove immensely satisfying for long-term fans of the series". He applauded the way the string of episodes managed to <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> self-contained stories and move into a dense and emotional backstory. Tonally, Smith described the miniseries as possessing [...] "the feel of an old-school post-apocalyptic SF sagaa journey through a devastated-but-wondrous world, {{with a sense of}} danger and mystery detached from the Land of Ooo." [...] Smith's only complaint was that [...] "there's enough rich emotional material once the voyagers reach their destination that it feels like more time could be spent there". Matthew Jacobson of The Spectrum wrote that [...] "the story is masterful and imaginative" [...] and that [...] "if Islands is a litmus test, then the final season should be one heck of an adventure." ...|$|E

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
500|$|Personas {{are used}} for types of {{physical}} attack and magical attacks, along with actions such as healing and curing or inflicting status ailments. For all Persona games, all playable characters <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> an initial Persona, which evolves through story-based events and use during battle. In multiple Persona titles, two or more Personas can be summoned at once to perform a powerful Fusion Spell. In Persona 3, 4 and 5, only the main character can wield and change between multiple Personas; the other characters use a single Persona. During {{the course of the}} game, the player acquires more Personas through a system of Skill Cards, represented by Major Arcana Tarot cards. Each skill card represents a different Persona family, which in turn hold their own abilities inherent to that family. Multiple Personas can be fused together to create a new Persona with improved and inherited abilities: these range from fusing two Personas in the Persona 2 duology, to fusing up to twelve in Persona 4. Starting with Persona 3, the main protagonist of each game has an ability known as [...] "Wild Card", an ability to summon multiple Personas represented by the Fool Arcana.|$|E
500|$|Various other titles were {{suggested}} {{for the series}} such as Cardcaster Sakura and Card Character Sakura before Nekoi suggested Cardcaptor Sakura. While Ohkawa planned out Cardcaptor Sakura from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so {{it would look like}} {{she was in love with}} Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of [...] "if you try your best, it'll work out", but Ohkawa did not <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Sakura's [...] "It'll definitely be okay" [...] mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that [...] "minorities would feel comfortable with," [...] referring to the same-sex and taboo relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.|$|E

500|$|Similar to many {{fighting}} games, {{the aim is}} for {{the player}} to reduce their opponent's HP to zero. A character's offensive (and, to a lesser extent, defensive) power is shown in numerical form called BRV or [...] "Bravery Points". Both characters <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a set amount of BRV, and each must reduce their health to 0 by attacking them with a HP attack. Players can steal BRV from their opponent by attacking them with the basic [...] "BRV attack" [...] to add it to their own total and gain the upper hand. Players can then use the [...] "HP attack" [...] to cause direct damage to their opponent; HP damage {{is equal to the}} player's current amount of Bravery. However, once an HP attack is used, the character's own BRV is reduced to 0 and then slowly recovers to its starting amount. A character whose BRV total has been depleted (past 0 BRV and into the negatives) is forced into [...] "Break mode", where, aside from not being able to cause HP and BRV damage (But being able to gain BRV), all attacks made against them cause critical damage and the opponent gets all of the BRV in the [...] "Bravery Pool" [...] (a number that can be seen {{at the bottom of the}} screen), massively boosting their BRV amount.|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat {{contacted}} Chris Chibnall, {{asking him}} to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode [...] "42" [...] as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not have done in the television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided to <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in [...] "the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've never seen them before". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was [...] "so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want".|$|E
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to <b>start</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
