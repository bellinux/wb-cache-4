30|$|Compression of {{encrypted}} data draws much attention {{in recent years}} due to the security concerns in a service-oriented environment such as cloud computing [1, 2]. The traditional way of securely and efficiently transmitting redundant data is to first compress the data to reduce the redundancy then encrypt the compressed data. At the receiver side, decryption is performed prior to decompression. However, in some application scenarios (e.g., sensor networking), a sender may first perform encryption with a simple cipher and then send it to a network provider. The network provider always has the interest to reduce the rate. It is desirable {{to be able to}} compress the {{encrypted data}} without the key to reduce the security concerns.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with analysis on controllability for a class of nonholonomic systems. We discuss controllability of underactuated planar manipulators with one unactuated joint. We show iff the first (in the base <b>side)</b> <b>joint</b> is actuated, these systems are completely controllable, namely, there exists an admissible trajectory from any given initial point to any given final point. In order to prove this, we use global stabilizing feedback control law to converge the state to a manifold, where the system is locally controllable. By this controller, we have two trajectories, the one starts at the given initial position and the other starts at the given final position. Then we connect them using a kind of bi-directional approach to show {{the existence of the}} whole admissible trajectory. Finally we give some simulation results to discuss controllability of more general cases, the first joint is actuated and all other joints are unactuated. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractApart {{from the}} {{ergonomic}} inconveniences, LESS surgery presents some specific technical difficulties {{such as the}} loss of instruments triangulation, and closer proximity of instruments, leading to clashing and crossing of the instruments {{both inside and outside}} the patient. In this case, the surgeons need to adopt a posture particularly appropriate for this task. However, it is not clear whether the movements of the upper-limb joints are able to destabilize other body segments, like it is the head segment. The UCM framework allowed the quantiﬁcation of the overall upper-limb joint variability into a task-relevant and task-irrelevant component. It was supposed that LESS surgery needs more flexibility by the surgeon than conventional laparoscopy, and that could compromise joint coordination. The results of the UCM analysis showed a positive degrees of freedom synergy index indicating that the co-variation of the upper-limb joint angles stabilizes the head posture of the surgeons in the anterior-posterior direction. There was not a statistically significant difference in the synergy index between the LAP and LESS approach for the UCMs of both the left (t(7) = 1. 76,p = 0. 12) and right <b>side</b> <b>joint</b> spaces (t(7) = 1. 127,p = 0. 902). However, important differences can be appreciated individually.

40|$|Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a {{powerful}} tool gaining use in studies of biological form and function. This method is particularly conducive to studies of extinct and fossilized organisms, as models can be assigned properties that approximate living tissues. In disciplines where model validation is difficult or impossible, the choice of model parameters and their effects on the results become increasingly important, especially in comparing outputs to infer function. To evaluate {{the extent to which}} performance measures are affected by initial model input, we tested the sensitivity of bite force, strain energy, and stress to changes in seven parameters that are required in testing craniodental function with FEA. Simulations were performed on FE models of a Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) mandible. Results showed that unilateral bite force outputs are least affected by the relative ratios of the balancing and working muscles, but only ratios above 0. 5 provided balancing-working <b>side</b> <b>joint</b> reaction force relationships that are consistent with experimental data. The constraints modeled at the bite point had the greatest effect on bite force output, but the most appropriate constraint may depend on the study question.

40|$|Background/purpose: Occlusion is an {{important}} component of temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Little is known about the association between missing teeth and TMJ changes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a correlation exists between unilateral missing posterior teeth and changes in the inclination of the articular eminence (AE). Materials and methods: A total of 106 joints in 53 patients (20 men and 33 women) with unilateral posterior edentulism were included. In the same patients, the sagittal outline of the AE and glenoid fossa was traced in panoramic radiographs. The sagittal condylar path inclination was constructed by joining the crest of the glenoid fossa and the crest of AE. This was then related to the constructed Frankfurt's horizontal plane to determine the inclination of AE. The results were subjected to the one-way analysis of variance test. A P value of   0. 05). The inclination of AE in men was higher than in women on both the missing side and the nonmissing side (P >  0. 05). The symmetry equality between the missing and the nonmissing <b>side</b> <b>joint</b> was 1. 89 %. This value was higher (3 %) in the female group than in the male group (0 %). Comparing the absolute mean differences, the female group showed a lower difference (9. 8 °) than the male group (12. 11 °). Conclusion: A wide range of values of AE inclination was found regardless of other factors such as side of teeth loss and the sex of patients...|$|E
40|$|Studies on jaw {{kinematics}} {{have provided}} {{a good understanding of}} the motion of the mandible in space, but are of little biomechanical relevance because they could not relate the movements to anatomic structures. This is possible by the combination of three-dimensional reconstructions of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) anatomy with jaw motion recordings. This technique allows us to analyze the variation {{of the relationship between the}} articular surfaces, providing indirect insight into disk deformation during function and parafunction as well as TMJ loading. As far as the variation of the condyle-fossa distance is concerned, data indicated that during chewing the distance was smaller 1) on closing than on opening; 2) on the balancing than on the working side; and 3) during chewing of hard than soft food. Moreover, during a forceful static biting, the condyle-fossa distance decreased more on the contralateral, i. e. on the balancing side than on the working side. The decrease was related to the degree of clenching force. These results support the content that both condyles are loaded during chewing and the balancing <b>side</b> <b>joint</b> more than the working one. Biomechanically, the development of osteoarthrosis is more likely related to the magnitude and frequency of stresses applied on the cartilage. Joint movements produce tractional forces that may cause shear stresses contributing to cartilage wear and fatigue. Tractional forces are the result of frictional forces caused by the cartilage surface rubbing and of plowing forces caused by the translation of a stress-field through the cartilage matrix, as the intra-articular space changes during motion. Translation of the stress-field in mediolateral direction seems to be particularly important for the integrity of the TMJ disk because of its anisotropic properties. Dynamic stereometry showed that stress-fields translate in mediolateral direction during opening/closing, protrusion and laterotrusion, and that their translatory velocity varies intraindividually and with the rate of the condylar movement. Furthermore, the results seem to indicate that the lateral area of the TMJ disk is more often exposed to shear stresses caused by stress-field translation than the medial one. In conclusion, dynamic stereometry provides a good visualization of the movement of the condyles in the respective fossae. This helps improving our understanding for the complexity of condylar movements. The technique may also contribute to ameliorate our knowledge of TMJ biomechanics and therefore of the etiology of degenerative joint diseases and possibly also of internal derangement...|$|E
