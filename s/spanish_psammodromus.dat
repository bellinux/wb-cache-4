50|$|Psammodromus hispanicus, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>psammodromus,</b> is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Lacertidae.It is found in France, Portugal, and Spain.Its natural {{habitats}} are Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, temperate grassland, sandy shores, arable land, pastureland, and rural gardens.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Spanish</b> sand racer (<b>Psammodromus</b> hispanicus) {{has been}} {{recently}} split into three distinct species: P. hispanicus, P. edwardsianus, and P. occidentalis. Some morphological differences {{have been reported}} but there is as yet no description allowing unambiguous identification of the three species. Here, we describe differentiation in body measurements, scalation traits, and colour traits {{as well as in}} the degree of sexual dimorphism. Our results show that P. edwardsianus can be easily distinguished by the presence of a supralabial scale below the subocular scale, which is absent in the other two species. Psammodromus hispanicus and P. occidentalis can be distinguished by the number of femoral pores, throat scales and ocelli, and the relative width of the anal scale. The degree of sexual size dimorphism and sexual colour dimorphism substantially differs among species, suggesting that different scenarios of sexual and natural selection may exist for each species. Moreover, sexually selected traits (nuptial colouration, ocelli, and femoral pores) significantly differ among species, suggesting that visual and chemical communication may also differ among species. Such differences could prevent reproduction and gene flow at secondary contact zones, potentially reinforcing isolation and speciation within this group of lizards...|$|R
40|$|Background: Genetic, {{phenotypic}} {{and ecological}} divergence within a lineage {{is the result}} of past and ongoing evolutionary processes, which lead ultimately to diversification and speciation. Integrative analyses allow linking diversification to geological, climatic, and ecological events, and thus disentangling the relative importance of different evolutionary drivers in generating and maintaining current species richness. Results: Here, we use phylogenetic, phenotypic, geographic, and environmental data to investigate diversification in the <b>Spanish</b> sand racer (<b>Psammodromus</b> hispanicus). Phylogenetic, molecular clock dating, and phenotypic analyses show that P. hispanicus consists of three lineages. One lineage from Western Spain diverged 8. 3 (2. 9 - 14. 7) Mya from the ancestor of Psammodromus hispanicus edwardsianus and P. hispanicus hispanicus Central lineage. The latter diverged 4. 8 (1. 5 - 8. 7) Mya. Molecular clock dating, together with population genetic analyses, indicate that the three lineages experienced northward range expansions from southern Iberian refugia during Pleistocene glacial periods. Ecological niche modelling shows that suitable habitat of the Western lineage and P. h. edwardsianus overlap over vast areas, but that a barrier may hinder dispersal and genetic mixing of populations of both lineages. P. h. hispanicus Central lineage inhabits an ecological niche that overlaps marginally with the other two lineages...|$|R

P. h. hispanicus Central lineage inhabits an ecological niche that overlaps marginally with the other two lineages. Conclusions Our results provide evidence for divergence in allopatry and niche conservatism between the Western lineage and the ancestor of P. h. edwardsianus and P. h. hispanicus Central lineage, whereas they suggest that niche divergence is involved in the origin of the latter two lineages. Both processes were temporally separated and may be responsible for the here documented genetic and phenotypic diversity of P. hispanicus. The temporal pattern is in line with those proposed for other animal lineages. It suggests that geographic isolation and vicariance {{played an important role in}} the early diversification of the group, and that lineage diversification was further amplified through ecological divergence. </p...|$|R
