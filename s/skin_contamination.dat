SUBJECTS AND METHODS [...] Semen of exposed workers in two TNT plants located in He-Nan Province in 1992 were examined. RESULTS [...] The average TNT concentrations in the workplace, except the packing site, {{were found to have}} exceeded the maximal allowable concentration (MAC, 1 mg/m 3); <b>skin</b> <b>contaminations</b> of male workers exposed to TNT were higher after a shift than in controls, and correlated with the total blood concentrations of TNT, 4 -amino- 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (4 A), and 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrotoluene (2 A). Cu, Zn, Na, Mg, and Se concentrations were significantly decreased, but K, Ca, Co, Mn and Li contents were not significantly changed in the semen of workers exposed to TNT.

As a biomarker of exposure to polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and as an integral of all possible absorption routes of pyrene, 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration was measured from post-shift urine samples. Eighteen percent of the personal air samples exceeded the Finnish threshold limit value of benzol[a]pyrene (10 micrograms/m 3). Mean values for benzo[a]pyrene and pyrene were 5. 7 micrograms/m 3 and 8. 1 micrograms/m 3, respectively. Based on skin wipe sample analyses, the <b>skin</b> <b>contamination</b> was also obvious.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{measure the}} {{exposure}} {{of a group of}} farmers to organophosphate pesticide in sheep dip, and to record the incidence of symptoms after exposure. DESIGN: A prospective study of the autumn 1992 dipping period. Working methods were assessed by questionnaire. Absorption of organophosphate pesticide was estimated before, immediately after, and six weeks after dipping by measuring plasma cholinesterase, erythrocyte cholinesterase, and dialkylphosphate urinary metabolites of organophosphates. Symptoms were recorded by questionnaire {{at the same time as}} biological monitoring. Possible confounding factors were identified by medical examination of the subjects. SETTING: Three community council electoral wards in Powys, typical of hill sheep farming areas in Wales. SUBJECTS: All (38) men engaged in sheep dipping living in the three community council electoral wards. RESULTS: 23 sheep farmers and one dipping contractor completed the study [...] a response rate of 63 %. A sample of seven men who refused to enter the full study had similar working practices to the 24 subjects. Subjects reported inadequate handling precautions, and significant <b>skin</b> <b>contamination</b> with dip. Two men reported under diluting dip concentrate for use. Both had significant depression of erythrocyte cholinesterase after dipping. This indicated some absorption of organophosphate pesticide [...] but this did not reach levels usually associated with toxicity. It was not clear whether the symptoms of these two mens were caused by organophosphate exposure. Measurement of dialkylphosphate urinary metabolites in a single specimen of urine voided shortly after the end of dipping could not be correlated with individual exposure.

40|$|Dose {{assessments}} produced {{using the}} computer code MCNP {{are important to}} simulate events {{that are difficult to}} recreate experimentally. An emergency scenario involving whole-body <b>skin</b> <b>contamination</b> is one example of such an event. For these scenarios, an anthropomorphic phantom of a 10 -year-old male with uniform <b>skin</b> <b>contamination</b> was created and combined with MCNP for dose calculations. Activity on the skin was modeled with gamma-ray sources at energies of 50 keV, 100 keV, 250 keV, 500 keV, 750 keV, 1 MeV, 1. 25 MeV, 1. 5 MeV, and 2 MeV. The radionuclides 60 Co, 137 Cs, and 131 I were also modeled. The effective dose to the body and major organs was calculated for each scenario. Exposure rate contour lines were also produced around the body. The activity required to result in a dose equal to the legal limit of 0. 1 mSv for minors was calculated for each scenario. The highest activity required to produce this limit was from the 50 keV gamma-ray source. This activity was increased by an arbitrary value, approximately tenfold the current value, to represent an emergency scenario. This new activity concentration of 1 mCi per 100 cm 2 was used to produce doses for each of the scenarios. The lowest effective dose for the body was 0. 82 mSv, produced from the 50 keV source. The highest effective dose was 19. 59 mSv, produced from the 2 MeV source. The exposure rates nearest the body were approximately 1. 25 R/h, decreasing to 100 mR/h approximately 60 cm from the body. The data points were found to be dependent on the energy of the gamma ray. These data can also be improved by deriving solutions previously assumed in this scenario. For example, the skin may be broken down into multiple regions to allow for independent calculations for regional contamination. The activity on the skin can also be derived from air concentration models, allowing for the use of other models to be used in conjunction with this research...|$|E

These methodological advances should help us understand the mechanisms by which these microorganisms adapt to the specific chemical composition of each skin and thereby lead {{to a better understanding of}} bacteria/human host interdependence. This knowledge will pave the way for more systemic and individualized pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications...|$|R
40|$|The INEL Radiological Control Performance Indicator Report is {{provided}} quarterly, {{in accordance with}} Article 133 of the INEL Radiological Control Manual. Indicators are used {{as a measure of}} performance of the Radiological Control Program and as a motivation for improvement, not as a goal in themselves. These indicators should be used by management to assist in focusing priorities and attention and adherence to As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable (ALARA) practices. The INEL Radiological Control Performance Indicators consist of: collective dose in person-rem; average work dose, maximum dose to a worker, and maximum neutron dose to a worker; the number of <b>skin</b> and clothing <b>contaminations,</b> including the number of contaminated wounds and facial contaminations; the number of radioactive material intakes resulting in a dose assessment of 10 mrem or more; the area of contamination, high contamination, and airborne radioactivity areas in square feet; and airborne radioactivity events and spills...|$|R
40|$|A {{windowless}} silicon (Si) diode (4 mm 2) {{was evaluated}} as alpha particle detector and spectrometer for field measurements. It was irradiated with alpha particles from a 241 Am (2. 3 kBq) and a 210 Po (9 kBq) source at source-detector distances (SDD) of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 8 cm. The energy resolution {{in terms of}} full width at half maximum was 281, 148 and 113 keV for SDD of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 8 cm, respectively. The minimum detectable activity increased from 0. 08 to 0. 83 Bq when the SDD increased from 0. 5 to 1. 8 cm. The detector {{has the potential for}} several alpha spectrometric applications, such as monitoring for wound, <b>skin</b> and surface <b>contamination</b> at nuclear fuel facilities, nuclear power plants and facilities handling radioactive waste. Other areas are environmental surveys following releases of actinides at accidents in nuclear power plants and in connection with other radiological or nuclear scenarios...|$|R
