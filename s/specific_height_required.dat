50|$|These animals form {{large groups}} as the tide recedes. Feeding on beach rock at a <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> above average low tide level, the snails slowly move about in clusters, conserving the {{moisture}} {{that allows them to}} respire out of water.|$|R
3000|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of obtaining reliable information about the <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> of the terminals and the complexity that would introduce a continuous vertical dimension, coverage areas are commonly defined as multiple two-dimensional layers (e.g., one per building floor). In this way, γ [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Size - The {{benefits}} of a small footprint are compromised by the much greater <b>height</b> <b>required.</b> The presence of over-bridges limits the height of steam vehicles, and this in turn restricts the size (and hence potential power capacity) of the boiler.|$|R
50|$|Plans for a 44-foot-high temple, {{came before}} the Harrison Zoning Board of Appeals on Thursday, September 28, 2000. The temple's <b>height</b> <b>required</b> the LDS Church {{to apply for a}} {{variance}} to the 30-foot height limit. In a 5-2 vote, the Board denied the variance.|$|R

5|$|Stronger soils make {{stronger}} walls. Adobe builders {{can test}} cured blocks for strength by dropping from a <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> or by breaking {{them with a}} lever. Builders using immediate techniques like earthbag, cob, or rammed earth may prefer approximate crushing tests on smaller samples that can be oven-dried and crushed under a small lever.|$|R
30|$|Volume and taper {{equations}} {{are essential}} for obtaining estimates of total and merchantable stem volume. Taper functions provide advantages to merchantable volume equations because they estimate diameter inside or outside bark at <b>specific</b> <b>heights</b> on the stem, enabling the estimation of total and merchantable stem volume, volume of individual logs, and a height at a given diameter.|$|R
50|$|A notable and much-studied {{invertebrate}} of Heron Island is Cerithium moniliferum, a small marine snail. These {{animals will}} form large {{groups as the}} tide recedes. Feeding on beach rock at a <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> over the average low tide level, the snails slowly move about in their clusters, preserving the precious moisture {{that allows them to}} breathe overwater.|$|R
50|$|Lights {{are usually}} {{arranged}} in clusters {{of two or}} more around the structure at <b>specific</b> <b>heights</b> on the tower. Frequently there will be a set at the top, and then one or more sets equally spaced down the structure. The United Kingdom's Belmont mast has nine clusters of red lamps spaced equally along the full height of the mast.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a tubular lock {{is similar to the}} pin tumbler lock, in that there are several stacks of pins.

The minimum <b>height</b> <b>required</b> to ride is 48 inches, guests are secured by a combination lap bar/leg pads, and a seat belt.|$|R
50|$|In addition, a Design Memorandum {{issued in}} 1968 {{revealed}} that the outfall canals needed to be addressed because the existing canal levees {{did not meet the}} design <b>heights</b> <b>required</b> by federal design criteria adopted after Hurricane Betsy. However, no immediate guidance was given as to how to increase flood protection along the canals and it remained an unresolved issue for over two decades.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} gauge S requires buildings {{to be placed}} at minimum of 3100 mm from the track centreline. Bridges and tunnels must have a clearance of at least 4900 mm wide and 6400 mm high. The {{structure gauge}} Sp for passenger platforms allows 4900 mm only above 1100 mm (the common platform <b>height)</b> <b>requiring</b> a width of 3840 mm below that line.|$|R
50|$|Izod {{impact testing}} is an ASTM {{standard}} method {{of determining the}} impact resistance of materials. A pivoting arm is raised to a <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> (constant potential energy) and then released. The arm swings down hitting a notched sample, breaking the specimen. The energy absorbed by the sample is calculated from the height the arm swings to after hitting the sample. A notched sample is generally used to determine impact energy and notch sensitivity.|$|R
5000|$|The Volcano is a 200 ft S&S Space Shot {{which has}} been {{operating}} at the park since 1998. In 2003, the park equipped the ride with tilting seats. However, these were removed for the 2006 season due to the tilting mechanism causing several technical problems. The minimum <b>height</b> <b>required</b> is 1.4m. The ride reaches 183 ft {{in the air at}} a high speed of 50 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The total minimum <b>height</b> <b>required</b> varies per {{building}} codes {{depending on the}} area and target use of either residential or commercial. Local city codes supersede state, national and international code. In most states, the residential code is 36” high. There are some exceptions though like in California [...] the <b>required</b> <b>height</b> for residential railing is 42” [...] On the other hand, the commercial International Building Code requires the railing {{to be at a}} minimum of 42” height. Posts can be floor mounted or fascia/side mounted but the height of the railing is measured from the floor {{to the top of the}} railing.|$|R
50|$|In {{weather and}} climate studies, {{measurements}} or simulations often need {{to refer to}} a <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> or altitude, which is naturally AGL. However, the values of geophysical variables measured in various places on the natural (ground) surface may not be easily compared in hilly or mountainous terrain, because part of the observed variability is due to changes in the altitude of the surface. For this reason, variables such as pressure or temperature are sometimes 'reduced' to mean sea level.|$|R
50|$|No <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> or {{weight is}} given in the Kennel Club breed {{standard}} but males can be up to 27 in and weigh around 70 lb. The American KC is more specific and cites females range in height from 22.5 to 24 in and males from 24 to 26 in with a weight around 50 to 70 lb. The height is taken from where the dog's neck joins the back (the withers) measured down to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Soundboard bridges are {{glued to}} the top side of the {{soundboard}} to transmit vibrations from the strings to the soundboard. Steinway bridges are made of vertically laminated hard rock maple with a hard rock maple cap. They are bent to a specifically defined contour to optimize sound transmission. The bridge is measured for <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> requirements for each piano and is hand-notched. The bridges are then glued down and doweled into the ribs for structural integrity.|$|R

50|$|The Leeb rebound {{hardness}} test is the only commonly-available test related to determining the COR. It uses a tip of tungsten carbide, {{one of the hardest}} substances available, dropped onto test samples from a <b>specific</b> <b>height.</b> But the shape of the tip, the velocity of impact, and the tungsten carbide are all variables that affect the result that is expressed in terms of 1000*COR. It does not give an objective COR for the material that is independent from the test.|$|R
5000|$|The lock {{is made up}} of levers (usually {{made out}} of {{non-ferrous}} metals). Each lever needs to be lifted to a <b>specific</b> <b>height</b> by the key in order for the locking bolt to move.
