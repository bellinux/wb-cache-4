40|$|Various {{growth factors}} have been implicated in the {{regulation}} of cell proliferation and differentiation during tooth development. It has been unclear if insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) participate in the epithelium–mesenchyme interactions of tooth development. We previously produced three-dimensional sandwich co-culture <b>systems</b> (<b>SW)</b> containing a collagen membrane that induce the differentiation of epithelial cells. In the present study, we used the <b>SW</b> <b>system</b> to analyze the expression of IGFs and IGFRs. We demonstrate that IGF 2 expression in mesenchymal cells was increased by SW. IGF 1 R transduces a signal; however, IGF 2 R does not transduce a signal. Recombinant IGF 2 induces IGF 1 R and IGF 2 R expression in epithelial cells. IGF 1 R expression is increased by SW; however, IGF 2 R expression did not increase by SW. Thus, IGF 2 signaling works effectively in SW.

40|$|Gas-solid {{two-phase}} flows {{are widely}} seen in many industrial processes. A {{good example of}} these is the pneumatically conveyed pulverised fuel (coal/biomass) flow in the power generation industry. In order to achieve efficient operation of a power plant it is desirable to monitor the physical characteristics of fuel particles. As {{one of the most important}} characteristics, particle size distribution should be monitored to increase combustion efficiency, to minimise pollutant emissions, and to reduce milling cost. This thesis describes the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of two prototype instrumentation systems for in-line, continuous size measurement of pneumatically conveyed particles. A review of methodologies and techno logies for the in-line measurement of particle size distribution is given, together with the discussions of existing problems and technical requirements in their applications. Based on this review, a particle impact sensing system using a piezoelectric film sensor incorporating particle impact modelling and signal processing algorithms is proposed. Experimental results obtained on a laboratory test rig demonstrate that the system is capable of measuring particle size distribution and can be used to provide an assessment of flow characteristics wider various flow conditions. The system also demonstrates that this technology is practical and operational on a full-scale power plant. Additionally, the thesis also reports the latest development in particle imaging technology. A novel particle imaging system using multi-wavelength illumination sources is designed and implemented. Experimental results on a laboratory-scale rig show that the multi-wavelength design has increased the coverage of flow field and improved the system repeatability compared to the <b>single-wavelength</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, the particle impact sensing system and particle imaging system have their own advantages and limitations and both require further research. The work reported in this thesis offers a foundation for future in-line measurement of particle size distribution and demonstrates the potential of the proposed techniques.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{increases}} in both the query load and the data managed, as well as changes in hardware architecture (multicore), the last years have seen a shift from query-at-a-time approaches towards shared work (<b>SW)</b> <b>systems</b> where queries are executed in groups. Such groups share operators like scans and joins, leading to systems that process hundreds to thousands of queries in one go. <b>SW</b> <b>systems</b> range from storage engines that use in-memory cooperative scans to more complex query processing engines that share joins over analytical and star schema queries. In all cases, they rely on either single query optimizers, predicate sharing, or on manually generated plans. In this paper we explore the problem of shared workload optimization (SWO) for <b>SW</b> <b>systems.</b> The challenge in doing so is that the optimization {{has to be done}} for the entire workload and that results in a class of stochastic knapsack with uncertain weights optimization, which can only be addressed with heuristics to achieve a reasonable runtime.

We evaluate the optimizer over the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.

Attention is directed to: the retention rate, changes in the retention rate over time, and differences in the retention rate among subpopulations of students. Using multivariate regression analysis, the relationship between retention and the following factors were assessed: age, sex, race/ethnicity, college, transfer or first-time student, grade level, full-time or part-time course load, and cumulative grade point average.

The secondary (more massive) component is found to have a lower effective temperature and a slightly higher spot coverage than the primary.
