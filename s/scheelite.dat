5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from <b>scheelite</b> (at the time named tungsten). Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating tungsten by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless <b>scheelite.</b> Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic <b>scheelite</b> produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality <b>scheelite,</b> synthetic <b>scheelite</b> is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E
25|$|Tungsten {{trioxide}} can {{be prepared}} in several different ways. CaWO4, or <b>scheelite,</b> is allowed to react with HCl to produce tungstic acid, which decomposes to WO3 and water at high temperatures.|$|E

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ECI 2 D+PAFInternational audienceA general {{approach}} to the preparation of inorganic nanoparticles is proposed, using metathesis of precursor salts in non-aqueous liquids. Nanoparticles of <b>scheelites</b> AMO(4) (A=Ba, Sr, Ca; M=Mo, W), were obtained with a quantitative yield. Precipitations in formamide, N-methylformamide, propylene carbonate, DMSO and polyols often provide narrow particle size distributions. Advantageous morphology was explained by strong ionic association in non-aqueous solvents, leading to slow nucleation and negligible Ostwald ripening. Mean particle size below 10 nm and high specific surface areas were obtained for several Ca(Sr) Mo(W) O- 4 materials, making them promising for applications as adsorbents or catalysts. Zeta-potential of <b>scheelites</b> in aqueous suspensions showed negative values {{in a wide range}} of pH. Systematic study of optical properties demonstrated variation of optical gap in the sequences W > Mo and Ba > Sr > Ca. The observed trends were reproduced by DFT calculations. No quantum confinement effect was observed for small particles, though the surface states induce low-energy features in the optical spectra. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and <b>scheelite</b> (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for <b>scheelite,</b> instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E

40|$|RAFFINAGE+PAF:DLANanoscopic {{transition}} metal nitrides were prepared {{by means of}} a newly developed technique, using nanoparticles of <b>scheelites</b> (AMO(4), A = Ca, Sr, Ba; M = Mo, W) as precursors. After treatment with CCl 4 -NH 3 gas mixtures the precursor salts were transformed to mixtures of alkali earth chlorides (ACl(2)) and {{transition metal}} nitrides (M 2 N). The thermodynamic driving force of the process is the high free enthalpy of the simultaneous formation of carbon dioxide and an electropositive chloride, from the interaction between CCl 4 and AMO(4). As a result, the gas-solid reaction occurs at relatively low temperature (500 - 550 A degrees C). After water extraction of soluble chlorides, finely dispersed solids Mo 2 N (x) C (y) and W 2 N (x) C (y) (x = 0. 79 - 0. 95, y = 0. 03 - 0. 15) were obtained, which demonstrated high specific surface areas and well developed mesoporosity. Their catalytic activity was compared in the thiophene hydrodesulfurization reaction, where the active phase is provided by MS 2 sulfides formed in situ under the reaction conditions, as confirmed by temperature-programmed reduction. Due to their open porosity, the solids as obtained demonstrated high activity and increased stability as compared to the same nitrides prepared by means of other techniques. The catalytic activity of the newly prepared nitrides was evaluated in the guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction. Molybdenum nitride showed promising HDO performance and unusual selectivity, whereas the tungsten homolog demonstrated poor activity...|$|R

40|$|In the Mazowe area some 40 [*]km NW of Harare in Zimbabwe, gold {{mineralization}} is hosted {{in a variety}} of lithologies of the Archean Harare-Bindura-Shamva greenstone belt, in structures related to the late Archean regional D 2 / 3 event. Conspicuous mineralzogical differences exist between the mines; the mainly granodiorite-hosted workings at Mazowe mine are on pyrite-rich reefs, mines of the Bernheim group have metabasalt host rocks and are characterized by arsenopyrite-rich ores, and Stori's Golden Shaft and Alice mine, both in metabasalts, work sulfide-poor quartz veins. In contrast to the mineralogical diversity, near-identical fluid inventories were found at the different mines. Both H 2 O-CO 2 -CH 4 fluids of low salinity, and highly saline fluids are present and are regarded to indicate fluid mixing during the formation of the deposits. Notably, these fluid compositions in the Mazowe gold field markedly contrast to ore fluids “typical” of Archean mesothermal gold deposits on other cratons. Stable isotope compositions of quartz from the various deposits (δ 18 O= 10. 8 to 13. 2 ‰ SMOW), calcite (δ 18 O= 9. 5 to 11. 9 ‰ SMOW and δ 13 C=− 3. 2 to − 8. 0 ‰ PDB), inclusion water (δD=− 28 to − 40 ‰ SMOW) and sulfides (δ 34 S= 1. 3 to 3. 2 ‰ CDT) are uniform within the range typical for Archean lode gold deposits worldwide. The fluid and stable isotope compositions support the statement that the mineralization in the Mazowe gold field formed from relatively reduced fluids with a “metamorphic” signature during a single event of {{gold mineralization}}. Microthermometric data further indicate that the deposits formed in the PT range of 1. 65 – 2. 3 [*]kbar and 250 – 380 [*]°C.
