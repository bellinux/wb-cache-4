5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} failure models {{on the performance of}} transfer lines composed of N machines separated by N - 1 buffers. The two most used failure models, operation-dependent failures (ODF) and time-dependent failures (TDF), are considered. A machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF can fail even it is not working on a part. A machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF cannot fail if it is not working on a part. A transfer line considered in this paper contains both machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF and machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF. Up times, repair times and processing times are continuous random variables of general distribution. We prove that modelling a machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF of a transfer line as a machine <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF, as usually done in the literature, leads to under-estimation of the throughput rate if the time between failures of the related machine is exponentially distributed while all other times are general random variables. We then propose a timed Petri net approach for performance evaluation and simulation of transfer lines with both machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> TDF and machines <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> ODF. Numerical results show that this result holds under more general conditions...|$|R
