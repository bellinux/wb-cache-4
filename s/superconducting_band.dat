25|$|Similarly, {{at a fixed}} {{temperature}} {{below the}} critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which {{is greater than the}} critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts {{in the absence of a}} field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of the electrons in the <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> and consequently a longer London penetration depth of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.|$|E
40|$|The {{superconductor}} niobium {{possesses a}} narrow, roughly half-filled energy band with Bloch functions {{which can be}} unitarily transformed into optimally localized spin-dependent Wannier functions belonging to a double-valued representation of the space group of Nb. The special symmetry of this "superconducting band" can be interpreted within a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model of magnetism. While the original Heisenberg model assumes that there is exactly one electron at each atom, the nonadiabatic model postulates that the Coulomb repulsion energy in narrow, partly filled energy bands is minimum when the balance between the bandlike and atomiclike behavior is shifted {{as far as possible}} towards the atomiclike behavior. Within this nonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> form Cooper pairs at zero temperature. Just as in the BCS theory of superconduc- tivity, this formation of Cooper pairs is mediated by phonons. However, there is an important difference: within the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons in a narrow <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> are constrained to form Cooper pairs because the conservation of spin angular momentum would be violated in any normal conducting state. There is great evidence that these constraining forces are responsible for superconducting eigenstates. That means that an attractive electron-electron interaction alone is not able to produce stable Cooper pairs. In addition, the constraining forces established within the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model must exist in a superconductor. Comment: 11 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|In part I of {{this paper}} a {{modified}} BCS mechanism of Cooper pair formation of electrons was proposed. This mechanism is connected with {{the existence of a}} narrow, roughly half-filled "superconducting energy band" of given symmetry. The special symmetry of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> was interpreted within a nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model of magnetism. Within this nonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> are constrained to form Cooper pairs at zero temperature because in any normal conducting state the conservation of crystal-spin angular momentum would be violated. Except for this participation of the angular momentum, the pair formation is mediated in the familiar way by phonons. Superconducting bands can be identified even within a free-electron band structure. Therefore, in this paper the band structures of the bcc and hcp solid solution alloys composed of transition elements are approximated by appropriate free-electron band structures with s-d symmetry. From the free-electron bands, the number n of valence electrons per atom related to the maxima of the superconducting transition temperature Tc in these solid solutions is calculated within the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model. The observed two maxima of Tc are reproduced without any adjustable parameter at valence numbers n approximately equal to 4. 9 and 6. 5 in bcc and 4. 7 and 6. 7 in hcp solid solutions. This result is in good aggreement with the measured values of 4. 7 and 6. 4 of Hulm and Blaugher.

40|$|As {{shown in}} former papers, the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model {{presents}} a novel mechanism of Cooper pair formation {{which is not}} the result of an attractive electron-electron interaction but can be described in terms of quantum mechanical constraining forces. This mechanism operates in narrow, roughly half-filled <b>superconducting</b> <b>bands</b> of special symmetry and is evidently responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs in all superconductors. Here we consider this new mechanism within an outer magnetic field. We show that in the magnetic field the constraining forces produce Cooper pairs of non-vanishing total momentum with the consequence that an electric current flows within the superconductor. This current satisfies the London equations and, consequently, leads to the Meissner effect. This theoretical result is confirmed by the experimental observation that all superconductors, whether conventional or unconventional, exhibit the Meissner effect...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of an {{externally}} imposed rotation or magnetic field on frustrated multiband superconductors/superfluids. The frustration originates with multiple <b>superconducting</b> <b>bands</b> crossing the Fermi surface in conjunction with interband Josephson-couplings with a positive sign. These couplings tend to frustrate the phases of the various components of the superconducting order parameter. This in turn leads to an effective description {{in terms of a}} -symmetric system, where essentially only the -sector couples to the gauge-field representing the rotation or magnetic field. By imposing a large enough net vorticity on the system at low temperatures, one may therefore reveal a resistive vortex liquid state which will feature an unusual additional phase transition in the -sector. At low enough vorticity there is a corresponding vortex-lattice phase featuring a phase transition. We argue that this Ising transition phase should be readily observable in experiments.

40|$|We {{study the}} superconducting {{properties}} of the thin film BCS superconductor proximity coupled to a magnetically doped topological insulator(TI). Using the mean field theory, we show that Fulde-Ferrell(FF) pairing can be induced in the conventional superconductor by having inverse proximity effect(IPE). This occurs when the IPE of the TI to the superconductor is large enough that the normal band of the superconductor possesses a proximity induced spin-orbit coupling and magnetization. We find that the energetics of the different pairings are dependent on the coupling strength between the TI and the BCS superconductor and {{the thickness of the}} superconductor film. As the thickness of the superconductor film is increased, we find a crossover from the FF pairing to the BCS pairing phase. This is a consequence of the increased number of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>bands,</b> which favor the BCS pairing, implying that the FF phase can only be observed in the thin-film limit.

40|$|We {{investigate}} generalizations of coherent {{states as}} a means of representing the dynamics of excitations of the superconducting ground state. We also analyse the propagation of generalized coherent state wave packets under the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. The excitations of the superconducting ground state are superpositions of electron and hole quasi-particles described by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, that can only exist at energies outside the band gap. A natural generalization relevant to the excitations of the superconducting ground state is the tensor product of canonical and spin coherent states. This state will quickly become de-localized on phase space under evolution by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian due to the opposite velocities of the quasi-spin components. We therefore define the electron-hole coherent states which remain localised on phase space over longer times. We show that the electron-hole coherent states though entangled retain many defining features of coherent states. We analyse the propagation of both product and electron hole coherent states in a superconductor with a spatially homogeneous <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> gap. The dispersion relation indicates that wavepackets defined on the band gap have a zero group velocity, but we will show that interference effects can create states on the band gap that propagate at the Fermi velocity. We also consider the two semiclassical, short wavelength regimes, hbar-> 0 and the large Fermi energy limit mu->infinity. In general these limits produce behaviour analogous to the canonical coherent states except for isolated cases. Finally we analyse the dynamics of the Andreev Reflection of a Gaussian wavepacket incident on a discontinuous normal-superconducting interface. We show that restricting the energy bandwidth of the incident state inside the <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> gap precludes the wavepacket from fully entering the superconducting region.

Our central finding is that the enhancement in transition temperature for these materials arises from the opening of an additional superconducting gap, while retaining a largely unchanged bulk superconducting gap. Literature data reveals that ultrathin niobium films similarly develop a second superconducting gap. Based on the available data, it seems that, for type-II superconductors, a new <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> appears when the film thickness becomes smaller than the out-of-plane coherence length.

40|$|Quantum {{materials}} such as antiferromagnets or superconductors are complex in that chemical, electronic, and spin phenomena at atomic scales can manifest in their collective properties. Although there are some clues for designing such materials, they remain mainly unpredictable. In this work, we find that enhancement of transition temperatures in BaFe 2 As 2 -based crystals are caused by removing local-lattice strain and electronic-structure disorder by thermal annealing. While annealing improves Neel-ordering temperature in BaFe 2 As 2 crystal (TN= 132 K to 136 K) by removing in-plane electronic defects and overall reduction of a-lattice parameter, it increases superconducting-ordering temperature in optimally cobalt-doped BaFe 2 As 2 crystal (Tc= 23 to 25 K) by precipitating-out the cobalt dopants and giving larger overall a-lattice parameter. Although annealing promotes local chemical and electronic uniformity resulting in higher TN in the parent, it results in nanoscale phase separation in the superconductor resulting in lower disparity and strong <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> gaps in the dominant crystalline regions, which lead to both higher overall Tc and critical-current-density, Jc.

40|$|The {{combination}} of a topological insulator (TI) and a superconductor (S), which together form a TI/S interface, is expected to influence the possible surface states in the TI. It is of special interest, if the theoretical prediction of zero energy Majorana states in this system is verifiable. This thesis presents the experimental realization of such an interface between the TI strained bulk HgTe and the S Nb and studies if the afore mentioned expectations are met. As these types of interfaces were produced {{for the first time}} the initial step was to develop a new lithographic process. Optimization of the S deposition technique as well as the application of cleaning processes allowed for reproducible fabrication of structures. In parallel the measurement setup was upgraded to be able to execute the sensitive measurements at low energy. Furthermore several filters have been implemented into the system to reduce high frequency noise and the magnetic field control unit was additionally replaced to achieve the needed resolution in the μT range. Two kinds of basic geometries have been studied: Josephson junctions (JJs) and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). A JJ consists of two Nb contacts with a small separation on a HgTe layer. These S/TI/S junctions are one of the most basic structures possible and are studied via transport measurements. The transport through this geometry is strongly influenced by the behavior at the two S/TI interfaces. In voltage dependent differential resistance measurements it was possible to detect multiple Andreev reflections in the JJ, indicating that electrons and holes are able to traverse the HgTe gap between both interfaces multiple times while keeping phase coherence. Additionally using BTK theory it was possible to extract the interface transparency of several junctions. This allowed iterative optimization for the highest transparency via lithographic improvements at these interfaces. The increased transparency and thus the increased coupling of the Nb’s superconductivity to the HgTe results in a deeper penetration of the induced superconductivity into the HgTe. Due to this strong coupling it was possible to enter the regime, where a supercurrent is carried through the complete HgTe layer. For the first time the passing of an induced supercurrent through strained bulk HgTe was achieved and thus opened the area for detailed studies. The magnetic dependence of the supercurrent in the JJ was recorded, which is also known as a Fraunhofer pattern. The periodicity of this pattern in magnetic field compared to the JJ geometry allowed to conclude how the junction depends on the phase difference between both superconducting contacts. Theoretical calculations predicted a phase periodicity of 4 p instead of 2 p, if a TI is used as weak link material between the contacts, due to the presence of Majorana modes. It could clearly be shown that despite the usage of a TI the phase still was 2 p periodic. By varying further influencing factors, like number of modes and phase coherence length in the junction, it might still be possible to reach the 4 p regime with bound Majorana states in the future. A good candidate for further experiments was found in capped HgTe samples, but here the fabrication process still has to be developed to the same quality as for the uncapped HgTe samples. The second type of geometry studied in this thesis was a DC-SQUID, which consists of two parallel JJs and can also be described as an interference device between two JJs. The DC-SQUID devices were produced in two configurations: The symmetric SQUID, where both JJs were identical, and the asymmetric SQUID, where one JJ was not linear, but instead has a 90 ° bent. These configurations allow to test, if the predicted uniformity of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>band</b> gap for induced superconductivity in a TI is valid. While the phase of the symmetric SQUID is not influenced by the shape of the band gap, the asymmetric SQUID would be in phase with the symmetric SQUID in case of an uniform band gap and out of phase if p- or d-wave superconductivity is dominating the transport, due to the 90 ° junction. As both devices are measured one after another, the problem of drift in the coil used to create the magnetic field has to be overcome in order to decide if the oscillations of both types of SQUIDs are in phase. With an oscillation period of 0. 5 mT and a drift rate in the range of 5. 5 μT/h the measurements on both configurations have to be conducted in a few hours. Only then the total shift is small enough to compare them with each other. For this to be possible a novel measurement system based on a real time micro controller was programmed, which allows a much faster extraction of the critical current of a device. The measurement times were reduced from days to hours, circumventing the drift problems and enabling the wanted comparison. After the final system optimizations it has been shown that the comparison should now be possible. Initial measurements with the old system hinted that both types of SQUIDs are in phase and thus the expected uniform band gap is more likely. With all needed optimizations in place it is now up to the successors of this project to conclusively prove this last point. This thesis has proven that it is possible to induce superconductivity in strained bulk HgTe. It has thus realized the most basic sample geometry proposed by Fu and Kane in 2008 for the appearance of Majorana bound states. Based on this work it is now possible to further explore induced superconductivity in strained bulk HgTe to finally reach a regime, where the Majorana states are both stable and detectable. Aus theoretischen Betrachtungen geht hervor, dass die Kombination eines topologischen Isolators (TI) und eines Supraleiters (S) zu einer TI/S Grenzfläche die möglichen Oberflächenzustände im TI beeinflussen kann. Von besonderem Interesse ist dabei die Vorhersage der Ausbildung von Majorana Zuständen bei Null-Energie. Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der experimentellen Realisierung einer solchen Grenzfläche zwischen dem TI verspanntes HgTe und dem S Nb und analysiert, ob die oben genannten Effekte tatsächlich in diesem System auftreten. Da diese Grenzflächen zum ersten Mal produziert wurden, musste zunächst ein neuer lithographischer Prozess dafür entwickelt werden. Nach der Optimierung der Depositionstechnik des S sowie der Anwendung von Reinigungsschritten, war eine reproduzierbare Fertigung von Probenstrukturen möglich. Parallel dazu wurde das Messsystem ausgebaut, damit die sensitiven Messungen bei geringer Energie durchgeführt werden konnten. So wurden mehrere Frequenzfilter eingebaut, um Hochfrequenzrauschen zu reduzieren und die Magnetfeldsteuerung ersetzt, damit die benötigte Auflösung im μT Bereich ereicht werden konnte. Es wurden zwei grundlegende Geometrien untersucht: Josephson Kontakte (engl. Josephson junctions, JJ) und supraleitende Quanteninterferenzeinheiten (engl. superconducting quantum interference devices, SQUIDs). Eine JJ besteht aus zwei Nb Kontakten mit einem kleinen Abstand zueinander, die auf einer HgTe Schicht aufgebracht werden. Diese S/TI/S Kontakte bilden eine der grundlegendsten Strukturen, die möglich sind und wurden mit Hilfe von Transportmessungen untersucht. Der Ladungstransport in dieser Geometrie wird stark durch die beiden S/TI Grenzflächen beeinflusst. In spannungsabhängigen Messungen des differenziellen Widerstandes konnten mehrfache Andreev Reflexionen in den JJ nachgewiesen werden, was zeigt, dass Elektronen und Löcher die HgTe Lücke zwischen beiden Nb Kontakten wiederholt phasenkoherent überwinden können. Zusätzlich konnte mit Hilfe der BTK Theorie die Transparenz der Grenzflächen bestimmt werden. Dies erlaubte eine iterative Optimierung zum Erreichen der höchst möglichen Transparenz durch lithographische Verbesserungen an den Grenzflächen. Eine verbesserte Transparenz erlaubt eine stärkere Kopplung der Supraleitung des Nb an das HgTe und somit ein tieferes Eindringen der induzierten Supraleitung in die HgTe Schicht. Aufgrund der verbesserten Ankopplung war es möglich, das Regime zu erreichen, in dem ein Suprastrom durch die HgTe Schicht zwischen den Nb Kontakten getragen werden kann. Erstmals konnte ein induzierter Suprastrom durch verspanntes HgTe geleitet werden und ermöglichte es, in diesem Forschungsbereich mit detaillierten Analysen zu beginnen. Es wurde die magnetische Abhängigkeit des Suprastroms in der JJ aufgenommen, auch bekannt als Fraunhofer Muster. Die Periodizität dieses Musters im Magnetfeld im Vergleich zur geometrischen Ausdehnung der JJ erlaubt Rückschlüsse darüber, wie der Suprastrom der JJ von der Phasendifferenz zwischen beiden supraleitenden Kontakten abhängt. Theoretische Berechnungen haben vorhergesagt, dass die Periodizität dieser Phasenbeziehung von ursprünglich 2 p auf 4 p wechselt, falls ein TI als Material zwischen den beiden Nb Kontakten verwendet wird, da Majorana Moden auftreten. Es konnte jedoch klar gezeigt werden, dass trotz Verwendung eines TI die Phasendifferenz immer noch 2 p periodisch war. Durch die Variation weiterer Einflussfaktoren, wie die Anzahl der möglichen Moden oder die Phasenkohärenzlänge in der JJ könnte es in Zukunft trotz allem immer noch möglich sein, einen Bereich zu erreichen, in dem eine 4 p Periodizität mit Majorana Zuständen vorliegt. Ein erfolgversprechender Kandidat für diese Experimente konnte in verspanntem HgTe mit CdHgTe Deckschicht gefunden werden, jedoch muss der Fabrikationsprozess für diese Material erst noch entwickelt werden, um in der Lage zu sein, Strukturen zu produzieren, die qualitativ vergleichbar mit denen ohne Deckschicht sind. Der zweite Geometrie-Typ, der untersucht wurde, ist ein DC-SQUID, das aus zwei parallelen JJs besteht und analog auch als Interferometer zweier JJs gesehen werden kann. Es wurden zwei Arten von DC-SQUIDs produziert: Das symmetrische SQUID, bestehend aus zwei identischen JJs und das asymmetrische SQUID, bei dem eine JJ nicht linear aufgebaut ist, sondern beide Nb Kontakte statt dessen einen Winkel von 90 ° zueinander aufweisen. Diese beiden Arten erlauben es die fehlende Winkelabhängigkeit der supraleitenden Bandlücke zu überprüfen, die für induzierte Supraleitung in einem TI prognostiziert wurde. Die Phase des symmetrischen SQUIDs wird nicht durch die Form der supraleitenden Bandlücke beeinflusst. Daher kann es als Referenz verwendet werden, um eine eventuelle Phasenverschiebung des asymmetrischen SQUIDs zu erkennen. Ist keine Phasenverschiebung vorhanden, ist dies eine Bestätigung der Uniformität der Bandlücke. Falls jedoch eine Phasenverschiebung aufgrund des 90 ° Kontaktes auftritt, würde der Transport hauptsächlich durch p- oder d-artige Supraleitung getragen werden. Da beide SQUIDs nacheinander vermessen werden, muss sichergestellt werden, dass Drifteffekte in der magnetfelderzeugenden Spule keinen Einfluss auf den Vergleich haben. Die typische Oszillationsfrequenz der SQUIDs beträgt 0. 5 mT und die Driftrate der Spule liegt im Bereich von 5. 5 μT/h. Um einen aussagekräftigen Vergleich durchführen zu können, müssen die Messungen an beiden SQUIDs in wenigen Stunden durchgeführt werden, damit der Gesamtdrift klein genug bleibt. Um diese Messgeschwindigkeit zu erreichen, wurde ein neues Messsystem zur Aufnahme des kritischen Stroms, basierend auf einem Echtzeit Microcontroller, entwickelt. Dies reduziert die Zeitskala der benötigten Messungen von Tagen auf Stunden und erlaubt es so, den gewünschten Vergleich durchzuführen. Nachdem alle Optimierungen im Messsystem realisiert wurden, konnte gezeigt werden, dass der Vergleich nun tatsächlich möglich ist. Erste Testmessungen mit dem alten Messsystem legen nahe, dass das asymmetrische SQUID ein Maximum bei B = 0 T zeigt und somit die homogene Bandlücke das wahrscheinlichere Resultat ist. Da nun alle messspezifischen Optimierungen abgeschlossen sind, sollte es den Nachfolgern dieses Projektes zukünftig möglich sein, die finale Messung durchzuführen. Diese Arbeit hat gezeigt, dass es möglich ist, Supraleitung in verspanntem HgTe zu induzieren. Es wurde somit die grundlegendste Probengeometrie realisiert, die von Fu und Kane in 2008 für das Auftreten von Majorana Zuständen vorgeschlagen wurde. Ausgehend von dieser Vorarbeit kann nun das Regime der induzierten Supraleitung in verspanntem HgTe weiter erforscht werden, um schlussendlich in einen Bereich vorzustoßen, in dem Majorana Zustände zugleich stabil und messbar sind...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} vortices in superconductors usually repel each other. Several cases are discussed when the vortex interaction has an attractive tail {{and thus a}} minimum, leading to vortex clusters and chains. Decoration pictures then typically look like in the intermediate state of type-I superconductors, showing lamellae or islands of Meissner state or surrounded by Meissner state, but with the normal regions filled with Abrikosov vortices that are typical for type-II superconductors in the mixed state. Such intermediate-mixed state was observed and investigated in detail in pure Nb, TaN and other materials 40 years ago; {{last year it was}} possibly also observed in MgB$_ 2 $, where it was called "a totally new state" and ascribed to the existence of two <b>superconducting</b> electron <b>bands,</b> one of type-I and one of type-II. The complicated electronic structure of MgB$_ 2 $ and its consequences for superconductivity and vortices are discussed. It is shown that for the real superconductor MgB$_ 2 $ which possesses a single transition temperature, the assumption of two independent order parameters with separate penetration depths and separate coherence lengths is unphysical.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{design of a}} <b>superconducting</b> rf {{photonic}} <b>band</b> gap (SRF PBG) accelerator cell with specially shaped rods {{in order to reduce}} peak surface magnetic fields and improve the effectiveness of the PBG structure for suppression of higher order modes (HOMs). The ability of PBG structures to suppress long-range wakefields is especially beneficial for superconducting electron accelerators for high power free-electron lasers (FELs), which are designed to provide high current continuous duty electron beams. Using PBG structures to reduce the prominent beam-breakup phenomena due to HOMs will allow significantly increased beam-breakup thresholds. As a result, there will be possibilities for increasing the operation frequency of SRF accelerators and for the development of novel compact high-current accelerator modules for the FELs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the usual}} Ginzburg–Landau theory the {{critical}} value of Ginzburg–Landau parameter View the MathML source separates regimes of type-I and type-II superconductivity. The latter regime possess thermodynamically stable vortex excitations which {{interact with each}} other repulsively and tend to form vortex lattices. It was shown in [5] that this dichotomy in broken in U(1) × U(1) Ginzburg–Landau models which possess a distinct phase with vortex excitations which interact attractively at large length scales and repulsively at shorter distances. Here we discuss the influence of the Josephson coupling and that similar kind of superconductivity can also arise for entirely different reasons in superconductors where only one <b>band</b> is <b>superconducting</b> if this <b>band</b> interacting via a proximity effect with another band (the report is partially based on [1]) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{origin of}} cuprate high-temperature superconductor pseudogaps remains debatable. We {{point out that}} the indication of such excitation is hidden in the usual expression for the quasiparticle energy. It can be realized on a suitable multiband spectrum with an interband pairing channel. The band components bearing the chemical potential manifest <b>superconducting</b> gaps. A <b>band</b> with the Fermi energy outside creates a pseudogap type excitation. The latter does not characterize the pairing strength. On a doping-driven spectral arrangement the nature of low-energy excitations changes with doping. The pseudogap appears as a precursor of the corresponding superconducting gap on the doping scale. The corresponding critical points on the phase diagram are determined by the doping-driven overlap dynamics of the bare gapped electron spectrum. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Size {{of narrow}} <b>band</b> <b>superconducting</b> filters {{depends on the}} {{permittivity}} of the substrate used and the filter frequency. Size of good quality high temperature superconducting thin film wafers {{at a reasonable price}} is limited to two inches, as cost of bigger wafers makes the filters not economical. In this paper we present a design of a 10 -pole filter for a centre frequency of 1. 88 GHz and bandwidth of 20 MHz using ideas of the modified hairpin, the Chebyshev approximation without the influence of cross coupling between the non-adjacent resonators. The design fits onto a half of a two inch YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 on MgO wafer. The simulated passband insertion loss of the filter is 0. 1 dB and the out-of-band rejection is 50 dB at 4 MHz from the passband on both sides...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe studied from first-principles the {{recently}} discovered BiS 2 -layered superconductor La 0. 5 Th 0. 5 OBiS 2 and compared with LaO 0. 5 F 0. 5 BiS 2. Firstly, we have performed a global geometry optimization {{in order to}} predict an accurate ground state. In contract to the parent semiconductor LaOBiS 2 and according to other recent works, the band structure of both materials presents <b>superconducting</b> behavior, four <b>bands</b> of Bi- 6 p orbitals that cross a Fermi-level. Additionally, the systematic study of the electronic properties {{as a function of}} pressure shows the same behavior in both materials “Enhancement of superconductivity TC”, where the Fermi-level is shifted upward and the Fermi surface presents a similar dispersion. These similarities between tetravalent cation electron-doped via Th+ 4 substitution for La+ 3 (La 0. 5 Th 0. 5 OBiS 2), and monovalent anion electron-doped via F− substitution for O 2 − (LaO 0. 5 F 0. 5 BiS 2) may predict the same electronic properties...|$|R
40|$|We study {{properties}} of quantim wires with spin-orbit coupling and time reversal symmetry breaking, in normal and <b>superconducting</b> states. Electronic <b>band</b> structures are classified according to quasi-one-dimensional magnetic point groups, or magnetic classes. The latter belong {{to one of}} three distinct types, depending on the way the time reversal operation appears in the group elements. The superconducting gap functions are constructed using antiunitary operations and have different symmetry properties {{depending on the type of}} the magnetic point group. We obtain the spectrum of the Andreev boundary modes near the end of the wire in a model-independent way, using the semiclassical approach with the boundary conditions described by a phenomenological scattering matrix. Explicit expressions for the bulk topological invariants controlling the number of the boundary zero modes are presented in the general multiband case for two types of the magnetic point groups, corresponding to DIII and BDI symmetry classes.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of nano(n) -SiC {{addition}} on the crystal structure, critical temperature (T(c)), critical current density (J(c)) and flux pinning in MgB(2) superconductors. X-ray diffraction patterns show that all the samples have MgB(2) as the main phase with a very small amount of MgO; further, with n-SiC addition the presence of Mg(2) Si is also noted and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The Tc value for pure MgB(2) is 18. 9 K under 8 T applied field, while it is 20. 8 K for the 10 wt% n-SiC doped sample under the same field. This points towards the increment in the upper critical field value with n-SiC addition. The irreversibility field (H(irr)) for the 5 % n-SiC added sample reached 11. 3, 10 and 5. 8 T, compared to 7. 5, 6. 5, and 4. 2 T for the pure MgB(2) at 5, 10 and 20 K, respectively. The critical current density (J(c)) for the 5 wt% n-SiC added sample is increased {{by a factor of}} 35 at 10 K and 6. 5 T field and by a factor 20 at 20 K and 4. 2 T field. These results are understood on the basis of <b>superconducting</b> condensate (sigma <b>band)</b> disorder and ensuing intrinsic pining due to B-site C substitution clubbed with further external pinning due to available n-SiC/Mg(2) Si pins in the composite system...|$|R
40|$|Two new polar {{intermetallic}} compounds Y 3 Au 7 Sn 3 (I) and Gd 3 Au 7 Sn 3 (II) have been synthesized and their structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (P 63 /m; Z = 2, a = 8. 148 (1) / 8. 185 (3), and c = 9. 394 (2) / 9. 415 (3) for I/II, respectively). They can formally {{be assigned to}} the Cu 10 Sn 3 type and consist of parallel slabs of Sn centered, edge-sharing trigonal Au 6 antiprisms connected through R 3 (R = Y, Gd) triangles. Additional Au atoms reside in the centres of trigonal Au 6 prisms forming Au@Au 6 clusters with Au–Au distances of 2. 906 – 2. 960 Å, while the R–R contacts in the R 3 groups are considerably larger than the sums of their metallic radii. These exclusive structural arrangements provide alluring systems to study the synergism between strongly correlated systems, particularly, those {{in the structure of}} (II), and extensive polar intermetallic contacts, which has been inspected by measurements of the magnetic properties, heat capacities and electrical conductivities of both compounds. Gd 3 Au 7 Sn 3 shows an antiferromagnetic ordering at 13 K, while Y 3 Au 7 Sn 3 is a Pauli paramagnet and a downward curvature in its electrical resistivity at about 1. 9 K points to a <b>superconducting</b> transition. DFT-based <b>band</b> structure calculations on R 3 Au 7 Sn 3 (R = Y, Gd) account for the results of the conductivity measurements and different spin ordering models of (II) provide conclusive hints about its magnetic structure. Chemical bonding analyses of both compounds indicate {{that the vast majority of}} bonding originates from the heteroatomic Au–Gd and Au–Sn interactions, while homoatomic Au–Au bonding is evident within the Au@Au 6 cluster...|$|R
