During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records...

2500|$|When my {{grandmother}} {{found out that}} I was playing jazz {{in one of the}} sporting houses in the District, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had disgraced the family and forbade me to live at the house.... <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> devil music would surely bring about my downfall, but I just couldn't put it behind me. The cornetist Rex Stewart recalled that Morton had chosen [...] "the nom de plume 'Morton' to protect his family from disgrace if he was identified as a whorehouse 'professor'." ...|$|E
60|$|I quite {{believed}} Leeby when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> afterwards <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{had watched}} Jamie feeling beneath the mattress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>that</b> passed," [...] said Oak, with a pharisaical {{sense that}} he was not as other shearers in this matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> afore <b>that</b> I should hear'n; and so I did. They say she's {{clever and}} deep, and perhaps she charmed 'en to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think you}} ought to know this. I went to Mr. Weiss' office. He did not know that the paper was not still in your keeping. I went to Stella, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she had not taken it for them. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they had offered her one hundred {{thousand}} dollars for it, but she never had any idea of letting them have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Torrington says so. I asked {{particularly}} who he was, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{his mother}} was some foreigner of high rank." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) How the dickens should I {{know what}} she prefers? <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she doted on horses. (Aloud.) I think it is.|$|E
6000|$|... "She thinks well of it, Umbelazi, for she {{has seen}} Saduko and taken a liking to him. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> herself <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wishes no other husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{speaking}}," [...] {{his wife}} returned, [...] "of what <b>she</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That's</b> one thing. I'm speaking of what I know by myself. That's another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{knew about}} your father's ruin, and his death. It {{was very hard}} to listen to, Jimmy--but did it really happen that way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called at}} Mrs. Plymdale's this morning, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he had taken}} the house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{a letter}} from Miriam {{yesterday}} afternoon," [...] said Dora, [...] "in which <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> her brother Ralph is engaged to Miss Drane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was, sir. When she handled {{her silver}} ornament, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I might depend {{on her to}} forget nothing, and {{to be afraid of}} nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} no room for me," [...] he said to Mrs. Jones, [...] "you must scold Lady Mab. <b>She</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you <b>told</b> her to invite me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. When <b>she</b> first <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{they had}} {{understood}} it so, I laughed--almost--it {{was so far}} from me. But now when {{you seem to have}} had the same idea--Did you all think so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nobody but my sister,' pursued Charley, 'would {{have found}} out such an {{extraordinary}} companion. She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving herself up to another. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so, <b>that</b> night when we went there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{her ability}} was not {{sufficient}} to induce me {{to give up my}} idea. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> after I had known her six months I should detest her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} would be arranged for me by Mr. Wickfield, and that I should want for nothing, and gave me the kindest words and the best advice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, papa. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Frederic Aylmer was to {{have all}} her property. She {{explained}} to me everything that she meant to do, and I {{thought that she was}} right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Cranston omits to add," [...] Lessingham put in, [...] "that before I did so <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> frankly <b>that</b> her {{feelings}} for me were of warm friendliness--that her love {{was given to}} her husband, and her husband only." ...|$|R
6000|$|Razumov {{was saying}} to himself, [...] "She won't offer to show the letter to me. Not likely. Has <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{everything}} <b>that</b> correspondent of hers has found out?" [...] He longed to see the letter, but he felt he must not ask.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious, ain't that {{an awful}} lot of money," [...] exclaimed Davy. [...] "She's the woman you and Diana lit on when you jumped into the spare room bed, ain't <b>she?</b> Diana <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> story. Is that why she left you so much?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she {{was called}} Dian the Beautiful, and that she belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.|$|E
60|$|To crown my vexation of spirit, Perdita, {{the visionary}} Perdita, seemed to awake to real life with transport, when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Earl of Windsor {{was about to}} arrive.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} last night," [...] said I, [...] "that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{was the only}} man in all this earth that she could ever bring herself to love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This boat {{reminds me}} of Adele," [...] said Mrs. Shorter. [...] "She loved it. I can see how she could get a divorce from Dicky--but the 'Folly'! <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{yesterday}} <b>that</b> {{the sight of it}} made her homesick, and Eustace Rindge won't leave Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was the {{use when}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not care for me? Of course I should have asked her father. As to Lady Staveley, she and I got on uncommonly well. I'm almost {{inclined}} {{to think that she}} would not have objected." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found she}} was very well pleased with the discourse, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> seriously <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be very glad to make him {{sensible}} of her just resentment, and either to bring him on again, or have the satisfaction of her revenge being as public as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, smiling; [...] "my work's out yonder. I couldn't sit idle. I think Miss Gladwyne hit it when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{was one of}} the pioneers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{thinking}} of her likewise,' said the Earl. 'She spoke truly when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he might not be}} what I then wished to make him, but something far better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur is serious?" [...] he inquired. [...] "It {{is only a}} {{short time}} ago that I was talking with Mademoiselle Delora, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she was dining with you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She, in her turn, seems enslaved to the dead. <b>She</b> {{has often}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> her father's spirit is leading her every movement." ...|$|R
60|$|I fancy it {{was hard}} enough even then. The Story Girl did not care a whit, but Cecily rather squirmed under the curious glances that were cast at her. <b>She</b> {{afterwards}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> really did not think she could have endured it {{if she had been}} alone.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of <b>that</b> last terrible moment {{months before}} {{when the door}} of her prison cell within the Temple of the Sun was slowly closing between us. Of how Phaidor had sprung upon her with uplifted dagger, and of Thuvia's shriek as she had {{realized}} the foul intention of the thern goddess.|$|R
