40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed {{of the effects}} of strong optical feedback on the characteristics of <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSELs. Consideration is given to the cases of short (1. 5 cm) and long (15 cm) external cavities.

Stable operation is found for an optimum phase while for other values of the phase chaotic dynamics is observed. Such behaviour is not seen near threshold where the laser output is stable for any accumulated phase. For the longer external cavity the influence of the phase term is found to be insignificant: chaotic behaviour is seen in the output over a wide range of operating currents.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a {{theoretical}} investigation of the nonlinear dynamics of the polarization of multitransverse mode vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) under current modulation. Special attention {{is given to the}} comparison with a previously studied case of <b>single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> VCSEL emitting in two orthogonal polarizations. The consideration of spatial effects in VCSEL modifies the polarization dynamics that accompanies the period doubling route to chaos for large modulation amplitudes. Depending on the modulation parameters, the excitation of a higher order transverse mode may either induce chaotic pulsing in an otherwise regularly pulsating VCSEL, or induce a time-periodic pulsing dynamics in an otherwise chaotic VCSEL. Bifurcation diagrams obtained for different modulation frequencies, several values of the dichroism, and different transverse mode characteristics allow us to identify the different scenarios of polarization dynamics in a directly modulated VCSEL. Temporal analysis of carrier number radial profile reveals considerable changes for the multitransverse mode case only constituting the physical origin of the reported changes in the temporal and polarization dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Single-transverse</b> <b>mode</b> lasing is {{demonstrated}} in a broad-area PT-symmetric semiconductor microring arrangement. The proposed scheme is versatile, robust to fabrication errors, {{and allows for}} high brightness operation while maintaining spectral purity. OCIS codes: (140. 3570) Lasers, single-mode; (140. 3948) Microcavity devices; (140. 3410) Laser resonators Broad-area lasers provide high output powers while managing the thermal load and reducing the impact of optical nonlinearities [1, 2]. Unfortunately, enlarging the cross section of a waveguide inevitably introduces higher order transverse modes and leads to undesired filamentation [3], thus compromising the spectral and spatial fidelity of the laser and limiting {{the brightness of the}} output beam. These limitations exist on all scales, and may even be exacerbated in chip-scale semiconductor lasers, where the large gain bandwidths afforded by the active media already pose a challenge in promoting single-mode operation. Tapering along the direction of propagation and/or engineering the refractive index in the cross section have been extensively pursued as possible techniques to enforce single mode operation in such broad area semiconductor arrangements. Despite their success in suppression of higher order modes, the application of these techniques is quite limited because of their inherent sensitivity to perturbations. Lately, the selective breaking of parity-time (PT) symmetry has been proposed as a viable strategy for obtaining single transverse mode operation [4]. Along these lines, by pairing an active resonator/waveguide with a lossy but otherwise identical partner, it is possible to enforce single-spatial-mode performance, even in the presence of strong mode competition i...|$|R

40|$|On-chip, single <b>mode</b> <b>semiconductor</b> lasers {{are usually}} {{fabricated}} using conventional distributed feedback (DFB) structures. Due to {{the limitation of}} index guiding in the transverse direction, the width of these lasers has {{to be less than}} a few microns. Meanwhile, the laser output power is limited by catastrophic optical damage (COD) at the facets and thus large optical cavities are necessary for high power semiconductor lasers. Therefore, high power, single mode applications are challenging, due to the conflicting requirements for large modal volume (to prevent COD by reducing optical power density) and narrow width (to obtain the single mode operation). Increasing the width of single <b>mode</b> <b>semiconductor</b> lasers is fundamentally important for obtaining high spectral and spatial optical power densities. This thesis reports on achieving the single mode operation of large area, edge emitting semiconductor lasers, using the photonic crystal Bragg structure (two dimensional distributed feedback structure). Both theoretical and experimental results are presented. Two dimensional coupled mode approaches and transfer matrix methods are developed to analyze and design the photonic crystal Bragg structure. It is shown that the single mode lasing can be obtained by satisfying both the transverse and longitudinal Bragg conditions and a single lobe, diffraction limited far field can be obtained by optimizing the coupling coefficient of the photonic crystal. Electrically pumped, large-area (100 um x 500 um), single <b>mode</b> <b>semiconductor</b> photonic crystal Bragg lasers are experimentally demonstrated in pulsed and continuous wave conditions with single lobe, diffraction limited far fields. Two dimensional lasing wavelength tuning is demonstrated, which proves that the lasing mode is truly defined by the photonic crystal lattice. Furthermore, a wavelength tuning sensitivity about 80 times smaller than a conventional DFB laser is also achieved, allowing for more accurate control of the lasing wavelength. Photonic crystal lasers based on effective index guiding are also studied. Single mode operation is achieved by combining the transverse confinement provided by an effective index guiding mechanism with the longitudinal mode selection provided by the Bragg reflection from the photonic crystal cladding. These devices represent an important first step toward using photonic crystals in a different way for the modal control of semiconductor lasers in planar optical circuits. ...|$|R

Furthermore, space based and airborne lasers for lidar and laser communication applications require efficient, compact, lightweight, long-lived, and stable-pulsed laser sources. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers (DPSSL) have recently shown the potential for satisfying all of these requirements. We will report on the operating characteristics of a diode-pumped, monolithic, self-Q-switched Cr,Nd:YAG laser where the chromium ions act as a saturable absorber for the laser emission at 1064 nm. The pulse duration is 3. 5 ns and the output is highly polarized with an extinction ratio of 700 : 1. It is further shown that the output is single-longitudinal-mode with transform-limited spectral line width without pulse-to-pulse mode competition. Consequently, the pulse-to-pulse intensity fluctuation {{is less than the}} instrument resolution of 0. 25 percent. This self-stabilization mechanism is because the lasing mode bleaches the distributed absorber and establishes a gain-loss grating similar to that used in the distributed feedback semiconductor lasers.
