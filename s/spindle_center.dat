40|$|Molecular motors are {{required}} for spindle assembly and maintenance during cell division. How motors move and interact inside spindles is unknown. Using photoactivation and photobleaching, we measure mitotic motor movement inside a dynamic spindle. We find that dynein–dynactin transports the essential motor Eg 5 toward the spindle poles in Xenopus laevis egg extract spindles, revealing a direct interplay between two motors of opposite directionality. This transport occurs throughout the spindle except at the very <b>spindle</b> <b>center</b> and at the spindle poles, where Eg 5 remains stationary. The variation of Eg 5 dynamics with {{its position in the}} spindle is indicative of position-dependent functions of this motor protein. Our results suggest that Eg 5 drives microtubule flux by antiparallel microtubule sliding in the <b>spindle</b> <b>center,</b> whereas the dynein-dependent concentration of Eg 5 outside the <b>spindle</b> <b>center</b> could contribute to parallel microtubule cross-linking.

The detailed {{process by which}} chromosomes are bioriented and how biorientation is coordinated with spindle assembly and chromosome congression remain unclear. Here, we provide complete 3 D kinetochore-tracking datasets throughout cell division by high-resolution imaging of meiosis I in live mouse oocytes. We show that in acentrosomal oocytes, chromosome congression forms an intermediate chromosome configuration, the prometaphase belt, which precedes biorientation. Chromosomes then invade the elongating <b>spindle</b> <b>center</b> to form the metaphase plate and start biorienting. Close to 90 % of all chromosomes undergo one or more rounds of error correction of their kinetochore-microtubule attachments before achieving correct biorientation. This process depends on Aurora kinase activity. Our analysis reveals the error-prone nature of homologous chromosome biorientation, providing a {{possible explanation for the}} high incidence of aneuploid eggs observed in mammals, including humans...|$|E

40|$|Background: Interspecies {{hybridization}} {{is widely}} used to achieve heterosis or hybrid vigor, which has been observed and harnessed by breeders for centuries. Natural allopolyploid hybrids generally exhibit more superior heterosis than both the diploid progenies and their parental species. However, polyploid formation processes have been long ignored, the genetic basis of heterosis in polyploids remains elusive. Results: In the present study, triploid hybrids had been demonstrated to contain two sets of chromosomes from mother species and one set from father species. Cellular polyploidization process in the embryos had been traced. The triploid hybrids might be formed by failure formation of the second polarized genome during the second meiosis stage. Four <b>spindle</b> <b>centers</b> were observed in anaphase stage of the first cell division. Three <b>spindle</b> <b>centers</b> were observed in side of cell plate after the first cell division. The 5 S rDNA genes of four types of groupers were cloned and analyzed. The diploid and triploid hybrids had been proved to contain the tandem chimera structures which were recombined by maternal and paternal monomer units. The results indicated that genome re-fusion had occurred in the hybrid progenies. To further elucidate the genetic patterns of diploid and triploid hybrids, fluorescence chromosome location had been carried out, maternal 5 S gene (M- 386) were used as the probe. The triploid hybrids contained fewer fluorescence loci numbers than the maternal species. The results indicated that participation of paternal 5 S gene in the triploid hybrid genome had degraded the match rates of M- 386 probe. Conclusions: Our study {{is the first to}} investigate the cellular formation processes of natural allopolyploids in hybrid fish, the cellular polyploidization process may be caused by failure formation of the second polarized genome during the meiosis, and our results will provide the molecular basis of hybrid vigor in interspecies hybridization...|$|R

The processive motor Xklp 1 controls overlap size by overlap length-dependent microtubule growth inhibition.

40|$|SummaryDuring cell division, correct {{positioning}} of chromosomes in mitotic and meiotic spindles depends on interactions of microtubules with kinetochores and, especially in higher eukaryotes, with the chromosome arms [1, 2]. Chromokinesins, highly concentrated on mitotic and meiotic chromatin, {{are thought to}} actively push the chromosome arms toward the <b>spindle</b> <b>center,</b> thereby contributing to chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate in early mitosis [1 – 9]. How many distinct classes of chromokinesins exist and how they cooperate to form a motile chromatin-microtubule interface are not known. Using a novel experimental assay with nonkinetochore chromatin reconstituted from Xenopus egg extract, we demonstrate that the microtubule motility generated on chromatin is continuous and plus-end directed. Using specific antibody depletions, we identify two distinct chromokinesins, kinesin- 10 (Xkid) [8, 10, 11] and kinesin- 4 (Xklp 1) [12, 13], as the major activities mediating the interaction of meiotic chromatin with microtubules. Interestingly, {{we find that the}} slower motor, kinesin- 10, more efficiently recruits microtubules and also dominates in collective microtubule transport both in the close-to-physiological environment of chromatin and also in a minimal in vitro assay.

40|$|AbstractIn {{eukaryotic}} cells, proper {{position of}} the mitotic spindle is necessary for successful cell division and development. We explored the nature of forces governing the positioning and elongation of the mitotic spindle in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We hypothesized that astral microtubules exert mechanical force on the S. pombe spindle and thus help align the spindle with the major axis of the cell [1, 2]. Microtubules were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [3] and visualized by two-photon microscopy. Forces were inferred both from time-lapse imaging of mitotic cells and, more directly, from mechanical perturbations induced by laser dissection [4, 5] of the spindle and astral microtubules. We found that astral microtubules push on the spindle poles in S. pombe, {{in contrast to the}} pulling forces observed {{in a number of other}} cell types [4, 6 – 9]. Further, laser dissection of the spindle midzone induced spindle collapse inward. This offers direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that spindle elongation is driven by the sliding apart of antiparallel microtubules in the spindle midzone [10, 11]. Broken spindles recovered and mitosis completed as usual. We propose a model of <b>spindle</b> <b>centering</b> and elongation by microtubule-based pushing forces...|$|R

40|$|The precise {{positioning}} of the mitotic spindle to the cell center during mitosis is a fundamental process for chromosome segregation and the division plane definition. Despite its importance, the mechanism for <b>spindle</b> <b>centering</b> remains elusive. To study this mechanism, the dynamic of the microtubules was characterized at the bulk and at the cortex in the C. elegans embryo. Then, this dynamic was correlated to the centering forces of the spindle that were studied by applying calibrated magnetic forces via super-paramagnetic beads inserted into the cytoplasm of one- and two-cell C. elegans embryos. Finally, these results were confronted with the different centering models: cortical pushing model, cortical pulling model and the cytoplasmic pulling model. This thesis shows that: (i) The microtubules dynamic of the spindle aster is controlled spatially in the C. elegans embryo, with not rescues and catastrophes in the cytoplasm but in the centrosome and the cortex, respectively. (ii) The centering mechanism of the spindle behaved roughly as a damped spring with a spring constant of 18 12 pN/ m and a drag coefficient of 127 65 pN s/ m (mean SD). This viscoelastic behavior is evidence of a centering force that recovers and/or maintains {{the position of the}} spindle in the cell center. (iii) It seems to be two mechanisms that recover/maintain the spindle position. A fast one that may work for transient displacements of the spindle and a slow one that work over large and long perturbations. (iv) The centering forces scale with the cell size. The centering forces are higher in the two-cell embryo. This result argues against a centering mechanism mediated by cytoplasmic factors. It seems to be a limit for the relation of centering force to size, as the forces found in the four-cell embryo are comparable to the single-cell ones. (v) The centering forces scale with the amount of microtubules in the cell. This strengthens the belief that the microtubules are the force transmission entities of the centering mechanism. (vi) The boundary conditions are important to maintain the centering forces. A transient residency time of microtubules at the cortex, which is controlled by cortical catastrophe factors, is indispensable for a proper force transmission by the microtubules. (vii) The elimination of cortical catastrophe factors provides evidence for microtubules buckling, which is taken as a proof of polymerization forces. (viii) The cortical pulling forces mediated by the gpr- 1 / 2 pathway {{do not seem to be}} involved in centering and it is proposed they are present in the cell for off-center positioning purposes. (ix) The forces generated by vesicle transport are enough to displace the spindle and they are suggested to be auxiliary forces to centering. (x) The forces associated with the spindle change dramatically during cell division. From metaphase to anaphase the forces associated with the spindle scale up to five times. This behavior was consistent during the development of the embryo as the same pattern was observed in the one-, two- and four-cell embryo. (xi) The higher forces found during anaphase are not cortical pulling (via pgr- 1 / 2 pathway) depended, and it is proposed the spindle is `immobilised' by tethering or by an unknown cortical pulling pathway. To this date, this thesis presents the most complete in-vivo measurements of the centering forces in association with the microtubules dynamics. Taken together the results constrain molecular models of centering. This thesis concludes that most probably the predominant forces of the <b>spindle</b> <b>centering</b> mechanism during mitosis are generated by astral microtubules pushing against the cortex. Additionally, this thesis presents the most complete map of forces during cell division during development, which will prove to be indispensable to understand the changes the spindle undergoes when it changes its function...|$|R

This extremely asymmetric division {{enables the}} oocyte to retain sufficient storage material {{for the development of}} the embryo after fertilization. To divide asymmetrically, mammalian oocytes relocate the <b>spindle</b> from their <b>center</b> to the cortex. In all mammalian species analyzed so far, including human [1], mouse [2], cow [3], pig [4], and hamster [5], spindle relocation depends on filamentous actin (F-actin). However, even though spindle relocation is essential for fertility [6], the involved F-actin structures and the mechanism by which they relocate the spindle are unknown. Here we show in live mouse oocytes that spindle relocation requires a continuously reorganizing cytoplasmic actin network nucleated by Formin- 2 (Fmn 2). We found that the spindle poles were enriched in activated myosin and pulled on this network. Inhibition of myosin activation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) stopped pulling and spindle relocation, indicating that myosin pulling creates the force that drives spindle movement.

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism that delays anaphase onset and mitotic exit {{in response to}} the lack of kinetochore attachment. The target of the SAC is the E 3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC) bound to its Cdc 20 activator. The Cdc 20 /APC complex is in turn required for sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of securin, thus relieving inhibition of separase that unties sister chromatids. Separase is also involved in the Cdc-fourteen early anaphase release (FEAR) pathway of nucleolar release and activation of the Cdc 14 phosphatase, which regulates several microtubule-linked processes at the metaphase/anaphase transition and also drives mitotic exit. Here, we report that the SAC prevents separation of microtubule-organizing <b>centers</b> (<b>spindle</b> pole bodies [SPBs]) when {{spindle assembly}} is defective. Under these circumstances, failure of SAC activation causes unscheduled SPB separation, which requires Cdc 20 /APC, the FEAR pathway, cytoplasmic dynein, and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that, besides inhibiting sister chromatid separation, the SAC preserves the accurate transmission of chromosomes also by preventing SPBs to migrate far apart until the conditions to assemble a bipolar spindle are satisfied...|$|R

This extremely asymmetric division {{enables the}} oocyte to retain sufficient storage material {{for the development of}} the embryo after fertilization. To divide asymmetrically, mammalian oocytes relocate the <b>spindle</b> from their <b>center</b> to the cortex. In all mammalian species analyzed so far, including human [1], mouse [2], cow [3], pig [4], and hamster [5], spindle relocation depends on filamentous actin (F-actin). However, even though spindle relocation is essential for fertility [6], the involved F-actin structures and the mechanism by which they relocate the spindle are unknown. Here we show in live mouse oocytes that spindle relocation requires a continuously reorganizing cytoplasmic actin network nucleated by Formin- 2 (Fmn 2). We found that the spindle poles were enriched in activated myosin and pulled on this network. Inhibition of myosin activation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) stopped pulling and spindle relocation, indicating that myosin pulling creates the force that drives spindle movement. Based on these results, we propose the first mechanistic model for asymmetric spindle positioning in mammalian oocytes and validate five of its key predictions experimentally...|$|R
