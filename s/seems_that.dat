5|$|According to Marshall Hodgson, it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made {{pilgrimage to}} the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.|$|E
5|$|According to Shahbazi. the Zu'l-faqar and {{the lion}} {{decorated}} the Iranian flags at the time. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> {{towards the end}} of Fath' Ali Shah’s reign the two logos were combined and the lion representing Ali was given Ali's saber, Zu'l-faqar.|$|E

5|$|While gaunching as de Tournefort {{describes}} {{involves the}} erection of a scaffold, it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> {{in the city}} of Algiers, hooks were embedded in the city walls, and on occasion, people were thrown upon them from the battlements.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{inserted}} the entire {{text of the}} Libellus into book I of his Historia Ecclesiastica (completed ca. 731), where it makes {{up the bulk of}} chapter 27. Bede also appears to have relied upon the Libellus while writing his prose Vita Sancti Cuthberti in about the year 720. Where Bede acquired his copy of the Libellus is not known, but it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> by the early eighth century it was beginning to be read widely throughout northern England.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the Roman road, entrenchments and relics it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the earliest settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a signal station on Castle Hills just {{to the west of the}} town as part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian's Wall with Eboracum (York) ran through what is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.|$|E
5|$|Earth-based {{observations}} {{announced in}} 2005 appeared {{to show that}} Neptune's rings are much more unstable than previously thought. Images taken from the W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the Liberté arc might disappear {{in as little as}} one century.|$|E

5|$|HHT is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} by definition. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, {{which means that}} an affected person carries one abnormal gene with a 50% chance of passing this gene to offspring. Those with HHT symptoms that have no relatives with the disease may have a new mutation. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> carrying two abnormal copies of the gene is not compatible with life, and hence no homozygotes have been described.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|If Malcolm {{exercised}} {{control over}} Moray, {{which is far}} from being generally accepted, then the annals record a number of events pointing to a struggle for power in the north. In 1020, Mac Bethad's father Findláech mac Ruaidrí was killed by the sons of his brother Máel Brigte. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti took control of Moray, for his death is reported in 1029.|$|E

5|$|In Prussia, {{a reform}} in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound {{in terms of}} the Prussian foot and {{distilled}} water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.|$|E
5|$|In St. Joseph Marquis {{worked for}} various newspapers, {{including}} the St. Joseph Daily News, the St. Joseph Gazette, and the St. Joseph Herald. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> work {{was easy to}} find as many printworkers had left the city after the printworkers union achieved a closed shop.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E

5|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> {{most of the}} Romano-British {{sites were}} {{abandoned}} by the 5th century and the arable land reverted to scrub and woodland. Arriving in the 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons began to clear the land again. Bletchley ("Blaeca's clearing") and Shenley ("Bright clearing") date from this period. Large settlements have been excavated at Pennyland and near Milton Keynes Village. Their cemeteries have been found at Newport Pagnell, Shenley and Tattenhoe.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure. Instead, it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|John Horsefield died on 6 March 1854, aged 62, {{probably}} {{as a consequence}} of a strangulated hernia that had been masked by a tumour. He was buried on 10 March 1854 at the St. Mary's Church, Prestwich, although at some point in his life it <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> he had upset the authorities of the established church for reasons unknown. His table tomb was listed as a Grade II monument by English Heritage in 2012.|$|E
