25|$|One {{example of}} this would be the Yingzao Fashi printed in 1103, an {{architectural}} building manual written by an official put in charge of government agencies for construction. Artisans and craftsmen were either government-employed or worked privately. A successful and highly <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> could often gain enough capital in order to hire others as apprentices or additional laborers that could be overseen by the chief artisan as a manager. Hence, artisans could create their own small enterprises in selling their work and that of others, and like the merchants, they formed their own guilds.|$|E

When mixed-race {{children were}} sired by the master, they were frequently named after people from his family. Jefferson gave the Hemings family special treatment: the three boys while young had very light household duties. At working age, they were each apprenticed to the master carpenter of the estate, the most <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan,</b> who was also their uncle. This would provide them with skills to make a good living as free adults.|$|E

2500|$|In 1773, {{the year}} after Jefferson married the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton, her father died. She and Jefferson {{inherited}} his estate, including 11,000 acres, 135 slaves, and £4,000 of debt. With this inheritance, Jefferson became deeply involved with interracial families and financial burden. [...] As a widower, his father-in-law John Wayles had taken his mulatto slave Betty Hemings as a concubine and had six children with her during his last 12 years. The Wayles-Hemings children were three-quarters English and one-quarter African in ancestry; they were half-siblings to Martha Wayles Jefferson and her sister. Betty Hemings and her 10 mixed-race children (4 of which she had before being with Wayles) were among the slaves who were moved to Monticello. Betty's youngest child, Sally Hemings, was an infant in 1773. Betty Hemings' descendants were trained and assigned to domestic service and highly <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> positions at Monticello; none worked in the fields. Over the years, some served Jefferson directly for decades as personal valets and butlers.|$|E

2500|$|The British Army drew {{many of its}} raw {{recruits}} {{from the}} lowest classes of Britain. Since army life {{was known to be}} harsh, and the remuneration low, it attracted mainly those for whom civilian life was worse. The Duke of Wellington himself said that many of the men [...] "enlist from having got bastard children – some for minor offences – some for drink". They were, he once said, [...] "the scum of the earth; it is really wonderful that we should have made them to the fine fellows they are." [...] In Scotland however, a number of men enlisted due to the collapse of the weaving trade and came from <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> or even middle-class households. Most soldiers at the time signed on for life in exchange for a [...] "bounty" [...] of £2317s6d, a lot of which was absorbed by the cost of outfitting [...] "necessities", but a system of 'limited service' (seven years for infantry, ten for cavalry and artillery) was introduced in 1806 to attract recruits. Soldiers began, from 1800 onward, to receive a daily Beer money allowance in addition to their regular wages; the practice was started on the orders of the Duke of York. Additionally, corporal punishment was removed for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty) and the Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established in 1803, teaching skirmishing, self-reliance and initiative. Unlike other armies of the time, the British did not use conscription to bolster army numbers, with enlistment remaining voluntary.|$|E

60|$|With {{regard to}} the {{struggling}} middle-class and <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> class parent, even more than to the lower poor, does the Socialist insist upon the plain need, if only that our State and nation should continue, of endowment and help. He deems it not simply unreasonable but ridiculous that {{in a world of}} limitless resources, of vast expenditure, of unparalleled luxury, in which two-million-pound battleships and multi-millionaires are common objects, the supremely important business of rearing the bulk of the next generation of the middling sort of people should be left almost entirely to the unaided, unguided efforts of impoverished and struggling women and men. It seems to him almost beyond sanity to suppose that so things must or can continue.|$|E
6000|$|If the {{children}} of the decent <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> and middle-class suffer less obviously than the poorer sort of children, assuredly the parents in wearing anxiety, in toil and limitation and disappointment, suffer more. And in less intense and dramatic, but perhaps even more melancholy ways, {{the children}} of this class do suffer. They do not die so abundantly in infancy, but they grow up, too many of them, to shabby and limited lives; in Britain they are still, as a class, extraordinarily ill educated--many of them still go to incompetent, understaffed and ill-equipped private adventure schools--they are sent into business prematurely, often at fourteen or fifteen, they become mechanical [...] "respectable" [...] drudges in processes they do not understand. They may escape want and squalor for a while, perhaps, but they cannot escape narrowness and limitation and a cramped and anxious life. If they get to anything better than that, it is chiefly through almost heroic parental effort and sacrifice.|$|E
60|$|The plain fact is {{that the}} better middle-class parents serve the State in this matter of child-rearing, the less is their reward, the less is their security, the greater their toil and anxiety. Is it any wonder then that {{throughout}} this more comfortable but more refined and exacting class, the <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> and middle-class, there goes on something even more disastrous, {{from the point of view}} of the State, than the squalor, despair and neglect of the lower levels, and that is a very evident strike against parentage? While the very poor continue to have many children who die or grow up undersized, crippled or half-civilized, the middle mass, which can contrive with a struggle and sacrifice to rear fairly well-grown and well-equipped offspring, which has a conscience for the well-being and happiness of the young, manifests a diminishing spirit for parentage, its families fall to four, to three, to two--and in an increasing number of instances there are no children at all.|$|E

6000|$|And at {{the other}} end of the scale, also, one misses an element. There is no {{territorial}} aristocracy, no aristocracy at all, no throne, no legitimate and acknowledged representative of that upper social structure of leisure, power and State responsibility which in the old European theory of Society was supposed to give significance to the whole. The American community, one cannot too clearly insist, does not correspond to an entire European community at all, but only to the middle masses of it, to the trading and manufacturing class between the dimensions of the magnate and the clerk and <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan.</b> It is the central part of the European organism without either the dreaming head or the subjugated feet. Even the highly feudal slave-holding [...] "county family" [...] traditions of Virginia and the South pass now out of memory. So that in a very real sense the past of the American nation is in Europe, and the settled order of the past is left behind there. This community was, as it were, taken off its roots, clipped of its branches, and brought hither. It began neither serf nor lord, but burgher and farmer; it followed the normal development of the middle class under Progress everywhere and became capitalistic. The huge later immigration has converged upon the great industrial centres and added merely a vast non-servile element of employees to the scheme.|$|E
6000|$|But when we {{contrast}} {{the state of}} man in {{the opening of the}} twentieth century with the condition of any previous period in his history, then perhaps we may begin to understand something of that blind confidence. It was not so much a reasoned confidence as the inevitable consequence of sustained good fortune. By such standards as they possessed, things HAD gone amazingly well for them. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say {{that for the first time}} in history whole populations found themselves regularly supplied with more than enough to eat, and the vital statistics of the time witness to an amelioration of hygienic conditions rapid beyond all precedent, and to a vast development of intelligence and ability in all the arts that make life wholesome. The level and quality of the average education had risen tremendously; and at the dawn of the twentieth century comparatively few people in Western Europe or America were unable to read or write. Never before had there been such reading masses. There was wide social security. A common man might travel safely over three-quarters of the habitable globe, could go round the earth at a cost of less than the annual earnings of a <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan.</b> Compared with the liberality and comfort of the ordinary life of the time, the order of the Roman Empire under the Antonines was local and limited.

Beginning with a fair show of justice on either side, the masters stultified their cause by obstinate impolicy, and the men disgraced their order by acts of outrage. 'On Wednesday last,' writes Fleeming, 'about three thousand banded round Fairbairn's door at 6 o'clock: men, women, and children, factory boys and girls, the lowest of the low in a very low place. Orders came that no one was to leave the works; but the men inside (Knobsticks, as they are called) were precious hungry and thought they would venture. Two of my companions and myself went out with the very first, and had the full benefit of every possible groan and bad language.' But the police cleared a lane through the crowd, the pupils were suffered to escape unhurt, and only the Knobsticks followed home and kicked with clogs; so that Fleeming enjoyed, as we may say, for nothing, that fine thrill of expectant valour with which he had sallied forth into the mob.

6000|$|... “Perhaps I shall here be asked, How, if {{the case}} be so—if the high [...] rate of {{industrial}} remuneration in America be only evidence of a [...] low cost of production—the fact is to be explained, since fact it [...] undoubtedly is, {{that the people of}} the United States are unable to [...] compete in neutral markets, in the sale of certain important [...] wares, with England and other European countries?(367) No one will [...] say that the people of New England, New York, and Pennsylvania, [...] are deficient in any industrial qualities possessed by the workmen [...] of any country in the world. How happens it, then, that, enjoying [...] industrial advantages superior to other countries, they are yet [...] unable to hold their own against them in the general markets of [...] commerce? I shall endeavor to meet this objection fairly, and, in [...] the first place, let me state what my contention is with regard to [...] the cost of production in America. I do not contend that it is low [...] in the case of all commodities capable of being produced in the [...] country, but only in that of a large, very important, but still [...] limited group. With regard to commodities lying outside this [...] group, I hold that the rate of wages is simply no evidence as to [...] the cost of their production, one way or the other. But, secondly, [...] I beg the reader to consider what is meant by the alleged [...] ‘inability’ of New England and Pennsylvania to compete, let us [...] say, with Manchester and Sheffield, in the manufacture of calico [...] and cutlery. What it means, and what it only can mean, is that [...] they are unable to do so consistently with obtaining that rate of [...] remuneration on their industry which is current in the United [...] States. If only American laborers and capitalists would be [...] content with the wages and profits current in Great Britain, there [...] is nothing that I know of to prevent them from holding their own [...] in any markets to which Manchester and Sheffield can send their [...] wares. And this brings us {{to the heart of the}} question. Over a [...] large portion of the great field of industry the people of the [...] United States enjoy, as compared with those of Europe, (1) [...] advantages of a very exceptional kind; over the rest (2) the [...] advantage is less decided, or (3) they stand on a par with [...] Europeans, or (4) possibly they are, in some instances, at a [...] disadvantage. Engaging in the branches of industry in which their [...] advantage over Europe is great, they reap industrial returns [...] proportionally great; and, so long as they confine themselves to [...] these occupations, they can compete in neutral markets against all [...] the world, and still secure the high rewards accruing from their [...] exceptionally rich resources. But the people of the Union decline [...] to confine themselves within these liberal bounds. They would [...] cover the whole domain of industrial activity, and think it hard [...] that they should not reap the same rich harvests from every part [...] of the field. They must descend into the arena with Sheffield and [...] Manchester, and yet secure the rewards of Chicago and St. Louis. [...] They must employ European conditions of production, and obtain [...] American results. What is this but to quarrel with the laws of [...] nature? These laws have assigned to an extensive range of [...] industries carried on in the United States a high scale of return, [...] far in excess of what Europe can command, to a few others a return [...] on a scale not exceeding the European proportion. American [...] enterprise would engage in all departments alike, and obtain upon [...] all the high rewards which nature has assigned only to some. Here [...] we find the real meaning of the ‘inability’ of Americans to [...] compete with the ‘pauper labor’ of Europe. They can not do so, and [...] at the same time secure the American rate of return on their work. [...] The inability no doubt exists, but it is one created, not by the [...] drawbacks, but by the exceptional advantages of their position. It [...] is as if a <b>skilled</b> <b>artisan</b> should complain that he could not [...] compete with the hedger and ditcher. Let him only be content with [...] the hedger and ditcher’s rate of pay, and there will be nothing to [...] prevent him from entering the lists even against this rival.”(368) ...|$|E
