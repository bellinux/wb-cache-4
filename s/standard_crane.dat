40|$|Cranes {{are widely}} used in material-handling and {{transportation}} applications, e. g. in shipyards, construction sites, and warehouses. As they are critical to the economic vitality of modern-day industries, improving crane performance {{and ease of use}} are important contributors to industrial productivity, low production costs, and workplace safety. In a typical crane operation, a payload is lifted, moved to its destination, and then lowered into place. This dissertation aims to improve crane performance and reduce task difficulty for the human operator in the movements mentioned above, namely: 1) Moving payloads laterally in the horizontal plane, 2) Lifting payloads off the ground, and 3) Lowering or laying down payloads on the ground. The design of a novel and intuitive human-machine control interface is the focus for improving operations that involve moving payloads laterally. The interface allows operators to drive a crane by simply moving a hand-held device through the desired path. The position of the device, which is tracked by sensors, is used to generate command signals to drive the crane. This command is then input-shaped such that payload oscillations are greatly reduced, making it much easier for the operator to drive the crane. Several facets of this crane control method are examined, such as control structure and stability, usability contexts, modes of operation, and quantitative measures (by means of human operator studies) of performance improvements over <b>standard</b> <b>crane</b> control interfaces. Lifting up a payload can be difficult for the operator, if the hoist is not properly centered above the payload. In these potentially dangerous and costly ``off-centered" lifts, the payload may slide on the ground and/or oscillate in the air after it is hoisted. Newtonian and Coulomb friction models that focus on the stiction-sliding-separation contact dynamics are derived and experimentally verified to study off-centered lifts. Then, with the goal of aiding operators during lift operations, simple but practical, self-centering solutions are proposed and implemented. Laying down or lowering a payload to the ground can also be challenging for operators in certain situations. For example, laying down a long, slender payload from a vertical orientation in the air, to a horizontal position on a flat surface. If the operator does not properly coordinate the motions of the crane in the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously, then the potential hazards that may occur during these operations include: 1) slipping of the pivot about which the payload rotates, leading to sudden and dangerous payload movements; and 2) excessive hoist cable angles that lead to ``side-pull" problems. Newtonian and Coulomb friction models are derived to describe this lay-down scenario. The forces and motions experienced by the payload are then used to determine the motion trajectories that the crane and payload should follow to execute a successful lay-down maneuver. Finally, a special chapter is included to address the oscillation control of systems that have on-off nonlinear actuators, such as cranes powered by relay-controlled circuits. Due to their simplicity, ruggedness, and long service life, this type of crane can be commonly found in older factories or in applications where precise motion control is not a strict requirement. However, controlling payload oscillations on this type of crane is challenging for two reasons: 1) Relays that can only be turned on or off allow for only limited control over the crane velocity; and 2) These cranes typically have nonlinear asymmetrical acceleration and deceleration properties. Methods are derived for determining the relay switch-times that move single-pendulum and double-pendulum payloads with low residual oscillations. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{overhead}} traveling bridge cranes in many varied applications {{is common}} practice. In particular, {{the use of}} cranes in the nuclear, military, commercial, aerospace, and other industries can involve safety critical situations. Considerations for Human Injury or Casualty, Loss of Assets, Endangering the Environment, or Economic Reduction must be addressed. Traditionally, {{in order to achieve}} additional safety in these applications, mechanical systems have been augmented with a variety of devices. These devices assure that a mechanical component failure shall reduce the risk of a catastrophic loss of the correct and/or safe load carrying capability. ASME NOG- 1 - 1998, (Rules for Construction of Overhead and Gantry Cranes, Top Running Bridge, and Multiple Girder), provides design <b>standards</b> for <b>cranes</b> in safety critical areas. Over and above the minimum safety requirements of todays design standards, users struggle with obtaining a higher degree of reliability through more precise functional specifications while attempting to provide "smart" safety systems. Electrical control systems also may be equipped with protective devices similar to the mechanical design features. Demands for improvement of the cranes "control system" is often recognized, but difficult to quantify for this traditionally "mechanically" oriented market. Finite details for each operation must be examined and understood. As an example, load drift (or small motions) at close tolerances can be unacceptable (and considered critical). To meet these high functional demands encoders and other devices are independently added to control systems to provide motion and velocity feedback to the control drive. This paper will examine the implementation of Programmable Electronic Systems (PES). PES is a term this paper will use to describe any control system utilizing any programmable electronic device such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), or an Adjustable Frequency Drive (AID) 'smart' programmable motion controller.

40|$|When {{suspended}} payloads {{are moved}} in a material handling environment pendulum like oscillations are naturally introduced. This presents a problem any time especially when expensive and/or delicate objects are moved. In a steel industry environment objects have {{to be placed in}} tight locations after finishing up of rolling. Typically an object (rolled coil) is lifted by a hook {{on the end of a}} cable, creating pendulum that is free to swing in a transit condition. This swinging motion makes remote positioning of casks and barrels difficult to control precisely which is potentially destructive to facility equipment and to other storage containers. Typically, a crane operator moves objects slowly to minimize induced swinging and allow time for oscillation to dampen, maintaining safety but greatly decreasing the efficiency of operations. By employing proper algorithm or by the choice of proper drive it is possible to dampen the oscillations predictive called residual vibration[1]. Using damped-oscillation control algorithm [2] is one method of solving this problem. Residual vibrations resulting from the motion of the crane can not only be expensive to deal with but also dangerous. <b>Standard</b> practice in <b>crane</b> operation is to allow the pendulum swing to die out before working with the moved object.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{safety of}} {{construction}} workers who toil {{in close proximity}} to cranes garnered congressional attention after tower cranes were involved in multiple fatalities at buildings under construction in 2008 (e. g., nine deaths in two incidents in New York City). Additional crane-related fatalities occurred since the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing on construction worker safety in June 2008, including four employees of a Louisiana-based construction firm who died when the contractor’s mobile crane fell at a Houston refinery. Construction historically has been the most hazardous industry as measured by number of fatalities. With 1, 178 out of 4, 956 on-the-job fatalities in the private sector in 2007, no other industry ranks higher than construction. The majority of construction deaths usually result from falls and transportation accidents (e. g., 38 % and 24 %, respectively, in 2007), according to the classification system of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. In contrast, most construction fatalities involving cranes are caused by contact with objects and equipment (e. g., struck by a falling crane). In 2007, contact with objects and equipment accounted for 71 % of crane-related deaths of workers in the construction industry. An analysis of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) files of construction fatalities involving cranes most frequently found violations of the following federal construction safety standard: 29 CFR 1926 Subpart N — Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevators and Escalators. OSHA’s <b>crane</b> and derrick <b>standard</b> has been virtually unchanged since its promulgation in 1971. In a July 2002 notice of intent to create a negotiated rulemaking committee, OSHA acknowledged that industry consensus standards had been updated and crane technology had changed considerably over three decades. The Crane and Derrick Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee voted favorably on an extensive revision to the standard in July 2004 and submitted draft regulatory language to OSHA at that time. After slowly proceeding through the rulemaking process, OSHA submitted a draft proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2008. OMB completed its review on August 28, 2008. Even if OSHA publishes a notice of proposed rule making in early fall, comments of OSHA administrator Foulke at the Education and Labor Committee hearing suggest an updated <b>crane</b> <b>standard</b> is unlikely to become final before the end of 2008. Although most of the 21 states that operate their own safety and health programs for private sector workers have adopted OSHA’s standards, some have developed more stringent regulations for specific hazards in certain industries. For example, many of these states require certification of crane operators: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Utah, and Washington (in 2010). To protect the safety and property of their residents, other jurisdictions have promulgated regulations requiring certification of crane operators as well: Massachusetts, Montana, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Washington, D.

40|$|STS cranes (Ship-to-Shore cranes) are {{designed}} for a finite fatigue life, but it is often preferred by the terminal operators to keep the crane in operation once the design fatigue life has expired. When the crane is operated after it reached its expected service life, the risk of fatigue failure increases. Therefore the structural lifetime of the crane needs to be assessed in order to enable operation of the crane after it reaches its design fatigue life without compromising safety. Methods to assess the remaining fatigue life in industries like offshore and aviation are stan- dardized, but for cranes such methods do not exist. Therefore an assessment method for {{the structure of the}} crane needs to be put forward. The assessment method should be able to calculate the remaining lifetime of the crane and determine whether inspection of the crane is necessary (and if so, how long the intervals should be). After inspections are completed, the method should determine whether repair works need to be performed to ensure the structural integrity of the crane. The main research question of this thesis is formulated as follows: What is the most appropriate method to assess the remaining fatigue life of steel structures of existing STS cranes? To determine which type of fatigue assessment methods can be applied to STS cranes, a review of assessment methods for STS cranes, bridges, aircraft and offshore structures is performed. The method that is selected when the crane is operated within its design fatigue life is the calculation procedure for fatigue used in the design stage, because this means that the remaining fatigue life can be determined using information that is already available. When the crane is operated outside its design limits, a crack growth model is used to calculate the remaining fatigue life. The steel structure of a general STS crane consists of four main components; bolted con- nections, pinned connections, welded connections and base material. It is determined that the majority of fatigue failures in steel structures occurs at welds, fatigue cracks in the base material contribute slightly and the amount of fatigue failures of bolted and pinned connec- tions is negligible. The fatigue assessment model therefore only considers cracks in the base material and in welds. The components at the connections at the forestay and backstay, the connections between the crane boom and the portal beams as well as the connections at the legs are even more susceptible to fatigue failure because these areas are subjected to relatively large fluctuating loads. In order to determine the remaining fatigue life of the crane, the crack size which will cause failure needs to be known. This critical crack size depends on the geometry of the detail under consideration, the used material and the stress at that detail. This means that the critical crack size is not constant across the steel structure of a general STS crane. When the critical crack size is known, the crack growth rate needs to be calculated {{in order to determine the}} time between crack initiation and failure. The structure needs to be checked for cracks before a member is expected to fail. Therefore the value for the remaining fatigue life is used to schedule inspections as well. The inspection interval depends on the crack size which can be determined with sufficient reliability, which in turn depends on the type of inspection method that is deployed. In case cracks are found during inspections, repair methods are available to extend the re- maining fatigue life of the crane. The methods that can be used to repair cracks in steel structures of STS cranes are the gouge-and-weld method, mounting doubler plates, drilling crack arrest holes and modifying the structure. The selection of the repair method is based on the remaining fatigue life of the structure, the location of the crack and potential earlier fatigue crack repair works. The most appropriate method to assess the remaining fatigue life of the crane therefore consists of an inspection schedule, where the inspection intervals are determined based on the remaining fatigue life. When the crane is operated within its design limits, the inspection intervals are based on the safety factors for fatigue as defined in the EN 13001 design <b>standard</b> for <b>cranes.</b> When the crane is operated after its design fatigue life is expired, the remaining fatigue life is calculated using a crack growth model. The inspection methods that are used to inspect the crane are determined based on the value for the critical crack size and the crack size which can be accurately determined by the inspection methods. When the remaining fatigue life is insufficient, repair works are scheduled to repair the crack and thus extend the fatigue life of the crane. The repair methods are selected based on the type of crack (cracks at the surface or internal cracks) and its location. This method is repeated until it is not economically feasible to further extend the fatigue life of the crane.

A hand calculation model, based on the analysis of built-up compression members in EN 1993 - 1 - 1, has been developed that describes the behaviour of a portal like gantry structure. The model executes geometrically non-linear calculations, that {{take into account the}} second order effects from the deformation of the gantry, and determines the resistance of the gantry based on the axial forces in its chords and on stability checks. Three different mast sections, out of which the gantry columns are made, have been investigated: MSG, DS and NYW. The latter is currently under developed by Mammoet and is called a New York Wheel mast section. The focus is on the application of this section type. The gantry in the model is subject to a vertical load from the self-weight of the mast sections, a vertical load from the weight of the payload and a horizontal point load {{at the top of the}} gantry. The latter accounts for operational loads and wind loads on both the structure and the payload. In the model the horizontal load is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the payload. The resistances obtained from the hand calculation model are within 5 % of the resistances obtained from a numerical benchmark model, for the gantry configurations considered. Therefore, the model is considered accurate enough for a preliminary design. It is able to represent a rigid and a flexible foundations, as well as a hinged and a rigid connection between the columns and beam(s) of the gantry. From the calculations with the hand calculation model several conclusions were drawn. The horizontal load is of large influence for the maximum payload, much larger than the influence of the global imperfection. The difference can easily be between 10 -to- 30 % for the NYW mast sections, between 2 % and 4 % horizontal load. Also, the influence is larger for a gantry with a rigid beam-column connection than for a hinged connection. Calculating with a different imperfection, for example no imperfection instead of 1 / 250 of the gantry height, result in a 6 -to- 10 % resistance difference. The resistance of a gantry with a rigid connection at the top is considerably larger than for a hinged connection, for an asymmetric section like the NYW mast sections. A rigid connection yields a 1. 5 to 4 times higher resistance than a hinged connection, when NYW sections are used on a rigid foundation. The resistance for the three mast section types under consideration has been compared for a rigid foundation. It turns out that for both a hinged and a rigid beam-column connection the NYW sections can bear the highest payload, by far. The resistance to tensile forces, mostly governed by the strength of the connections, is much lower for the MSG sections than for the DS sections. Also, a rigid connection significantly improves the asymmetrical DS sections. For relevant gantry heights the MSG sections can bear a payload that is roughly 50 % of the payload that the DS sections can carry, for a hinged top connection. For a rigid connection it is around 30 %. The DS sections can carry 15 -to- 25 % of the load the NYW sections can carry, for a hinged connection. For a rigid connection it is 25 -to- 35 %. The stiffness of the foundation has been modelled with the method of Pais and Kausel (1988). It appeared that the stiffness of the foundation can have a significant influence on the resistance of the gantry. The MSG sections are more susceptible to a flexible foundation, because of their relatively small base frame. This results in a much smaller rotational stiffness at the bottom of the gantry columns. A foundation on dense sand leads to a resistance decrease around 5 % for the NYW sections and around 35 % for the MSG sections. One of the goals of this thesis was to incorporate the use of guy lines into the model and to investigate their influence on stability, stiffness and ultimately resistance. A preliminary study showed great potential for the use of guy lines. The buckling length can be reduced by around 50 %, almost to the point where a column with a fixed end at the top is resembled. Also, the first order deflection can be reduced significantly, as over 75 % of the horizontal load is taken by the guy lines. This means that the second order effects are drastically reduced. The reduction also has a positive effect on the first order bending moments in the column. A guy line that is installed under a 60 degree angle with the foundation turns out to be effective in both supporting the column and minimizing the gantry footprint. The behaviour of guy lines is highly non-linear. Therefore, it was found challenging to incorporate them in the final hand calculation model accurately. However, the evidence from the preliminary design leads to the recommendation to further investigate the application of guy lines. Several standards have been studied for the design of the gantry. It was concluded that the European <b>crane</b> <b>standard</b> EN 13001 - 1 is best suited to take into account the loads on the structure and that the structural behaviour of the gantry is best described using the European building standard EN 1993 - 1 - 1. The global imperfection of the gantry is a parameter of interest. Mammoet wants to calculate with an imperfection that equals one thousandth of the height of the gantry, since they believe their gantries can be erected with such high precision. The standards under consideration prescribe a larger imperfection, typically 1 / 500. The fabrication and erection tolerances are however much tighter for the mast sections than provided by the standards. Therefore, a smaller imperfection (1 / 1000) can be justified, except for very tall gantries and gantries in storm conditions. The horizontal load on the gantry varies between 2. 5 % and 4 % of the weight of the payload, depending on the direction, the weight of the payload and whether or not skidding of the load is involved. A larger portion of the horizontal load comes from wind loads, of which the load on the object to be lifted is a substantial part. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the wind load.
