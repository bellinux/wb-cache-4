40|$|Abstract. 3 K {{type and}} 2 K- 2 H <b>type</b> {{planetary}} <b>gear</b> trains {{can be designed}} to have high reduction ratios. Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K <b>type</b> planetary <b>gear</b> reducer only contain two ring gears and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H <b>type</b> planetary <b>gear</b> reducers. Also, in general, the gear reducers with high reduction ratio are compound gear system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K <b>type</b> planetary simple <b>gear</b> reducers with high reduction ratios. Based on the concept of train value equation, the kinematic design of 2 K <b>type</b> planetary <b>gear</b> trains with high reduction ratio are synthesized. Six 2 K <b>type</b> planetary <b>gear</b> reducers are designed to illustrate the kinematic design process. Three of the examples are 2 K <b>type</b> planetary <b>gear</b> reducers with simple planet gears. For the 2 K <b>type</b> planetary simple <b>gear</b> reducer, there is a problem that is the simple planet gear engages to two ring gears with different tooth number. One example is used to illustrate how to design the two ring gears with different shift coefficient to engage the same planet gear.
