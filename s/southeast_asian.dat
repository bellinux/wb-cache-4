5|$|Malagasy cuisine {{encompasses}} the many diverse culinary {{traditions of the}} Indian Ocean island of Madagascar. Foods eaten in Madagascar reflect the influence of <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asian,</b> African, Indian, Chinese and European migrants that have settled on the island since it was first populated by seafarers from Borneo between 100 CE and 500 CE. Rice, {{the cornerstone of the}} Malagasy diet, was cultivated alongside tubers and other <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asian</b> staples by these earliest settlers. Their diet was supplemented by foraging and hunting wild game, which contributed to the extinction of the island's bird and mammal megafauna. These food sources were later complemented by beef in the form of zebu introduced into Madagascar by East African migrants arriving around 1,000CE. Trade with Arab and Indian merchants and European transatlantic traders further enriched the island's culinary traditions by introducing a wealth of new fruits, vegetables, and seasonings.|$|E

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease {{more prevalent in}} people of African and Asian origin than Caucasian origin. FcgammaRIIb is an inhibitory Fc receptor with {{a critical role in}} immune regulation. Mouse data suggest that FcgammaRIIb deficiency increases susceptibility to autoimmune disease but protects against infection. We show that a SNP in human FCGR 2 B that abrogates receptor function is strongly associated with susceptibility to SLE in both Caucasians and <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asians.</b> The minor allele of this SNP is more common in <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asians</b> and Africans, populations from areas where malaria is endemic, than in Caucasians. We show that homozygosity for the minor allele is associated with substantial protection against severe malaria in an East African population (odds ratio = 0. 56; P = 7. 1 x 10 (- 5)). This protective effect against malaria may contribute to the higher frequency of this SNP and hence, SLE in Africans and <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asians...</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} 'Two Layer' hypothesis {{is whether or}} not the evolutionary process truly involved the Australo-Melanesians. Archaeologists such as Matsumura suggest Southern Chinese people comprised the initial population of Southeast Asia, rather than Australo-Melanesians while researchers such as Turner argue that prehistoric <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asians</b> did not mix with either racial group.Though the early prehistoric Vietnamese and Malaysians both resembled the Australo-Melanesian samples the most, the Màn Bạc people had a greater resemblance to the Đông Sơn samples dating back to the Iron Age. Analyzing cranial and dental remains, Matsumura concluded based on chronological differences that the Man Bac people were immigrants affiliated with peoples near the Yangtze River region in Southern China. Molecular anthropologists have used classical genetic markers and mtDNA to analyze the similarities between early Chinese and <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asians.</b> Such genetic markers suggest the genetic layout of Southern Chinese peoples is quite similar to that of <b>Southeast</b> <b>Asians.</b>|$|R
