The system installed at the University of Melbourne used a serial communications network, connecting campus buildings back to a control room [...] "front end" [...] system {{in the basement of}} the Old Geology building. Each remote or Satellite Intelligence Unit (SIU) ran 2 Z80 microprocessors whilst the front end ran eleven Z80's in a Parallel Processing configuration with paged common memory. The z80 microprocessors shared the load by passing tasks to each other via the common memory and the communications network. This was possibly the first successful implementation of a distributed processing direct digital control system.|$|E
50|$|Distance {{measuring}} equipment (DME) provides pilots with a slant range measurement of {{distance to the}} runway in nautical miles. DMEs are augmenting or replacing markers in many installations. The DME provides more accurate and continuous monitoring of correct progress on the ILS glide slope to the pilot, and does not require an installation outside the airport boundary. When {{used in conjunction with}} an ILS, the DME is often sited midway between the reciprocal runway thresholds with the internal delay modified so that one unit can provide distance information to either runway threshold. For approaches where a DME is specified in lieu of marker beacons, DME Required is noted on the Instrument Approach Procedure and the aircraft must have at least one operating DME unit, or an IFR approved GPS system (an RNAV <b>system</b> <b>meeting</b> TSO-C129/ -C145/-C146), to begin the approach.|$|E

The military occupation was converted into full ownership at the Peace of Augsburg.The city quickly became the administrative center of all of Sweden's German possessions when the Royal Swedish Tribunal {{was set up in}} the Fürstenhof. This necessitated a build up of Wismar's fortifications, an operation that Field Marshal Erik Dahlbergh was appointed to lead. The result was completely self-contained fortifications with bulwarks as an effective all-round defence system - a <b>system</b> <b>meeting</b> the most modern requirements was thus refined to great efficiency. Remains of these fortifications have been preserved, among other places, in the ‘Lindengarten' to the east of the wall of the old city.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{a member}} of The Clique, which also {{included}} Richard Dadd. The principal influence on his work was the hugely popular domestic subjects painted by Sir David Wilkie. Wilkie's famous painting The Chelsea Pensioners was a spur to the creation of Frith's own most famous compositions. Following the precedent of Wilkie, but also imitating the work of his friend Dickens, Frith created complex multi-figure compositions depicting the full range of the Victorian class <b>system,</b> <b>meeting</b> and interacting in public places. In Ramsgate Sands, Life at the Seaside (1854) he depicted visitors and entertainers at the seaside resort. He followed this with The Derby Day, depicting scenes among the crowd at the race at Epsom Downs, which was based on photographic studies by Robert Howlett. This 1858 composition was bought by Jacob Bell for £1,500. It was so popular {{that it had to be}} protected by a specially installed rail when shown at the Royal Academy of Arts. Another well-known painting was The Railway Station, a scene of Paddington station. In 1865 he was chosen to paint the Marriage of the Prince of Wales.His 1858 painting The Crossing Sweeper has been described as breaking [...] "new ground in its description of the collision of wealth and poverty on a London street." ...|$|E
5000|$|Compared {{to the end}} of {{the first}} World War, the United States was even more {{powerful}} in 1945 following the conclusion of the second World War. The nation possessed a preponderance of military power and close to half of the world's wealth. Once again, leaders from the United States attempted to leverage this powerful position and create a stable order that would serve to benefit their nation for decades to come. Political and economic openness was the centerpiece of this envisioned framework. It was believed that the closed economic regions which had existed before the war had led to worldwide depression and at least in part contributed to the start of the conflict. Reconstructing a stable Europe was also a priority, as safeguarding American interests was seen as being rooted in European stability. The region also became a staging ground for the Cold War, and building a strong West Germany was seen as an important step in balancing against the Soviet Union. In the end, the United States created its desired order through a series of security, economic, and financial multilateral institutions, including NATO and the Marshall Plan. West Germany was bound to its democratic Western European neighbors through the European and Coal and Steel Community (later, the European Communities) and to the United States through Atlantic security pact; Japan was abound to the United States through an alliance partnership and expanding economic ties. The Bretton Woods <b>system</b> <b>meeting</b> in 1944 laid down the monetary and trade rules that facilitated the opening and subsequent flourishing of the world economy. In institutionalizing its power, the United States was willing to act as a [...] "reluctant superpower," [...] making concessions to weaker states in order to ensure their participation in their desired framework.|$|E
