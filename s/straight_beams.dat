All patients were preoperatively assessed by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), maximum flow rate (Qmax), post-void residual urine (PVR), prostate-specific antigen level, and prostate volume measurement. Perioperative parameters and complications were recorded. Patients were reassessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12  months postoperatively. PVRP resulted in a significant improvement of IPSS, Qmax, and PVR. Mean operative time was 48.3  ±  14.4  min. A significant improvement for PVRP was achieved regarding the catheter indwelling and hospital stay time. No severe perioperative complications were recorded. No requiring blood transfusion in all patients. Capsule perforation was observed in four patients in the group.
