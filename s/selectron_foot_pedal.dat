40|$|Fifty years ago, NASA {{decided that}} the cockpit {{controls}} in spacecraft should be like the ones in airplanes.

A different method is based on submersible vehicles controlled with <b>foot</b> <b>pedals.</b> A new pilot can learn the sub's control scheme in minutes and drive it hands-free. We are building a pair of <b>foot</b> <b>pedals</b> for spacecraft control, and will test them in a spacecraft flight simulator...|$|R
