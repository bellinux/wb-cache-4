25|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} and vaginal prolapse {{are well}} known adverse effects that develop with high frequency {{a very long time}} after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery. For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for urinary incontinence is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> following hysterectomy.|$|E

50|$|In women, {{physical}} changes resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause often contribute to <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence.</b> <b>Stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> can worsen {{during the week}} before the menstrual period.

The incidence of <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> increases following menopause, similarly because of lowered estrogen levels. In female high-level athletes, effort incontinence occurs in all sports involving abrupt repeated increases in intra-abdominal pressure that may exceed perineal floor resistance.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> {{in women}} {{results from the}} urethra {{dropping}} down toward the vagina. Therefore, common surgery for <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence</b> involves pulling the urethra up to a more normal position. Working through an incision in the vagina or abdomen, the surgeon raises the urethra and secures it with a string attached to muscle, ligament, or bone. For severe cases of <b>stress</b> <b>incontinence,</b> the surgeon may secure the urethra with a wide sling. This not only holds up the bladder but also compresses {{the bottom of the}} bladder and the top of the urethra, further preventing leakage.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{quantified}} {{and described}} the economic burden of overactive bladder and <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> in Korea. We calculated direct costs by identifying public and private data sources that contain population-based data on resource utilization by patients with <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> and overactive bladder. Methods: For estimating indirect costs (productivity loss), the human capital approach was applied. Data were collected from several institutes, including the Health Insurance Review Agency. Results: The estimated total economic cost in treating overactive bladder was 117 billion Korean Won (KRW, the currency of South Koea) in 2006 and 145 billion KRW in 2007. The estimated total cost in treating <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> was 122 billion KRW in 2006 and 59 billion KRW in 2007. Conclusions: By quantifying the total economic costs of overactive bladder and <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence,</b> this study provides an important perspective in Korea. Because {{the average age of}} the Korean population is rapidly increasing, this study provides important information on the direct and indirect costs of overactive bladder and <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> for an aging society...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to educate allied health {{professionals}} and female athletes of the anatomy of the pelvic floor, and the pathology, etiology, and prevalence of <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> in female athletes. Background: Urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening or dangerous condition, but it is socially embarrassing, may cause the individual to remove herself from social situations, and decrease quality of life. While typically associated with parous women who had vaginal delivery, research has shown prevalence of the condition in physically active women of all ages. <b>Stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> has shown to lead to withdrawal from participation in high-impact activities such as gymnastics, aerobics, and running. It may be considered a barrier for life-long athletics participation in women.

40|$|Pelvic organ {{prolapse}} and <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> {{are common}} conditions for which approximately 11 % of women will undergo surgical intervention in their lifetime. The use of vaginal mesh for pelvic organ prolapse and <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> rose {{rapidly in the}} early 2000 s as over 100 mesh products were introduced into the clinical armamentarium with little regulatory oversight for their use. US Food and Drug Administration Public Health Notifications in 2008 and 2011, as well as reclassification of transvaginal mesh for prolapse to class III in early 2016, were a response to debilitating complications associated with transvaginal mesh placement in many women. The midurethral sling has not been {{subject to the same}} reclassification and continues to be endorsed as the “gold standard” for surgical management of <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> by subspecialty societies. However, litigators have not differentiated between mesh for prolapse and mesh for incontinence. As such, all mesh, including that placed for <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence,</b> faces continued controversy amidst an uncertain future.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of Kegel exercises on reducing urinary incontinence symptoms in women with <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted on females with <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> who had done Kegel exercises and met inclusion criteria in articles published between 1966 and 2012. The articles from periodicals indexed in KoreaMed, NDSL, Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, and other databases were selected, using key terms such as “Kegel” or “pelvic floor exercise. ” Cochrane’s risk of bias was applied to assess the internal validity of the RCTs. Eleven selected studies were analyzed by meta-analysis using RevMan 5. 1. Results. Eleven trials involving 510 women met the inclusion criteria. All trials contributed data to one or more of the main or secondary outcomes. They indicated that Kegel exercises significantly reduced the urinary incontinence symptoms of female <b>stress</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> There was no heterogeneity in the selected studies except the standardized bladder volumes of the pad test.
