50|$|The output {{transformer}} sits between the power valves and the speaker, serving to match impedance. When a transformer's ferromagnetic core becomes electromagnetically saturated {{a loss of}} inductance takes place, since the back E.M.F. is reliant on a change in flux in the core. As the core reaches saturation,the flux levels off and cannot increase any further. With no change in flux there is no back E.M.F. and hence no reflected impedance. The transformer and valve combination then generate large 3rd order harmonics. So long as the core does not go into saturation, the valves will clip naturally as they drop the available voltage across them. In <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> systems the <b>output</b> harmonics will be largely even ordered due to the valve's relatively non linear characteristics at large signal swings. This is only true however if the magnetic core does NOT saturate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} a novel low-voltage class-AB operational amplifier (opamp) based on dynamic threshold voltage MOS transistors (DTMOS). A DTMOS tran-sistor is a device whose gate {{is tied to}} its bulk. DTMOS tran-sistor pseudo-pMOS differential input pairs are used for input common-mode range enhancement, followed by a <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> class-AB <b>output.</b> Two versions of the proposed opamp (opamp-A and opamp-B) were fabricated in a standard 0. 18 - m CMOS process technology. Measurements under 5 pF and 10 k load conditions gave, for opamp-A, a DC open-loop gain of 50. 1 dB, and a unity gain bandwidth (GBW) of 26. 2 MHz. A common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 78 dB, and input and output swings of 0. 7 V and 0. 9 V, respectively, were achieved. Opamp-B has been optimized for biomedical applications, and is implemented to build the analog front-end part of a near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS) receiver of a multi-wavelength wireless brain oxymeter apparatus. A DC open-loop gain of 53 dB, a GBW of 1. 3 MHz, and input and output swings of 0. 6 V and 0. 8 V, respectively, were measured. Opamp-A consumes 550 W with an input referred noise of 160 nV Hz at 1 kHz. Opamp-B consumes only 40 W and exhibits a lower input referred noise of 107 nV Hz at 1 kHz.

The X-Y plane is divided by non linear {{boundaries}} into zones {{in order to}} generate the digital output for each analog (x,y) location.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{molecular}} beam epitaxial growth and characterization of InAs/GaInSb/InAs/AlGaAsSb type-II miniband-to-bound state W-lasers. Laser core structures were characterized using photoluminescence, high resolution X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy {{to reveal the}} best growth conditions. The growth temperature for the laser core was varied in the range between 380 deg C and 460 deg C and found to be optimal at 420 deg C. Optimized laser active regions were embedded between 600 nm AlGaAsSb separate confinement layers which in turn were sandwiched between 1. 5 µm thick n- and p-doped Al(0. 85) Ga(0. 15) As(0. 07) Sb(0. 93) cladding layers. The upper cladding was capped with a 100 nm p(exp +) -GaSb contact layer. The growth temperature of the upper separate confinement and cladding layer was varied between 470 deg C and 530 deg C to reveal the influence on laser performance.

40|$|Two {{different}} frequency doubling {{power amplifier}} topologies have been compared, one with differential input {{and one with}} single-ended, both with single-ended output at 60 GHz. The frequency doubling capability is valuable from at least two perspectives, 1) the high frequency signal is on the chip {{as little as possible}} 2) the voltage controlled oscillator and power amplifier are at different frequencies easing the isolation of the two in a transceiver. The topologies have been simulated in a 1 p 8 M 130 -nm CMOS process. The resonant nodes are tuned with on-chip transmission lines. These have been simulated in ADS and compared to a standard Cadence component, tline 3. The Cadence component gives a somewhat pessimistic estimation of the losses in the transmission line.

Ranchero systems consist of series-parallel combinations of simultaneously initiated coaxial magnetic flux compression generators, and {{are intended to}} operate in the range from 50 MA to a few hundred MA currents. One example of a Ranchero system is shown here. The coaxial modules lend themselves to extracting the current output either from one end or along the generator midplane.

40|$|T/R modules {{suitable}} for spaceborne SAR instruments have to fulfil very strong requirements {{given by the}} challenging environmental and electrical conditions in space. This paper shows that the HBT (Heterojunction-Bipolar-Transistor) technology is able to meet these requirements for future SAR systems. For this application a separate breadboard Tx-chain {{as well as a}} T/R module have been realised which operate in X-Band and use the HBT technology for the high power chain. For the breadboard Tx-chain with driver and HPA in balanced configuration an output power of 39. 5 dBm with an efficiency of 32. 5 % at 10 % duty cycle was achieved. For the medium power T/R module with HBT driver and HPA in <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> configuration the <b>output</b> power is stabilised by a power control loop to 35 dBm with an overall module efficiency of better than 11. 5 % at 10 % duty cycle.

40|$|There {{exists a}} {{need to be able}} to acquire high data speed over a wide bandwidth. This {{requires}} the use of an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of achieving wide input bandwidth. With the 60 GHz unlicensed band, which has 7 GHz of usable bandwidth, the effective resolution bandwidth of an ADC must be at least 7 GHz. Parallel architectures, such as the flash ADC, are used to obtain fast sampling speeds and are suitable for systems where a wide bandwidth is required. The input bandwidth is reduced as the bit size is increased due to the large parasitic capacitance present at the input of the ADC. The 0. 13 ?m IBM 8 HP SiGe BiCMOS process provides high speed heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) with cut-off frequencies (fT) up to 200 GHz providing possible operation in the mm-wave region. Amongst other advantages, HBTs have good noise performance characteristics and are discussed in the dissertation. The focus of the research is to reduce the effect of the parasitic input capacitance of a flash ADC, whilst still maintaining ADC performance at low-GHz range frequencies. In order to improve the input bandwidth a common collector input tree is proposed. The Cherry Hooper differential amplifier is proposed to function as the ADC comparator. The input tree separates the parasitic input capacitances of each comparator thereby reducing the high parasitic input capacitance and improving the bandwidth of the ADC. The Cherry Hooper amplifier can be used as a transimpedance amplifier for mm-wave signals. By connecting the Cherry Hopper amplifier in a differential pair configuration, a comparator can be realised for use in an ADC. The input tree in combination with the Cherry Hooper amplifier could provide high bandwidth and maintain ADC performance at low-GHz frequencies for use in the 60 GHz mm-wave bandwidth frequency. This led to the hypothesis of this research. Cadence Virtuoso results are presented in this dissertation to support the derived hypothesis. AC simulation results show a gain of approximately 6 dB with a bandwidth up to 30 GHz for a two-bit ADC. Time domain simulation results show digital outputs within the 10 / 90 % range of the 440 mV <b>single</b> <b>ended</b> <b>output</b> swing, up to 5 GHz. A two-bit ADC is also prototyped within the 0. 13 ?m 8 HP IBM SiGe process in order to affirm the hypothesis. Measurement printed circuit boards (PCBs) were designed and developed to measure various characteristics of the ADC, such as the integral non-linearity (INL) and differential non-linearity (DNL), to determine the effective number of bits (ENOB) and hence the figure of merit (FOM). Measurement results showed INL and DNL results up to 0. 33 least significant bits (LSBs), an effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) up to 2 GHz and an ENOB up to 1. 18. Reduction in bandwidth of the implemented system was due to high inductive test leads. The increase in inductance at the test leads lead to oscillations on the comparator outputs and reduced the voltage standing wave ratio. These measured results were confirmed in post layout simulations. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Electrical, Electronic and Computer EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|E
