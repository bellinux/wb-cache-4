25|$|In August 1932 the {{announced}} Internordic Catholic rally {{finally took}} place in Copenhagen {{in the form of}} a Eucharistic Congress. All five countries were represented. Bishop Smit, who had resigned in 1927, was replaced by Bishop-elect Mgr. Jacques Mangers, S.M. (1889-1972), Vicar of South Norway, that country having in 1931 been divided into three jurisdictions. Among the many foreign dignitaries present for the occasion we find, once more, Cardinal van Rossum (who died only some weeks later) and Cardinal August Hlond of Gniezno and Poznań. It <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the busy programme of a Eucharistic Congress did not allow time for a formal Conference meeting.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{disclosure}} {{that the}} judge may be biased, {{the parties to the}} suit may choose to request {{that the judge}} recuse himself and have the proceedings started before another judge. If the parties choose to proceed on with the claim without any objections to the judge, it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a court will infer a waiver to the accusation of bias if either party had not raised an objection to bias at the commencement of a suit or at any time during it, following the approach taken by Locabail which was applied by the Federal Court of Malaysia in M. G. G. Pillai v. Tan Sri Dato' Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (2002).|$|E
500|$|Many {{people have}} accused Steorn of {{engaging}} in a publicity stunt although Steorn denied such accusations. Eric Berger, writing on the Houston Chronicle website, commented: [...] "Steorn is a former e-business company that saw its market vanish during the dot.com bust. It <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Steorn has retooled as a Web marketing company and is using the [...] "free energy" [...] promotion as a platform to show future clients how it can leverage print advertising and a slick Web site to promote their products and ideas". Thomas Ricker at Engadget suggested that Steorn's free-energy claim was a ruse to improve brand recognition {{and to help them}} sell Hall probes, while Josh Catone, features editor for Mashable, believes that it was merely an elaborate hoax.|$|E

500|$|New Super Mario Bros. was {{released}} by Nintendo in North America on May 15, 2006, in Japan on May 25, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006. Nintendo did not specify why it chose to delay the game's release in its home market of Japan by ten days, but GameSpot noted that [...] "it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the company simply wants {{a few more days}} to build inventory." [...] In Japan, over 480,000 units of New Super Mario Bros. were sold on the day it {{was released}} and 900,000 copies in the first four days. At the time, it was the best-selling debut for a Nintendo DS game in Japan, but it has since been surpassed by Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It is Japan's 26th best-selling game in 2008. In the United States, 500,000 copies of New Super Mario Bros. were sold in the first 35 days, and one million copies were sold twelve weeks after its release. Worldwide sales have steadily increased throughout the years, with five million copies by April 2008, eighteen million by March 2009, and 30.8 million by March 2016, making it the best-selling game for the Nintendo DS and one of the best-selling video games of all time.|$|E
2500|$|... “However {{legitimate}} {{this purpose}} {{may seem to}} the Georgian side, it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> this kind of military intelligence-gathering {{is bound to be}} interpreted by the Abkhaz side as a precursor to a military operation, particularly in a period of tense relations between the sides.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Indeed, many {{must have}} {{reacted to the}} {{catastrophe}} with despair and total abandonment of Judaism. Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals {{are known to have}} turned pagan before the war, and it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority." ...|$|E
5000|$|This is {{so because}} {{the wealth of}} the ruler is {{something}} kept by the people. If the people are already rich, how can it <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the ruler alone is poor? ...|$|R

2500|$|Art {{historian}} Ronald Pickvance {{says that}} with [...] "its arbitrary collage of separate motifs," [...] The Starry Night [...] "is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'." [...] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes {{them with the}} village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination. Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east, as does Jirat-Wasiutyński. Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh [...] "telescoped" [...] the view in certain of {{the pictures of the}} view from his window, and it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the morning star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of planet.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, José Mourinho again {{found himself}} causing {{controversy}} after commenting that Muntari, a practicing Muslim, was lacking fitness and energy due to fasting {{during the month}} of Ramadan. He was reported to have said [...] "Muntari had some problems related to Ramadan, perhaps with this heat it's not good for him to be doing this fasting. Ramadan has not arrived at the ideal moment for a player to play a football match." [...] However, since these comments, many Muslims and non-Muslims have come out in defence of Mourinho, saying that no offense was meant towards the player, but while the manager could have been more tactful in his treatment of the issue it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> a lack of food and water will affect a player's stamina and energy level.|$|E
2500|$|The Muralitharan Report {{produced}} by the University of Western Australia's study has considered the Richards study done in 1999 to evaluate the error margin. University of South Australia's study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama argued that the Richards study which was presented by the University of Western Australia's study has used a rigid aluminium bar that only rotated in the horizontal plane to introduce such error margin. Pathegama's report stated that [...] "in view of the system used in the test itself yielding considerable error even with a rigid aluminum bar (an accuracy level of approximately 4 degrees {{as stated in the}} Murali Report), it <b>stands</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the error margin would be considerably larger when tracking skin markers on a spin bowler's moving upper limb by this same system".|$|E

"Dancing," [...] she said, [...] "was exercise, {{regulated}} and timed by music; and it <b>stood</b> <b>to</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>that</b> {{it must be}} {{the best}} of all exercise for a delicate person, especially as it could be taken within doors, and in all states of the weather." ...|$|R
