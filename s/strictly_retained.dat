Yesternight I {{completed}} a bargain with Mr. Miller, of Dalswinton, for the farm of Ellisland, {{on the banks of the}} Nith, between five and six miles above Dumfries. I begin at Whit-Sunday to build a house, drive lime, etc., and Heaven be my help! for it will take a strong effort to bring my mind into the routine of business. I have discharged all the army of my former pursuits, fancies, and pleasures--a motley host! and have literally and <b>strictly</b> <b>retained</b> only the ideas of a few friends, which I have incorporated into a life-guard. I trust in Dr. Johnson's observation, [...] "Where much is attempted, something is done." [...] Firmness, both in sufferance and exertion, is a character I would wish to be thought to possess: and have always despised the whining yelp of complaint, and the cowardly, feeble resolve.|$|E

Such a promise is shown to ground the basic manifold with the Finslerian fourth-root metric function to measure length of relativistic four [...] vectors. Conversion to the framework of relativistic four [...] momentum is also elucidated. The relativity principle is <b>strictly</b> <b>retained.</b> An interesting particular algebra for subtraction and composition of three-dimensional relative velocities is arisen. The correspondence principle is operative {{in the sense that}} at small relative velocities the transformations introduced tend approximately to ordinary Lorentzian precursors. The transport synchronization remains valid. Abbreviation RF will be used for (inertial) reference frames. Keywords: special relativity, invariance, Finsler geometry...|$|E
40|$|POLN is {{a nuclear}} A-family DNA {{polymerase}} encoded in vertebrate genomes. POLN has unusual fidelity and DNA lesion bypass properties, including strong strand displacement activity, low fidelity favoring incorporation of T for template G and accurate translesion synthesis past a 5 S-thymine glycol (5 S-Tg). We searched for conserved {{features of the}} polymerase domain that distinguish it from prokaryotic pol I-type DNA polymerases. A Lys residue (679 in human POLN) of particular interest was identified in the conserved ‘O-helix’ of motif 4 in the fingers sub-domain. The corresponding residue {{is one of the}} most important for controlling fidelity of prokaryotic pol I and is a nonpolar Ala or Thr in those enzymes. Kinetic measurements show that K 679 A or K 679 T POLN mutant DNA polymerases have full activity on nondamaged templates, but poorly incorporate T opposite template G and do not bypass 5 S-Tg efficiently. We also found that a conserved Tyr residue in the same motif not only affects sensitivity to dideoxynucleotides, but also greatly influences enzyme activity, fidelity and bypass. Protein sequence alignment reveals that POLN has three specific insertions in the DNA polymerase domain. The results demonstrate that residues have been <b>strictly</b> <b>retained</b> during evolution that confer unique bypass and fidelity properties on POLN...|$|E

Renormalization group results for random magnets {{when combined with}} these statistics for the Lennard-Jones glass suggest that discontinuous replica symmetry breaking would occur if a liquid with short range interactions could be equilibrated at a sufficiently low temperature where its mean field configurational entropy would vanish, even though the system <b>strictly</b> <b>retains</b> a finite configurational entropy...|$|R
40|$|Cartograms are a {{well-known}} technique for showing geography-related statistical information, such as popula-tion demographics and epidemiological data. The basic {{idea is to}} distort a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, {{but in a way}} that keeps the map recognizable. In this paper, we deal with the problem of making continuous cartograms that <b>strictly</b> <b>retain</b> the topol-ogy of the input mesh. We compare two algorithms to solve the continuous cartogram problem. The first one uses an iterative relocation of the vertices based on scanlines. The second one is based on the Gridfit technique, which uses pixel-based distortion based on a quadtree-like data struc-ture. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{freezing}} {{waters of}} the Antarctic coasts host a variety of protozoan ciliates. Among these, Euplotes species dominate. Representatives of their populations can easily be isolated and expanded into laboratory cultures {{that are able to}} reproduce true-to-type virtually indefinitely. They provide excellent experimental material to identify and characterize, structurally and functionally, cold-adapted molecules of eukaryotic origin. In this context, we have focused on a family of small (52 to 63 residues), globular signal proteins (or “pheromones”), that strains of E. nobilii synthesize constitutively and secrete into the extracellular environment. For three members (i. e., En- 1, En- 2, and En- 6) of this protein family, we have determined the 3 -D structures in solution by NMR spectroscopy. The comparison of these En structures with those previously determined for the Er pheromone family (produced by E. raikovi, a temperate species that is phylogenetically closely allied to E. nobilii) shows that these protein families have <b>strictly</b> <b>retained</b> a common compact three-helix bundle core, to which the cold-adapted En pheromones have added two unique, extended non-structured regions. One region (spanning 10 - 12 residues) forms the molecule N-terminal extremity, while the second one (of 8 - 10 residues) connects helices 1 and 2. Together with increased concentrations of negatively charged side-chains on the molecular surface, these non-structured extensions improve, locally and globally, the flexibility and breathing of the En molecules, and may thus help the effective docking and binding of the En molecules to their target receptor proteins on the cell surface at cold temperature...|$|E
40|$|Copy number {{variations}} (CNVs) {{represent a}} large source of genetic variation in humans {{and have been}} increasingly studied for disease association. A deletion polymorphism of the gene encoding the cytosolic detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT 1) has been extensively studied for cancer susceptibility (919 studies, from HuGE navigator, [URL] However, clear conclusions have not been reached. Since the GSTT 1 gene is located within a genomic region of segmental duplications (SD), {{there may be a}} confounding effect from another, yet-uncharacterized CNV at the same locus. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized 38 -kilo-base (kb) long deletion polymorphism of GSTT 2 B located within a 61 -kb DNA inverted repeat. GSTT 2 B is a duplicated copy of GSTT 2, the only paralogue of GSTT 1 in humans. A newly developed PCR assay revealed that a microhomology-mediated breakpoint appears to be shared among individuals at high frequency. The GSTT 2 B deletion polymorphism was in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D' = 0. 841) with the neighboring GSTT 1 deletion polymorphism in the Caucasian population. Alleles harboring a single deletion were significantly overrepresented (p = 2. 22 x 10 (- 16)), suggesting a selection against alleles with both deletions. The deletion alleles are almost certainly the derived ones, because the GSTT 2 B-GSTT 2 -GSTT 1 genes were <b>strictly</b> <b>retained</b> in chimpanzees. Extremely low GSTT 2 mRNA expression was associated with the GSTT 2 B deletion, suggesting an influence of the deletion on the flanking region and loss of GSTT 2 function. Genome-wide LD analysis between deletion polymorphisms further points to the uniqueness of two deletions, because strong LD between deletion polymorphisms might be very rare in humans. These results show a complex genomic organization and unexpected biological functions of CNVs within segmental duplications and emphasize the importance of detailed structural characterization for disease association studies...|$|E
40|$|Nutriomics is {{the study}} of the whole range of {{nutritional}} components (nutriome) in foods. In order to further understand the molecular basis for the positive health benefits of fruits identified from epidemiology, the mass balance through the human digestion and absorption should be studied. The components of the nutriome studied in this research were sugars, carotenoids, phenolics and organic acids, all important for defining dietary – human health relationships and linking to evidence obtained from epidemiological studies. An attempt to approach a realistic human mimetic digestion and absorption model has been carried out in this study using a static in-vitro model of the human digestive system. Two major novelities in this model compared to other in-vitro models are (i) the use of particles of solid fruit products that mimic the products of human chewing and (ii) a cell-based (Caco- 2) in-vitro intestinal absorption model. Hence, imitative bioavailability, i. e. releasing nutrients and potential levels of target compounds reaching the portal circulatory system could be assessed. The fruits studied were tomato, mango, papaya; each as fresh, dried and juiced forms. In-vivo chewing suggested 0. 5 cm size modes for dried products and 1. 5 cm for fresh products. The agglomerates that were obtained from the chewing of dried products disaggregated during in-vitro digestions in the presence of acids (gastric simulation) or sodium bicarbonate at pH 6 (small intestinal simulation). The extent of this disaggregation followed the order: tomato > mango > papaya. Although all fresh samples contained separated cells, their responses to a 5 mm texture analysis probe (mimicking teeth cusps) varied depending on fruit products. All matrices were hardened by drying, becoming more brittle and breaking easier to produce smaller size modes. Variation between individual participants in the size of their chewed particles was lower for fresh products and high for dried products. The in-vitro digestion and absorption model developed had simulated particle sizes of approximately 0. 5 cm 3 for dried products or 1. 5 cm 3 (thickness varied with the products) for fresh products in a 9 : 1 ratio mix with blended samples, and were digested in-vitro using the following steps: 1. ‘Chewing’: pH 6. 9; 37 C, 10 min, in a shaking-water bath (55 rpm) with human alpha-amylase (100 U/L). 2. ‘Gastric’ digestion: pH 2; 37 C, 60 min, in a shaking-water (55 rpm) with porcine pepsin (40 µg/L). 3. ‘Intestinal’ digestion: pH 6; 37 C, 60 min, in a shaking-water bath (55 rpm) with porcine pancreatin and bile extract (1. 4 µg/L and 8. 6 µg/L, respectively). 4. Caco- 2 cell monolayer in-vitro passages: aged 22 days post confluent monolayers in a 24 transwell-insert well plate seeded at 105 cells, pH 7. 4 with renewal of apical and basolateral solutions every 30 min for bioavailability estimations. In this study, two models of basolateral – apical solution renewals were carried out: both apical and basolateral were renewed (model A) and basolateral only was renewed (model B). To study metabolites produced by Caco- 2 cells, the bioassays were carried out for 22 h without renewals of apical and basolateral solutions (model C). An overview of nutriomics analysis of in-vitro digestions of mango, papaya and tomato based on principal component analysis (PCA) suggested: (1) fruit types led to variable nutriome releases: in-vitro digestions affected tomato >mango >papaya; (2) processing varied nutriome releases from fruit products with juicing tended to release more nutriome components, whereas drying and unprocessed (fresh) did not show noticeably different patterns; (3) gastric and simultaneous gastric-intestinal digestions were similar in nutriome releases whereas contributions of intestinal digestion alone were negligible for water soluble nutriome components; and overall (4) during in-vitro digestions there were no interactions among releasing nutriome from the fruit products studied (independent nutriome releasing processes). Phenolic components showed molecular changes during in-vitro digestion and processing, due to, heating effects, pH or enzymic degradations. Caco- 2 bioassays using model compounds showed a range of monolayer responses as follows: (1) mannitol, lycopene and catechin were <b>strictly</b> <b>retained</b> in the apical solution; (2) sugars, caffeine and atenolol were translocated in the apical-to-basolateral direction as intact molecules; (3) Beta-carotene partially disappeared from the apical solution without basolateral release. Models A – C consistently confirmed these responses. Low recoveries provided evidence for cellular metabolisms of (particularly) phenolic and carotenoid molecules by the Caco- 2 cell monolayers...|$|E

D.), Department of Teaching and Learning, Washington State UniversityThis {{study is}} a {{critical}} discourse analysis (CDA) {{that focuses on the}} public discourse surrounding the relationship that emerged between Barack Obama and hip hop culture throughout his 2008 campaign, and ultimate presidential victory. I explored the timeframe of January 9, 2008, thru April 1, 2009. In this CDA study, I utilize the "ProQuest Newspapers" database; a database that <b>strictly</b> <b>retains</b> newspaper publications. Amid the 40 articles, I uncovered four themes related to Obama and his association with hip hop: "Hip Hop Vote=Youth Vote," "Guilty by Association," "A Credit to Hip Hop," and "Change. " These four themes unveiled the beneficial, yet politically unstable relationship with hip hop that Obama had throughout his 2008 and 2009 presidential odyssey. Finally, I conclude my comprehensive CDA analysis with the notion that Obama's presidential victory was a social, cultural, and political manifestation of hip hop culture. This historical achievement, influenced by the social and cultural power of hip hop, should guide the conversations regarding the racial politics in 21 st century America.

40|$|The use of TRISO-particle-based {{dispersion}} fuel within SiC matrix and cladding materials {{has the potential}} to allow the design of extremely safe LWRs with failure-proof fuel. This paper examines the feasibility of LWR-like cycle length for such a low enriched uranium fuel with the imposed constraint of <b>strictly</b> <b>retaining</b> the original geometry of the fuel pins and assemblies. The motivation for retaining the original geometry is to provide the ability to incorporate the fuel 'as-is' into existing LWRs while retaining their thermal-hydraulic characteristics. The feasibility of using this fuel is assessed by looking at cycle lengths and fuel failure rates. Other considerations (e. g., safety parameters, etc.) were not considered {{at this stage of the}} study. The study includes the examination of different TRISO kernel diameters without changing the coating layer thicknesses. The study shows that a naive use of UO{sub 2 } results in cycle lengths too short to be practical for existing LWR designs and operational demands. Increasing fissile inventory within the fuel compacts shows that acceptable cycle lengths can be achieved. In this study, starting with the recognized highest packing fraction practically achievable (44 %), higher enrichment, larger fuel kernel sizes, and the use of higher density fuels have been evaluated. The models demonstrate cycle lengths comparable to those of ordinary LWRs. As expected, TRISO particles with extremely large kernels are shown to fail under all considered scenarios. In contrast, the designs that do not depart too drastically from those of the nominal NGNP HTR fuel TRISO particles are shown to perform satisfactorily and display a high rates of survival under all considered scenarios. Finally, it is recognized that relaxing the geometry constraint will result in satisfactory cycle lengths even using UO{sub 2 }-loaded TRISO particles-based fuel with enrichment at or below 20 w/o...|$|R
