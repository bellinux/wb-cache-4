However, the methodologies utilised in these studies cannot be used for general analysis of such problems. In this research, an extra term is added to the optimisation penalty function in order to consider the transverse shear effect. This modified penalty function leads to a new methodology whereby the thickness of laminated composite plate is minimized by optimising the fibre orientations for different <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> Therefore, the effect of transverse shear forces is considered in this study. Simulated annealing (SA) is used to search for the optimal design. This optimisation algorithm {{has been shown to be}} reliable as it is not based on the starting point, and it can escape from the local optimum points. In this research, the Tsai-Wu failure and maximum stress criteria for composite laminate are chosen. By applying two failure criteria at the same time the results are more reliable.

This critical value is calculated under conditions either accounting for or negating the effect of heat dissipated by the material.

40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) is a {{manufacturing}} process that builds up metallic or ceramic parts layer by layer directly from 3 D-computer-aided design data, offering, for example, {{the advantage of}} imposing little restrictions in terms of geometric complexity. One of the main challenges of the SLM process is to improve its efficiency by increasing the build rate {{of the process and}} thereby decreasing time and cost. One way of achieving this is increasing the applied laser power and beam diameter, thereby melting more volume in a shorter period of time. Another option of improving efficiency is reducing the volume of the material which has to be melted, made possible by the aforementioned limitless geometric freedom offered by the SLM process. Hereby, one can generate hollow parts for better exploitation and adaption of the volume to <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> Large volumes can be replaced by lattice structures with a certain volume fraction, saving weight and production time by maintaining the stiffness of the structure.

Different studies on reconstruction plates present a fracture rate of 2. 8 - 9. 8 %. The rate of plate fracture and plate loosening increases {{the need to improve}} the design of the reconstruction plate. A useful tool to find new designs for structures is topology optimization. Topology optimization is a mathematical based method where it is possible to define an optimization problem for a <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> <b>case.</b> Based on the defined problem, the solver calculates the most appropriate design to reach the final goal. The aim of this work is to investigate, describe, and discuss how new designs for reconstruction plates used for bridging large mandibular defects can be achieved by using topology optimization as a tool.   Two software programs handling topology optimization from Altair Engineering were used: SimLab 14. 0 and HyperMesh 14. 0. Both of them uses the solver OptiStruct to solve the defined topology optimization problem. The topology optimization problem was defined to minimize the compliance of the structure with an upper limit of the allowed volume fraction used for the new design. Three different clenching tasks were examined: right unilateral clench, clenching in the intercuspal position, and incisal clench. All three <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> resulted in different designs, the designs were also affected by the initial amount of screws used, and by the defined value on the allowed thickness of the created parts in the new design.

40|$|Bonding a fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composite or metallic {{plate to}} the soffit of a reinforced concrete (RC), timber or metallic beam can significantly increase its strength {{and other aspects}} of structural performance. These hybrid beams are often found to fail due to premature debonding of the plate from the original beam in a brittle manner. This has {{led to the development of}} many analytical solutions over the last two decades to quantify the interfacial shear and normal stresses between the adherends. The adherends are subjected to axial, bending and shear deformations. However, most analytical solutions have neglected the influence of shear deformation of the adherends. For the few solutions which consider this effect in an approximate manner, their applicability is limited to one or two <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> This paper presents a general analytical solution for the interfacial stresses in plated beams under an arbitrary loading with the shear deformation of the adherends duly considered. The shear stress distribution is assumed to be parabolic through the depth of the adherends in predicting the interfacial shear stress and Timoshenko's beam theory is adopted in predicting interfacial normal stress to account for the shear deformation. The solution is applicable to a beam of arbitrary prismatic cross-section bonded symmetrically or asymmetrically with a thin or thick plate, both having linear elastic material properties. The effect of shear deformation is illustrated through an example beam. The influence of material and geometric parameters of the adherends and adhesive on the interfacial stress concentrations at the plate end is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In the {{classical}} laminate plate theory for composite materials, {{it is assumed}} that the laminate is thin compared to its lateral dimensions and straight lines normal to the middle surface remain straight and normal to the surface after deformation. As a result, the induced twist which is due to the transverse shear stresses and strains are neglected. Also, this induced twist was considered as an unwanted displacement and hence was ignored. However, in certain cases this induced twist would not be redundant and can be a useful displacement to control the behaviour of the composite structure passively. In order to use this induced twist, {{there is a need for}} a modified model to predict the behaviour of laminated composites. A composite normally consists of two materials; matrix and fibres. Fibres can be embedded in different orientations in composite lay-ups. In this research, laminated composite models subject to transfer shear effect are studied. A semi analytical model based on Newton-Kantorovich-Quadrature Method is proposed. The presented model can estimate the induced twist displacement accurately. Unlike other semi analytical model, the new model is able to solve out of plane loads as well as in plane loads. It is important to mention that the constitutive equations of the composite materials (and as a result the induced twist) are determined by the orientation of fibres in laminae. The orientation of composite fibres can be optimised for <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> <b>cases,</b> such as longitudinal and in-plane loading. However, the methodologies utilised in these studies cannot be used for general analysis such as out of plane loading problems. This research presents a model whereby the thickness of laminated composite plates is minimised (for a desirable twist angle) by optimising the fibre orientations for different <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> In the proposed model, the effect of transverse shear is considered. Simulated annealing (SA), which is a type of stochastic optimisation method, is used to search for the optimal design. This optimisation algorithm is not based on the starting point and it can escape from the local optimum points. In accordance with the annealing process where temperature decreases gradually, this algorithm converges to the global minimum. In this research, the Tsai-Wu failure criterion for composite laminate is chosen which is operationally simple and readily amenable to computational procedures. In addition, this criterion shows the difference between tensile and compressive strengths, through its linear terms. The numerical results are obtained and compared to the experimental data to validate the methodology. It is shown that there is a good agreement between finite element and experimental results. Also, results of the proposed simulated annealing optimisation model are compared to the outcomes from previous research with <b>specific</b> <b>loading</b> where the validity of the model is investigated...|$|R

The testing and modelling of various tyres {{in order to determine}} stress distributions of tyres on the road surface, under varying conditions, remains a relevant and important field of study. The information from these studies are essential to understanding vehicle dynamics as the small contact patches between the vehicle tyres and road surface is the only area of interaction between the entire vehicle and the road surface. The contact stress data is also essential in the calculation of road wear characteristics of tyres and vehicles. Different models exist to estimate the contact stress between the tyre and road surface, but most contain assumptions that limit their applicability to a small set of tyres under very <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> This paper considers the development of mathematical models that are used to estimate the vertical uniform contact stress for three types of heavy vehicle tyres. The three tyres studied are 315 / 80 R 22. 5, 385 / 65 R 22. 5 and 425 / 65 R 22. 5 tyres. The models have been developed through the use of tyre testing data obtained from the Stress-In-Motion (SIM) system. It was found that 4 th order polynomials provided the most accurate stress results over the selected operating range of 25 kN to 45 kN which is the typical load range for heavy vehicle tyres due to legal axle load limits. The polynomial formulas require only the tyre inflation pressure and vertical tyre load as inputs, in order to estimate the vertical uniform contact stress. The models developed correlate well with the test data and showing an average absolute error of less than 2 %.

The viscoelastic solution is then expressed as a sequence of elastic finite element solutions. The strain-dependent character of the relaxation modulus is included by replacing the single relaxation curve used in the linear viscoelastic theory by a family of relaxation functions obtained at various strain levels.

40|$|Trabecular bone has {{a complex}} and porous microstructure. This study {{develops}} approaches to determine the mechanical behaviour of this material at the macroscopic level {{through the use of}} homogenisation-based multiscale methods using micro-finite element simulations. In homogenisation-based finite element methods, a simulation involving a representative volume element of the microstructure of the considered material is performed with a specific set of boundary conditions. The macroscopic stresses and strains are retrieved as averaged quantities defined over this domain. Most of the homogenisation-based work on trabecular bone has been performed to study its macroscopic elastic regime, and therefore define its constant macroscopic stiffness tensor. The rod and plate-shaped microstructure of trabecular bone can be precisely identified with advanced scanning tools, such as micro-computed tomography devices. Taking into account the size requirements to achieve a certain independence of boundary conditions for trabecular bone in a homogenisation-based multiscale setting, the resulting stack of images can have around ten million solid voxels after binarisation. Although a completely linear finite element simulation with such a large system may be feasible with commercial packages (with the proper time and memory requirements), {{it is not possible to}} perform a nonlinear simulation for such a mesh in a reasonable time frame, and the amount of required memory may not be available. A highly scalable parallel driver program which solves finite strain elastoplastic systems was developed within the framework of the existing parallel code ParaFEM. This code was used throughout this study to evaluate the yield and post-yield properties of trabecular bone. It was run on cutting edge high performance computing platforms (BlueGene/Q at the Hartree Centre, Science and Technology Facilities Council; and ARCHER, UK National Supercomputing Service, at Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre). Micro-finite element simulations require definition of properties at the microscopic scale and it is unclear how these properties affect the macroscopic response. This study examines the effect of compressive hydrostatic yield at the microscopic scale on the macroscopic behaviour. Two different microscopic yield criteria, one permitting yielding at compressive hydrostatic stresses and the other not, were considered. A large number of <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> were examined. It was found that these two microscopic yield criteria only influence macroscopic yield behaviour in load scenarios which are compression-dominated; for other <b>load</b> <b>cases,</b> macroscopic response is insensitive to the choice of the microscopic yield criterion, provided it has an appropriate strength asymmetry. Also, in compression-dominated <b>load</b> <b>cases,</b> high density bone is much more sensitive as it is more like a continuum, resulting in the microscopic properties being more directly upscaled. Only a few previous studies have employed homogenisation to evaluate the macroscopic yield criterion of trabecular bone. However, they either used a simplified microscopic yield surface or examined only a small number of <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> A thorough multiaxial evaluation of the macroscopic yield surface was performed by applying a wide range of loading scenarios (160 <b>load</b> <b>cases)</b> on trabecular bone samples. Closed-form yield surfaces with different symmetries (isotropy, orthotropy and full anisotropy) were fitted to the numerically obtained macroscopic yield points in strain space, and the fitting errors were evaluated in detail for different subsets of <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> Although orthotropy and full anisotropy showed the smallest fitting errors, they were not significantly superior to the isotropic fit. Thus, isotropy in strain space presents itself as the most suitable option due to the simplicity of its implementation. The study showed that fitting errors do depend on the chosen set of <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> and that shear <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> are extremely important as it was found that even for these highly aligned samples, trabecular bone presents some degree of shear asymmetry, i. e. different strength in clockwise and counter-clockwise shear directions. There have been no previous attempts to evaluate the post-yield behaviour of trabecular bone through homogenisation-based studies on detailed micro-finite element trabecular bone meshes. A damage and plasticity constitutive law for the microscale based on existing data in the literature was considered. A homogenisation-based multiscale approach was used to evaluate the hardening and stiffness reduction at the macroscale when uniaxial load scenarios are applied to trabecular bone samples, for a small range of plastic strain Euclidean norms. Results show that damage progression at the macroscale for trabecular bone is not isotropic, which is contrary to what has been assumed previously, and that both the evolution of the yield surface and damage are different for tension, compression and shear. Nonetheless, they can be correlated with plastic strain Euclidean norms by using linear relationships. It was also observed that macroscopic damage in a <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> <b>case</b> affects differently the on-axis orthotropic stiffness and the off-axis orthotropic stiffness components. The findings of this study will permit the use of a more rigorous definition of the post-elastic macroscopic behaviour of trabecular bone in finite element settings...|$|R
40|$|A key to {{successful}} modelling {{of the complex}} progressive failure in layered composite materials is to have computationally efficient models and methods which {{can be adapted to}} the predominant failure mechanisms in each <b>specific</b> <b>loading</b> <b>case.</b> In particular, efficient approximation and solution methods for delamination modelling is crucial, since "high-fidelity" FE models with many elements through the component thickness interconnected with cohesive interface elements leads to unfeasible simulation times and memory requirements. For that purpose, several papers have been published that present alternative methods for modelling concepts which support laminate failure analyses requiring only one shell element through the thickness and where arbitrary delamination propagation is accounted for only in areas where it is needed, cf. Brouzoulis and Fagerström, Hosseini et al. and McElroy. The proposed new concepts however need to be further developed before they can be readily applied to solve engineering problems in which delamination cracks can initiate and propagate. For traditional finite element based shell models, such as the one presented by Brouzoulis and Fagerström (based on the eXtended Finite Element Method, XFEM), improved methods to predict the interlaminar stresses are needed for an accurate prediction of delamination initiation, since the transverse stresses predicted directly from the shell solution are of too low accuracy. This was recently done e. g. by Främby et al. who complemented an XFEM shell formulation with a stress recovery approach, performed over a patch of elements, thereby making the model fully adaptive. As for the alternative concept based on an isogeometric approach by Hosseini et al., {{there is a need to}} handle successive introduction of new discontinuities by means of knot-insertion in an automated fashion. A first step in this direction was taken by the authors in, outlining strategies for how to initiate and propagate delamination cracks using this framework. As a benefit over FE based C 0 continuous shells, the necessary improvements of the interlaminar stresses for isogeometric shells can be performed element-wise since in-plane stresses are smooth over element boundaries. In this contribution we focus on the further development of the isogeometric solid-like shell element to allow for an automated insertion of discontinuities. The formulation adopts NURBS (or T-spline) basis functions for the discretisation of the shell mid-surface, whereas a higher-order B-spline functions are used for the interpolation in the thickness direction. A discontinuity can be incorporated in this latter function by so-called knot-insertion to account for ply interfaces (weak discontinuities) and delaminations (strong discontinuities). In order to automatically enhance the element, various stress-based criteria using element local improved interlaminar stresses are investigated. In this way, the isogeometric continuum element can be used in an even more efficient fashion, allowing for the detailed analysis of large, thin-walled composite structures...|$|R

The genetic algorithm uses an objective function with adaptive penalization as well as an adaptive mutation scheme. The aim is to minimize the material cost of strengthening timber beams and the constraints are the ultimate limit states for flexural and shear behaviour and the serviceability limit state of deflection, according to Spanish Technical Building Code. For this purpose different properties are used, such as section geometry, length, timber class and load conditions. The reinforcement solutions have been encoded in a binary database: type of composite material (CFRP or GFRP), reinforcement mechanical properties and geometric configuration. The search space for the minimum cost consists of 65 billion possible solutions. The genetic algorithm has been used for several <b>specific</b> <b>load</b> and geometry <b>cases</b> for glued laminated timber in order to find whether there is a specific reinforcement configuration more feasible for certain loading situations: short or long beams and lower or higher <b>loading</b> increments.

40|$|The fatigue of ship {{structural}} details is {{of major}} {{concern in the}} maritime industry as it can generate fracture issues that may compromise structural integrity. In the present study, a fatigue analysis of the lower hopper knuckle connection of a bulk carrier was conducted using the Finite Element Method by means of ABAQUS/CAE software. The fatigue life was calculated using Miner's Rule and the long-term distribution of stress range {{by the use of}} the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The cumulative damage ratio was estimated using the fatigue damage resulting from the stress range occurring at each load condition. For this purpose, a cargo hold model was first generated, which extends over the length of two holds (the mid-hold and half of each of the adjacent holds) and transversely over the full breadth of the hull girder. Following that, a submodel of the area of interest was extracted in order to calculate the hot spot stress of the connection and to estimate the fatigue life of the structural detail. Two hot spot locations were identified; one at the top layer of the inner bottom plate and one at the top layer of the hopper plate. The IACS Common Structural Rules (CSR) require that <b>specific</b> dynamic <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> for each <b>loading</b> condition are assessed. Following this, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>case</b> that causes the highest stress range at each loading condition should be used in the fatigue analysis for the calculation of the cumulative fatigue damage ratio. Each <b>load</b> <b>case</b> has a different effect on ship hull response. Of main concern, when assessing the fatigue strength of the lower hopper knuckle connection, was the determination of the maximum, i. e. the critical value of the stress range, which acts in a direction normal to the weld toe line. This acts in the transverse direction, that is, perpendicularly to the ship's centerline axis. The <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> were explored both theoretically and numerically in order to establish the one that causes the highest damage to the location examined. The most severe one was identified to be the <b>load</b> <b>case</b> induced by beam sea condition where the encountered wave comes from the starboard. At the level of the cargo hold model, the model was assumed to be simply supported at its ends. A coarse mesh was generated in order to represent the overall stiffness of the structure. The elements employed were quadrilateral shell elements, each having four integration points. A linear elastic analysis was performed because linear elastic material behavior can be presumed, since only localized yielding is allowed by most design codes. At the submodel level, the displacements of the analysis of the cargo hold model to the outer region nodes of the submodel acted as boundary conditions and applied loading for the submodel. In order to calculate the hot spot stress at the hot spot locations, a very fine mesh zone was generated and used. The fatigue life of the detail was found to be 16. 4 years which is lower than the design fatigue life of the structure (25 years), making this location vulnerable to fatigue fracture issues. Moreover, the loading conditions that induce the most damage to the location were found to be the various ballasting conditions...|$|R

The door was loaded for two pressure <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> and two suction <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> Pressure <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> are limit <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> One suction <b>load</b> <b>case</b> corresponds to Design ultimate <b>load</b> <b>case</b> and the other suction <b>load</b> <b>case</b> corresponds to jamming <b>load</b> <b>case.</b> The <b>load</b> v/s deflection/strain behavior was obtained for all <b>load</b> <b>cases.</b> The door successfully withstood the ultimate load without any failure and the maximum deflection was 11. 26 mm and the maximum strain was 1681 micro strains.

This Multiple <b>Load</b> <b>Cases</b> Traditional ESO (MLCTESO) is difficult to optimize a structure subject to complex <b>load</b> <b>cases,</b> and the optimization result may not be reasonable. Modified Rejection Ratio for Multiple <b>Load</b> <b>Cases</b> Evolutionary Structural Optimization (MRR-MLCESO) proposed in this paper makes a change based on the MLCTESO. The major change is to modify the rejection ratio of each <b>load</b> <b>case</b> according to {{the ratio of the}} total strain energy of a structure subject to each <b>load</b> <b>case</b> to the total strain energy of a structure subject to all <b>load</b> <b>cases,</b> then optimization for a structure subject to complex multiple <b>load</b> <b>cases</b> can be easily made and the structure obtained from such an optimization has a good undertaking force performance...|$|R

40|$|The near wake of wind {{turbines}} {{is characterized by}} the presence of the hub vortex, which is a coherent vorticity structure generated from the interaction between the root vortices and the boundary layer evolving over the turbine nacelle. By moving downstream, the hub vortex undergoes an instability with growth rate, azimuthal and axial wavenumbers determined by the characteristics of the incoming wind and turbine aerodynamics. Thus, a large variability of the hub vortex instability is expected for wind energy applications with consequent effects on wake downstream evolution, wake interactions within a wind farm, power production, and fatigue loads on turbines invested by wakes generated upstream. In order to predict characteristics of the hub vortex instability for different operating conditions, linear stability analysis is carried out by considering different statistics of the incoming wind turbulence, thrust coefficient, tip speed ratio, and blade lift distribution of a wind turbine. Axial and azimuthal wake velocity fields are modeled through Carton-McWilliams velocity profiles by mimicking the presence of the hub vortex, helicoidal tip vortices, and matching the wind turbine thrust coefficient predicted through the actuator disk model. The linear stability analysis shows that hub vortex instability is strongly affected by the wind turbine loading conditions, and specifically it is promoted by a larger thrust coefficient. A higher load of the {{wind turbines}} produces an enhanced axial velocity deficit and, in turn, higher shear in the radial direction of the streamwise velocity. The axial velocity shear within the turbine wake is also the main physical mechanism promoting the hub vortex instability when varying the lift distribution over the blade span for a <b>specific</b> <b>loading</b> condition. <b>Cases</b> with a larger velocity deficit in proximity of the wake center and less aerodynamic load towards the blade tip result to be more unstable. Moreover, wake swirl promotes hub vortex instability, and it can also affect the azimuthal wave number of the most unstable mode. Finally, higher Reynolds stresses and turbulent eddy viscosity decrease both growth rate and azimuthal wave number of the most unstable mode...|$|R
