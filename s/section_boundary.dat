50|$|Modern {{track is}} often {{continuously}} welded, the joints being welded during installation. This offers many benefits {{to all but}} the signalling system, which no longer has natural breaks in the rail to form the block sections. The only method to form discrete blocks in this scenario is to use different audio frequencies (AF) in each block section. To prevent the audio signal from one section passing into an adjacent section, pairs of simple tuned circuits are connected across the rails at the <b>section</b> <b>boundary.</b> The tuned circuit often incorporates the circuit to either apply the transmitted signal to the track or recover the received signal {{from the other end}} of the section.|$|E
50|$|Beginning around 1800, the Illinois Territory was {{surveyed}} {{pursuant to}} the Land Ordinance of 1785.

Because the Goshen Road was often the only noteworthy feature {{at the time of}} the original survey, the road was noted in many of these surveys.

50|$|Though it was {{inspired}} by the Wien and followed its long span, high set, high aspect ratio wing layout, it differed significantly both structurally and aerodynamically. The project leader was Raymond Jarlaud, who was also responsible for the wing, with Eric Nessler designing the fuselage. Unlike the Wien's wing, that of the Avia 41-P was a two part structure, each half-wing having a rectangular plan centre section and a straight-tapered outer section, the latter dominating (80%) the span. The inner and outer airfoils were Göttingen 535, a thick and highly cambered section, and the flat bottomed Göttingen 527 respectively, different profiles from those of the Wien. They had a single spar formed by a leading edge, plywood covered torsion box which narrowed outwards. Behind this the wing was fabric covered. Broad chord ailerons occupied more than half the span, divided into two sections which moved separately to minimise torsion. On the first Avia 41-P the ailerons were fabric covered but the second and later examples had ply covering. Streamlined duraluminum V-struts from the lower fuselage braced the half-wings just inside the inner and outer <b>section</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{graph-based}} method {{to find the}} optimal cross <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> for vessel segmentation. The voxels on the cross sectional plane are assumed to lay on the circles around the centerline point. The voxels on the circles with different radii are then transformed to a graph, by which the objective of finding the optimal boundary is converted to choosing the optimal path in the graph. A new cost function for the edge cost of the graph is proposed to obtain a smooth, optimal boundary of the cross section. Based on the optimal cross <b>section</b> <b>boundary,</b> we also propose a method for stenosis detection and quantification. The proposed method for segmentation and stenosis detection has been evaluated to be accurate and highly computationally efficient. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the relationship between}} the IMF <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> crossing, solar flares, the sunspot 11 year cycle variation and the thunderstorm index is given, using the superposition epoch method, for data from more than 13, 000 thunderstorms from 10 meteorological stations in the Beijing area and the Northeast region during 1957 to 1978. The results show that for some years a correlation exists between the thunderstorm index and the positive IMF <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> crossing. The thunderstorm index increases obviously within three days near the crossing and on the seventh day after the crossing. The influence of the crossing on thunderstorms is stronger in the first half year than the latter half year. For different classes of solar flares, the influences are not equally obvious. The solar flares which appeared on the west side, especially in the western region (from 0 to 30 deg) have the most obvious influence. There is no discernible correlation between the thunderstorm index and the sunspot eleven-year cycle...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{automatic}} detection of <b>section</b> <b>boundaries</b> and extraction of key sentences from lecture audio archives is proposed. The method {{makes use of}} 'discourse markers' (DMs), which are characteristic expressions used in initial utterances of sections, together with pause and language model information. The DMs are derived in a totally unsupervised manner based on word statistics. An experimental evaluation using the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) demonstrates that the proposed method provides better indexing of <b>section</b> <b>boundaries</b> compared with a simple baseline method using pause information only, {{and that it is}} robust against speech recognition errors. The method is also applied to extraction of key sentences that can index the section topics. The statistics of the presumed DMs are used to define the importance of sentences, which favors potentially section-initial ones. The measure is also combined with the conventional tf-idf measure based on content words. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of using the DMs in combination with the keyword-based method. The paper also describes a statistical framework for transforming raw speech transcriptions into the document style for defining appropriate sentence units and improving readability...|$|R

40|$|The phased {{microphone}} array {{has become a}} widely used tool in aeroacoustic testing for the localization and quantification of sound sources. Measurements are often carried out in wind tunnels with open or closed test sections. The underlying thesis investigates the performance and comparability of {{microphone array}} measurements conducted in wind tunnels with open and closed test sections and carries out a systematic comparison. The various effects influencing the aeroacoustic results of testing in different wind tunnels can be summarized in three main groups. Deviations can result from influences which can affect the aeroacoustic sound generation. The second group concerns differences in the experimental setup. Finally, the third group consists of the varying test <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions and propagation effects. In {{the framework of the}} assessment of the comparability of microphone array measurements in open and closed wind tunnels, this thesis focuses on the third group - the influence of test <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions and propagation effects on microphone array results.

30|$|Algorithm 6 {{provides}} the in-memory section by section flight path implementation in Spark using RDDs. Since all operations are performed in-memory, the algorithm simply transforms the input data into RDD elements that represent all elevation data in step 1 {{and the network}} line data in step 2 within each section. The flatMapToPair function flattens the data elements for a key into a single value in the transformed RDD. Step 3 joins the two RDDs with their section id and then applies the flight plans builder to the data points in each section. The operation in step 4 allows flight plans to be created by subregion in parallel for each subsection in memory, and finally step 5 resolves the subregions based on the <b>section</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} procedure {{for evaluating the}} collapse load and assessing the cross-section classification of thin-walled sections of arbitrary shape {{on the basis of}} Eurocode prescriptions. The procedure is based on two algorithms which address separately the rigid-plastic model adopted by the Eurocode for ordinary steel cross-sections and arbitrary uniaxial constitutive laws typically used for stainless steel and aluminum. Both algorithms are based on a polygonal description of the cross <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> so that integrals extended to the section domain are conveniently expressed as algebraic sums depending upon the coordinates of the section vertices. Accordingly, a further algorithm is illustrated in order to automatically convert the plate and node model adopted by Eurocode to a polygonal description of the section geometry.

40|$|AbstractThe {{anisotropy}} {{properties of}} bulk high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs) {{are taken into}} consideration {{for the application of}} high-temperature superconducting (HTS) Maglev systems, which are especially based on the different flux-trapping capabilities as well as critical current density, Jc, values between the growth <b>section</b> <b>boundary</b> (GSB) and the growth sections (GS) in bulk superconductors. By adjusting the angle between the GSB of bulk HTSCs and the strongest magnetic field position of a permanent magnet guideway (PMG), the levitation force and its relaxation processes are compared at different field-cooling conditions. Experimental results show that the levitation capability and the suppression of levitation force decay can be enhanced by optimizing the GS/GSB alignment of every bulk HTSC above the PMG. Meanwhile, our conclusions may provide references to other HTS maglev systems with small levitation gaps, i. e., superconducting magnetic bearings...|$|E
