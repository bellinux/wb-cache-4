40|$|Belgian judges {{may well}} be among <b>the</b> loneliest <b>of</b> their peers due to Belgium’s legal framework. In an attempt to counter this unfortunate situation, we will start by {{outlining}} some contours of “judicial loneliness” in Belgium through a brief discussion <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>deliberations,</b> <b>the</b> wide-spread unus iudex practice, {{as well as a}} more recent phenomenon: judges who ventilate certain aspirations and/or frustrations often end up being <b>the</b> epicenter <b>of</b> fierce public polemics. Secondly, we will emphasize that the judicial function and its prerogatives have undergone significant change over the last decades thus justifying a new concept of loyalty in order to adequately approach <b>the</b> spreading <b>of</b> critical outcries by magistrates. In a final third part we will briefly state how <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> separate opinions – a well-known common law phenomenon – in the Belgian system could alleviate, to a certain extent, judicial loneliness while boosting public appreciation for the hard work judges are expected to deliver on a daily basis in a growingly pluralist society. <b>The</b> European Court <b>of</b> Human Rights (ECHR) constitutes a valuable example in this respect. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this essay}} I define <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> {{transparency}} – primarily intended as publicity of decision-making and antonym <b>of</b> <b>secrecy</b> – and its semantic evolution in France between the Ancien régime and the Revolution. The absolutist policy {{was based on}} <b>the</b> dogmas <b>of</b> religion, on <b>the</b> secrets kept by the sovereign and by corporations, and on <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judges. This legal and ideological structure is criticized by the Enlightenment which, in its various intellectual forms, denounced <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power, <b>the</b> arbitrariness <b>of</b> judges and their functions carried out covertly. Public opinion and freedom of expression were conceived as powers to exercise against despotism, even in the legal field with the request to marginalize <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process. However, only with the French Revolution, transparency – in the law making process, in <b>the</b> visibility <b>of</b> public affairs, in <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> justice and in <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> power by <b>the</b> citizens – achieved a constitutional value...|$|R

50|$|Data General Corp. v.

After acquiring drawings with a Nova 1200 purchase, Digital Computer Controls designed its own nearly identical minicomputer. Digital Computer Controls maintained that its use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> documentation was proper because Data General Corporation inadequately maintained <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design drawings by distributing them to many customers.

40|$|We {{propose a}} quantum-enhanced {{protocol}} to authenticate classical messages, with improved security {{with respect to}} the classical scheme introduced by Brassard in 1983.

We show that a quantum encoding of secret bits offers more security than the classical XOR function introduced by Brassard. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between <b>the</b> bias <b>of</b> a PRG and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> information about <b>the</b> key that the attacker can retrieve from a block of authenticated messages. Finally, we prove that quantum resources can improve both <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key generated by the PRG and <b>the</b> <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tag obtained with a hidden hash function.
