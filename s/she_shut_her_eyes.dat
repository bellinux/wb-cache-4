60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> for a moment, {{as though}} {{in an effort to}} collect herself.|$|E
6000|$|The {{few seconds}} seemed ages. Instinctively <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and prayed again. 'Oh! God. Give me this man's life that I may atone!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The instant {{his back}} was turned, <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and ran over the paper and the pen-wiper with {{the tips of her}} fingers! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'She'll do,' said Dan, looking her over. 'What's to {{be afraid}} of, lass? Come and kiss me.' He puts his arm round <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> gives {{a bit of a}} squeak, and down goes her face in the side of Dan's flaming-red beard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another wager-bet!" [...] cried Grosse, still {{standing}} behind her, and calling to me. [...] "Twenty thousand pounds {{this time to}} a fourpennies-bit. <b>She</b> has <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to get to you. Hey!" ...|$|R
60|$|Now Swanhild lay in <b>her</b> <b>shut</b> bed; but <b>she</b> {{could not}} sleep, {{because of what}} she saw {{in the eyes of}} Gudruda. Little may she ever sleep again, for when <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> once more <b>she</b> sees that which was written in the dead eyes of Gudruda. So, as she lay, she heard the blows upon the door, and sprang frightened from her bed. Now there was tumult in the hall, for every man rose to his feet in fear, searching for his weapons. Again the loud knocks came.|$|R
6000|$|Albinia {{teased her}} {{so far as}} to cover her with warmed shawls, and force on her a stimulant. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> but {{presently}} opened them to say, 'Please go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and shuddered again. 'It was frightful!' he said, {{holding her}} fast. 'It {{was a great}} mercy, indeed. Thank heaven, it is over! You are not giddy now.' ...|$|E
60|$|She smiled, {{and said}} nothing. Dr. Abury {{gave her a}} little wine in a teaspoon, and she drank it quietly. Then <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, {{but this time she}} was sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Am I hurted bad?' Edna asked, {{and died}} between Nurse Eden's {{dripping}} hands. The sheet fell aside {{and for an}} instant, before <b>she</b> could <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> Mary saw the ripped and shredded body.|$|R
60|$|How great a shock she {{had been}} {{subjected}} to was manifest in a sensation of disgust that overwhelmed <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> even <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to try and blot out the recollection. She felt that {{she had been}} contaminated.|$|R
6000|$|On our way I {{tried to}} cheer her up by {{pointing}} {{out some of the}} children of the Great Mother before alluded to, but <b>she</b> only <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as we rolled down the long avenues, and murmured, [...] "Oh, these cruel, cruel distances!" ...|$|R
60|$|The chill flowers fell on her neck. She {{looked up}} at him, with almost pitiful, scared grey eyes, {{wondering}} what he was doing. Flowers fell on her face, and <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--you--you are as dense as {{the forest}} where you live," [...] she cried. And then <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, {{the better to}} {{remember}} that transfiguration of his face, the better to betray herself.|$|E
60|$|To this Mrs Gordon gave {{a hearty}} assent. Sitting still as she was, with hand {{resting on the}} old woman's arm, <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and prayed fervently for the {{salvation}} of the enslaved man.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> {{paused and}} <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as though <b>she</b> {{were going to}} faint. A strange idea came to Philip, and he spoke it as it came, without {{stopping}} to think it out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then--then--he is safe! Thank God!" [...] <b>she</b> murmured, and <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, {{dizzy and}} overcome, unable even to analyse her {{conviction}} that {{all would be}} well, and that in some manner {{he had come to}} her rescue.|$|R
60|$|Cleopatra {{was so much}} fluttered and moved, by hearing this, of course, incomprehensible speech, that <b>she</b> {{could only}} <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and shake <b>her</b> head, and give Mr Dombey her hand; which Mr Dombey, not exactly {{knowing what to do}} with, dropped.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and looked}} so white that Ben hurried away, and burst upon old Mrs. Paine, placidly {{knitting}} {{at the end}} door, so suddenly that, as she afterward said, [...] "It sca't her like a clap o' thunder." ...|$|E
60|$|She, too, must {{lie there}} in the shadow. Allie shivered with the cool desert wind that blew in her face from the shadowy spaces. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to hide the dim passing traces of terrible Benton and the {{darkness}} that hid the lonely graves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Any way, Cinthy {{said she}} felt jest as ef she was turnin' to stone. She couldn't move nor speak. She lay a minute, and then <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and begun to say her prayers; and a minute after she opened 'em, and it was gone.|$|E
60|$|When he came to, {{as if from}} sleep, {{he seemed}} to be sitting in a {{timeless}} stillness. What was he listening for? He seemed to be listening for some sound a long way off, from beyond life. He remembered his wife. He must go back to her. The child was asleep, the eyelids not quite shut, showing a slight film of black pupil between. Why did <b>she</b> not <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes?</b> <b>Her</b> mouth was also a little open.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is Milly safe?" [...] {{was all she}} asked, {{and being}} assured {{that the child was}} in her mother's arms, and Sammy had gone to tell Grandpa all about it, <b>she</b> smiled and <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with a whispered, [...] "Then it's all right, thank God!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her head will be--and {{a mass of}} it, in a day, I reckon! Why, man, you put enough plaster on it to clothe {{and paper}} {{the dome of the}} Capitol! You drew her scalp {{together}} so that <b>she</b> couldn't <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> without climbing up the bed-post! You mowed her hair off so that she'll have to wear a wig for the next two years--and handed it to her in a beau-ti-ful sealed package! They talk of suing me and killing you out of hand." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the custom}} was established. It was plain {{that the old}} woman counted much on the {{influence}} of the simple Word of God, without comment, for every time she opened the Bible <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and her lips moved in silent prayer before she began to read.|$|E
60|$|His arm was wounded; and the Russian surgeon led {{him aside}} to bind it up. To Olga's amazement, while the surgeon was {{actually}} engaged in binding it, Niaz turned upon {{him like a}} savage dog, and bit his arm till the teeth met fiercely in the very middle. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and half fainted with disgust and horror.|$|E
6000|$|Maggie's {{power of}} {{sacrifice}} {{did not extend}} so far; indeed, I fear she cared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff, than {{that he should be}} pleased with her for giving him the best bit. So <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> quite close, till Tom told her to [...] "say which," [...] and then she said, [...] "Left hand." ...|$|E
50|$|Jane then tortures Bree into telling {{everything}} about the newborns. Bree then pretends to act dumb, and hysterically states that Riley lied to her and everyone else, and they were ignorant of most things, and simply did as they were told, under fear of death. The Volturi decide to kill Bree, but Carlisle and Edward attempt to rescue her, by saying that they would take responsibility for her and teach her the rules. Bree {{can see that it}} is a futile attempt, and Jane confirms it by refusing to spare her life. Jane says that they do not give second chances, as it would adversely affect their reputation as law enforcers, and also warns them that Caius would display an interest in learning that Bella is still human, as he sees her as a threat to vampire secrecy. All of this is beyond Bree's comprehension, and she yearns for it to be over, since Diego, for whom she had developed a romantic affection, is dead. Jane grants her wish by telling Felix to take care of her. Edward warns Bella to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> but Bree believes that Edward is referring to herself. And as <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>she</b> is killed.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is true that}} Mrs. Cliff's {{plans and}} {{purposes}} did not entirely pass without criticism. [...] "It's all very well," [...] said Miss Nancy Shott to Mrs. Ferguson one morning when the latter had called upon her with a little basket of cake and preserves, [...] "for Mrs. Cliff to be sending her money to the colored poor of South America, but {{a person who has}} lived as she has lived in days gone by ought to remember that there are poor people who are not colored, and who live a great deal nearer than South America." [...] Miss Shott was at work as she said this, but she could always talk when she was working. She was busy packing the California blankets, which Mrs. Cliff had given her, in a box for the summer, putting pieces of camphor rolled up in paper between their folds. [...] "If she wanted to find people to give money to, she needn't hire ministers to go out and hunt for them. There are plenty of them here, right under her nose, and if she doesn't see them, it's because <b>she</b> <b>shuts</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> wilfully, and won't look." ...|$|R
60|$|When the ayah {{reached the}} gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out. Twilight came on, and scores and {{hundreds}} of people passed out, including the last one, who always has to run for it, but Maimie saw them not. <b>She</b> had <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tight and glued them with passionate tears. When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart. It was {{the stillness of the}} Gardens. Then she heard clang, then from another part clang, then clang, clang far away. It was the Closing of the Gates.|$|R
60|$|The fall of Kabelaw had the {{peculiar}} effect {{of producing a}} gush of desperation in the tender heart of Nunaga, which amounted, almost, to courage. With a lively shriek <b>she</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> rushed in on the bear, {{and gave it a}} dab in the side, which actually sent her weapon into the flesh about an inch deep, and there it stuck fast.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{and there}} was {{something}} in the sweet, obedient, placid look of her face, as the white moonlight shone upon it, that made her mother pause and gaze again with the feeling, only tenderer, left by a beautiful poem. Amy looked up to see why she delayed; she gave her another kiss, and left her in the moonlight.|$|E
60|$|They had not met {{for five}} years. <b>She</b> <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and looked in}} on her past. It all came back very vividly. She had been {{eighteen}} when they were married--a gay, high-spirited girl and the season's beauty. He was much older and a quiet, serious student. Her friends had wondered why she married him--sometimes she wondered herself, but she had loved him, or thought so.|$|E
60|$|A little shocked silence ensued, then Carley {{found herself}} being led across {{the lower level}} and up the wide stairway. As she mounted to the vast-domed cathedral-like chamber of the station a strange {{sensation}} pierced her with a pang. Not the old thrill of leaving New York or returning! Nor was it the welcome sight of the hurrying, well-dressed throng of travelers and commuters, nor the stately beauty of the station. Carley <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and then <b>she</b> knew. The dim light of vast space above, the looming gray walls, shadowy with tracery of figures, the lofty dome like the blue sky, brought back to her the walls of Oak Creek Canyon and the great caverns under the ramparts. As suddenly as <b>she</b> had <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> Carley opened them to face her friends.|$|R
60|$|It {{was well}} that Christina had {{resolution}} {{to prevent her}} making a fool of herself on the spot, for {{the thought of the}} pathway turned her so dizzy that <b>she</b> could only <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> trusting that <b>her</b> father did not see her terror. Soon the turn round {{to the side of the}} mountain was made, and the road became a mere track worn out on the turf on the hillside, with an abyss beneath, close to the edge of which the mule, of course, walked.|$|R
60|$|Lists {{and letters}} and items, over and over; {{sitting at her}} {{typewriter}} till her shoulder-blades ached and <b>she</b> had to <b>shut</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to the blur of the keys. The racket of office noises all day. The three-o'clock hour when {{she felt that she}} simply could not endure the mill till five o'clock. No interest in anything she wrote. Then the blessed hour of release, the stretching of cramped legs, and the blind creeping to the Subway, the crush in the train, and home to comfort the mother who had been lonely all day.|$|R
