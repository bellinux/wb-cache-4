50|$|The later {{model used}} a Cletrac-type final drive (instead of the automotive-type {{differential}} unit used previously) {{along with many}} other improvements. The engine was mounted {{on the floor of the}} driving cab with the drive taken through a <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> to the transmission. The transmission had four forward gears and one reverse. The suspension consisted of four large pressed-steel disk wheels on each side, mounted in pairs with elliptic springs. Steering involved upright steering levers to four hydraulic brakes on the sprockets and idlers. A spring-loaded pintle was fitted at the rear, and towing hooks were fitted in the front. It had a speed of about 30 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|This type of clutch {{has several}} driving members {{interleaved}} or [...] "stacked" [...] with several driven members. It {{is used in}} racing cars including Formula 1, IndyCar, World Rally and even most club racing. Multiplate clutches see much use in drag racing, which requires the best acceleration possible, and is notorious for the abuse the clutch is subjected to. Thus motorcycles, automatic transmissions and in some diesel locomotives with mechanical transmissions. It is also used in some electronically controlled all-wheel drive systems {{as well as in}} some transfer cases. They can also be found in some heavy machinery such as tanks and AFV's (T-54) and earthmoving equipment (front-end loaders, bulldozers), as well as components in certain types of limited slip differentials. The benefit in the case of motorsports is that you can achieve the same total friction force with a much smaller overall diameter (or conversely, a much greater friction force for the same diameter, important in cases where a vehicle is modified with greater power, yet the maximum physical size of the clutch unit is constrained by the clutch housing). In motorsports vehicles that run at high engine/drivetrain speeds, the smaller diameter reduces rotational inertia, making the drivetrain components accelerate more rapidly, as well as reducing the angular velocity of the outer areas of the clutch unit, which could become highly stressed and fail at the extremely high drivetrain rotational rates achieved in sports such as Formula 1 or drag racing. In the case of heavy equipment, which often deal with very high torque forces and drivetrain loads, a <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> of the necessary strength would be too large to easily package as a component of the driveline.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Conventional {{transmission}} system uses <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> with a manual transmission gear box. Disengage clutch, Change gear, Gradually engage clutch thus three operations {{are to be}} performed while moving from one gear to another, hence in all 15 operations are performed {{to move to the}} top gear, {{it is important to note}} out of the 15 operations performed to reach the top gear… 10 operations are clutch operations, hence making clutch operations automatic will reduce human effort. Automatic clutch control has another advantage, i. e, out of three pedals ie, one of accelerator pedal, Brake Pedal, Clutch pedal eliminating the clutch pedal will lead to easy driving as the controls become simple. Many methods of automatic clutch control namely electro-magnetic clutch, pneumatic clutch control etc have been tried but due inherent disadvantages and maintenance problems they have been replaced back by conventional method. The auto-disengagement single clutch employs only one set of compression springs instead of the usual two sets, with this arrangement it is possible to reduce the weights of the centrifugal members. The modified system utilizes the centrifugal force developed by engine acceleration, whereas the temporary dis-engagement of clutch required at the time of gear change is a solenoid actuated by switch in gear change knob. The hold time of the solenoid is only a few seconds thus prolongs solenoid life and reduces power consumption from battery...|$|E

50|$|The Juwel 6 was {{powered by}} a newly {{developed}} 6-cylinder side-valve engine of 2.46 litres, mounted ahead of the driver and delivering 45 hp at 3,200 rpm. The larger 3.1-litre 55 hp engine first seen on the Typs ASK / ALK, could be specified as an option.

40|$|To {{transmit}} the drive, {{in form of}} rotation, produced during the combustion process in the cylinders to the gearbox, where it is transformed into different ratios, a coupling element is needed. This is {{the task of the}} clutch. The clutch is the part that enables a gear change. A disconnection between constantly-spinning crankshaft and the gearbox must be realized to be able to stand still as well as to change gears. Among many principles in design, the classical friction <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> has established it ` position in vehicle design. Especially, race car rules predict the use of conventional multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutches</b> (in some cases <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> <b>clutches</b> are also used) which transmit engine torque into the gearbox via friction. A traditional multi <b>plate</b> <b>clutch</b> is composed of three basic elements: the flywheel, the pressure <b>plate</b> and the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> (in race car practice, 4 plates are the limit). The flywheel is attached {{to the end of the}} main crankshaft and the <b>clutch</b> <b>plates</b> are attached to the gearbox input shaft using a spline. When a axial load is applied to the assembly, the friction produced between plates prevents any rotation between them and a solid drive is established without any additional mechanical engagement. While a breakthrough was made with the new generation clutches in the 1980 `s, made with Carbon as friction material, the current situation in this field of the transmission is saturated. All inventions lead to some improvements in the general design field, where the main improvement happens in the whole concept of the transmission (DSG or CVT) ...|$|R

This engine was {{more powerful than}} other tractors of this age and weight, with 190 hp at the engine and 150 drawbar hp. However the fuel consumption was also high, at 9.8 gallons per hour at full rate. The transmission was initially three-speed manual and a high-low-reverse splitter gearbox with a relatively small Borg & Beck 18 inch <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> dry <b>clutch.</b> This small <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> {{had a reputation for}} early failure if worked hard.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{clutches}} damp torsional vibrations. Both running-wheels, {{pump and}} turbine, correspond to two masses, which are coupled by fluid. The masses replace the double-mass-flywheel of passenger-cars. In {{the case of}} fuel cut-off in the overturn, hydrodynamic clutches {{can be used as}} a retarder. Compared to <b>single</b> dry <b>plate</b> <b>clutches,</b> hydrodynamic clutches transfer the power without wear. The present doctoral dissertation describes construction and experimental testing of two hydrodynamic clutches. The blades of one of the two running-wheels swing round radial axes. The angle of attack variates. The tests fhow higher efficiency compared to hydrodynamic clutches with axial movable blades. The designed hydrodynamic clutches offer substantial lower switching times than clutches with volumetric control.

40|$|AbstractIntelligent {{mechatronic}} systems, such as self-optimizing systems, {{allow an}} adaptation of the system behavior at runtime based on the current situation. To do so, they generally select among several pre-defined working points. A common method to determine working points for a mechatronic system is to use model-based multiobjective optimization. It allows finding compromises among conflicting objectives, called objective functions, by adapting parameters. To evaluate the system behavior for different parameter sets, {{a model of the}} system behavior is included in the objective functions and is evaluated during each function call. Intelligent mechatronic systems also have the ability to adapt their behavior based on their current reliability, thus increasing their availability, or on changed safety requirements; all of which are summed up by the common term dependability. To allow this adaptation, dependability can be considered in multiobjective optimization by including dependability-related objective functions. However, whereas performance-related objective functions are easily found, formulation of dependability-related objective functions is highly system-specific and not intuitive, making it complex and error-prone. Since each mechatronic system is different, individual failure modes have to be taken into account, which need to be found using common methods such as Failure-Modes and Effects Analysis or Fault Tree Analysis. Using component degradation models, which again are specific to the system at hand, the main loading factors can be determined. By including these in the model of the system behavior, the relation between working point and dependability can be formulated as an objective function. In our work, this approach is presented in more detail. It is exemplified using an actively actuated <b>single</b> <b>plate</b> dry <b>clutch</b> system. Results show that this approach is suitable for formulating dependability-related objective functions and that these can be used to extend system lifetime by adapting system behavior...|$|R
