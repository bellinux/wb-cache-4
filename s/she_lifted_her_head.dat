5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{out of the water and}} saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> instantly; {{her eyes}} flashed through her tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> with joy, {{then she}} shook it mistrustfully.|$|E
60|$|A strong shudder {{passed through}} Mrs. Leigh's frame, and then <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> up <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> noble <b>head.</b> <b>Her</b> grand, guileless {{gray eyes}} rested on {{me with a}} look of patient reproach.|$|R
60|$|He was {{surprised}} to see that <b>she</b> had <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> suddenly, with a quick look that however changed to an amused and half coquettish smile.|$|R
60|$|Tears were {{streaming}} down the girl's face as <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Joscelyn's face, {{that had}} grown pale, flamed scarlet again. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> proudly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She was pale, but {{her dark}} eyes had an indignant sparkle in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] at last said my quiet companion, as stirless in her {{happiness}} as a {{mouse in}} its terror. Even now in speaking <b>she</b> scarcely <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|She heard him. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> feebly declining <b>head.</b> <b>She</b> looked. She knew.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> again <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and told}} him that that would have been impossible. Let things go as they might, she knew that she had been right in leaving her aunt's house.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> There {{was still}} {{something}} of {{the look of a}} scared child in her face.|$|E
60|$|It {{was said}} seriously. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for a moment, so that I could examine her face.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{felt his}} grip upon her {{shoulder}} grow almost painful, {{but her eyes}} shone softly when <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "it will be but begun. Oh, cruel man! I {{know the}} reason of your coming. You come to murder the babe that shall be born of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I been fainting? have I been sleeping?" [...] {{she said}} to me in low, bewildered tones. [...] "Am I just awake? Is this Browndown?" [...] <b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> [...] "Nugent! are you there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> up <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him. There was a new-born note in her voice, a tremulous note of joy {{in the midst of}} sorrow. It was of her he was thinking! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{and looked}} at him in a slow way. She seemed to be remembering. The tears lay on her hollow cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{from his}} {{shoulder}} he looked round {{the room and}} said, [...] "But, mother, this ghost-room has got to go." ...|$|E
60|$|He did not go, and {{she played}} {{more and more}} softly, languidly, aimlessly. Once <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> to speak, but did not say anything.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> did <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{with the}} {{singular}} wild grace always {{a part of}} her actions, with that old unconscious intimation of innocence which always tortured Venters, but now with something more--a spirit rising from the depths that linked itself to his brave words.|$|R
60|$|She {{must say}} SOMETHING; <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> bowed golden <b>head</b> {{and asked him}} stammeringly {{to give her a}} few days for--for consideration.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for endless spring, [...] For {{everlasting}} blossoming! [...] 10 [...] Both Roses flourish, Red and White. [...] In {{love and}} sisterly delight [...] The two {{that were at}} strife are blended, [...] And all old sorrows now are ended.-- [...] Joy! joy to both! but most to her [...] Who is the Flower of Lancaster! [...] Behold her how She smiles to day [...] On this great throng, this bright array! [...] Fair greeting doth she send to all [...] From {{every corner of the}} Hall; [...] 20 [...] But, chiefly, from above the Board [...] Where sits in state our rightful Lord, [...] A Clifford to his own restored.|$|R
60|$|Blanca blushed {{and looked}} embarrassed, {{but the next}} moment <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{with an air of}} pride. There was a sparkle in her deep blue eyes.|$|E
60|$|She made no reply, {{the subject}} {{seemed to have}} passed from her mind. But {{presently}} <b>she</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> again, and in her turn asked a question.|$|E
6000|$|I {{called her}} from where I stood--"Annabel Lee!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and shook back her hair, {{and gazed at}} me startled and intent. I went nearer.|$|E
60|$|He made a {{momentary}} gesture towards the red-haired {{woman on the}} bench. <b>She</b> had <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> at last and the tears were drying on her splendid face. But the {{eyes were fixed on}} the corpse with an electric glare that had in it something of idiocy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll do my best," [...] promised Anne, burying {{her face}} in Marilla's lap. [...] "Gracious heavenly Father--that's the way the ministers say it in church, so I suppose it's all right in private prayer, isn't it?" [...] <b>she</b> interjected, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> for a moment.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> up <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looked}} darkly round {{at him for}} a moment; then laid it down again, and curved her right arm about her neck, as a woman in a fever, or in an agony of pain from a shot, might twist herself.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{a little}} as she gasped out these words with an {{intensity}} of utterance that thrilled her hearer--a powerful, penetrating earnestness that burned like fire.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{with the}} steady light of {{resolution}} shining again in her grand, gray eyes. Her low, sweet voice answered him, without a faltering note in it, ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> from him, relinquishingly. With {{a little}} {{breaking}} away, {{he moved out}} of bed, and was taking his clothes. She stretched out her hand to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] asked Annie, bending down; <b>she</b> laughed, in <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> [...] "I promised Idella you'd let us {{have some}} {{preserves}} to-day, Mrs. Bolton." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the instant}} afterward, she moved--before he had {{completely}} {{passed over the}} space between them. Her still figure began to tremble. <b>She</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> drooping <b>head.</b> For a moment there was a shrinking in her--as {{if she had been}} touched by something. She seemed to recognize the touch: she was still again.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all I wished you to say," [...] <b>she</b> replied, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{and looking}} him radiantly in the face. [...] "I don't {{want you to}} go at all! I only want you to promise that you'll come here every night that you're invited out, and read to Mrs. Bowen and me." ...|$|R
