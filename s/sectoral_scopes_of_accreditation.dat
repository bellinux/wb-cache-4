40|$|In a usual {{country level}} MARKAL, {{the role of}} the demand has been {{neglected}} for a long time. Over decades, it remained inelastic (Abilock et al. 1979), then piecewise constant (Loulou & Lavigne 1996), until it was connected to rest of the economy (A. Manne, MARKAL-MACRO 1992). The optimal configuration consisted of competing technologies, and technologies only. Demand-side management measures were modelled through sets of measures described as technologies that were with zero or low cost and therefore always used to their full potential. Putting bounds on their penetration was subjective and depended upon the modeller and his good sense. Another important disadvantage of this approach was that the model could become remote-controlled through bounds on demand-side management.

METHODS: Urine processing was optimized for centrifugation conditions {{on the basis of}} microparticle counts at room temperature (RT) and at 4 degrees C. The optimal protocol was validated for performance (microparticle counts), and for reproducibility and robustness for centrifugation temperature (4 degrees C vs. RT) and brake speed (soft, medium, hard). Acceptance criteria were based on microparticle counts, cystatin C and creatinine concentrations, and the metabolomic profile. RESULTS: The optimal protocol was a 20 -min, 12, 000 g centrifugation at 4 degrees C, and was validated for urine collection in terms of microparticle counts. All reproducibility acceptance criteria were met. The protocol was robust for centrifugation at 4 degrees C versus RT for all parameters. The protocol was considered robust overall in terms of brake speeds, although a hard brake gave significantly fewer microparticles than a soft brake.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nontyphoidal {{salmonellosis}} {{continues to}} pose a global threat to human health, primarily by causing food-borne illnesses, and food-producing animals are the principal reservoirs of many pathogenic serovars. To identify key control points and generate information that may enable future estimation of the transmission routes between the environment, animals, and humans, we examined data on Salmonella isolates in South Africa. METHODS: Samples were obtained from livestock and poultry on farms, meat at abattoirs, raw materials at feed mills, animal feed, and environmental sources (eg, poultry houses, abattoirs, feed mills, water) from 2012 to 2014 in compliance with each establishment's protocols conforming to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (ISO/TS 17728, ISO 18593 : 2004 and ISO 17604 : 2003) standards. Isolation and serotyping of Salmonella were performed according to the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>of</b> the respective laboratories conforming to ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 standard techniques. RESULTS: Salmonella was isolated from 9031 of 180 298 (5. 0 %) samples, and these isolates were distributed among 188 different serovars. Salmonella Enteritidis was the most frequent isolate, with 1944 of 180 298 (21. 5 %) originating from poultry on farms, poultry meat, and poultry houses, followed by Salmonella Havana, with 677 of 180 298 (7. 5 %), mostly from environmental samples. Serovars that are uncommonly associated with human disease (Salmonella Idikan, Salmonella Salford, and Salmonella Brancaster) were isolated at higher frequencies than Salmonella Typhimurium, a common cause of human illness. Environmental samples accounted for 3869 of 9031 (42. 8 %) samples positive for Salmonella. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the frequent isolation of Salmonella {{of a wide variety}} of serovars, from an array of animal feeds, food animals, and food animal environment. As prevention of human salmonellosis requires the effective control of Salmonella in food animals, these data can be used to facilitate Salmonella control in food animals and thereby prevent human infections...|$|R
40|$|Background: Formal method {{validation}} for biospecimen processing in {{the context}} <b>of</b> <b>accreditation</b> in laboratories and biobanks is lacking. Serum and plasma processing protocols were validated for fitness-for-purpose in terms of key downstream endpoints, and this article demonstrates methodology for biospecimen processing method validation. Methods: Serum and plasma preparation from human blood was optimized for centrifugation conditions with respect to microparticle counts. Optimal protocols were validated for methodology and reproducibility in terms of acceptance criteria based on microparticle counts, DNA and hemoglobin concentration, and metabolomic and proteomic profiles. These parameters were also used to evaluate robustness for centrifugation temperature (4 °C versus room temperature [RT]), deceleration (low, medium, high) and blood stability (after a 2 -hour delay). Results: Optimal protocols were 10 -min centrifugation for serum and 20 -min for plasma at 2000 g, medium brake, RT. Methodology and reproducibility acceptance criteria were met for both protocols except for reproducibility of plasma metabolomics. Overall, neither protocol was robust for centrifugation at 4 °C versus RT. RT gave higher microparticles and free DNA yields in serum, and fewer microparticles with less hemolysis in plasma. Overall, both protocols were robust for fast, medium, and low deceleration, with a medium brake considered optimal. Pre-centrifugation stability after a 2 -hour delay was seen at both temperatures for hemoglobin concentration and proteomics, but not for microparticle counts.
