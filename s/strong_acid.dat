5|$|H. aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid, a {{reducing}} agent and relatively <b>strong</b> <b>acid.</b> This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{sulfonic}} acids, TsOH is a <b>strong</b> organic <b>acid.</b> It {{is about one}} million times <b>stronger</b> than benzoic <b>acid.</b> It {{is one of the}} few <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> that is solid and, hence, conveniently weighed. Also, unlike some <b>strong</b> mineral <b>acids</b> (especially nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid), TsOH is non-oxidizing.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the {{complete}} dissociation of <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> in aqueous solution, {{the concentration of}} hydronium ions in the water {{is equal to the}} total concentration (ionized and un-ionized) of the acid introduced to solution: [...] = [...] = total and pH = −log. No <b>acid</b> species <b>stronger</b> than H3O+(aq) can exist in aqueous solution, as any <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> is converted to H3O+. The acidity of the <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> is said to be leveled to the acidity of hydronium ion.|$|R

5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>strong</b> <b>acid,</b> HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
50|$|Sulfonic <b>acids</b> {{are much}} <b>stronger</b> <b>acids</b> than the {{corresponding}} carboxylic acids. p-Toluenesulfonic acid, with a pKa of −2.8, {{is about a}} million times <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> than benzoic acid, with a pKa of 4.2. Similarly, methanesulfonic acid, pKa = −1.9, is also about one million times <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> than acetic acid. Because of their polarity, sulfonic acids tend to be crystalline solids. They are also usually colourless and nonoxidizing, which is convenient. Because of their high acidity, sulfonic acids are often soluble in water or exhibit detergent-like properties.|$|R

5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very <b>strong</b> <b>acid,</b> such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{itself is}} {{protected}} from the <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize existing acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{strength}} of an acid is generally discussed {{as a unique}} feature of the acid itself according to its chemical structure. <b>Strong</b> <b>acids</b> have a lower pKa value, and weak acids have a higher one. In the classrooms of high schools and universities, we sometimes use the technical terms “strong acid ” and “weak acid”. However, there are some acids {{for which it is}} very difficult to say, from their pKa values, whether they are strong or weak. This research addresses the distinction between <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> and weak acids, in a restricted initial concentration of acids, to provide a clear distinction between <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> and weak acids...|$|R
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E

25|$|In a <b>strong</b> <b>acid,</b> {{equilibrium}} lies {{far to the}} right, {{meaning that}} almost all of the original HA is dissociated at equilibrium. A <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> yields a weak conjugate base (A−), so a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> is also described as an acid whose conjugate base is a much weaker base than water.|$|E
25|$|HF is {{the only}} hydrohalic acid that is not {{considered}} a <b>strong</b> <b>acid,</b> i.e. it does not fully ionize in dilute aqueous solutions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>acids</b> are {{distinguished}} from weak acids (see below), in which dissociation is incomplete and is represented as an equilibrium, not a completed reaction. The typical {{definition of a}} weak acid is any acid that does not dissociate completely. The difference separating the acid dissociation constants of <b>strong</b> <b>acids</b> from all other acids {{is so great that}} this is a reasonable demarcation.|$|R

25|$|The {{strength}} of an acid refers to its ability or tendency {{to lose a}} proton (H+). A <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent). In water, one mole of a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> HA dissolves yielding one mole of H+ (as hydronium ion H3O+) and one mole of the conjugate base, A−. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%.|$|E
