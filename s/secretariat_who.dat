500|$|Thoroughbred {{horses are}} {{primarily}} bred for racing under saddle at the gallop. Thoroughbreds are often {{known for being}} either distance runners or sprinters, and their conformation usually reflects {{what they have been}} bred to do. Sprinters are usually well muscled, while stayers, or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer. The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse. Although there have been champion racehorses of every height, from Zenyatta who stood 17.2 hands, to Man o' War and <b>Secretariat</b> <b>who</b> both stood at 16.2 hands, down to Hyperion, who was only 15.1, the best racehorses are generally of average size. [...] Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet, predisposing them to lameness. [...] Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them, especially in the starting gate. Historically, Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size: [...] the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13.3hands high. By 1876 this had increased to 15.3.|$|E
500|$|Twice a Prince {{reared in}} the {{starting}} gate, which delayed the start. Out of the starting gate, Shecky Greene set the pace for the field, while race favorite Secretariat started in last place. Exiting the gate, Sham hit his mouth against the gate and subsequently bumped into Navajo before gaining proper stride. Sham briefly took the lead around the quarter-mile marker, but Shecky Greene quickly retook the lead. Beginning the first turn, Secretariat had moved ahead of only two horses; however, in the next quarter-mile Secretariat moved into sixth position. A half-mile in, Shecky Greene maintained a three length lead over Gold Bag, but his pace had slowed compared to the first quarter. Sham remained close {{to the front of}} the field within the top four for the first half of the race; he moved into second position as the field reached the half-mile post. At the three-quarters post, at the start of the homestretch, Shecky Greene began to fade and Sham overtook him to move into first going into the final furlong. <b>Secretariat,</b> <b>who</b> had passed his competitors on the outside throughout the race, overtook Sham in the final furlong and pulled ahead, finishing [...] horse lengths in front of Sham. Our Native took third and Forego, who went on to win multiple Eclipse Awards as an older horse, was fourth.|$|E
