60|$|Thus shall {{there be}} made two Bows of Colours, an {{interior}} and stronger, by one Reflexion in the Drops, and an exterior and fainter by two; for the Light becomes fainter by every Reflexion. And their Colours shall {{lie in a}} contrary Order to one another, the red of both Bows bordering upon the Space GF, which is between the Bows. The Breadth of the interior Bow EOF measured cross the Colours shall be 1 Degr. 45 Min. and the Breadth of the exterior GOH shall be 3 Degr. 10 Min. and {{the distance between them}} GOF shall be 8 Gr. 15 Min. the greatest <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the innermost, that is, the Angle POF being 42 Gr. 2 Min. and the least <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the outermost POG, being 50 Gr. 57 Min. These are the Measures of the Bows, as they would be were the Sun but a Point; for by the Breadth of his Body, the Breadth of the Bows will be increased, and their Distance decreased by half a Degree, and so the breadth of the interior Iris will be 2 Degr. 15 Min. that of the exterior 3 Degr. 40 Min. their distance 8 Degr. 25 Min. the greatest <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the interior Bow 42 Degr. 17 Min. and the least of the exterior 50 Degr. 42 Min. And such are the Dimensions of the Bows in the Heavens found to be very nearly, when their Colours appear strong and perfect. For once, by such means as I then had, I measured the greatest <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the interior Iris about 42 Degrees, and the breadth of the red, yellow and green in that Iris 63 or 64 Minutes, besides the outmost faint red obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, for which we may allow 3 or 4 Minutes more. The breadth of the blue was about 40 Minutes more besides the violet, which was so much obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, that I could not measure its breadth. But supposing the breadth of the blue and violet together to equal that of the red, yellow and green together, the whole breadth of this Iris will be about 2-1/4 Degrees, as above. The least distance between this Iris and the exterior Iris was about 8 Degrees and 30 Minutes. The exterior Iris was broader than the interior, but so faint, especially on the blue side, that I could not measure its breadth distinctly. At another time when both Bows appeared more distinct, I measured the breadth of the interior Iris 2 Gr. 10´, and the breadth of the red, yellow and green in the exterior Iris, was to the breadth of the same Colours in the interior as 3 to 2.|$|E
60|$|Obs. 6. The Diameter of {{the sixth}} Ring at the most lucid part of its Orbit was 58/100 parts of an Inch, and the Diameter of the Sphere on which the double convex Object-glass was ground was about 102 Feet, and hence I {{gathered}} {{the thickness of the}} Air or Aereal Interval of the Glasses at that Ring. But some time after, suspecting that in making this Observation I had not determined the Diameter of the Sphere with sufficient accurateness, and being uncertain whether the Plano-convex Glass was truly plane, and not something concave or convex on that side which I accounted plane; and whether I had not pressed the Glasses together, as I often did, to make them touch; (For by pressing such Glasses together their parts easily yield inwards, and the Rings thereby become sensibly broader than they would be, did the Glasses keep their Figures.) I repeated the Experiment, and found the Diameter {{of the sixth}} lucid Ring about 55/100 parts of an Inch. I repeated the Experiment also with such an Object-glass of another Telescope as I had at hand. This was a double Convex ground on both sides to one and the same Sphere, and its Focus was distant from it 83-2/5 Inches. And thence, if the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of the bright yellow Light be assumed in proportion as 11 to 17, the Diameter of the Sphere to which the Glass was figured will by computation be found 182 Inches. This Glass I laid upon a flat one, so that the black Spot appeared {{in the middle of the}} Rings of Colours without any other Pressure than that of the weight of the Glass. And now measuring the Diameter of the fifth dark Circle as accurately as I could, I found it the fifth part of an Inch precisely. This Measure was taken with the points of a pair of Compasses on the upper Surface on the upper Glass, and my Eye was about eight or nine Inches distance from the Glass, almost perpendicularly over it, and the Glass was 1/6 of an Inch thick, and thence it is easy to collect that the true Diameter of the Ring between the Glasses was greater than its measur'd Diameter above the Glasses in the Proportion of 80 to 79, or thereabouts, and by consequence equal to 16/79 parts of an Inch, and its true <b>Semi-diameter</b> equal to 8/79 parts. Now as the Diameter of the Sphere (182 Inches) is to the <b>Semi-diameter</b> of this fifth dark Ring (8/79 parts of an Inch) so is this <b>Semi-diameter</b> to the thickness of the Air at this fifth dark Ring; which is therefore 32/567931 or 100/1774784. Parts of an Inch; and the fifth Part thereof, viz. the 1/88739 Part of an Inch, is the Thickness of the Air at the first of these dark Rings.|$|E

60|$|We made no {{more land}} till we {{came into the}} {{latitude}} of 62°, when we saw some islands at a great distance, {{on both sides of}} us; we believed them to be islands, because we saw many of them with large openings between. But we were all so willing to get into a warmer climate, that we did not incline to put in anywhere, till, having run thus fifteen days and the wind still holding southerly, with small alteration and clear weather, we could easily perceive the climate to change, and the weather grow milder. And here taking an observation, I found we were in the latitude of 50° 30', and that our meridian distance from the Ladrones west was 87°, being almost one <b>semi-diameter</b> of the globe, so that we could not be far from the coast of America, which was my next design, and indeed the chief design of the whole voyage.|$|E
60|$|Now by {{what has}} been said, it's certain that the Rays which differ in Refrangibility do not {{converge}} to the same Focus; but if they flow from a lucid Point, {{as far from the}} Lens on one side as their Foci are on the other, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the Lens than that of the least refrangible, by above the fourteenth Part of the whole distance; and if they flow from a lucid Point, so very remote from the Lens, that before their Incidence they may be accounted parallel, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the Lens than the Focus of the least refrangible, by about the 27th or 28th Part of their whole distance from it. And the Diameter of the Circle in the middle Space between those two Foci which they illuminate, when they fall there on any Plane, perpendicular to the Axis (which Circle is the least into which they can all be gathered) is about the 55th Part of the Diameter of the Aperture of the Glass. So that 'tis a wonder, that Telescopes represent Objects so distinct as they do. But were all the Rays of Light equally refrangible, the Error arising only from the Sphericalness of the Figures of Glasses would be many hundred times less. For, if the Object-glass of a Telescope be Plano-convex, and the Plane side be turned towards the Object, and the Diameter of the Sphere, whereof this Glass is a Segment, be called D, and the <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the Aperture of the Glass be called S, and the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air, be to the Sine of Refraction as I to R; the Rays which come parallel to the Axis of the Glass, shall in the Place where the Image of the Object is most distinctly made, be scattered all over a little Circle, whose Diameter is (Rq/Iq) × (S cub./D quad.) very nearly,[H] as I gather by computing the Errors of the Rays by the Method of infinite Series, and rejecting the Terms, whose Quantities are inconsiderable. As for instance, if the Sine of Incidence I, be to the Sine of Refraction R, as 20 to 31, and if D the Diameter of the Sphere, to which the Convex-side of the Glass is ground, be 100 Feet or 1200 Inches, and S the <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the Aperture be two Inches, the Diameter of the little Circle, (that is (Rq × S cub.)/(Iq × D quad.)) will be (31 × 31 × 8)/(20 × 20 × 1200 × 1200) (or 961/72000000) Parts of an Inch. But the Diameter of the little Circle, through which these Rays are scattered by unequal Refrangibility, will be about the 55th Part of the Aperture of the Object-glass, which here is four Inches. And therefore, the Error arising from the Spherical Figure of the Glass, is to the Error arising from the different Refrangibility of the Rays, as 961/72000000 to 4/55, that is as 1 to 5449; and therefore being in comparison so very little, deserves not to be considered.|$|E
60|$|And, indeed, it was {{not long}} before I had my desire. I found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards which being as steep as a house side, nothing could descend on me from the top. On the side of this rock, was a little hollow place, {{resembling}} the entrance or door of a cave. Just before this place; on the circle of the green, I resolved my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a delightful green, before my door, with a pleasing, though an irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea-side, lying on the N. W. side of the hill, so that it was sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this, I drew a semi-circle, containing ten yards in a <b>semi-diameter,</b> and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows; of strong stakes, not 6 inches from each other. Then with the pieces of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove another row of piles looking within side against them, between two or three feet high, which made me conclude it a little impregnable castle against men and beasts. And for my better security I would have no door, but entered in and came out by the help of a ladder, which I also made.|$|E

60|$|And of {{the same}} kind with these Experiments are those that follow. If two plane polish'd Plates of Glass (suppose two pieces of a polish'd Looking-glass) be laid together, so that their sides be {{parallel}} and at a very small distance from one another, and then their lower edges be dipped into Water, the Water will rise up between them. And the less the distance of the Glasses is, the greater will be the height to which the Water will rise. If the distance be about the hundredth part of an Inch, the Water will rise to the height of about an Inch; and if the distance be greater or less in any Proportion, the height will be reciprocally proportional to the distance very nearly. For the attractive Force of the Glasses is the same, whether the distance between them be greater or less; and the weight of the Water drawn up is the same, if the height of it be reciprocally proportional to the distance of the Glasses. And in like manner, Water ascends between two Marbles polish'd plane, when their polish'd sides are parallel, and at a very little distance from one another, And if slender Pipes of Glass be dipped at one end into stagnating Water, the Water will rise up within the Pipe, and the height to which it rises will be reciprocally proportional to the Diameter of the Cavity of the Pipe, and will equal the height to which it rises between two Planes of Glass, if the <b>Semi-diameter</b> of the Cavity of the Pipe be equal to the distance between the Planes, or thereabouts.

60|$|But {{you will}} say, if the Errors {{caused by the}} {{different}} Refrangibility be so very great, how comes it to pass, that Objects appear through Telescopes so distinct as they do? I answer, 'tis because the erring Rays are not scattered uniformly over all that Circular Space, but collected infinitely more densely in the Center {{than in any other}} Part of the Circle, and in the Way from the Center to the Circumference, grow continually rarer and rarer, so as at the Circumference to become infinitely rare; and by reason of their Rarity are not strong enough to be visible, unless in the Center and very near it. Let ADE [in Fig. 27.] represent one of those Circles described with the Center C, and <b>Semi-diameter</b> AC, and let BFG be a smaller Circle concentrick to the former, cutting with its Circumference the Diameter AC in B, and bisect AC in N; and by my reckoning, the Density of the Light in any Place B, will be to its Density in N, as AB to BC; and the whole Light within the lesser Circle BFG, will be to the whole Light within the greater AED, as the Excess of the Square of AC above the Square of AB, is to the Square of AC. As if BC be the fifth Part of AC, the Light will be four times denser in B than in N, and the whole Light within the less Circle, will be to the whole Light within the greater, as nine to twenty-five. Whence it's evident, that the Light within the less Circle, must strike the Sense much more strongly, than that faint and dilated Light round about between it and the Circumference of the greater.|$|E
6000|$|This Bow never appears, {{but where}} it rains in the Sun-shine, {{and may be}} made artificially by {{spouting}} up Water which may break aloft, and scatter into Drops, and fall down like Rain. For the Sun shining upon these Drops certainly causes the Bow to appear to a Spectator standing in a due Position to the Rain and Sun. And hence it is now agreed upon, that this Bow is made by Refraction of the Sun's Light in drops of falling Rain. This was understood {{by some of the}} Antients, and of late more fully discover'd and explain'd by the famous Antonius de Dominis Archbishop of Spalato, in his book De Radiis Visûs & Lucis, published by his Friend Bartolus at Venice, in the Year 1611, and written above 20 Years before. For he teaches there how the interior Bow is made in round Drops of Rain by two Refractions of the Sun's Light, and one Reflexion between them, and the exterior by two Refractions, and two sorts of Reflexions between them in each Drop of Water, and proves his Explications by Experiments made with a Phial full of Water, and with Globes of Glass filled with Water, and placed in the Sun to make the Colours of the two Bows appear in them. The same Explication Des-Cartes hath pursued in his Meteors, and mended that of the exterior Bow. But whilst they understood not the true Origin of Colours, it's necessary to pursue it here a little farther. For understanding therefore how the Bow is made, let a Drop of Rain, or any other spherical transparent Body be represented by the Sphere BNFG, [in Fig. 14.] described with the Center C, and <b>Semi-diameter</b> CN. And let AN be one of the Sun's Rays incident upon it at N, and thence refracted to F, where let it either go out of the Sphere by Refraction towards V, or be reflected to G; and at G let it either go out by Refraction to R, or be reflected to H; and at H let it go out by Refraction towards S, cutting the incident Ray in Y. Produce AN and RG, till they meet in X, and upon AX and NF, let fall the Perpendiculars CD and CE, and produce CD till it fall upon the Circumference at L. Parallel to the incident Ray AN draw the Diameter BQ, and let the Sine of Incidence out of Air into Water be to the Sine of Refraction as I to R. Now, if you suppose the Point of Incidence N to move from the Point B, continually till it come to L, the Arch QF will first increase and then decrease, and so will the Angle AXR which the Rays AN and GR contain; and the Arch QF and Angle AXR will be biggest when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(3)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 2R to I. Also the Angle AYS, which the Rays AN and HS contain will first decrease, and then increase and grow least when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(8)RR, in which case NE will be to ND, as 3R to I. And so the Angle which the next emergent Ray (that is, the emergent Ray after three Reflexions) contains with the incident Ray AN will come to its Limit when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(15)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 4R to I. And the Angle which the Ray next after that Emergent, that is, the Ray emergent after four Reflexions, contains with the Incident, will come to its Limit, when ND is to CN as sqrt(II - RR) to sqrt(24)RR, in which case NE will be to ND as 5R to I; and so on infinitely, the Numbers 3, 8, 15, 24, &c. being gather'd by continual Addition of the Terms of the arithmetical Progression 3, 5, 7, 9, &c.

5000|$|German mooring methods {{differed}} significantly from those {{adopted by the}} British. To quote Pugsley (1981): [...] "the Germans, originally for ease of transport and for economy, developed a system using much lower masts. The nose of the ship was tethered as before to the mast head, which was only a little higher than the <b>semi-diameter</b> of the ship's hull. The lower fin at the stern was then fixed to a heavy carriage running on a circular railway track around the mast, and this carriage was powered {{so as to be}} able to move around the track to keep the ship head on to the wind. In the most sophisticated form, used by the Hindenburg, the rail system was linked to rails running from the mast straight into the airship shed, and the mast was powered so that the ship could be moved mechanically into the shed, complete with mast and stern carriage".The following account of landing the German airship Graf Zeppelin is abridged from Dick and Robinson (1985):Before attempting a landing, contact was made by radio or flag signals with the ground crew to determine the ground temperature and wind conditions. For a normal calm weather landing the ship was trimmed very slightly nose down, as this gave a better gliding angle and the ship almost flew herself down. A smoky fire was started on the ground to show the wind direction. The ship then made a long approach with a rate of fall of 100 feet per minute, and the lines were dropped when she was over the landing flag. When conditions were unusual, as in gusty and bumpy weather, the Graf was weighed off a little light, and the approach had to be fast and preferably long and low.When the airship was over the field the engines had to be reversed for some time to stop her, and this also helped to get the nose down. Yaw lines dropped from the ship's nose were drawn out to Port and Starboard by thirty men each, while twenty more on each side pulled the ship down with spider lines (so called because twenty short lines radiated like the legs of a spider from a block). When the airship reached the ground, fifty men held the control car rails and twenty held those of the after car. With thirty men in reserve, the ground crew totalled two hundred men.The ground crew would then walk the Graf to a short, or ‘stub’, mast, to which the nose of the airship would be attached. The airship would then rest on the ground with its rear gondola attached to a movable weighted carriage that enabled the airship to swing around the mast with the wind. In some places the stub mast was mounted on rails and could be drawn into the airship hangar, guiding the nose of the ship while the tail was controlled by the carriage attached to the rear gondola. Airships designed for landing on the ground had pneumatic bumper bags or undercarriage wheels under the main and rear gondolas (or tail fin).Dick states that the Germans never used mooring masts until the Graf Zeppelin entered service in 1928, and never moored to high masts. To some extent this probably reflects the conservatism of the Zeppelin company operations. Long experience in handling airships in all sorts of conditions was valued and innovations or significant changes in practice were unlikely to be adopted unless clear advantages were apparent.|$|E

The observations taken {{in the year of}} 2001 were special because, for the first time, they can be compared with other equivalent series, and because the Sun passed by a second maximum of its cycle of activity. The observed data were at first selected, by leaving out the values relative to unsuccessful measurements. We dealt with the errors in the observed values originating from the instability of the objective prism, which increases the east values and diminishes the west ones. Then, it was possible to remove the errors by comparing the East and West series. Next, the observational conditions were investigated: the air temperature, the Fried's parameter, and the dispersion on the solar limb adjustment. Their influence on the results was accounted for. Finally we considered the errors arising from leveling defects, modeled by a dependence to the azimuth of observation. All the corrections are smaller than the standard deviation and the mean <b>semi-diameter</b> values stay unaffected. This means that the series have the same pattern with smaller deviations. After the correction of the prism instability the East and West series become more similar, what reinforces that they aim at the same target. The corrected series were compared with other observations of solar <b>semi-diameter</b> from the CERGA, Cote d'Azur Observatory in France and from Tubitak Observatoty in Antalya, Turkey. The comparison reveals alike features, which deserve further, detailed study. Also, the series was compared to the daily mean Sun spots number. It exhibited three maxima along 2001, that coincide on time with three maxima of the correct series delayed by 50 days. Again, this requires a further study. Comment: 72 pages, 33 figures in color.

From a set of more than 5000 visual observations, made by the same observer between 1975 and 1994, the mean value of the semidiameter was measured at 959. 42 ″ ± 0. 01 ″. Also, a set of CCD measurements made with the same instrument between 1989 and 1994 yields the mean value 959. 40 ″ ± 0. 01 ″. Both results obtained by raw measurements are consistent but significantly differ from values obtained by other methods and on other instruments. We discuss some systematic effects that can affect our visual measurements and their precision.

This paper presents a comparison between visual and charge coupled device (CCD) camera measurements performed by means of the Calern Observatory solar astrolabe during the last 4 years; this allows us to evaluate visual measurements done previously (1975 - 1989). Then, a study of atmospheric effects is developed.

A statistical analysis gives about 0. 26 arc sec (or 0. 13 arc sec for the <b>semi-diameter)</b> as the lowest value that this error may reach at Calern Observatory.

Accurate calibration is accomplished by using a sample of solar analogues, whose average temperature {{is assumed to be}} equal to the solar effective temperature of 5777 K. By taking into account all possible sources of error we estimate associated uncertainties better than 1 % in effective temperature and in the range 1. 0 - 2. 5 % in angular <b>semi-diameter</b> for unreddened stars. Comparison of our new temperatures with other determinations extracted from the literature indicates, in general, remarkably good agreement. These results suggest that the effective temperaure scale of FGK stars is currently established with an accuracy better than 0. 5 %- 1 %. The application of the method to a sample of 10999 dwarfs in the Hipparcos catalogue allows us to define temperature and bolometric correction (K band) calibrations as a function of (V-K), [m/H] and log g. Bolometric corrections in the V and K bands as a function of effective temperature, [m/H] and log g are also given. We provide effective temperatures, angular semi-diameters, radii and bolometric corrections in the V and K bands for the 10999 FGK stars in our sample with the corresponding uncertainties.

40|$|International audienceThe {{series of}} {{measurements}} of the Solar radius at CALERN site of the observatoire de la Côte d'Azur (OCA) spans about 30 years. Measurements of the Sun were first achieved visually by the same single observer, then gradually grew more man-independent {{with the use of}} CCD acquisitions. The DORAYSOL instrument was designed and built up to keep improving the number and the quality of these <b>semi-diameter</b> measurements. The principle of this instrument remains {{the same as that of}} the Solar Astrolabe (timing the crossing of a parallel of altitude by the Sun) but a varying prism enables larger numbers of daily measurements. Digital CCD acquisition of images improves the credibility of the data and five computer-driven motors are giving a better control of the attitude of the instrument. The results for eight years and nearly 20, 000 measurements are presented. Analysis of instrumental biases shows that differences between East and West measurements are systematic and then allow one to choose the mean values to calculate the Solar radius. This results display a good agreement with the Solar Astrolabe series, namely the mean value of the Sun radius (959. 48 ″± 0. 01 ″), its time-dependence and the apparent dissymmetry of the photosphere. In the framework of the PICARD CNES Space mission, Solar radius ground measurements at CALERN simultaneously with the onboard SODISM telescope were projected. It appeared in 2007 that the maintenance of the DORAYSOL program was not possible alongside the development of the atmospheric turbulence monitor MISOLFA and the preparation for setting up the model of the SODISM 2 telescope, the staff at hand becoming insufficient. We do hope that it will be resumed, in a fully automated way. A continuation of the ground-based series would permit one to detect possible long time variations of the global geometry of the Sun...|$|E
