50|$|To {{minimize}} accidental {{capture of}} marine animals, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries developed and tested bycatch reduction devices (BRDs). These devices are openings in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> nets that allow finfish or other unwanted aquatic animals to escape, while the target species, such as shrimp, is directed towards the tail bag or cod {{end of the}} net. The placement and design have been developed in conjunction with normal bottom trawling practices, using trawl nets outfitted with a turtle excluder device. BRDs are required in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> nets working in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions.|$|E

50|$|Electric rays, {{such as the}} Aden Gulf torpedo, are {{susceptible}} to incidental capture in trawls due to their sluggish, bottom-dwelling natures.

25|$|Harmless and of no {{commercial}} value, the roughtail catshark is {{too small}} to be caught on most types of fishing gear but is taken incidentally in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawls.</b> Shark expert Stewart Springer reported in 1966 that it was frequently caught in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawls</b> along the entire coast of Florida. The impact of trawl fisheries on this species in United States waters is unknown; its depth and spawning habitat preferences may offer a degree of protection from fishing pressure. Similarly, <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling</b> activity off Central America does not extend into the depths occupied by this species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore assessed the roughtail catshark as of Least Concern.|$|R

5|$|Though little {{specific}} data are available, the Japanese sleeper ray {{is believed to}} be caught incidentally in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawls</b> and other demersal fishing gear throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, electric rays tend not to survive being caught and discarded, and <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling</b> is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|R
50|$|Bycatch is {{typically}} managed in cold-water <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling,</b> {{and rates of}} bycatch are accordingly low, and the capture of sea turtles is rare in cold temperate waters. Bycatch is mostly reduced {{by the use of}} Nordmøre grids, which reduce the numbers of cod, haddock, Greenland halibut and redfish caught during <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawls.</b> The Nordmøre grid was invented by the Norwegian fisherman Paul Brattøy, primarily as a means of excluding jellyfish from shrimp catches, and introduced in 1989. This innovation causes a minimal reduction in the quantity of shrimp caught, but can reduce the amounts of bycatch by around 97%.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{requested}} in 1999 that groundfish trawlers voluntarily avoid sponge reefs. In 2002 voluntary closures of <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> fishing, {{and regulated}} closures of groundfish trawling were initiated {{in areas where}} sponge reefs were known.

5000|$|Worldwide, {{hundreds}} of thousands of sea turtles a year are accidentally caught in <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> nets, on longline hooks and in fishing gillnets—a threat known as bycatch. Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe, and therefore many drown once caught. Loggerheads are highly migratory and are very likely to come in contact with a fishery, particularly in shrimp gillnets and longlines. 2 ...|$|E
50|$|One {{mechanism}} used {{to protect}} turtles from fishing nets is the turtle excluder device (TED). Because the biggest danger to the population of Kemp’s ridley sea turtles is shrimp trawls, the device {{is attached to the}} <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl.</b> It is a grid of bars with an opening at the top or bottom, fitted into the neck of the <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl.</b> It allows small animals to slip through the bars and be caught while larger animals, such as sea turtles, strike the bars and are ejected, thus avoiding possible drowning. In September 2007, Corpus Christi, Texas, wildlife officials found a record of 128 Kemp's ridley sea turtle nests on Texas beaches, including 81 on North Padre Island (Padre Island National Seashore) and four on Mustang Island. The figure was exceeded in each of the following 7 years (see graph to 2013, provisional figures for 2014 as at July, 118.). Wildlife officials released 10,594 Kemp's ridley hatchlings along the Texas coast that year. The turtles are popular in Mexico, as boot material and food.|$|E

50|$|Trawl nets in general, and <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawls</b> in particular, {{have been}} {{identified}} as sources of mortality for cetacean and finfish species. When bycatch is discarded (returned to the sea), it is often dead or dying.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} often {{captured}} during <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawls.</b> This {{occurs in the}} northern Gulf of Mexico.

50|$|Between 1990 and 1996, {{research}} in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries examined the proportions of catch and bycatch by weight. The data indicated that catches in the Gulf consisted of about 67 percent finned fish, 16 percent commercial shrimp, 13 percent non-commercial shrimp, and 4 percent other invertebrates. In the South Atlantic, the catch averaged 51 percent finned fish, 18 percent commercial shrimp, 13 percent non-commercial shrimp and crustaceans, and 18 percent non-crustacean invertebrates (by weight).|$|E
50|$|During 1997 and 1998, trawls {{in federal}} {{waters of the}} Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic regions were {{required}} to insert and use a BRD in their nets. This device is installed in the cod end of a <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawl</b> {{for the purpose of}} excluding finfish from the net. Since then, NOAA fisheries have certified three types of BRDs for use in the Gulf of Mexico region: the Gulf Fisheye, the Jones-Davis, and the Fisheye BRDs; and five for the south Atlantic region: the Extended Funnel, Expanded Mesh, Fisheye, Gulf Fisheye and Jones-Davis BRDs.|$|E

40|$|Coastal zone {{management}} {{has become an}} increasingly important topic as coastal populations continue to grow and the numerous ocean and coastal uses associated with coastal development exert tremendous pressure on the marine environment and its resources. Marine spatial planning (MSP) {{is a process that}} can help direct when and where multiple coastal activities take place, and can also make areas of conflicting and compatible uses more visible to fisheries and coastal managers. ^ Stakeholders in North Carolina are concerned about the sustainability of the economically and culturally significant blue crab fishery after significantly reduced landings during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. Managers are currently exploring the relationships among stakeholder groups whose activities impact the blue crab including navigational dredgers, shrimp trawlers, commercial crab and oyster dredgers, and blue crab potters. Identifying conflicting interactions between blue crab potting and navigational dredging, <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling,</b> and commercial crab and oyster dredging may improve management and add valuable information to marine spatial planning efforts in North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s coastal zone. ^ Through 25 semi-structured interviews with fishermen (blue crab potters, shrimp trawlers, commercial crab and oyster dredgers), fisheries and coastal managers, and Army Corps of Engineers 2 ̆ 7 staff in cities and towns along the coast of North Carolina, this study examines how these stakeholder groups perceive crab potting to interact with navigational dredging, <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling,</b> and commercial crab and oyster dredging, and the drivers of these interactions. Interviews were transcribed and then coded for the types of interactions and drivers of these interactions. Ten different types of interactions emerged in the interviews including: spatial, temporal, gear, benthic, water quality, biological, knowledge, traditional use, environmental conditions, and mutual respect. Subsequently, frequency of compatible and conflicting interactions mentioned by the respondents were analyzed to understand the perceptions of the stakeholder groups. Additionally a variety of drivers emerged during the interviews as respondents discussed particular activity pairs. The frequencies of mentions for the different drivers were analyzed to see which ones seemed to most heavily influence the interactions between activities. ^ The results indicate that respondents perceive crab potting as generally compatible with navigational dredging, <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling,</b> and commercial crab and oyster dredging. Respondents also discussed compatibility-related drivers more frequently than conflict-related drivers for crab potting and navigational dredging, <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling,</b> and commercial crab and oyster dredging. It appears that regional and demographic characteristics may influence fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of how crab potting interacts with other activities. Also, fishermen and managers seem to have differing perceptions of how crab potting interacts with <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling.</b> The managers {{do not seem to be}} aware of the informal arrangements that exist between crab potters and shrimp trawlers. Furthermore, the fishermen interviewed in this study frequently noted that mutual respect between fishermen facilitates interactions between crab potting and <b>shrimp</b> <b>trawling</b> more than fisheries regulations do. Lastly, results suggested that there is a lack of communication amongst the four stakeholder groups. A better understanding of how these stakeholder groups interact and what drives the interactions among them will help managers develop appropriate regulations and policies to ensure the sustainability of the blue crab fishery in North Carolina and conservation of the coastal zone. ...|$|R
