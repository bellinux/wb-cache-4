40|$|Human U 6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase III requires cooperative promoter binding involving the snRNA-activating protein complex (<b>SNAP</b> c) and the TATA-box binding protein (TBP).

Mini-SNAP c efficiently recruits TBP to the U 6 TATA box, and two <b>SNAP</b> c subunits, <b>SNAP</b> 43 and <b>SNAP</b> 190, directly interact with the TBP DNA binding domain.

40|$|Part 1 : Long and Short PapersInternational audienceWe {{introduce}} a new <b>snapping</b> technique, Oh <b>Snap,</b> designed specifically for users of direct touch interfaces. Oh <b>Snap</b> allows users to easily align digital objects with lines or other objects using 1 -D or 2 -D translation or rotation. Our technique addresses two major drawbacks of existing <b>snapping</b> techniques: they either cause objects to “jump” to <b>snap</b> locations, preventing placement very close to those locations, or they “expand” motor space so that on direct-touch interfaces objects lag behind the user’s finger. Oh <b>Snap</b> addresses both of these problems using an asymmetric velocity profile similar to a technique for filtering degrees of freedom in multi-touch gestures that was introduced by Nacenta et al. (2009). Oh <b>Snap</b> applies the velocity profile to multiple “snapping” constraints. A user study revealed a 40 % performance improvement over no <b>snapping</b> for 1 -D translation, 2 -D translation, and rotation tasks when <b>snap</b> lines or angles were targeted. We found that Oh <b>Snap</b> performs no worse than traditional <b>snapping,</b> while retaining its important functional benefits. The study also investigated optimal parameter settings and Oh <b>Snap’s</b> accuracy in supporting the placement of objects near to, but not at, <b>snap</b> locations, which traditional <b>snapping</b> techniques do not support.

5|$|In {{the final}} days before the 2015 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team began its season for new head coach Jim Harbaugh against Utah, Morris was in a quarterback battle with incoming graduate student transfer Jake Rudock, who had started the prior two seasons for Iowa. On Monday before the Thursday September 3 game, Harbaugh would not name his starter. Rudock started the game. After the second game, against Oregon State, there was controversy when Wilton Speight took the mopup <b>snaps</b> during the 357 victory instead of Morris. Harbaugh explained that since Speight had already used his redshirt season and Morris had not, {{there was no reason}} for Morris to lose a season unless it was for meaningful <b>snaps,</b> but that Morris is the #2 quarterback. When Rudock was sidelined in the third quarter with the team trailing in the October 31, 2015, Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota, Speight engineered the game-winning drive via his first touchdown pass with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Harbaugh explained that Speight had earned the backup role in practice in the preceding weeks.|$|E

The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion.

40|$|Human small nuclear RNA gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerases II and III depends upon promoter recognition by the <b>SNAP</b> C general transcription factor.

The <b>SNAP</b> 50 zinc finger domain contains 15 cysteine and histidine residues configured in two potential zinc coordination arrangements. Individual alanine substitution of each cysteine and histidine residue demonstrated that eight sites are important for DNA binding by <b>SNAP</b> C.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether the Neonatal Acute Physiology (<b>SNAP)</b> scoring system (<b>SNAP</b> II) and with perinatal extension (<b>SNAP</b> II PE) can be used to predict neonatal deaths in a resource-limited neonatal intensive care unit in Nepal. A prospective observational study was conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Kanti Children's Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Data required for the <b>SNAP</b> II and <b>SNAP</b> II PE scores were collected. The relationships between the <b>SNAP</b> II and <b>SNAP</b> II PE scores and neonatal mortality were analyzed.

40|$|<b>SNAP</b> 25 {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in neuronal exocytosis pathways. <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b are alternatively spliced isoforms differing by only nine amino acids, three of which occur within the palmitoylated cysteine-rich domain. <b>SNAP</b> 23 is 60 % identical to <b>SNAP</b> 25 and has a distinct cysteine-rich domain to both <b>SNAP</b> 25 a and <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. Despite the conspicuous differences within the palmitoylated domains of these secretory proteins, there is no information on their comparative interactions with palmitoyl transferases. We report that membrane association of all <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 proteins is enhanced by Golgi-localized DHHC 3, DHHC 7, and DHHC 17. In contrast, DHHC 15 promoted a statistically significant increase in membrane association of only <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. To investigate the underlying cause of this differential specificity, we examined a <b>SNAP</b> 23 point mutant (C 79 F) designed to mimic the cysteine-rich domain of <b>SNAP</b> 25 b. DHHC 15 promoted a marked increase in membrane binding and palmitoylation of this <b>SNAP</b> 23 mutant, demonstrating that the distinct cysteine-rich domains of <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 contribute to differential interactions with DHHC 15. The lack of activity of DHHC 15 toward wild-type <b>SNAP</b> 23 was not overcome by replacing its DHHC domain with that from DHHC 3, suggesting that substrate specificity is not determined by the DHHC domain alone. Interestingly, DHHC 2, which is closely related to DHHC 15, associates with the plasma membrane in PC 12 cells and can palmitoylate all <b>SNAP</b> 25 isoforms. DHHC 2 is, thus, a candidate enzyme to regulate <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 palmitoylation dynamics at the plasma membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of specific Golgi-localized DHHC proteins active against <b>SNAP</b> 25 / 23 proteins perturbs the normal secretion of human growth hormone from PC 12 cells...|$|R
