The {{market share}} of Gross Box Office (GBO) of European films have been {{experiencing}} a steady fall in recent years while the Hollywood films continue to claim more than 60 % of market share within Europe. Every country of EU has devised public aid mechanism {{in the form of}} subsidies and tax concessions to protect the domestic film industry with a view to augment national film's market share against Hollywood's domination. Though the state interventions on the ground of cultural protectionism have been the integral part of EU's policy to protect the domestic film industry and to uphold its cultural sovereignty, the effectiveness of the economic policies needs to be investigated to ascertain whether these policies are boosting European film industry or wasting public money. Hence, {{to assess the impact of}} the economic policies on the domestic film market, this study examine the impact of subsidy and tax concession on the <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratio,</b> defined as the {{market share of}} GBO of domestic films, and attempt to identify other determinants namely market size, the number of domestic films produced and the average budget per film that explain the variance of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> in a country.

On the other hand, the method of linear programming {{is one of the}} most important mathematical techniques designed to distribute economic resources among alternative uses so as to achieve the optimal use. Accordingly, this study aims at characterizing the cropping patterns that maximizes the net return per feddan, minimizes water requirements and maximizes the net return per water unit for the cropping pattern of the year 2006. To accomplish the study main goals, three linear programming models were applied as a tool for economic planning. The main objectives of these scenarios are maximizing the total net revenues for the cropping pattern calculated, maximizing the total net revenues for the cropping pattern, minimizing water irrigation requirements, and maximizing the total net revenues for the cropping pattern in case of achieving higher <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> for the major crops. The results of solving the linear programming models for the cropping pattern found out that the optimum combination of crops can be produced according to the third scenario, since it achieves an increase in the total net revenue for the cropping pattern of about 0. 13 %. Moreover, it saves about 4. 28 % of the water irrigation, as well as achieving greater return per unit of water resources of about 4, 61 % as compared to those achieved by the cropping pattern of the year 2006 in addition to achieving suitable <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> of most major crops...|$|R

We assess the interlinkages between energy, food, water and land, for two case studies, Okinawa and Sogn og Fjordane. We apply a range of assessment methods and study their usefulness as tools to identify trade-offs and to compare the sustainability performance. We calculate cross-sectoral footprints, <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> and perform a simplified Energy-Water-Food nexus analysis. We use the latter for assessing scenarios to increase energy and food self-sufficiency in Okinawa, while we use ecosystem service (ESS) accounting for Sogn og Fjordane. For Okinawa, we find that constraints on the energy, food and water sectors urgently call for integrated approaches to energy policy; for Sogn og Fjordane, the further expansion of renewables comes at the expense of cultural and supporting ESS, which could outweigh gains from increased energy exports. We recommend a general upgrade to indicators and visualization methods that look beyond averages and a fostering of infrastructure for data on sustainable development based on harmonized international protocols.

Among others, China, now the second largest {{country in the world}} in terms of the GDP total, has been continuing economic growth still at higher growth rate. Demand for “Food” increases greatly along with economic growth, and those countries became important purchaser in the world market, and have been influencing the international price for some products. In such a trend, growth of each domestic economy has expanded its trade volumes of food, agricultural and fisheries raw products. And this process has strengthened mutual economic linkage of Asian countries. Against this background, this paper shows quantitative analysis on how growth of industries composing food system put impact on the economy of each country and Asian economies as a whole using Asian International Input-Output Table which compiled domestic input-output tables of member countries.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to evaluate the existing plan for producing wheat and barley to test its compatability with the objectives of agricultural development in the Kingdom. This has been made under the two conditions of optimal allocation of resources and asset fixity. The study has implemented the model of sectoral programming to determine the optimal plan. Furthermore, the study utilized several criteria in order to evaluate the existing plan. They are: the actual needs of the society from both crops, production efficiency {{in the use of}} both crops, balanced regions, <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratios</b> achieved of both crops, balanced regional growth, reducing international dependency, rationalizing government expenditures, sectoral integration, and the criterion of varying and developing new income sources for the King-dom. Some of the evaluation results showed the following: (1) The existing plan for wheat and barley in the Kingdom is incompatible with the objectives of food and water security and agricultural development in general. This crop production practice achieves a loss which is estimated at 24 billion Saudi Riyals during the study period (1986 - 1990). (2) Applying the principle of comparative advantage in the production of either crop with exhaustible groundwater resources, it is shown that importing both crops is economically better than producing them. (3) The Northern Region showed superiority over other regions, and that barley is better produced than wheat. In addition, specialized production techniques are shown to be better and more efficient than the traditional ones. (4) Finally, results showed that changing the existing crop production practices to any of the suggested ones in the model will cause more efficient use of the scarce resources.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the optimum guidance of agricultural loans and subsidies financed by the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank to the specialized agricultural projects in the central region in order to improve the investment returns of allocating loans and subsidies over different agricultural projects. Random primary data of five specialized agricultural projects have been used which include wheat, vegetables produced in green houses, broilers, table-eggs, and dairy products that were financed by the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank in the central region. Lamb projects were not operating at the time of conducting this study, so lambs data were obtained from Sherin's et. al. paper[1]. The sample survey covered 52 projects which represents 11 % of specialized projects in the central region. The sample data include investment costs, operating costs, production costs, production capacity, and gross return which can be used to estimate the investment criteria and to formulate the financial problem through the procedure of portfolio selection problems. The Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank financial plans have been aiming at rationalizing government expenditure along with maximizing returns, and achieving high levels of financial efficiency and <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratios.</b> Therefore, the analysis of con-strained maximization of the expected returns from a certain plan followed by the Saudi Arabia Agricultural Bank is made. Saudi Arabian or Agricultural Bank in general is aiming to achieve more than one goal at the same time, thus, goal programming has been used to fulfil the Bank's goals. The results indicate that there is a deviation of the expected returns of the existing plan (first plan) from the goals of the declared agricultural development plans. One of the suggested financial plans (seventh plan) outweighed with the rest through realizing an increase of 4. 75 %, which represents 2 %, in the expected returns compared with the existing plan, along with achieving higher levels of self-sufficieny goals and lower costs of opportunity losses by 10. 5 %. Moreover, the study recommended that the returns on investment in the above indicated projects could be increased by 25 % affecting the production capacities of these which are also examined and analyzed.

40|$|Islamic {{microfinance}} is {{a growing}} sector {{that is expected to}} provide a long-term solution to poverty in the Muslim world, home to more than 600 million poor people. The role of microfinance institutions in poverty alleviation is still debatable, however established literature provides assurance that microfinance does {{contribute to the development of}} financial sector and reduction of poverty in developing countries. Nonetheless, the rise of competition in the microfinance sector has forced many microfinance institutions to resort to commercial funding and lending activities, which according to some studies has led microfinance institutions to trade off poverty alleviation objective with commercial goals of profitability and sustainability. This thesis examines the impact of commercialisation push and its subsequent impacts on Islamic microfinance institutions in three empirical chapters. They are a) comparison of financial performance i. e. profitability and sustainability, between Islamic microfinance institutions with conventional microfinance institutions, b) examination of portfolio risk and vulnerability of Islamic microfinance institutions (IMFIs), and finally c) survey of the presence or absence of ‘mission drift’ at IMFIs. The thesis benefits from the latest panel data provided by MIX Market database, which is obtained from the publicly accessible websites at www. mixmarket. org. MIX Market provides reliable dataset for many microfinance institutions from all regions in the world. However, the dataset used for this research covers 1, 320 microfinance institutions during the period of 1998 to 2014, from four regions where IMFIs exist, namely East Asia and Pacific, South Asia, Middle East and North Africa and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. IMFIs represent about 2. 88 per cent, or only 38 IMFIs, in the dataset from the overall sample. Using Ordinary Least Squares regression to analyse financial performance, portfolio risk, and poverty outreach, the research finds mixed results. Overall, although IMFIs are worse off than their conventional counterparts in terms of financial performance, i. e. lower profitability and high cost, they are relatively better off with outreach to the poor, indicated by lower average loan balance per borrower to income per capita (depth of outreach) and positive number of active borrowers (breadth of outreach). In addition to lower or negative profitability, the first empirical chapter also indicates that IMFIs are operating at higher cost per borrower than conventional MFIs. However, interestingly IMFIs manage to record positive operational <b>self-sufficiency</b> (being a <b>ratio</b> of financial revenue over expenses, or OSS), which is an important indicator of sustainability, in addition to return on assets (ROA). Lower ROA is attributed to higher operational cost, e. g. cost per borrower, while OSS is higher mainly due to irregular funding mechanism of IMFIs. Many of the IMFIs rely on donations or charitable funds and also to a certain extend grants from government and donors. The second empirical chapter explores portfolio and default risk of IMFIs and find that they are facing relatively lower risks than conventional MFIs. The result defies expectation, as IMFIs are face challenging working environment and operate in some of the poorest countries in the world with frequent natural disasters or armed conflicts. They are also less vulnerable despite their clients are from the poorest segment in the society, often with lower educational level, and the nature of Islamic financial products are relatively unknown to most clients. Many of the IMFIs and their clients live in countries considered to be high risk or have histories of instability, either politically or economically. Finally, the third paper examines poverty outreach performance of MFIs to find any evidence of mission drift in Islamic microfinance institutions. Using similar method with the first empirical chapter, the paper finds that there is no clear evidence of mission drift at Islamic microfinance institutions, as indicated by lower Average loan balance per borrower to income/capita and at the same time significantly lower percentage of women borrowers. However, this claim requires more explanations to qualify as convincing evidence. The findings contradict the argument for mission drift, i. e. the presence of higher Average loan balance and lower Percentage of women borrowers. The results do not confirm nor reject the hypothesis that there will be no mission drift at Islamic microfinance institutions. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with literature i. e. there is no clear evidence of mission drift in existing and mostly conventional microfinance institutions. Overall, the regression results of all three empirical chapters of the thesis indicate that IMFIs are still loyal to their primary mission of poverty alleviation, despite operating at a loss and high operational cost. Their relatively positive outreach, in both scale and depth, is complementary to consistently high operational self-sufficiency. Although sustainability is important in microfinance, IMFIs are not currently concerned with sustainability objectives as their funding mechanism can still support their pursuit of poverty alleviation. However, as the drive of commercialisation and intensifying competition continue, especially with many international donors becoming more selective, IMFIs must abandon over-reliance on subsidy or grants. Should their current financial performance persists, i. e. lower return and higher cost, IMFIs may soon discover poverty alleviation mission as liability, not an achievable goal...|$|R

40|$|The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh {{is known}} {{worldwide}} for its success in providing {{credit to the}} poor. However, subsequent replications of its methodology {{in other parts of}} the world have been less successful. Is there really an infallible solution that works everywhere, and is outreach to the poor compatible with sustainability? A Grameen replic ator in the Philippines, the Center for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD), has recently set itself firmly on the path to sustainability through becoming a formal sector, rural bank – the first credit NGO in the country to do so. During the period 1993 to June 1999, CARD?s all-female outreach soared from 1, 711 to 26, 369 and its operational <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> increased from 0. 46 to l. 09. At the end of June 1999, CARD?s loan portfolio stood at $ 2. 7 million, its repayment rate was 99. 9 per cent and its financial <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> was 0. 85. The principal lesson to be learned from CARD?s success is that Grameen-type MFIs can be sustainable and can substantially increase their outreach. CARD?s social capital comprises: (a) a core of good Grameen practices, such as high moral commitment on the part of the leaders, based on values instilled through training; peer control – to preclude adverse selection and moral hazard; and a strict credit discipline; (b) innovative adaptations to suit the Philippine context, such as the adoption of rural bank status under central bank supervision; vigorous mobilization of voluntary savings; the provision of differentiated, profit-making loan and insurance products; and a broadening of the clientele to include poor and non-poor depositors, while adhering to its mission of lending to poor women only.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a stylised overview of energy situation in Asia covering the developments since 1990. The primary energy {{requirement of the}} region has grown significantly during this period as China emerged as the second largest global economy while other Asian countries grew economically. High dependence on coal emerges as a special feature of this development, which has allowed the region to maintain a <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> of 80 % since 1990. Most {{of the countries in}} the region have reduced their energy intensity but there is significant learning potential from one another in further improving energy efficiency. Growing industrialisation particularly in China has meant that the industrial sector is the leading final energy consumer but the residential sector comes next...|$|E

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) is {{promising}} to supply power for residential buildings. Battery {{is the most}} widely employed storage method to mitigate the intermittence of PV and to overcome the mismatch between production and load. Hydrogen storage is another promising method that it is suitable for long-term storage. This study focuses on the comparison of <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>ratio</b> and cost performance between battery storage and hydrogen storage for a residential building in Sweden. The results show that battery storage is superior to the hydrogen storage in the studied case. Sensitivity study of the component cost within the hydrogen storage system is also carried out. Electrolyzer cost is the most sensitive factor for improving system performance. A hybrid battery and hydrogen storage system, which can harness the advantages of both battery and hydrogen storages, is proposed in the last place...|$|E
