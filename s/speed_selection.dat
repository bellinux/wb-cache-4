25|$|The Lynx is an agile helicopter, {{capable of}} {{performing}} loops and rolls, and of attaining high speeds. The agility {{of the type}} led to its use as an aerial display aircraft, having been operated with by the Blue Eagles and Black Cats helicopter display teams. The efficiency of the main rotor, {{as well as the}} overall top speed of the Lynx, was substantially improved with the adoption of BERP rotor blade technology. During the 1990s, the hot-and-high performance of the type was considerably boosted in the later Super Lynx 200 series, at which point the type's Gem engines were replaced with the newer LHTEC T800 turboshaft engine with associated FADEC system; the Lynx can also maintain a good level of performance under moderate icing conditions. The FADEC controls eliminated the requirement for a throttle or manual <b>speed</b> <b>selection</b> switches, further simplifying flight control. Later aircraft feature automatic stabilisation equipment; functions such as auto-hover are optionally installed on some Lynx.|$|E
500|$|The Nord Stage Organ Section {{provides}} {{physical models}} of three electric organs – the Hammond B3, the Vox Continental, and the Farfisa Compact. Instead of physical drawbars, the Organ section features [...] "drawbuttons" [...] {{with a set}} of red LED strips to indicate the position of each drawbar from 0 (fully in) to 8 (fully out). For the Hammond and Vox organ emulations, pressing the [...] "down" [...] button illuminates more LEDs to visually emulate a drawbar being pulled out, while pressing the [...] "up" [...] button does the reverse. Since a real Farfisa organ selects sounds via rocker tabs instead of drawbars, the drawbuttons behave as tabs when the Farfisa emulation is selected on the Stage. The standard set of Percussion, Chorus and Vibrato settings as found on each of the three organs are available, and a rotary speaker emulation (similar to a Leslie speaker), including <b>speed</b> <b>selection</b> and overdrive, is also available. The Organ section is fully polyphonic.|$|E

He suggests that people may instead be choosing gait parameters that maximize stability while walking downhill. This suggests that under adverse conditions such as down hills, gait patterns may favor stability over speed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} {{the use of the}} parallel processing capabilities of a graphics chip to increase the processing speed of a high dynamic range (HDR) video system. The basis is an existing HDR video system that produces each frame from a sequence of regular images taken in quick succession under varying exposure settings. The image sequence is processed in a pipeline consisting of: shutter <b>speeds</b> <b>selection,</b> capturing, color space conversion, image registration, HDR stitching, and tone mapping. This article identifies bottlenecks in the pipeline and describes modifications to the algorithms that are necessary to enable parallel processing. Time-critical steps are processed on a graphics processing unit (GPU). The resulting processing time is evaluated and compared to the original sequential code. The creation of an HDR video frame is sped up by a factor of 15 on the average...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates a}} new approach that uses patterns of eye motion for object selection in an eye tracking interface. The analysis of eye motion on the pattern level can deliver three values to an eye tracking interface: <b>selection</b> <b>speed,</b> reliability, and a more complete understanding of user attention. Current eye tracking interfaces use fixation {{as a means of}} target acquisition and/or selection. There are several problems with this approach concerning issues of <b>selection</b> <b>speed,</b> system reliability and the understanding of user attention. This research builds a system, called InVision, to demonstrate how the analysis of eye fixation at the pattern level can help provide solutions to these problems. First, <b>selection</b> <b>speed</b> is quick through the use of pattern identification as a means of selection. Second, pattern correlation can add reliability to an eye tracking interface. Finally, the ability to understand the context of a user's eye motion is provided throug...|$|R

40|$|Variations in the {{geometry}} of the external flight apparatus of birds are beneficial for different behaviors. Long-distance flight is less costly with more pointed wings and shorter tails; however these traits decrease maneuverability at low <b>speeds.</b> <b>Selection</b> has led to interspecific differences in these and other flight apparatuses in relation to migration distance. If these principles are general, how are the external flight apparatus within a partially migratory bird species shaped in which individuals either migrate or stay at their breeding grounds? We resolved this question by comparing the wing pointedness and tail length (relative to wing length) of migrant and resident European blackbirds (Turdus merula) breeding in the same population. We predicted that migrant blackbirds would have more pointed wings and shorter tails than residents. Contrary to our predictions, {{there were no differences}} between migrants and residents in either measure. Our results indicate that morphological differences between migrants and residents in this partially migratory population may be constrained...|$|R

50|$|Horses {{have also}} {{demonstrated}} normal, narrow distributions of preferred walking speed {{within a given}} gait, {{which suggests that the}} process of <b>speed</b> <b>selection</b> may follow similar patterns across species. Preferred walking speed has important clinical applications as an indicator of mobility and independence. For example, elderly people or people suffering from osteoarthritis must walk more slowly. Improving (increasing) people's preferred walking speed is a significant clinical goal in these populations.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{joint and}} muscle {{biomechanics}} also directly affect walking speed. Norris showed that elderly individuals walked faster when their ankle extensors were augmented by an external pneumatic muscle. Muscle force, {{specifically in the}} gastrocnemius and/or soleus, may limit walking speed in certain populations and lead to slower preferred speeds. Similarly, patients with ankle osteoarthritis walked faster after a complete ankle replacement than before. This suggests that reducing joint reaction forces or joint pain may factor into <b>speed</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E

50|$|People have {{suggested}} mechanical, energetic, physiological and psychological factors as contributors to <b>speed</b> <b>selection.</b> Probably, individuals face a trade-off between the numerous {{costs associated with}} different walking speeds, and select a speed which minimizes these costs. For example, they may trade off time to destination, which is minimized at fast walking speeds, and metabolic rate, muscle force or joint stress. These are minimized at slower walking speeds. Broadly, increasing value of time, motivation, or metabolic efficiency may cause people to walk more quickly. Conversely, aging, joint pain, instability, incline, metabolic rate and visual decline cause people to walk more slowly.|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{is a very}} {{important}} characteristic of inverter compressor, and itâ€™s critical for refrigerator running <b>speeds</b> <b>selection.</b> First, the reasons why the compressor vibrates are discussed, unbalanced forces of comprssor moving parts are the source of the vibration. The flexible parts in the vibration transmission route are also very critical, they are inner discharge tube, suspension springs, rubber grommets, and so on. When the natural frequencies of the system are similar to the source excitation frequencies, resonance will happen, vibrations will be very large. Second, one inverter compressor vibrations were tested, and the results show that the vibrations varied a lot in different speeds and directions. Then the reasons why the inverter compressor vibrations are very large in some speeds are analyzed in the third part. The natural frequencies of shell and grommets system and inner discharge tube were got by experiment or simulation. The results show that those natural frequencies are too close to the soure excitation frequencies in some speeds, that is the reason why the compressor vibrates so large. By the grommets and inner discharge tube redesigns, the natural frequecies are moved far away from excitation frequencies, the compressor vibrations are reduced. The methods suggested in this research are helpful in reducing inverter compressor vibrations...|$|R

The P 300 potential {{is one of the}} most used control signals for {EEG}-based {BCIs}. Classic P 300 -based {BCIs} work in a synchronous mode; the synchronous control assumes that the user is constantly attending to the stimulation, and the number of stimulation sequences is fixed a priori.
