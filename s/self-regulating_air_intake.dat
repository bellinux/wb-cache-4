50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems that regulate {{the temperature of}} the air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy. With the advent of advanced emission controls and more advanced fuel injection methods modern vehicles do not have a thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system and the factory installed <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> draws unregulated cold air. Aftermarket cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems are marketed with claims of increased engine efficiency and performance. The putative principle behind a cold <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is that cooler air has a higher density, thus containing more oxygen per volume unit than warmer air.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{characteristics}} of an aerator inserted on the chute with a concave surface {{is more complex}} than that of on the straight chute. The area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator is a very important factor which influences the cavity size of jet flow after the aerator, the air pressure in the cavity and air concentrations in high-speed flows along the chute. The present project focused on the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of an aerator inserted on a model chute with a concave surface. How the area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator and the radius of chute arc affect {{flow characteristics}} are investigated. The air pressure in the cavity was indirectly derived from the jet trajectory equation. It is demonstrated that the cavity length increases with, and the air pressure in it decreases with the increasing of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> area at first, and then it remains unchangeable for a discharge even though the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> area continues to increase...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to analyze the flow through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of 1. 6 L Proton Waja engine by adding guide vane. The pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system {{is known to have}} a significant influence on the indicated power of the SI engine. The pressure drop along the intake system is proportional to the engine speed and cross sectional area. The guide vane is placed in the system to reduce the pressure drop across the system. It was found that the guide vane help to reduce pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system where it increases the capabilities of air induction system to suck more air to the engine. The geometry of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine was used in the modeling approach. The study was focused on different engine speed. This analysis was done in CFD using a model setup with appropriate speed of the Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine from maximum speed to minimum speed.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{discusses}} on {{the fuel}} economy and exhaust emissions at variations of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure. The <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure {{is influenced by}} the degree of opening throttle plate and venturi effect which draw the fuel to the combustion chamber in carbureted engine. The experimental work is conducted at variations of engine speed and load using a single cylinder four stroke SI engine attached with 5 kW dynamometer. Gas analyzer was used to measure exhaust emissions compositions and to identify the quality of combustion. The results show that the standard <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system resulted in rich combustion which led to the incomplete combustion due to less availability of air. By eliminating the air filter, the air flow restriction through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system was reduced. Hence, better combustion and less unburned components are achieved because of higher air availability. A higher <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> pressure is required to increase air density in allowing for better combustion within a limited time to improve fuel economy, power output and exhaust emissions. Complete combustion also lead to the reduction of unburned components such as carbon (C), hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydroxide (OH) that resulted in less hazardous emissions...|$|R
