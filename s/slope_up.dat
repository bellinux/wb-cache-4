5|$|To {{the north}} of Edinburgh lay the marshy Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the {{depression}} where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out. This natural defence was augmented by the steep <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> to {{the northern edge of}} the Old Town. Edinburgh Castle, on its rocky outcrop, defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed primarily on the south and east sides of the burgh.|$|E
5|$|The first away {{game for}} the Ramblin' Wreck was the 1961 game against the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Wreck was freighted by Southern Railway to Birmingham, Alabama. At the time, Alabama played its home games at Legion Field. Before the game the current driver Dekle Rountree decided to {{traverse}} the <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> to visit Birmingham's Vulcan statue. The trip to Birmingham was such a success, a trip to Jacksonville for Tech's Gator Bowl appearance against Penn State was organized as well. These {{would be the first}} road and bowl game appearances for the Wreck in its illustrious career.|$|E

25|$|Downtown Schenectady {{includes}} Union College, {{which is}} a private 4-year college established in 1795. In July 1806, the college determined to acquire a large tract of land {{to the east of}} the main settlement in Schenectady, on a gentle <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by college president Eliphalet Nott some years later as “pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill…”.|$|E
25|$|It {{was very}} slow and {{therefore}} a most impressive assault with steel. At times the tanks almost 'stood on their heads', twisting to avoid mounds of rock and to get {{at right angles to}} the huge cracks and shell holes, but always getting nearer and nearer. Like beetles trying to climb an inverted ice-cream cone, they slipped a little, hung suspended and then went onwards towards the top. The behaviour of these tanks upset the Germans. Such tactics were untanklike, and no answer was contained in their military textbooks. Too late now to shift the anti-tank guns from their positions, too late to make alternative arrangements to deal with the new menace. There was only one answer – retreat, and that's what the Germans did – leaving the British tanks and infantry in possession of the first <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> the heights of Longstop. So ended 23 April.|$|E

This eight-block area of 42 acres (17 ha) included, at the time of its Register listing, 173 contributing properties. None of them are separately listed.|$|E

2500|$|Entrance to {{the north}} end of the park is via Taft Hill Road (which {{approaches}} the base of the cliff) and to the east end via Ulm-Vaughn Road (which leads to the visitor's center, the <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> the hill, and the summit of the cliffs). A [...] trail leads from the visitor's center to the cliff summit and back again, and includes signage about the buffalo jump along the way as well as a tipi ring (a ring of stones which indicate that a tipi was once held in place there). There are drinking water facilities, garbage cans, and public restrooms throughout the park.|$|E
2500|$|The crusaders {{had brought}} no siege {{machines}} with them, but Boucicaut optimistically stated that ladders were easily made and {{worth more than}} catapults when used by courageous men. However, the lack of siege weapons, the steep <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> to {{the walls and the}} formidable fortifications made taking the castle by force impossible. [...] The crusaders set up positions around the town to block the exits, and with the naval blockade of the river, settled in for a siege to starve out the defenders. [...] Nevertheless, they were convinced that the siege of the fortress would be a mere prelude to a major thrust into relieving Constantinople and did not believe that Bayezid I would arrive so speedily to give them a real battle.|$|E
2500|$|Accordingly, in July 1806, Nott and the {{trustees}} determined {{to acquire a}} large tract of land {{to the east of}} the Downtown Schenectady, on a gentle <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by Nott some years later as “pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill …”. [...] Clearly, the prospect was largely {{in the eye of the}} beholder. There was apparently even a sulphur spring on the hill, although it did not pose any threat to Saratoga Springs. [...] Using primarily his own funds and credit, Nott purchased between [...] of the hill. [...] By 1812 a stone wall had been built at the lower end of the slope, creating a terrace upon which the preliminary foundations for buildings were begun. Then a meeting occurred that changed not only the Union College campus, but many other American college designs for the next several decades. [...] The catalyst for this venture was international financier David Parish.|$|E

2500|$|The {{climate of}} the Sierra Nevada is {{influenced}} by the Mediterranean climate of California. [...] During the fall, winter and spring, precipitation in the Sierra ranges from [...] where it occurs mostly as snow above [...] Precipitation is highest on the central and northern portions of the western slope between [...] elevation, due to orographic lift. Above , precipitation diminishes on the western <b>slope</b> <b>up</b> to the crest, since most of the precipitation has been wrung out at lower elevations. Most parts of the range east of the crest are in a rain shadow, and receive less than 25 inches of precipitation per year. While most summer days are dry, afternoon thunderstorms sometimes occur, particularly during the North American Monsoon in mid and late summer. Some of these summer thunderstorms drop over an inch of rain in a short period, and the lightning can start fires. Summer high temperatures average [...] Winters are comparatively mild, and the temperature is usually only just low enough to sustain a heavy snowpack. For example, Tuolumne Meadows, at [...] elevation, has winter daily highs about [...] with daily lows about [...] The growing season lasts 20 to 230 days, strongly dependent on elevation. The highest elevations of the Sierra have an alpine climate.|$|E

It had not {{appeared}} far up to that saddle, but it was far. There were straggling pine-trees and huge rocks that obstructed his gaze.
