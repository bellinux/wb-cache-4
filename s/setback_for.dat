5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. The attack {{was a major}} <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda {{might not be as}} weakened as previously thought.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski {{plunged into}} the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and {{have given rise to}} a number of different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the Polish cause.|$|E

5|$|Since early 2010, {{opinion polls}} {{regularly}} showed a majority {{support for the}} Progress Party and Conservative Party together. The Progress Party however saw a strong <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the 2011 local elections. The party lost 6% in vote share, while the Conservative Party gained 9%. According to political scientists, most of the setback {{could be explained by}} a low turnout of Progress Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. The Navy did have five s under construction in Germany, but a perceived inability to sail the completed submarines past Gibraltar to Pola led to a hasty decision to sell them to Germany, a severe <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet.|$|E
5|$|With a {{characteristic}} flair for creating publicity, the Air Corps' General Headquarters Air Force (its combat organization) not only successfully made the interception at sea, but exploited both live radio news coverage and dramatic photographs. Although the publicity {{resulted in a}} short-term <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Air Corps ambitions, within a year both U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and future Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall became new proponents of long-range air power.|$|E

5|$|Ironically, {{the success}} of Rossini's Semiramide earlier the same season was what allowed A Life to be staged at all, with {{virtually}} all the cast from Semiramide retained for A Life. Despite A Life's success, the furor over Semiramide aroused an overwhelming demand for Italian opera. This proved a <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Russian opera in general and particularly for Glinka's next opera, Ruslan and Lyudmila when it was produced in 1842. Its failure prompted Glinka to leave Russia; he died in exile.|$|E
5|$|Khazir {{was a major}} <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the Umayyads, who did not launch another {{invasion}} of Iraq until 691. However, al-Mukhtar's victory was short-lived as he was killed a year later when the Zubayrids took over Kufa. Meanwhile, the blood feud between the Qaysi and Yamani tribal elements of the Umayyad Caliphate intensified due to Umayr's mid-battle defection and subsequent spearheading of attacks against the tribes of Taghlib and Kalb. In these later battles, the Kalb were led by Humayd ibn Hurayth al-Kalbi, an Umayyad commander who survived Khazir.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Gompers of the AFL {{recognized}} that the strike was damaging the cause of labor {{in the public mind}} and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.|$|E

40|$|To improve {{air quality}} near large swine {{production}} sites and manure application fields, Kentucky has legislated setback requirements. Unlike other states, however, Kentucky requires swine producers to control all acreage in the setback. Furthermore, the <b>setback</b> length <b>for</b> surface application, an odorous option, {{is longer than}} that for incorporation. This paper evaluates how much longer the <b>setback</b> length <b>for</b> surface application must be to encourage soil incorporation of swine manure. Results indicate that Kentucky's setback lengths do not encourage odor control via incorporation;t he <b>setback</b> length <b>for</b> surface application must be substantially longer than that for incorporation...|$|R
5|$|Six {{months after}} the release of the iPhone 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple {{announced}} that sales of the iPhone brand had exceeded 500 million units. By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, the iPhone 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million iPhone 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust the iPhone 5S from the top selling spot was a major <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4, {{in the first quarter of}} their releases, had outsold the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonians {{had been}} {{defeated}} in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC which left the Spartans in control of Argos. This Spartan gain was a <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the Achaean League who {{had been trying to}} incorporate Sparta into their league for many years. The Romans had won the Second Macedonian War and it left them in control of Greek affairs. However, they decided not to occupy Greece but to garrison some cities for five years. The tyrant of Sparta, Nabis, who had declared himself king, was troubling the Achaean League and was also threatening to destroy the peace in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena was {{produced}} {{on a budget}} of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988, the film received critical acclaim. It was also premiered at the 12th International Film Festival of India. However, it was a commercial failure and Babu had to incur a loss of 0.6 million. It was dubbed as a <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Chiranjeevi who had starred in a streak of successful films such as Pasivadi Pranam, Swayamkrushi, Jebu Donga (all released in 1987) and Manchi Donga (1988). Babu considered Rudraveena a spiritually awakening film personally and felt that a book could be written about it. The film was remade into Tamil as Unnal Mudiyum Thambi {{in the same year}} by Balachander himself, with Kamal Haasan reprising Chiranjeevi's role, while Ganesan reprised his role.|$|E

25|$|A study {{commissioned}} in 2000 by the Ministry of Economy {{suggested to}} liberalize the German water sector, allowing competition {{similar to the}} telecommunications and electricity sectors.

25|$|On 3 October 1935, General Emilio De Bono {{advanced}} into Ethiopia from Eritrea {{without a}} declaration of war, leading a force of approximately 100,000 Italian and 25,000 Eritrean soldiers towards the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. In December, after {{a brief period of}} inactivity and minor <b>setbacks</b> <b>for</b> the Italians, De Bono was replaced by Badoglio.|$|R
5|$|The Tyler-Texas {{treaty was}} in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an {{accident}} aboard USS Princeton on February 28, 1844, just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic. The Princeton disaster proved a major <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{also became}} embroiled {{in the dispute}} between Hilary, the Bishop of Chichester, and Walter de Lucy, the abbot of Battle Abbey, over Hilary's claims to {{jurisdiction}} over the abbey and the abbey's counter-claims that it was exempt from episcopal supervision. The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King William I of England and its status as an eigenkirche, or proprietary church of the king. Under King Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy. Theobald supported the bishop, who eventually secured a trial before King Henry II. It was a minor <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Theobald when the case was eventually decided in Battle's favour, mainly {{on the basis of}} charters that were thought at the time to be genuine, but modern historians have come to believe were forged.|$|E
5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular {{with the people of}} York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority from the pope, which he had not yet received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E

50|$|The use of text figures {{suffered}} further <b>setbacks</b> <b>for</b> {{most of the}} 20th century, amid {{attempts to}} do away with typographic case altogether, and they became rarer still with the advent of phototypesetting. Fine book faces for mechanical typesetting still used text numerals well into the 20th century, and they began to make a strong comeback.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 {{sovereign}} states. The appointment of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led {{to the rise of}} liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich. The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states. National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy. In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the movement.|$|E
5|$|The defeat off {{the coast}} of Durazzo, though devastating to Guiscard's fleet, had inflicted little damage to his army as the {{majority}} of it had disembarked before the battle in preparation of the siege of Durazzo. In the coming months, Guiscard would regroup his forces and defeat a large Byzantine army led by Alexios I himself. In 1082, Guiscard took the city of Durazzo, and as the Venetian sailors were forced out of the city and their ships vacated the harbor of Durazzo, the first victory by Venice against the Norman fleet appeared just a temporary <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> the Normans. Due to the new trade privileges and the fact that virtually no damage was inflicted on the Venetians during this siege, Selvo remained very popular in Venice. Meanwhile, Guiscard advanced rapidly across the Balkan Peninsula, but his march was halted by an urgent dispatch and a call for help from his greatest ally, Pope Gregory VII. Guiscard responded by returning to Italy and marching on Rome to temporarily expel Henry IV, but in the process, he lost almost all the territories he had gained in the Balkans. Knowing that Guiscard was gone, in 1083, Selvo sent the Venetian fleet to recapture both Durazzo and the island of Corfu to the south.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Ouadi Doum was {{a severe}} <b>setback</b> <b>for</b> Libya. Deserted {{by most of}} their Chadian allies, Libyan forces found {{themselves}} isolated in foreign territory, {{and the loss of}} the main Libyan air base in Chad prevented Libya from providing close air cover to its troops. In general, the offensive against FANT had exposed the vulnerability of Libya's heavy armor to a more mobile enemy. On Gaddafi's orders, a general withdrawal was undertaken from Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture, beginning with Faya-Largeau. The town had served as the main Libyan base during the preceding four years, but was in danger of being encircled. Its garrison of 3,000 men, together with the survivors of Ouadi Doum, retired toward the Libyan base at Maatan-as-Sarra, north of the Chadian border. In an attempt to reduce the damage inflicted to his international standing, Gaddafi announced that Libya had won the confrontation, and was now leaving Chad so that the opposition could play its part in fighting Habré.|$|E

In September 2005, Brett Richardson (guitars and bassoon) joined ist, following guest appearances on their second album.|$|R
