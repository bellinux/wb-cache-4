40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{results from}} both genes and the environment. Mapping genetic loci in animal models can help identify genes {{that are involved}} in type 2 diabetes to better understand the disease. Heterogeneous stock (HS) rats are derived from eight inbred founder strains and maintained in a breeding strategy that minimizes inbreeding. HS rats have a highly recombinant genome, which allows for rapid fine-mapping of complex traits genome-wide. However, this results in a complicated set of relationships between animals that is non-existent in traditional genetic mapping methods. To fine-map traits involved in type 2 diabetes, multiple diabetic phenotypes were collected in 1, 038 HS male rats and these animals were genotyped using the Affymetrix 10 K SNP array. Following ancestral haplotype reconstruction, a mixed modeling approach was used to identify genetic loci involved in two phenotypes suggestive of diabetes: fasting glucose and glucose area under the curve after a glucose tolerance test. Sibship was used as a random effect in the model to account for the complex family relationships. A genome-wide <b>significant</b> marker <b>interval</b> was detected on chromosome 11 for fasting glucose with a 95 % confidence interval of 5. 75 Mb. Genome-wide <b>significant</b> marker <b>intervals</b> were also detected on chromosomes 1, 3, 10, and 13 for glucose area under the curve, with the average 95 % confidence interval for these loci being only 3. 15 Mb. A multilocus modeling technique involving resample model averaging was applied to the fasting glucose phenotype. This technique determines how frequently each locus is detected when resampling a portion of the original data-set, thus reducing potential false positives. Multilocus modeling results for fasting glucose coincided with the <b>significant</b> marker <b>interval</b> demonstrated in the mixed modeling approach.

The {{interval}} {{temporal logic}} AB features two modalities {{that make it}} possible to access intervals which are adjacent {{to the right of the}} current interval (modality 〈A〉) and proper subintervals that have the same left endpoint of it (modality 〈B〉). AB is one of the most <b>significant</b> <b>interval</b> logics, as it allows one to express meaningful (metric) properties, while maintaining decidability (undecidability rules over interval logics, AB is EXPSPACE-complete [14]). In an attempt to capture ωS-regular languages with interval logics [15], it was proved that AB extended with an equivalence relation, denoted AB∼, is decidable (non-primitive re-cursive) on the class of finite linear orders and undecidable on N. The question whether the addition of two or more equivalence relations makes finite satisfiability for AB undecidable was left open. In this paper, we answer this question proving that AB∼ 1 ∼ 2 is undecidable. ...|$|E

The objective of the current study is to apply the reliable change index (RCI) statistic to examine whether the Parent Observation of Early Markers Scale (POEMS) is sensitive to developmental change, and whether these changes can be quantified along a child’s developmental trajectory. Ninety-six children with older siblings with autism were followed from 1 - 36 months of age.

The results showed that the coherence of the blood pulse and its harmonics with the eye’s aberrations was, on average, weak (0. 4 ± 0. 15), while the coherence of the respiration signal with eye’s aberrations was, on average, moderate (0. 53 ± 0. 14).

50|$|The first {{successful}} {{identification of a}} strong infrared spectral signature from surficial carbonate minerals of local scale (< 10 km²) {{was made by the}} MRO-CRISM team. Spectral modeling identified a key deposit in Nili Fossae dominated by a single mineral phase that was spatially associated with olivine outcrops. The dominant mineral appeared to be magnesite, while morphology inferred with HiRISE and thermal properties suggested that the deposit was lithic. Stratigraphically, this layer appeared between phyllosilicates below and mafic cap rocks above, temporally between the Noachian and Hesperian eras. Even though infrared spectra are representative of minerals to less than ≈0.1 mm depths (in contrast to gamma spectra which are sensitive to tens of cm depths), stratigraphic, morphologic, and thermal properties are consistent with the existence of the carbonate as outcrop rather than alteration rinds. Nevertheless, the morphology was distinct from typical terrestrial sedimentary carbonate layers suggesting formation from local aqueous alteration of olivine and other igneous minerals. However, key implications were that the alteration would have occurred under moderate pH and that the resulting carbonates were not exposed to sustained low pH aqueous conditions even as recently as the Hesperian. This increased the likelihood of local and regional scale geologic conditions on Mars that were favorable to analogs of terrestrial biological activity over geologically <b>significant</b> <b>intervals.</b>|$|R
