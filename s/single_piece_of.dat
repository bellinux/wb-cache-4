5|$|The {{appeal is}} based upon fresh {{evidence}} that was not available at the original trial, it is hoped the conviction will be quashed and a retrial ordered... Upon his conviction, Mr Park's family and friends launched a campaign to clear his name, claiming there was no <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence that pointed indisputably to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83kg) aluminum apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> aluminum cast at the time, when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce {{and the price of}} aluminum plummeted, making the once-valuable apex more ordinary, though it still provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex that served as the original lightning rod. The monument opened to the public on October 9, 1888.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The earlobe {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of a scanned copy of the 1599 Japanese edition of the Guia Do Pecador {{has been carried out}} in an attempt to ascertain whether certain sequences of characters were printed using <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> type. The results of the study strongly indicate that for all the sequences examined, there is no clear evidence that <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> type were used, and in many cases {{it is clear that the}} characters and ligatures were printed with separate type components...|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge of}} the yangqin consist <b>of</b> long, <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood with many {{protruding}} [...] "stubs" [...] supporting the strings unlike the santur, which uses a number of small, individual chesspiece-like bridges.|$|R
5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made from a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, {{or from a}} chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages}} of the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E
5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E
50|$|With few exceptions, {{the objects}} {{are made from}} <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> stone that weigh on average 15 ST each. The largest stone weighs 30 ST and the tallest are two monoliths {{standing}} 25 ft each.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the laths {{need to be}} {{held off}} of a solid surface so the plaster can wrap around the lath. <b>Single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> lath applied to a surface for this purpose are {{sometimes}} called counter lath.|$|R

5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software {{would allow them to}} work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E

On the upper level the columns do not support arches, but rather a running frieze with iron balconies between them, and windows which were originally made from walnut wood.|$|R
5000|$|Kafka {{had decided}} not to do {{literary}} work there. However, he kept diaries and [...] "Oktavhefte". From the notes in these books Kafka extracted 109 numbered <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> text on [...] "Zettel", <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> paper in no given order. These aphorisms were first published in 1931 by Kiepenheuer & Witsch, under the title Brod had chosen: [...] "Betrachtungen über Sünde, Hoffnung, Leid und den wahren Weg" [...] (Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).|$|R

50|$|The Golden hats known so far {{are made}} from a gold alloy {{containing}} 85-90% Au, about 10% Ag and traces of Cu and Sn (< 1% each). They are made <b>of</b> seamless <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> gold sheet, hammered to a thinness between 0.25 mm (Schifferstadt) and 0.6 mm (Berlin). Thus, the cones are surprisingly light considering their size. The Ezelsdorf example, measuring 89 cm in height, weighs only 280 g.|$|R

In 2011, the Jewish Museum Berlin invited the artist to show her work from {{the past ten years}} at the exhibition [...] "how german is it?". In 2012, Gronbach participated in the MANIFESTA 09 European Art Biennale.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century all vessels' masts were made of wood formed from a <b>single</b> or several <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> timber which {{typically}} consisted of {{the trunk of a}} conifer tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and royal masts. Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood. Such a section was known as a made mast, as opposed to sections formed from <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> timber, which were known as pole masts.|$|R
25|$|The Toda dress {{consists}} of a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cloth, which is worn like shalya wrap over a dhoti for men and as a skirt for women along with shalya wrap. The symbols from traditional costumes are very old and similar to those worn in ancient India, according to surviving representations.|$|E
25|$|A {{solid wood}} floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses {{moisture}} from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.|$|E
25|$|Piecing: Sewing {{small pieces}} of cloth into patterns, called blocks, that are then sewn {{together}} to make a finished quilt top. These blocks may be sewn together, edge to edge, or separated by strips of cloth called sashing. Note: Whole cloth quilts typically are not pieced, but are made using a <b>single</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> cloth for the quilt top.|$|E

50|$|On 7 May 1948 a Scottish {{airlines}} Liberator departed Prestwick on a cargo {{charter flight}} to Calcutta via Rome, Cyprus, Basra and Karachi. On board was a ship's propeller shaft weighing 6 tons 7 cwt (6.5 tonnes) and measuring 19 feet (ft) 6 inches (5.9 m), which was urgently required for SS Clan Angus. At the time, this {{was believed to}} be one <b>of</b> the heaviest <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> machinery carried by a British commercial aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The stoa leads off {{north-east}} {{from the}} main sanctuary. It {{was built in the}} Ionic order and consists of seven fluted columns, unusually carved from <b>single</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> stone (most columns were constructed from a series of discs joined together). The inscription on the stylobate indicates that it was built by the Athenians after their naval victory over the Persians in 478 BC, to house their war trophies. The stoa was attached to the existing Polygonal Wall.|$|R
