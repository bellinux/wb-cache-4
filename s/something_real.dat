25|$|Meg & Dia (also {{then known}} as The Meg & Dia Band) {{released}} its first album, Our Home is Gone, in 2005. At the time, the band consisted of just the two Frampton sisters, and the album's tracks were mostly acoustic songs. Meg played guitar and provided back-up vocals while Dia sang. A year later, they released their second album, <b>Something</b> <b>Real,</b> their first album released under Doghouse Records.|$|E
25|$|In addition, on July 9 AAF intelligence, {{with help}} from the FBI, {{secretly}} began an investigation of the best sightings, mostly from pilots and military personnel. Arnold's sighting, {{as well as that of}} the United Airline's crew, were included in the list of best sightings. Three weeks later they came to the conclusion that the saucer reports were not imaginary or adequately explained by natural phenomena; <b>something</b> <b>real</b> was flying around. This laid the groundwork for another intelligence estimate in September 1947 by Gen. Nathan Twining, commanding officer of the Air Materiel Command, which likewise concluded the saucers were real and urged a formal investigation by multiple government agencies. This in turn resulted in the formation of Project Sign at the end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF UFO investigation. Project Sign eventually evolved into Project Grudge, and then the better known Project Blue Book.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as {{the root of all}} clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and has no place in linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as <b>something</b> <b>real,</b> then one is likely to go down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is to position the verb as the root of all structure, which means one has chosen the path of dependency grammar.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Categorization—such as {{deciding}} whether <b>something</b> is <b>real</b> ethnography—is a difficult task, because nature and social practices, {{the topics of}} ethnography, themselves do not come with inherent labels. In this article, which takes its starting point in AGAR's contribution to {{the debate on the}} quality of qualitative research, I articulate and expose the aporetic and internally contradictory nature of categorizing <b>something</b> as <b>real</b> ethnography...|$|R

That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before I go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get <b>something</b> <b>real</b> out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hush" [...] explores issues {{relating}} to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed {{as a means of}} avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode's plot or to the show's overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how [...] "inevitably coherent" [...] this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others to stop talking. Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy [...] "Talk, all talk. Blah blah Gaia. Blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was hoping we would get into <b>something</b> <b>real,</b> but..." [...] These pseudo conversations are what Buffy essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as [...] "locutionary acts": language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.|$|E

They recruited drummer Nicholas Price, and later guitarist Kenji Chan in 2005. Nick was Meg's car mechanic after {{she was involved in}} a minor car accident (which also {{is the result of the}} name for the EP What Is It? A Fender Bender). After Nick joined, Meg and Dia found bassist Ryan Groskreuetz.

2500|$|In January 2006 Meg and Dia {{recorded}} a second album, <b>Something</b> <b>Real,</b> with producer Stacy Jones of American Hi-Fi and Bill Leffler. As a teaser for the album, Meg & Dia released an EP titled What Is It? A Fender Bender, on both iTunes and the Tower Records website in July 2006. What Is It? A Fender Bender featured [...] "Monster" [...] and [...] "Indiana", and {{would also be}} part of their upcoming album. That album was soon-after released on August 8, 2006. <b>Something</b> <b>Real</b> is made up both new works and revamped versions of acoustic songs from Our Home is Gone. The songs [...] "Indiana", [...] "Masterpiece", and [...] "Nineteen Stars" [...] were rerecorded with a full band, while parts of [...] "Timmy" [...] were incorporated into the song [...] "Roses".|$|E

[...] Israel was attacked the next day by the joint armies of neighboring countries in what became the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

2500|$|A further {{review by}} the {{intelligence}} and technical divisions of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field reached the same conclusion. It reported that [...] "the phenomenon is <b>something</b> <b>real</b> and not visionary or fictitious," [...] that there were objects {{in the shape of}} a disc, metallic in appearance, and as big as man-made aircraft. They were characterized by [...] "extreme rates of climb [...] maneuverability," [...] general lack of noise, absence of trail, occasional formation flying, and [...] "evasive" [...] behavior [...] "when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar," [...] suggesting a controlled craft. It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up to investigate the phenomenon. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand {{notes that}} Mothman {{has been widely}} covered in the popular press, some {{claiming}} sightings connected with UFOs, and others claiming that a military storage site was Mothman's [...] "home". Brunvand notes that recountings of the 1966-67 Mothman reports usually state that at least 100 people saw Mothman with many more [...] "afraid to report their sightings" [...] but observed that written sources for such stories consisted of children's books or sensationalized or undocumented accounts that fail to quote identifiable persons. Brunvand found elements in common among many Mothman reports and much older folk tales, suggesting that <b>something</b> <b>real</b> may have triggered the scares and became woven with existing folklore. He also records anecdotal tales of Mothman supposedly attacking the roofs of parked cars inhabited by teenagers.|$|E
2500|$|One {{attempt to}} define {{goodness}} {{describes it as}} a property {{of the world with}} transcendental realism. According to this claim, to talk about the good is to talk about <b>something</b> <b>real</b> that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression {{that there is such a}} thing as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. [...] The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. [...] The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm. [...] The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. [...] The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence was one {{of three}} British medical men who wrote on evolution-related topics from 1813 to 1819. They would all have been {{familiar}} with Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck at least; and probably also Malthus. Two (Prichard and Lawrence) dedicated their works to Blumenbach, the founder of physical anthropology. [...] "The men who took up the challenge of Lamarck were three English physicians, Wells, Lawrence and Prichard... All three men denied soft heredity (Lamarckism)" [...] This account is not too accurate in biographical terms, as Lawrence was actually a surgeon, Wells was born in Carolina to a Scottish family, and Prichard was a Scot. However, it is correct in principle on the main issue. Each grasped aspects of Darwin's theory, yet none saw the whole picture, and none developed the ideas any further. The later publication of Robert Chambers' Vestiges and Matthew's Naval timber was more explicit; the existence of the whole group suggests there was <b>something</b> <b>real</b> (though intangible) about the intellectual atmosphere in Britain which is captured by the phrase 'evolution was in the air'.|$|E
