Heavy crude oils also carry contaminants. For example, Orinoco extra heavy oil contains 4.5% sulfur as well as vanadium and nickel. However, because crude oil is refined before use, generating specific alkanes via cracking and fractional distillation, this comparison is not valid in a practical sense. Heavy crude refining techniques may require more energy input though, so its environmental impact is presently more significant than that of lighter crude if the intended final products are light hydrocarbons (gasoline motor fuels). On the other hand, heavy crude is a better source for road asphalt mixes than light crude.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the next}} stage of the freeway, an {{extension}} south to Thomas Road, multiple routes were investigated. The preferred route was selected based on the least impact from a combination of engineering, social, and environmental factors. The environmental factors considered were conservation areas associated with Thompsons Lake, west of the alignment, three [...] "good quality" [...] wetlands along the alignment, as well as patches of vegetation that were considered [...] "nothing special". The conservation of these areas and associated vegetation was considered desirable.This extension was completed in two stages. The first was a 7.1 km extension to Forrest Road, which opened on 12 December 1991, at a cost of $36.7 million.Subsequently, the freeway was extended a further 11.7 km to Thomas Road. Main Roads looked for opportunities to improve the environment during the planning of this segment. These included the establishment of a protected strip of vegetation alongside the freeway, and the preservation or enhancement of remnant wetlands under threat from urban expansion. The main negative impacts of construction would be controlled through vegetation reinstatement and drainage management plans, as well as the use of [...] "standard techniques" [...] for preventing pollution, which was recognised as a <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> The proposed route had the least environmental consequences compared with viable alternatives, and was the Department of Environment and Conservation's preferred route.The impact on wetlands was further investigated by the EPA in 1992. The EPA estimated that 50 ha of wetland habitat would be lost, including 20 ha with conservation status. The EPA's report concluded that the alignment was not ideal from an environmental standpoint, but recognised the social importance of constructing the freeway, which would facilitate development of the area. The authority was satisfied that the project's environmental repercussions could be managed, with the key recommendation of replacing the function of impacted wetlands. This $31 million section had three at-grade traffic light controlled intersections, which were designed to be replaced by grade separated interchanges. Intersections were used to avoid delaying the extension, as Main Roads Western Australia considered the $30 million cost for interchanges to be prohibitively expensive. The extension opened on 11 September 1994; the Town of Kwinana contributed $1 million, per an agreement on completing the freeway prior to 1995.|$|E

30|$|Dyes are {{extensively}} {{used in many}} industries, such as in textile, leather, paper, wool, {{printing and}} cosmetics. The release of wastewater containing dye compounds into water sources has caused a <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> As dyeing effluent will deplete the dissolved oxygen content in water and also inhibit sunlight from reaching to the water sources, some of the dye wastewater is usually poisonous and carcinogenic to human beings (Bhattacharya and Sharma 2005). Thus, the removal of dyes from wastewater is necessary before discharging into water bodies. Methylene blue (MB), an aromatic heterocyclic compound, was extensively used {{in a range of}} different fields, especially in textile industry. The wastewater containing MB has adverse impacts on flora, fauna and aquatic ecosystems (Ghosh and Bhattacharyya 2002; Guo et al. 2014). Moreover, MB is frequently used as a probe molecule for determining the adsorption capacity of adsorbents (Bestani et al. 2008). Therefore, it is essential to minimize a number of dyes to the lowest possible limit approved by the environment and health agencies. A wide range of methods has been adopted for the treatment of wastewater containing dye residues, such as coagulation, ozonation, irradiation, flocculation, electrochemical destruction, electrokinetic, membrane filtration, photocatalytic oxidation, ion exchange and adsorption on a solid phase. Adsorption is a cost-effective and user-friendly technique for the removal of existing dyes (Danish et al. 2014 a).|$|E

LeeThis is partly because the requirements for such an ultimate material change with people’s perception about its properties {{as well as its}} environmental impact. Thus, the once-believed ultimate Portland cement binder is now becoming unacceptable {{for a number of reasons}} including poor durability as well as <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> during production. Thus, an improved mineral binder is required by modern society to serve the same purposes as the existing Portland cement binder, as well as to reduce the current environmental impact caused by Portland cement production. Geopolymerisation is such a ‘green’ technology capable of turning both natural ‘virginal’ aluminosilicates and industrial aluminosilicate wastes, such as fly ash and blast furnace slag, into mechanically strong and chemically durable construction materials. However, the source materials for geopolymer synthesis are less reactive than Portland cement clinkers and the chemical compositions of these source materials can vary significantly. Consequently, product quality control is a major engineering challenge for the commercialisation of geopolymers. This thesis is therefore devoted to the mechanistic understanding of the interfacial chemical interactions between a number of natural and industrial aluminosilicates and the various activating solutions, which govern the reactivity of the aluminosilicate source materials. The effects of activating solution alkalinity, soluble silicate dosage and anionic contamination on the reactivity of the aluminosilicate source materials to produce geopolymeric binders, as well as their bonding properties to natural siliceous aggregates for concrete making, are examined. In particular, a new set of novel ‘realistic’ reaction models has been developed for such purposes. These reaction models have been further utilised to develop a novel analytical procedure, which is capable of studying geopolymerisation on ‘real’ geopolymers in situ and in real time. This novel procedure is invaluable for the total understanding of geopolymerisation, which is in turn vital for effective geopolymer mix designs. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} econometric {{models have been}} created, {{including}} a travel cost model, contingent behaviour models and a contingent valuation model. Based on these models a “typical” day at Loch Lomond is valued at £ 20. 53, with visitors willing to pay an additional £ 1. 76 to fund environmental improvements. Looking at the particular environmental issues of noise, crowding and environmental damage, noise pollution appears to have the greatest influence on recreation enjoyment. Noise pollution is caused primarily {{by the use of}} personal watercraft (“jet-skis”). It was found that an asymmetrical conflict exists between jet-skiers and non jet-skiers. The research project reveals that there is no simple relationship between the perception of and reality of environmental damage. Although visitor perception of environmental damage often differs from actual levels of environmental damage, the relationship is complex. In terms of “real” environmental impact around the loch area, the visitor-induced environmental damage survey estimates that just over 9 % of the loch shore suffers from <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> Ecological vegetation surveys also confirm that recreation pressure is a statistically significant influence on the presence/absence of plant communities, but that this ecological impact is spatially limited to specific sites around the loch. Following on from both the perceptual and ecological results, policy and management implications are investigated and recommendations are provided – for example the implementation of a possible vehicle parking fee at various sites around Loch Lomond. It is suggested that recreational carrying capacity frameworks such as VERP should be applied, as they assimilate the ecological and social facets of outdoor recreation. An overall conclusion to the thesis is thus that a sustainable approach (framework) to recreation management, one that encompasses the perceptual and ecological dimensions of outdoor recreation, is the only way of maintaining the beauty and enjoyment of Loch Lomond – and, it is suggested, national parks world-wide – for present and future generations.

Some of these factors are; distance from the legal limits of the city, distance from main road, airport, main urban utilities, other human settlements, surface water resources, wind direction, population density, gradient, fault line, vegetation cover and geology. The data and information has been integrated and then by using satellite images, three areas in the 20 km of north east of Sanandaj city were identified for the solid waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|The marine toad Bufo marinus is {{native to}} {{northern}} South America, parts of Central America and Southern Texas. It was deliberately introduced into Australia's tropical north-east in 1935 in an unsuccessful attempt to control the cane beetle, a damaging insect pest of sugarcane crops. The toads quickly established in the new environment and began to spread. Today, they inhabit most of the Australian tropics and sub-tropics and have reached Western Australia. Models predict that global warming will enable the toads to extend their range further south. They cause <b>severe</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts,</b> as all life stages of B. marinus contain bufadienolides, alkaloid substances toxic to vertebrates, resulting in death of the predators ingesting it. The continental scale of this biological invasion {{in combination with the}} remoteness of the areas affected, poses a specific set of challenges to potential control approaches for cane toads. This review covers different biocontrol strategies pursued over the past 8 years, with particular focus on an immunological approach aiming at the disruption of toad metamorphosis. So far, research efforts have failed to produce a tool for large-scale reduction of toad populations. Considerations of future research priorities and efforts are also discussed. No Full Tex...|$|R
