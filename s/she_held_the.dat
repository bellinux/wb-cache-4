5|$|A chapter {{entitled}} Shashthidevyupakhyanam, appended to {{the texts}} Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Devi Bhagavata Purana, narrates {{the tale of}} Shashthi.

Priyavrata set off to the cremation grounds with the corpse of his son. On his way, he saw a celestial woman dressed in white silk and jewels, riding in a heavenly chariot.

Priyavrata stopped the goddess, praising her and pleading that she return his son to him. The goddess agreed on the condition that Priyavrata would initiate and propagate her worship in all three worlds: heaven, earth and the netherworld. She returned the child to the king, naming him Suvrata and declaring that he should become famous as a great, virtuous, and learned ruler. Priyavrata decreed that Shashthi should be worshipped on the sixth day of every month, as well as the sixth and twenty-first days after childbirth, and on all occasions auspicious to a child. She would be worshipped {{in the form of a}} Shaligrama stone, a Purna Ghata under a banyan tree, or an image of her on a wall.|$|E
