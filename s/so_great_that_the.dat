5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, {{so much so that}} the band members were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform in unison.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{substantial}} communities of Slovaks, Hungarians, French, Slovenes, Czechs, Ukrainians, Arabs, Dutch, Scottish, Russian, Scotch Irish, Croats, Macedonians, Puerto Ricans, West Indians, Romanians, Lithuanians, and Greeks. The presence of Hungarians within Cleveland proper was, at one time, <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city boasted the highest concentration of Hungarians {{in the world}} outside of Budapest. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1920 and 1960, the black population of Cleveland increased from 35,000 to 251,000.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, {{and the office}} received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed {{large amounts of money}} to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|The gas {{chambers}} {{worked to}} their fullest capacity from April–July 1944, during {{the massacre of}} Hungary's Jews. Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews until Germany invaded that March. A rail spur leading directly into Birkenau was completed that May to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers. From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, {{at a rate of}} 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period. The incoming volume was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits {{as well as in the}} crematoria. The last selection took place on 30 October 1944.|$|E

25|$|Tourist travel stopped {{during the}} World War II. However, Kuranda {{was one of}} the busiest {{stations}} at this time handling freight for the many troops which were stationed on the Atherton Tablelands from early 1943 for rest, rehabilitation and training in a malaria-free environment close to New Guinea. Traffic at this time was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> road from Cairns to Kuranda was constructed to relieve congestion.|$|E
25|$|During {{the housing}} bubble {{collapse}} of the late 2000s, foreclosures rose by 3,500 percent. In 2010, the area ranked fourth {{in the nation in}} the number of foreclosures, with one filing for every 133 households. The problem of abandoned homes became <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city of Perris initiated a program to paint the brown lawns of abandoned homes green as a way {{to cut down on the}} appearance of blight.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} modern period, {{successor}} states of the Adal and Ajuran empires began to flourish in Somalia, continuing the tradition of seaborne trade established by previous Somali empires. The rise of the 19th century Gobroon Dynasty in particular saw a rebirth in Somali maritime enterprise. During this period, the Somali agricultural output to Arabian markets was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coast of Somalia {{came to be known}} as the Grain Coast of Yemen and Oman. Somali merchants also operated trade factories on the Eritrean coast.|$|E

25|$|A single {{vertical}} tail was tested on a Consolidated B-24D Liberator flown with a Douglas B-23 Dragon fin on 6 March 1943. Then the XB-24K, a B-24D-40-CO, 42-40234, modified by Ford, was flown 9 September 1943, {{with a high}} single tail fin, R-1830-65 engines, and Convair nose turret. Improvements in flight handling and field of fire for the rear guns was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Eglin Field Proving Ground recommended on 26 April 1944, that all future B-24s be ordered with single tails.|$|E
25|$|Cantarini {{was born}} in Padua, where he {{received}} his diploma as physician on February 11, 1664. In addition to following the profession of medicine, he often preached in synagogues. His sermons were frequently attended by Christians, the number of these on one occasion being <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jews had to find seats in the women's gallery. He also taught in the yeshiva, and officiated as cantor, especially on the Day of Atonement. As he had a thorough knowledge of the Talmud, his decisions were often sought in halakic cases.|$|E
25|$|In early 1787, encroachments by American {{settlers}} became <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Overhill Towns held {{a council}} {{on whether to}} completely abandon their homes on the Little Tennessee for more removed locations to the west. They elected to stay, but the crisis provoked another rise in the small-scale raiding which never really ceased completely. The situation of the Overhill Cherokee {{was so bad that}} refugees appeared in Muscogee towns, and the Chickasaw threatened to break the treaty of 1783 and go on the warpath if something were not done to alleviate the situation.|$|E
50|$|About 300 miles {{southwest}} of Madeira, the convoy in which Hawkins was serving was attacked. Hit by three torpedoes, the British Dominion caught fire almost immediately.

25|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} common flood type in normally-dry {{channels}} in arid zones, known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the hydrograph becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.|$|E
25|$|The Partition of British India {{split the}} former British {{province}} of Punjab between the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The mostly Muslim {{western part of}} the province became Pakistan's Punjab province; the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became India's East Punjab state (later divided into Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and the fears of all such minorities were <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence. Some have described the violence in Punjab as a retributive genocide.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Brandeis's nomination was <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senate Judiciary Committee, {{for the first}} time in its history, held a public hearing on the nomination, allowing witnesses to appear before the committee and offer testimony both in support of and in opposition to Brandeis's confirmation. While previous nominees to the Supreme Court had been confirmed or rejected by a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor—often on the same day on which the President had sent the nomination to the Senate—a then-unprecedented four months lapsed between Wilson's nomination of Brandeis and the Senate's final confirmation vote.|$|E
