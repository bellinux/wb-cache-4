40|$|Abstract — Tensile strain, {{normal to}} the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> layers, {{is an issue}} {{in the design of the}} ITER central solenoid (CS). There are a number of sources of through {{thickness}} insulation tension. Tensions develop from flexure of the conductor jacket under axial self loads. Tensions develop from quench behavior. Global components of tensile stress result from normal interactions between the segmented coils. Global simulations of the segmented coil system are presented with parametric studies of frictional behavior and degree of axial preload. With lower preload, and appropriate modeling of slippage and separation, the global tensile stresses can be kept below 4 MPa. A design preload value of 10 MPa is recommended. Radial tensions due to normal operation vertical (axial) stresses are above 50 MPa. Quench tensile stresses are above 20 MPa. These are not altered by adjustments in preload. Designing fo...|$|E

In this paper, Karamay No. 25 naphthenic mineral oil, Karamay No. 25 paraffinic mineral oil, Kraft paper and copper were used to compose four combinations of oil-paper insulation samples. The ageing by-products and dielectric properties of the four combinations of oil-paper insulation samples were compared after they were thermally aged at 130 °C. The influence of copper on the by-products and dielectric properties of different oil-paper insulations was obtained. The results show that copper can accelerate the ageing rate of insulation oils and reduce their AC breakdown voltage.

Nowadays the <b>surface</b> coating <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> resistance device is relatively heavy, measurement error is relatively large, and measurement repeatability is not good.

The experimental results validate the feasibility of this system. The measurement system is stable and reliable, high repetition rate, and has a good application prospect.

The modifications in chemical components at the <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> polymeric <b>insulation</b> should in turn lead to corresponding modifications in electrical properties <b>of</b> the <b>surface</b> and suppress the charge accumulation.
