40|$|This paper {{presents}} the progress made in works aiming {{to design a}} modular low cost cross-flow turbine runner that is compatible with mass production. In an earlier study, stress and weight optimization analyses had been presented for a common runner design. This work includes analyses on segmented modular runner design iteration. Obtaining a closed form analytical formulation for complex mechanical structures such as turbine rotors with multiple blade assemblies can be very problematic. Building a prototype without optimizing the structural stress levels may result in unnecessary hardware costs. In this work, mathematical models for highest stress or lowest factor of <b>safety</b> on <b>critical</b> components of a small modular cross-flow hydro turbine rotor have been explored for various design options through a response surface analysis. The response surface model is obtained based on finite element analysis results following design of simulated experiments. Rotor design parameters have been investigated to optimize factor of <b>safety</b> on <b>critical</b> components without violating the specified weight limits. Box-Behnken data tables {{have been used to}} obtain the response surface model. The attained response model yields the maximum stress and lowest factor of <b>safety</b> for <b>critical</b> rotor components for various combinations of design parameters. Verification runs indicate that response model successfully predicts factor of safety levels close to finite element calculations...|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} types of critical systems: mission critical, business critical, <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> and security critical. The key difference between a <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> system and mission critical system, is that <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> system is a system that, if it fails, may result in serious environmental damage, injury, or loss of life, while mission critical system may result in failure in goal-directed activity. An example of a <b>safety</b> <b>critical</b> system is a chemical manufacturing plant control system. Mission critical system and business critical system are similar terms, but a business critical system fault can influence only a single company or an organization and can partially stop lifetime activity (hours or days). So it {{also can be used}} as a mission critical system in the business. Failure of it will cause very high cost loss for the business. Security critical system may lead to loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss. All these four systems are generalized as critical system.|$|E
