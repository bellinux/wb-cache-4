40|$|We {{present a}} {{concrete}} and explicit {{construction of a}} new <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> operator for loop quantum gravity. The operator is defined on the recently introduced space of partially diffeomorphism invariant states, and this space is preserved by the action of the operator. To define the Euclidean part of the <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> operator, we propose a specific regularization based on the idea of so-called "special" loops. The Lorentzian part of the quantum <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> is merely the curvature operator that has been introduced in an earlier work. Due to the properties of the special loops assignment, the adjoint operator of the non-symmetric constraint operator is densely defined on the partially diffeomorphism invariant Hilbert space. This fact opens up the possibility of defining a symmetric <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> operator as a suitable combination of the original operator and its adjoint. We also show that the algebra of the <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> operators is anomaly free, and describe the structure of the kernel of these operators on a general level...|$|R

40|$|Smolin {{has pointed}} out that the spin network {{formulation}} of quantum gravity will not necessarily possess the long range correlations needed for a proper classical limit; typically, the action of the <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> is too local. Thiemann's length operator is used to argue for a further restriction on the action of the scalar constraint: it should not introduce new edges of color unity into a spin network, but should rather change preexisting edges by ± one unit of color. Smolin has proposed a specific ansatz for a correlated <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint.</b> This ansatz does not introduce color unity edges, but the [scalar, scalar] commutator is shown to be anomalous. In general, {{it will be hard to}} avoid anomalies, once correlation is introduced into the constraint; but it is argued that the <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> may not need to be anomaly-free when acting on the kinematic basis.

40|$|The Hamiltonian {{formulation}} of Horava gravity is derived. In a closed universe the Hamiltonian is a sum of generators of gauge symmetries, the foliation-preserving diffeomorphisms, and vanishes on shell. The <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> is second class, {{except for a}} global, first-class part that generates time reparametrizations. A reduced phase space formulation is given in which the local part of the <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> is solved formally for the lapse {{as a function of}} the 3 metric and its conjugate momentum. In the infrared limit the <b>scalar</b> <b>constraint</b> is linear in the square root of the lapse. For asymptotically flat boundary conditions the Hamiltonian is a sum of bulk constraints plus a boundary term that gives the total energy. This energy expression is identical to the one for Einstein-aether theory which, for static spherically symmetric solutions, is the usual Arnowitt-Deser-Misner energy of general relativity with a rescaled Newton constant.

40|$|This work {{presents}} OT {{analyses of}} two Hindi dialects: Kelkar's Hindi and Eastern Standard. A metrical analysis of Eastern Standard is necessary since the stress pattern cannot be predicted without feet.
