50|$|A <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> is the {{general-purpose}} bench plane, {{used for}} general smoothing of the edges, sizing of timber but only making it smaller to correct size - wood edge jointing. <b>Jack</b> <b>planes</b> are about 12-15 inches long, and the blade can have either a slightly curved edge for smoothing stock, or {{a straight edge}} for jointing stock.|$|R
5000|$|In {{preparing}} stock, the <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> is used {{after the}} scrub plane {{and before the}} jointer plane and smoothing plane. The name {{is related to the}} saying [...] "jack of all trades" [...] as <b>jack</b> <b>planes</b> can be made to perform some of the work of both smoothing and jointer planes, especially on smaller pieces of work.|$|R

5000|$|A scrub {{plane is}} {{generally}} used in diagonal strokes {{across the face}} of a board, rather than parallel to the length of the board (along the grain) as with most other bench planes. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the scrub plane is usually followed by the <b>jack</b> <b>plane,</b> jointer plane, then smoothing plane.|$|R

50|$|The {{jointer plane}} (also {{known as the}} try plane or trying plane) {{is a type of}} hand plane used {{primarily}} to straighten the edges of boards in the operation known as jointing. A jointer plane may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the jointer plane is usually preceded by the fore <b>plane</b> or <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> and followed by the smoothing plane.|$|R

50|$|For {{a time in}} the 1920s, Gallagher was {{involved}} with his protegee, vivacious French-Canadian dancer Fifi D'Orsay. In 1925, inventor Theodore Case made a short film of them in his sound-on-film process at his Auburn, New York studio; however, the film was lost in a fire at the Auburn studio in the mid 1950s, and only outtakes of the film now exist. In August 1931, Fleischer Studios released a short cartoon, Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean, as part of the Fleischer Screen Songs series.

5000|$|Early {{planes were}} all wood, {{except for the}} cutter, or {{combined}} a wood base with a metal blade holder and adjustment system on top. Although there were earlier all-metal planes, Leonard Bailey patented a number of all-metal planes and improvements in the late 19th century.A <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> came {{to be referred to}} as a [...] "No. 5" [...] plane or a [...] "Bailey pattern No. 5" [...] {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The [...] "No." [...] nomenclature originally used by Stanley Tools to label its Bailey pattern plane products continues to identify planes made by various manufacturers. Not all manufacturers of the era had the same number scheme for their planes. Millers Fall and Sargent used different numbers to refer to the same planes.|$|R

6000|$|Jack {{was in a}} desponding mood. His pipe {{would not}} [...] "draw" [...] that morning; and his mind had been more active than usual {{for a few days}} past, {{revolving}} the past, the present, and the future. In <b>short,</b> <b>Jack</b> was cross. There could be no doubt whatever about it; for he suddenly, and without warning, dashed his pipe to pieces against a log, went into the house for another, which he calmly filled, as he resumed his former seat, lit, and continued to smoke for some time in sulky silence. We record this fact because it was quite contrary to Jack's amiable and patient character, and showed that some deep emotions were stirring within him.|$|R
