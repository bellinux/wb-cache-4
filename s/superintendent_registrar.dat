That is not happiness, but the price for which the strong sell their happiness. What we have both done this {{afternoon}} is to renounce tranquillity, above all renounce the romantic possibilities of an unknown future, for the cares of a household and a family. I beg that no man may seize the occasion to get half drunk and utter imbecile speeches and coarse pleasantries at my expense. We propose to furnish our own house according to our own taste; and I hereby give notice that the seven or eight travelling clocks, the four or five dressing cases, the salad bowls, the carvers and fish slices, the copy of Tennyson in extra morocco, {{and all the other}} articles you are preparing to heap upon us, will be instantly sold, and the proceeds devoted to circulating free copies of the Revolutionist's Handbook. The wedding will take place three days after our return to England, by special license, at the office of the district <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar,</b> in the presence of my solicitor and his clerk, who, like his clients, will be in ordinary walking dress.|$|E

50|$|There are {{approximately}} 164 <b>Superintendent</b> <b>Registrar's</b> Districts (SRDs) in Ireland and Northern Ireland; some were dissolved, split, or merged {{in the mid}} to late 1800s, and a few (such as Fingal) were created in the 1900s. Many of the SRDs share the name of the Irish county in which most of their land exists: Specifically, the SRDs of Londonderry, Donegal, Antrim, Sligo, Monaghan, Armagh, Cavan, Longford, Roscommon, Galway, Kilkenny, Carlow, Limerick, Tipperary, Wexford, Waterford, and Cork. However, the SRDs follow the general outlines of Poor Law Unions that preceded them (see accompanying map), and often overlap across two or more counties. SRDs are also distinct from civil and ecclesiastical parishes.|$|R

The aim of this project was to analyse population, economy and social and family structure in mid- 19 th century Hertfordshire, in comparative perspective. The 1851 census {{was the first to}} provide details of both county and town or parish of birth of each individual, whilst clearer instructions were provided for the recording of occupations, the work of members of the head's family and for recording details of farm size and agricultural labour force. There is therefore a wealth of economic, social and demographic information contained in the 1851 census, whilst its consistent and highly structured format renders it ideally suited to treatment by database management systems. Main Topics : The dataset includes a full transcription of the Census Enumerators' Books for Berkhamsted <b>Superintendent</b> <b>Registrar's</b> District in Hertfordshire, enhanced with occupational codings. Variables in the dataset include : record number, surname, forename, schedule number, address, relation to head of household, marital status, age, gender, occupation, social status code, Booth/Armstrong occupational code, raw material occupational code, product occupational code, county of birth, place of birth, disabilities, enumeration district, parish/sub-parish unit, date, PRO reference, ages under one year...|$|R
5000|$|The {{report of}} the Royal Commission on the Poorer Classes in Ireland 1833 led to the Irish Poor Law Act of 1838, under which three [...] "poor law commissioners" [...] divided Ireland into poor law unions, in which paupers would receive poor relief (either workhouse or outdoor relief) paid for by a poor rate based on a [...] "poor law valuation". The name [...] "union" [...] was {{retained}} from the English [...] "union of parishes" [...] model although the Irish union boundaries diverged greatly {{from those of the}} civil parishes. A union was named after the town on which it was centred, where its workhouse was located. Unions were defined as groups of poor law electoral divisions, in turn defined as groups of townlands. Electoral divisions returned members to the board of guardians, with voters who paid higher rates having more votes. During and after the Great Famine, boundaries in the impoverished west were redrawn to create more and smaller union for easier administration. When the Irish General Register Office was established in 1864, each union became a <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar's</b> district, with groups of electoral divisions forming a dispensary or registrar's district. The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 divided administrative counties into urban and rural districts, with each rural district corresponding to the non-urban portion of a poor law union within the county.|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Birth Registration dataset for England and Wales contains administrative records about birth events occurred in England and Wales since 1837, while electronic individual records are available from 1963 onwards. In general the dataset provides a variety of information including the date and place of birth, sex, Mother and Father’s place of birth, occupation and residence (including postcode) and marital status. Information on the birth weight of the child is also supplied by the NHS but approximately 1 % of all live births {{in any given year}} do not contain the birth weight. Note that over time various Acts of Parliament have added to the schedule of information required and therefore the records cannot be perfectly comparable across years. The information about a birth event is originally collected by the General Register Office (GRO), {{which is part of the}} Identify and Passport Service. In most cases, a birth must be registered by the parents to a local registrar within 42 days of the birth date. The residence of the baby born is allocated to the Mother’s usual area of residence and not the place where the birth occurred (although in many cases this will be the same). Once complete, the birth registration details are then passed to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as daily extracts of data from the registration on-line system. The ONS compiles birth statistics from the information recorded at birth registration and, under the Statistics and Registration Service Act, since April 2008 ONS has also been the Data Controller responsible for the governance and disclosure of individual level data. This implies that the dissemination of birth records for research and statistical purposes is currently responsibility of ONS. Aggregate statistics regarding birth registrations are published to a pre-announced timetable available at www. statistics. gov. uk. Some data are available on a quarterly basis. Annual figures based on calendar year of occurrence are usually published in the July of the following year. Birth statistics data are governed by the UK Statistics Authority and so is of a high standard. Once on the ONS database, the data are passed through a series of validation processes and any inconsistencies are highlighted and dealt with appropriately. Validation checks are also made at various times by <b>registrars,</b> <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrars,</b> and inspectors of registration. The Birth Registration dataset held by the Office for National Statistics covers births in England and Wales. Information on births in Scotland is recorded by National Records of Scotland. In Northern Ireland it is recorded by the Department for Finance and Personnel. The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 required all parents to register a birth. However, it omitted to impose any penalty for failure by the parent to do this. The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1874 rectified this. Whilst the majority of births will still have been registered between 1836 and 1874, it must be regarded as incomplete for research and statistical purposes. As specified previously, various Acts of Parliament have added to the schedule of information required at registration. The Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1953, defined a stillbirth as ‘a child which has issued forth from its mother after the twenty- eighth week of pregnancy and which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show other signs of life’. This definition was used up to the 30 th of September 1992. On the 1 st of October 1992 the Stillbirth (Definition) Act 1992 came into force, altering the above definition of a stillbirth to 24 or more weeks completed gestation. Figures for the stillbirths from 1993 are thus not fully comparable with those for previous years. Because this change of definition occurred three-quarters of the way into 1992, most of the tables on stillbirth data in 1992, are on the basis of the old definition. Research Usage and Linkage The Birth Registration records for England and Wales have been used for a wide range of research purposes including population estimates and analysing geographical and historical trends in birth and health patterns. The dataset has also been employed in vital events studies to help understand population demographics. For these aims the data have been linked to a number of different datasets about health and vital events. As an example, the birth records have been linked with the Hospital Episode Statistics Inpatient (including maternity dataset) to analyse patterns in health and the causes of premature birth, defects and infant mortality. The dataset has also been used as part of other studies for example the ONS Longitudinal Study and the Millennium Cohort Study. The former is a 1 % sample of census records and vital events data to help examine important social health and demographic issues. The latter is a longitudinal observational study of nearly 19, 000 babies born in the UK between September 2000 and January 2002 to help understand the social conditions surrounding birth and early childhood. </div...|$|R
50|$|For marriages, Church of England clergy {{acted as}} the local registrar. Two {{identical}} registers of marriages were kept {{and when they were}} complete, one was sent to the <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar.</b> However, every three months, the clergyman had to send a copy of his marriage records (detailing marriages that had taken place in the preceding three months) directly to the <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar.</b> The Marriage Act 1836 also permitted marriages by licence to take place in approved churches, chapels and nonconformist meeting houses, other than those of the Church of England. Marriages were only legally binding if they were notified to the <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar</b> by the officiating minister so in effect, this required the presence of a local registration officer as the authorising person. When a nonconformist minister or other religious official, such as a rabbi, performed the ceremony it was necessary for the local registrar or his assistant to be present so that the marriage was legal. This legalisation was not repealed until 1898, after which date, nonconformist ministers and other religious leaders could take on the role of notifying official, if so appointed, and on the condition that their premises were licensed for the solemnising of marriage. The civil authorities, i.e. the local registrar, could also perform marriage by certificate in a register office. Changes in marriage laws since 1836 have also affected how marriages are registered, for example, civil partnerships for same-sex couples were introduced by the British Government in 2004 and the GRO records these ceremonies through its civil registration system.|$|E
50|$|The {{marriage}} certificate itself {{is given to}} the couple who have married. Copies are made in two registers: one is retained by the church or register office; the other, when the entire register is full, is sent to the <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar</b> of the registration district. Every quarter, the minister or civil registrar prepares a further copy of all the marriage entries and sends them to the Registrar General.|$|E
50|$|On 1 July 1837 civil {{registration}} {{was introduced}} in England and Wales, providing a central record of all births, deaths and marriages. A Registrar General was appointed with overall responsibility and the country was divided into registration districts, each controlled by a <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar.</b> Under this system, all marriage ceremonies have been certified by the issuing of a marriage certificate whose details are also stored centrally. From that date, marriage ceremonies could be performed, and certificates issued either by a clergyman of the Church of England, in a parish church, or by a civil registrar in a civil register office. Marriages performed according to the ceremonies of Quakers and Jews also continued to be recognised as legal marriages, and certificates were issued.|$|E
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Ottery St Mary school, and trained for the law, being {{admitted}} to practise as a solicitor in Trinity term 1832. In January 1833 he settled at Penzance, where he entered into partnership with George Dennis John. On John's death in 1847 Messrs John and Rodd became John, Rodd and Darke {{and after the}} latter's death the firm became Rodd & Cornish. He had also held many official posts in the town. He was town clerk from 1847, clerk to the local board from 1849, clerk to the Board of Guardians from {{the passing of the}} Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, and <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar,</b> besides being head distributor of stamps in Cornwall from 1844 to 1867. Rodd retired about 1878 leaving the practice to Thomas Cornish.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the system, it was up to each local {{registrar}} to find out what births, marriages and deaths had taken place in his sub-district. It has therefore been estimated that only about 50-60% of births, both legitimate and illegitimate, were registered as parents were not legally obliged to inform the registrar. It has been estimated that in some parts of England up to 15% of births were not registered between 1837 and 1875. As a result of the Births and Deaths Act 1874, registration was made compulsory from 1875 and the onus was now on parents to inform the registrar when they had a child and penalties were imposed on those who failed to register. Births had to be registered within 42 days at the district or sub-district office, usually by the mother or father. If more days had elapsed but it was less than three months since the birth, the <b>superintendent</b> <b>registrar</b> had to be present and if between three months and a year, the registration could only be authorised by the Registrar General.|$|E
