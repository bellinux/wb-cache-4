50|$|Thayer {{became ill}} in 1928, and donated his {{collection}} of 28,000 skins and 15,000 eggs and nests to Harvard. These included the first clutches ever collected of <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and surfbird. After Thayer's death Harvard received {{his collection of}} 3,500 mounted birds.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened. These include vulnerable Chinese egrets, greater spotted eagles and straw-headed bulbuls, endangered Nordmann's greenshanks and critically endangered <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> as well as greater crested terns.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper's</b> {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} sea coasts and adjacent hinterland on the Chukchi Peninsula and southwards along the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula It migrates down the Pacific coast through Japan, North Korea, South Korea and China, to its main wintering grounds in South and South-East Asia, {{where it has}} been recorded from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.|$|R
50|$|In November 2011, {{thirteen}} <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpipers</b> {{arrived at}} the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) reserve in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire to start a breeding program. The birds hatched from eggs collected in north-eastern Russian tundra earlier and spent 60 days in Moscow Zoo in quarantine {{in preparation for the}} 8,000 km journey. Artificial incubation and captive rearing, termed headstarting, may increase survival rates from less than 25% to over 75%, and the removal of eggs may also lead to a second clutch reared by the parents. In 2013, conservationists hatched twenty chicks in Chukotka.|$|R
50|$|The contact {{calls of}} the <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> include a quiet preep or a shrill wheer. The song, given during display, is an {{intermittent}} buzzing and descending trill preer-prr-prr.

Other-long legged waders seen around Nalbana Island are the lesser flamingos, Goliath heron, grey herons, purple herons, egrets, spoonbills, storks and black-headed ibis. Rare birds reported in the lake are Asiatic dowitchers (NT), Dalmatian pelican (VU), Pallas's fish-eagles (VU), the very rare migrant <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (CR) and spot-billed pelican (NT). The white-bellied sea eagle, pariah kite, brahminy kites, kestrel, marsh harriers, and the world's most widespread bird of prey, peregrine falcon, are among the raptors seen here.|$|E
50|$|The Daedong Bay Important Bird Area {{lies on the}} {{north-eastern}} {{coast of}} the Yellow Sea {{on the west coast}} of North Korea near the mouth of the Taedong River. It comprises 3,500 ha of marine, intertidal and beach wetlands, encompassing a 2,000 ha protected area. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant populations of various birds, including greater white-fronted geese, Oriental storks, black-faced spoonbills, Chinese egrets, great bustards, hooded cranes, red-crowned cranes, Far Eastern curlews, Nordmann's greenshanks and <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> Threats to the site include agricultural intensification and aquacultural development.|$|R
50|$|A {{charitable}} trust (the Eric Hosking Trust) {{was established in}} 1993 to commemorate Hosking’s life and work. Its board of Trustees currently consists of Dawn Balmer, Professor Richard Chandler, Dr Jim Flegg, Robert Gillmor, David Hosking, Robin Hosking, Edward Keeble, and Paul Williams. Its stated aims are to sponsor ornithological research and other natural history projects through the media of photography, art and writing. The Trust has paid out over 30 bursaries to projects varying from {{the development of a}} reliable ageing criterion for British storm petrels to the production of a short animation about the <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper.</b> The latter was drawn and coloured by children in countries along the migration route of this critically endangered species.|$|E
50|$|This bird is {{critically}} endangered, with a current population {{of fewer than}} 2500 - probably fewer than 1000 - mature individuals. The main threats to its survival are habitat loss on its breeding grounds and loss of tidal flats through its migratory and wintering range. The important staging area at Saemangeum, South Korea, has already been partially reclaimed, and the remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future. Long-term remote sensing {{studies have shown that}} up to 65% of key <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> habitat in China, South Korea and North Korea has been destroyed by reclamation. A 2010 study suggests that hunting in Burma by traditional bird trappers is a primary cause of the decline.|$|E
50|$|Xuân Thủy National Park {{is within}} Nam Định Province and covers {{an area of}} 7100 ha {{including}} 4000 ha of low tide wetlands and 3100 ha of land. It was officially gazetted as a park in 2003. Located in the submerged coastal zone of the Red River Delta, it has been declared as a Ramsar Wetland site. It has 120 species of vascular plants and 111 species of water plants. As a migratory bird habitat, it is a staging and wintering area for shorebirds, gulls and waterfowl in the coastal zone of the Red River Delta. Some of the popular bird species in the park are the Asian dowitcher, Nordmann's greenshank, <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> Saunders's gull and black-faced spoonbill. The park is facing threat on account of aquaculture {{and high levels of}} fishing. Shellfish harvesting is also practiced within its boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Saemangeum is an estuarine {{tidal flat}} {{on the coast of}} the Yellow Sea in South Korea. It was dammed by the {{government}} of South Korea's Saemangeum Seawall Project, completed in April 27, 2010, after a long fight between the government and environmental activists, and is scheduled to be converted into either agricultural or industrial land. Prior to 2010, it had played an important role as a habitat for migratory birds. The completion of this seawall {{is likely to be a}} major contributor to the decline of many species. Around 400,000 shorebirds depended on the Saemangeum estuarine as an important feeding ground on the 24,000 km migration between Asia and Alaska and Russia, including the two endangered waders Nordmann's greenshank and <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (each species with fewer than a thousand surviving birds). A conservation organisation has accused authorities of having failed to monitor the project's impact on local wildlife in a transparent way, and carried out an independent monitoring program in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The {{forests of}} Point Calimere, also known the Vedaranyam forests, {{are one of}} the last {{remnants}} of the dry evergreen forests that were once typical of the East Deccan dry evergreen forests ecoregion. The Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary, with an area of 24.17 km2, was created on June 13, 1967. The sanctuary includes the cape and its three natural habitat types: dry evergreen forests, mangrove forests, and wetlands. In 1988, the sanctuary was enlarged to include the Great Vedaranyam Swamp and the Talaignayar Reserve Forest, and renamed the Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary, with a total area of 377 km2. Point Calimere is home to the endangered endemic Indian blackbuck {{and is one of the}} few known wintering locations of the <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper.</b> It also holds large wintering populations of greater flamingos in India. The area is dotted with salt pans and these hold large crustacean populations that support the wintering bird life. Pesticide residues running off from agricultural fields and shrimp farms has entered the ecosystem and many species have high concentrations of DDT and HCH in their tissue.|$|E
50|$|Xuân Thủy National Park is {{a staging}} and {{wintering}} area for shorebirds, gulls and waterfowl {{in the coastal}} zone of the Red River Delta. The National Park is a living space for 250 species of birds (150 migratory and 50 water bird species) from 41 families and 13 orders. 9 species are designated as endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species for example the <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and Nordmann's greenshank.65- 75 black-faced spoonbill - who were chosen to be the symbol of Xuân Thủy National Park - are seen in the migratory season. The total number of black-faced spoonbill {{in the world are}} about 1000, it shows that 5% of the whole population of the species are living in Xuân Thủy National Park during the winter season.The park also provides a habitat for other rare animal species. These include species of otter, endangered cetaceans such as Chinese white dolphins, finless porpoise, and rorqual whales.Furthermore, it has 30 species of reptiles and an uncounted number of different insects.|$|E
50|$|Most notably, in 2006 Birds Korea {{developed}} the Saemangeum Shorebird Monitoring Program (SSMP) {{in partnership with}} the Australasian Wader Studies Group, monitoring the impacts of the world's largest known coastal reclamation (the 40,100 ha Saemangeum) on populations of migratory shorebirds. Prior to seawall closure in April 2006, Saemangeum was considered to be the single most important shorebird site in the Yellow Sea (Barter, 2002). The SSMP documented (following seawall closure) very major declines of several species of shorebirds within the Saemangeum reclamation area and adjacent wetlands (Moores et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2006; Moores et al., 2007), and through further coordinated survey effort (e.g. the 2008 Birds Korea National Shorebird Survey), declines of species such as <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper</b> Eurynorhynchus pygmeus (critically endangered) and great knot Calidris tenuirostris at the national level too. SSMP and other shorebird data gathered in 2008 is to be published in time for the Tenth Conference of the Parties of the Ramsar Convention (to be held in Changwon City, South Korea, between October 28 and November 4, 2008), to inform and influence the increasingly urgent debate on the need to better conserve the intertidal habitats and biodiversity of the Yellow Sea.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The plant {{communities}} of the reserve are highly dependent on proximity to the sea, and altitude zonation. The richest floral families are the grasses and members of Asteraceae, plus species of the Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Cabbage, and Heath families. Otherwise, the area is relatively species-poor due to isolation since the pre-glacial time. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 312 species of vascular plants. The forested areas feature stunted trees, with willow, alder and poplar common on the floodplains. The slopes of the Koryak Highlands on the Gauvin peninsula support cedar forests. [...] Scientists on the reserve have recorded 44 species of mammals: 24 permanent residents, 5 migrants, and 15 marine mammals. The rivers the reserve are important spawning grounds for salmon, chum, brown trout, brook trout, and the Kamchatka grayling. Because of its large, marshy character, the Parapolsky site {{is home to a}} wide variety of water and wading birds - ducks, geese, cormorants, and gulls. During the spring and autumn migration, hundreds of thousands of birds nest or rest on the site. The Koryak Highlands are one of the largest sites for bighorn sheep in northeast Asia. The Cape Gauvin and Lavosky sites, with coastal rocks and ledges, are home to over 30 large colonies of seabirds. [...] Species include the Steller's sea eagle, Aleutian tern, and the <b>Spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper.</b>|$|E
5000|$|According to the Ramsar definition, {{more than}} two-thirds of the country’s landmass may be {{classified}} as wetlands. It is a country dominated by wetland including estuaries, mangrove swamps namely the Sundarbans, freshwater marshes such as haor, swamps and rivers. There are about 628 bird species in Bangladesh, of which 244 are Migratory. About 100 species of migratory birds regularly or occasionally visit the country. Considering the present threats to waterbird conservation in the country, 31 migratory waterbird species are of high priority for future action for conservation. 14 of these species are threatened.The wetlands are home to about 70 species of resident waterbirds including ducks, grebe, cormorants, bitterns, herons, egrets, storks, rails, jacanas, finfoot, waders, gulls, turns and skimmers. Eleven species of resident waterbirds are identified as threatened. The important threatened species are masked finfoot, Indian skimmer, black-headed ibis, greater adjutant, lesser adjutant, Baikal teal, Baer's pochard, ferruginous pochard, wood snipe, Nordmann's greenshank and <b>spoon-billed</b> <b>sandpiper.</b> [...] The wetlands of Bangladesh are being degraded rapidly due to population pressure, withdrawal of water for irrigation, destruction of swamp forest and many other anthropogenic and natural causes. Large scale habitat conversion, unsustainable harvesting policies and lack of ecological considerations have led to the destruction of valuable wetland habitat for water birds and other associated biodiversity. Immediate action is required for restoring these habitats and conserving the water birds in Bangladesh. The Key breeding and staging areas of Bangladesh are: Haor areas such as the Meghna estuary, Tanguar haor and Hail-Hakaluki haors, Chalan Beel, the Sundarbans and other coastal mangroves including Hatia and Nijhum Dweep, haor areas of the north west and off shore Islands.|$|E

It is No. 18 of Wetlands International Global Series and International Wader Studies 17 of the International Wader Study Group. Although publication was delayed, the papers in this proceedings remain an important contribution to international shorebird conservation. Eighteen of the 25 papers are about Australian and New Zealand shorebirds, while the remainder are mainly from Southeast Asia. Topics include managing human disturbance of plovers on Australian beaches, conservation of the <b>Spoon-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Eurynorhynchus pygmaeus in Russia, shorebird studies in Taiwan, and threats from marine farming in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The Yellow Sea {{region is}} of high global {{importance}} for waterbird populations, but recent systematic bird count data enabling {{identification of the}} most important sites are relatively sparse for some areas. Surveys of waterbirds at three sites on the coast of southern Jiangsu Province, China, in 2014 and 2015 produced peak counts of international importance for 24 species, including seven globally threatened and six Near Threatened species. The area is of particular global importance for the 2 ̆ 7 Critically Endangered 2 ̆ 7 <b>Spoon-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Calidris pygmaea (peak count across all three study sites: 62 in spring [2015] and 225 in autumn [2014] and 2 ̆ 7 Endangered 2 ̆ 7 Spotted Greenshank Tringa guttifer (peak count across all three study sites: 210 in spring [2014] and 1, 110 in autumn [2015]). The southern Jiangsu coast is therefore currently the most important migratory stopover area in the world, in both spring and autumn, for both species. Several serious and acute threats to waterbirds were recorded at these study sites. Paramount is the threat of large-scale land claim which would completely destroy intertidal mudflats of critical importance to waterbirds. Degradation of intertidal mudflat habitats through the spread of invasive Spartina, and mortality of waterbirds by entrapment in nets or deliberate poisoning are also real and present serious threats here. Collisions with, and displacement by, wind turbines and other structures, and industrial chemical pollution may represent additional potential threats. We recommend the rapid establishment of effective protected areas for waterbirds in the study area, maintaining large areas of open intertidal mudflat, and the urgent removal of all serious threats currently faced by waterbirds here...|$|E
40|$|The IUCN Species Survival Commission and IUCN Asia Regional Office {{commissioned}} this independent {{report to}} assess the state and condition of intertidal habitats along the East Asian- Australasian Flyway (EAAF), in response to growing concerns expressed by IUCN members over observed declines in biodiversity, the loss of ecological services, {{and an increase in}} ecological disasters. This report is a situation analysis, and it seeks to gather in one place the relevant data and analyses, and to present as clear a picture of the status of the intertidal zone in the EAAF as the data allow. By intention, this report makes no recommendations, but it should serve as a resource for those stakeholders empowered to make or influence decisions and policies in the region. This report makes use of the status and population trends of key species of waterbirds as indicators of the environmental health of intertidal habitats (including beaches, marshes, mudflats, mangroves and seagrass beds). It presents an analysis of 395 coastal sites used by waterbirds along the EAAF and identifies 16 key areas. The findings presented show that there is cause for significant concern over the status of the intertidal zone along the EAAF. Fisheries and vital ecological services are collapsing and ecological disasters increasing, with concomitant implications for human livelihoods. Observed rates of declines of waterbird species of 5 – 9 % per year (and up to 26 % per year for Critically Endangered <b>Spoon-billed</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Eurynorhynchus pygmeus) are among the highest of any ecological system on the planet. Breeding success among migrating species in their Arctic breeding grounds and survival on most wintering grounds (for northern breeding species) {{at the southern end of}} their migrations appears satisfactory, at least where hunting is sustainable. However, problems clearly are occurring along the EAAF during migration. Unless major steps are taken to reverse current trends, the EAAF is likely to experience extinctions and associated collapses of essential and valuable ecological services in the near future. Although all sectors of the EAAF face a variety of threats, the Yellow Sea (including the Bohai Sea) emerges as the focus of greatest concern, with six of 16 key areas identified in this report in the region. Here, the fast pace of coastal land reclamation is the most pressing threat. Remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) analyses show losses of up to 60 % of intertidal habitats in some key areas. In total, more than 41 % of the existing tidal flat area was reclaimed within the six key areas identified by this study. Losses of such magnitude are likely the key drivers of declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services in the intertidal zone of the region. This report reviews the drivers that are leading to such environmental degradation. We evaluated the processes that should maintain or restore a balance between developmental needs and environmental needs (including legal instruments, financing, habitat and species conservation, awareness and knowledge), and found that these were usually weak, and were in some cases dysfunctional. Drivers are reviewed at both the national and site-specific level. The report highlights the risks to biodiversity, to the livelihoods of coastal communities, and to economic investments if the ‘business as usual’ scenario continues. The stakes are very high including loss to fisheries sector valued at US$ billions per year and the potential loss of US$ trillions of coastal cities, towns and lands. The countries along the EAAF have made commitments to global biodiversity targets under several key multilateral environmental agreements, but it will not be possible for the countries to meet these commitments without halting the declining trends in species populations and habitat availability and quality identified in this report. Each country’s economic and environmental sustainability is beingdamaged by the actions of its neighbours. Various existing regional seas initiatives are failing to address these specific problems. The fast pace and nature of human developments affecting the EAAF jeopardizes species that depend on this zone as well as the valuable ecological services that intertidal zone ecosystems deliver to humans. Different species use different suites of sites during northbound and southbound migrations. Therefore, protection of only the best sites will not provide an adequate site network for all migratory species and broader protection of a comprehensive and complementary set of sites is necessary. Although this is a situation analysis and does not include recommendations, we allow ourselves this comment. The birds and habitats of the EAAF are the shared natural heritage of 22 countries. Many of the steps that need to be taken to secure this resource in the long term will require international cooperation. Unless the fast economic development of this region can be balanced with adequate environmental safeguards, impressive-looking economic gains could be short-lived and undermined by the loss of valuable ecosystem services and a growing list of costly ecological disasters...|$|E
