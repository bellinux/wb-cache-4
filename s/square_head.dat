5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} {{the house before}} 1850 (and the lodge at the gate dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a <b>square</b> <b>head</b> again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century two breeds {{had been}} {{developed}} for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a <b>square</b> <b>head,</b> and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably {{closely related to the}} Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.|$|E
500|$|Entrance to {{the church}} was through a doorway with a <b>square</b> <b>head,</b> in the north wall at the west end; this dates from the 19th century.

[...] There are two windows on the south wall, one fully blocked and one partially blocked. [...] The small window at the east end of the church dates from the latter part of the 15th century.|$|E

In the south wall of the chancel are, in {{addition}} to the slit window, a fourteenth/fifteenth century <b>square</b> <b>headed</b> window, and two lancet windows, one of which has been shortened to accommodate a seventeenth century <b>square</b> <b>headed</b> doorway. The east window has three lights.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the breed was crossed with the Percheron, {{and with the}} Boulonnais between 1860 and 1867. During the same time period, crosses were made with the Breton, a {{practice}} supported by some breeders and denounced by others. Farmers in the region also began to add Breton blood into the Poitou mule, giving that animal a more <b>square</b> <b>head</b> and shorter ears. In the Poitevin horse breed, the crosses resulted in the body becoming longer and lighter, the legs longer and with less bone, and gray becoming more common as a coat color. In 1860, Eugene Gayot called the mares of the breed [...] "heavy, common, soft and of medium size". Breeders chose horses with large joints, thick coats and a high croup, and had a preference for a black coat color.|$|E

60|$|A marvellous wandering, {{that which}} {{followed}} {{on the old}} Sparwehr. We were in quest of new lands of silk and spices.

Now this Woozy was a most {{peculiar}} animal, having a <b>square</b> <b>head,</b> square body, square legs and square tail. His skin was very tough and hard, resembling leather, and while his movements were somewhat clumsy, the beast could travel with remarkable swiftness. His square eyes were mild and gentle in expression, and he was not especially foolish. The Woozy and the Patchwork Girl were great friends, and so the Wizard agreed to let the Woozy go with them.|$|E
