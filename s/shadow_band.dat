40|$|We have {{performed}} systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on single-layered cuprate superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CuO 6 +delta to elucidate {{the origin of}} <b>shadow</b> <b>band.</b> We found that the <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> is exactly the c(2 × 2) replica of the main band irrespective of the carrier concentration and its intensity is invariable with respect to temperature, doping, and substitution constituents of block layers.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we studied the fermi arc and the fermi pocket in cuprates in a {{short-range}} diagonal stripe phase with wave vectors (7 π/ 8, 7 π/ 8), which reproduce {{with a high}} accuracy the positions and sizes of the fermi arc and fermi pocket and the superstructure in cuprates observed by Meng et alMeng. The low-energy spectral function indicates that the fermi pocket results from the main band and the <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> at the fermi energy. Above the fermi energy the <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> gradually departs away from the main band, leaving a fermi arc. Thus we conclude that the fermi arc and fermi pocket can be fully attributed to the stripe phase but {{has nothing to do}} with pairing. Incorporating a d-wave pairing potential in the stripe phase the spectral weight in the antinodal region is removed, leaving a clean fermi pocket in the nodal region.

We are able to identify two main differences in their electronic properties. First, the <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> that is present in double layer and low T_c,max single layer cuprates is absent in Tl 2201. Recent studies have linked the <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> to structural distortions in the lattice {{and the absence of}} these in Tl 2201 may be a contributing factor in its T_c,max. Second, Tl 2201 's Fermi surface (FS) contains long straight parallel regions near the anti-node, while in Bi 2201 the anti-nodal region is much more rounded. Since the size of the superconducting gap is largest in the anti-nodal region, differences in the band dispersion at the anti-node may {{play a significant role in}} the pairing and therefore affect the maximum transition temperature.

Light variations in a bandpass of 1 - 500 Hz were detected during the half-minutes preceding and following the total phase. Fourier analysis of the noise spectrum of the variations reveals a sharp drop-off for frequencies above 50 Hz and an overall spectrum quite similar to previously reported power spectra of stellar scintillation. This is consistent with an atmospheric origin for the <b>shadow</b> <b>bands.</b> Cross-correlations between the detector outputs are low, suggesting a short persistence time for the turbulent elements causing the patterns...|$|R

In this underdoped superconductor, we found clear fingerprints of the parent insulator: a <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> and a large pseudo-gap. These observations are most likely described by a "chemical potential shift", which contrasts clearly with the prevailing wisdom of the "pinned chemical potential" learned from the prototype La(2 -x) Sr(x) CuO(4), demonstrating that the route to a high-Tc superconductor is not unique.

We find clear signatures of ordered stripes, although matrix element effects suppress most <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> features. With decreasing stripe correlation length, stripe signatures are quickly washed out, the only remaining effect being a broadening of antinodal quasiparticles.

40|$|The {{increase}} in environmental solar UV radiation due to depletion of ozone layer {{is a recent}} challenge to human health (skin cancer and eye effects) in countries having clear skies. Therefore, applying integrated, passive and inexpensive techniques to assess solar UV radiation is very much essential. Measurements of environmental solar UV radiation in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia area were carried out {{for a period of}} two months in the summer period in 1996 using two techniques in parallel namely: passive nuclear track detectors and active solar UV radiometers. Some of the nuclear track detectors were mounted in different conditions such as: under <b>shadow</b> <b>band,</b> on solar tracking mechanism following the solar rays. Others were mounted on perpendicular, tilted and horizontal surfaces in sunlight. All detectors were attached to a wooden background of the same thickness (0. 5 cm) to eliminate interference of the heat effect of various support materials and have uniformity of the support materials. The assessment was carried out for different periods extending from two to nine weeks continuously. The investigated period covered the hottest months in Saudi Arabia (July and August) when the sky was clear of clouds. The results indicate linear correlation between alpha track diameters and the integrated exposure to solar UV as measured by the solar UV radiometer for all nuclear track detector positions and orientations. The highest slope has been observed for the detectors placed on solar tracking mechanism following the solar rays and the lowest from detectors oriented under the <b>shadow</b> <b>band</b> on horizontal position (measuring the diffused UV radiation only).
