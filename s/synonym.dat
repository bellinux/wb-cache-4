40|$|<b>Synonyms</b> in Polish medical {{terminology}} at {{the turn}} of the 20 th century. Reconnaissance The paper concerns the phenomenon of <b>synonyms</b> in the medical terminology. On the basis of Słownik terminologii lekarskiej polskiej (Dictionary of Polish Medical Terminology, 1881) and Słownik lekarski polski (Polish Dictionary of Medicine, 1905) the author examines (in terms of a structure, origin and chronology) 88 series of <b>synonyms</b> (regarding illnesses) present in both dictionaries. From the examination it results that during a conscious tiding up and shaping of Polish medical terminology it was impossible to eliminate <b>synonyms,</b> a phenomenon undesired in every terminology. Admittedly, in the Słownik lekarski polski (Polish Dictionary of Medicine, 1905) one may observe a tendency to reduce on the number of <b>synonyms</b> in the series of <b>synonyms</b> and the general number of the series, however, scale of this phenomena is still significant. Even if, till the half of twentieth century, nearly half of series of <b>synonyms</b> did not survive, as it is proven by researches conducted by K. Musiołek-Choinski, phenomena of <b>synonyms</b> could not be eliminated. The old series of <b>synonyms</b> are replaced by new ones, and this situation is greatly affected by English vocabulary...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to phraseological English <b>synonyms,</b> {{interchangeability}} and translation equivalence. This paper examines {{the state of the}} phenomenon of synonymy in phraseology at present, classifies phraseological units and phraseological <b>synonyms</b> in particular, common translation techniques of idiomatic <b>synonyms,</b> according to different levels of equivalence. The scientific relevance of the work is a synthesis of the linguistic nature of phraseological <b>synonyms,</b> as well as organizing methods of translation. The object of the research, thus, is English and Ukrainian phraseological <b>synonyms.</b> Its subject comprises peculiarities of translation of those <b>synonyms</b> from English into Ukrainian. Phraseological <b>synonyms</b> are those units whose values are close, but thanks to the stylistic and semantic nuances they can be distinguished. Phraseological <b>synonyms</b> are those, with similar meanings, and as a rule, they correlate with the same part of speech, which have partially similar or identical lexical-phraseological compatibility, but are different in meaning, stylistic nuance. This article summarizes different ways of translation of phraseological <b>synonyms</b> from English to Ukrainian, namely phraseological (full phraseological equivalent, partial equivalent and individual equivalent) non-phraseological (lexical translation, calquing, descriptive translation, contextual or selective translation). The purpose of using idiomatic translation is to reproduce the full equivalent in target language?????? ????????? ???????? ???????????????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ? ?? ????????????? ???????????????, ????????? ?? ???? ? ?????????????. ? ?????? ????????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ?????; ???????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ????????; ??????????????? ????? ?????? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????, ???????? ????????? ??????? ???????????????. ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ??????, ????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ????? ?? ??????????. ??????? ???????????? ?????? ??????????? ? ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????, ? ????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ?? ????????...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the incoherence problem of the visual words in bag-of-words vocabularies. Different from existing work, which performs assignment of words based solely on closeness in descriptor space, we focus on identifying pairs of independent, distant words – the visual <b>synonyms</b> – that are still likely to host image patches with similar appearance. To study this problem, we focus on landmark images, where we can examine whether image geometry is an appropriate vehicle for detecting visual <b>synonyms.</b> We propose an algorithm for the extraction of visual <b>synonyms</b> in landmark images. To show the merit of visual <b>synonyms,</b> we perform two experiments. We examine closeness of <b>synonyms</b> in descriptor space and we show a first application of visual <b>synonyms</b> in a landmark image retrieval setting.
