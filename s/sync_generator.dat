25|$|One of CBWT's {{first big}} mobile {{production}} was Ice Revue, which was broadcast from the Winnipeg Winter Club in March 1956. However, as a mobile production, the equipment {{was different from}} that present in the studio. Several people had phoned the station complaining that their television set would get stuck in vertical or horizontal hold. This would occur when the switcher at the mobile unit went from one camera to another.

500|$|Three {{months into}} development, Bushnell told Alcorn {{he wanted the}} game to feature {{realistic}} sound effects and a roaring crowd. Dabney wanted the game to [...] "boo" [...] and [...] "hiss" [...] when a player lost a round. Alcorn had limited space available for the necessary electronics and was unaware of how to create such sounds with digital circuits. After inspecting the <b>sync</b> <b>generator,</b> he discovered that it could generate different tones and used those for the game's sound effects. To construct the prototype, Alcorn purchased a $75 Hitachi black-and-white television set from a local store, placed it into a [...] wooden cabinet, and soldered the wires into boards to create the necessary circuitry. The prototype impressed Bushnell and Dabney {{so much that they}} felt it could be a profitable product and decided to test its marketability.|$|E

50|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{a digital}} console, {{the same as}} all other game {{consoles}}. However, like all video game consoles up until the sixth generation, it uses analog circuitry for the output to match the televisions of its era, which were analog; also, like all later consoles from the Nintendo 64 onwards, it features analog game controllers. Due to these two facts, many collectors have mistakenly considered the Odyssey to be an analog console, with the misunderstanding becoming so widespread that Baer was eventually led to clarify that the Odyssey is indeed a digital console: all of the electronic signals exchanged between the various parts responsible for gameplay (ball and players <b>generators,</b> <b>sync</b> <b>generators,</b> diode matrix, etc.) are binary. The type of digital components used feature DTL, a common pre-TTL digital design component using discrete transistors and diodes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sync</b> pulse <b>{{generator}}</b> is {{a special}} type of generator which produces synchronization signals, {{with a high level}} of stability and accuracy.

50|$|In {{television}} studio operations, longitudinal timecode {{is generated by}} the studio master <b>sync</b> <b>generator,</b> and distributed from a central point. Central sync generators usually derive their timing from an atomic clock, either using network time or GPS. Studios usually maintain two or three clocks, and automatically switch over if one fails.|$|E

50|$|Although {{initially}} {{offered as}} just an add-on to an Amiga, {{the product was}} soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the Toaster, Amiga, and <b>sync</b> <b>generator.</b> These Toaster systems became very popular, primarily because {{at a cost of}} around $5,000 US, they could do much of what a $100,000 fully professional video switcher (such as an Evans and Sutherland) could do at that time. The Toaster was also the first such video device designed around a general-purpose personal computer that is capable of delivering broadcast-quality NTSC signals.|$|E

50|$|Interrupt latency is {{constant}} at three instruction cycles. External interrupts {{have to be}} synchronized with the four-clock instruction cycle, otherwise {{there can be a}} one instruction cycle jitter. Internal interrupts are already synchronized. The constant interrupt latency allows PICs to achieve interrupt-driven low-jitter timing sequences. An example of this is a video <b>sync</b> pulse <b>generator.</b> This is no longer true in the newest PIC models, because they have a synchronous interrupt latency of three or four cycles.|$|R
50|$|If location, {{a camera}} {{is driven by}} a DC motor, {{with some sort of}} {{governor}} control to hold it fairly accurate at 24 fps, a <b>sync</b> pulse <b>generator</b> geared to the movement or motor shaft could be employed to provide the sync pulse output. A cable conducts the sync pulse from camera to sound recorder. The sync pulse is typically a sine wave of 50 or 60 Hz with an RMS amplitude of approximately 1 volt.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Divide-and-conquer is a {{well-known}} and important programming model that supports efficient execution of parallel applications on multi-cores, clusters and grids. In a divideand-conquer system such as Satin or Cilk, recursive calls are automatically transformed into jobs that execute asynchronously. Since the calls are non-blocking, consecutive calls {{are the source of}} parallelism. However, theprogrammer hastomanuallyenforce synchronization with sync statements that indicate where the system has to wait for the result of the asynchronous jobs. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to automatically insert sync statements to relieve the programmer of the burden of thinking about synchronization. We investigate whether correctness can be guaranteed and to what extent the amount of parallelism is reduced. We discuss the code analysis algorithms that are needed in detail. To evaluate our approach, we have extended the Satin divideand-conquer system, which targets efficient execution on grids, with a <b>sync</b> <b>generator.</b> The fact that Satin uses Java as a base language helps the <b>sync</b> <b>generator</b> to reason about control flow and aliasing of references to objects. Our experiments show that, with our analysis, we can automatically generate synchronization points in virtually all real-life cases: in 31 out of 35 realworld applicationsthesyncstatements are placedoptimally. The automatic placement is correct in all cases, and in one case the <b>sync</b> <b>generator</b> corrected synchronizationerrors inan application (FFT). I...|$|E

50|$|Lebar and his Westinghouse team {{wanted to}} add color to their camera as early as 1967, and {{they knew that the}} CBS system would likely be the best system to study. The Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera used a {{modified}} version of CBS's field-sequential color system. A color wheel, with six filter segments, was placed behind the lens mount. It rotated at 9.99 revolutions per second, producing a scan rate of 59.94 fields per second, the same as NTSC video. Synchronization between the color wheel and pickup tube's scan rate was provided by a magnet on the wheel, which controlled the <b>sync</b> pulse <b>generator</b> that governed the tube's timing.|$|R

40|$|A {{primary sensor}} used in {{environmental}} and earth-resource observation, the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) {{was designed for}} use on the ITOS D series spacecraft.

The components of this system are described. The optical subsystem of the VHRR consists of a scanning mirror, a Dall-Kirkham telescope, a dichroic beam splitter, relay lenses, spectral filters, and an IR detector. Signal electronics amplify and condition the signals from the infrared and visible light detector. <b>Sync</b> <b>generator</b> electronics provides the necessary time signals.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a synthesizable model of the Serial Communication Interface and Synchronous Serial Interface, which constitutes the Port C of Motorola DSP 56002 is presented in this report. They serves as a full duplex serial interface to other DSPs, processors, codecs, digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters and other transducers. The SCI block is able to handle a data rate of 5 Mbps in Synchronous mode and 625 Kbps in asynchronous mode for a 40 MHz clock. It supports five word formats including a multidrop mode for multiprocessor systems. SSI provides a data rate of 10 Mbps for the same 40 MHz clock. The design includes a programmable on-chip or external baud rate generator/interrupt timer for the SCI and a clock generator and frame <b>Sync</b> <b>generator</b> for the SSI. The thesis focus on arriving at a full functional description of individual blocks included with Port C from the data sheets and product users manual. From this operational description a behavioural model was developed. The structure and implementation {{is based on the}} Motorola DSP 56002 with additional support for a variable data-width. The model is written completely in behavioural VHDL with a top-down approach and the model was verified and validated...|$|E
