His chances improved in 1936 {{when he was}} hired as a decorator for the shop and the display windows of L'Innovation, a Belgian chain of supermarkets. In the same year, he met Paula Van Den Branden, whom he married on 9 October 1937. After living in Antwerp for two years and having a daughter, Helena, in 1938, the first of their four children, the couple moved to the more rural Schilde in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Consider an {{experiment}} {{that can produce}} a number of outcomes. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space of the experiment. The power set of the sample space (or equivalently, the event space) is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling an honest die produces one of six possible results. One collection of possible results corresponds to getting an odd number. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} {{is an element of}} the power set of the sample space of die rolls. These collections are called events. In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on <b>some</b> <b>odd</b> number. If the results that actually occur fall in a given event, that event is said to have occurred.|$|E

He criticized the Meg storyline as he did not find mass suicide funny; he also commented that Peter felt a lot like Homer from The Simpsons.

500|$|Nolan's most {{prominent}} recurring theme {{is the concept}} of time. The director has identified that all of his films [...] "have had <b>some</b> <b>odd</b> relationship with time, usually in just a structural sense, in that I have always been interested in the subjectivity of time." [...] Writing for Film Philosophy, Emma Bell points out that the characters in Inception do not literally time-travel, [...] "rather they escape time by being stricken in it – building the delusion that time has not passed, and is not passing now. They feel time grievously: willingly and knowingly destroying their experience by creating multiple simultaneous existences." ...|$|E
500|$|After filming ended, {{they put}} {{together}} a 24minute presentation {{and took it to}} every studio in June 2003. There was a lot of interest and Avnet selected the studio that gave Conran the most creative control. They needed studio backing to finish the film's ambitious visuals. At one point, the producer remembers that Conran was [...] "working 18 to 20 hours a day {{for a long period of}} time. It's 2,000 <b>some</b> <b>odd</b> CG shots done in one year, and we literally had to write code to figure out how to do this stuff!" [...] Most of the post-production work was done on Mac workstations using After Effects for compositing and Final Cut Pro for editing (seven workstations were dedicated to visual effects and production editing). The distinctive look of the film was achieved by running footage through a diffusion filter and then tinting it in black and white before color was blended, balanced and added back in.|$|E

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for <b>some</b> <b>odd</b> reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Newspaper records {{suggest that}} between 1916 and 1917, the Cornwall Victorias went unbeaten for 46 games; winning 45 and tying 1. During that period, they outscored their opponents 228–29, of which Lapensée scored 150, {{averaging}} {{more than three}} goals per game. Lapensée's ability and strength led to <b>some</b> <b>odd</b> occurrences in games she was involved in. In one, the Montreal Westerns played a 17-year old, Ada Lalonde, who was being touted as [...] "a hockey prodigy" [...] and a talent to rival Lapensée. Lalonde {{turned out to be}} a young man that Montreal's owner had convinced to take part to try and outshine Lapensée. In another game, the Westerners goaltender, a Miss Hardman, was so scared of Lapensée's powerful shot that she wore a baseball catcher's mask. Lapensée realised how much money the league was making for the arenas, and how significant her role was in her team's success, and she demanded a share of the profits. These claims, leaked to the press, led the Montreal Star to dub her a prima donna. The team owners refused, and Lapensée retired from the league in 1918.|$|E
500|$|In a late July debate {{sponsored}} by the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Bevin continued {{to insist that the}} state could not afford the Medicaid expansion authorized by Governor Beshear. He said he was [...] "appalled that one in four Kentuckians now get their health insurance from Medicaid". He then advocated modifying the state's Medicaid system to require those insured by Medicaid to contribute small premiums or co-payments, citing a system similar to Indiana's. The Kentucky General Assembly would have to effect such changes through legislation, but the debate moderator told Bevin he could end the expansion entirely with an executive order. Bevin responded, [...] "And create what degree of chaos?" [...] Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion [...] "immediately", to which Bevin replied, [...] "I said I would address it. I didn't say I would end it immediately. Go back and look at what I said." [...] In the post-debate press conference, Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman confirmed that Bevin had said he would [...] "end" [...] the Medicaid expansion. Bevin then said, [...] "Yeah, well, here's the bottom line: We need to address the situation. We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks." [...] At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to [...] "tweak" [...] Beshear's Medicaid expansion. Later in the month, he told a reporter [...] "e will not continue to enroll people at 138 percent of the federal poverty level ," [...] adding [...] "The bottom line is this: Even if we don't continue to enroll people at 138 percent, there will be the 850-some odd thousand that were on it before the expansion and the other 400-and <b>some</b> <b>odd</b> thousand that are on it right now. They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution. But {{we are not going to}} re-enroll people at 138 percent." [...] In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, [...] "Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one. What he has called for is repeal of Obama's Medicaid expansion by applying to [...] for 1115 waivers (as other states have successfully done) in order to better customize a solution to address the healthcare needs of the commonwealth." ...|$|E

For historical games, 15 mm seems to be the most popular scale, because it is small enough to allow for large battles. Smaller scaled miniatures are typically mounted in groups and moved as groups. This creates the visual effect of a large mass of combatants, allowing games simulating platoon, company, battalion, and even corps level actions. In these cases, the miniatures are often mounted on trays, or bases, for ease of mass movement.|$|R
