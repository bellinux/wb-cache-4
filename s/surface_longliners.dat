40|$|Fisheries {{by-catch}} {{is considered}} to be a major threat to loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean Sea. Technical differences in both gear configurations (e. g. hook and bait type) and fisheries operations carried out by the Spanish Mediterranean surface longline fleet could have an effect on by-catch rates and size selectivity. The aim of the present study was to test the differences in by-catch per unit effort and body size of loggerhead sea turtles caught using different gear types in the Mediterranean surface longline fishery. Our results suggest that differences in the gear type used have an effect on catch rates and size selec- tivity. Thus, <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting albacore (LLALB) using smaller hooks tend to capture smaller loggerheads but have the highest by-catch per unit of effort (BPUE), whereas other longlines, such as <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting bluefin tuna (LLJAP) and traditional <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting swordfish (LLHB), using larger hooks tend to select the larger animals; moreover, LLHB had the lowest BPUE. Disproportionate rates of fisheries-induced mortality on certain size/age- classes can differentially affect sea turtle populations, as each sea turtle age-class contributes differently to current and future reproduction. Thus, fisheries management should not only be focusing on preserving the large juvenile and mature turtles, but also on reducing the total by-catch. Thus, we recommend encouraging the use of LLHB versus other surface gears. We suggest that it is very important to take into account the gear type (and its particular catch rates) when making inferences about the impact of longline fisheries on sea turtle populations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} data on catches, nominal {{effort and}} nominal catch rates in 5 x 5 degree square formats {{of the activity}} of the Spanish surface longline fleet targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) carried out in 2005 in waters of the Atlantic (including the Mediterranean areas), Indian and Pacific Ocean. Graphics and a descriptive summary are also provided. The nominal catch in round weight of swordfish taken in the ICCAT convention area by Spanish <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> during 2005 was 10. 913 tons in the Atlantic Ocean and 760 tons in the Mediterranean. Nominal catches in the Indian and Pacific Oceans were 5. 079 and 6. 212 tons, respectively. Additionally, data on nominal catch rates of swordfish for the Atlantic areas are updated for the period 1986 - 2005. Versión del edito...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the dolphinfish bycatch rates in the longline fisheries of the Western Mediterranean and modelling the nominal bycatch abundance and distribution of dolphinfish from the Spanish Mediterranean as a function of technical, geographical, and seasonality factors. Our results indicate that the impact of the pelagic and semipelagic longline on the dolphinfish population is relatively low (1. 083 fishes per 1000 hooks), in contrast with the greater effect on the target species population. We obtained a statistically significant logistic model, with the following factors: technical characteristics of the fishery, geographical location, and seasonality. Drifting <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting albacore is the gear with the highest effect on Mediterranean dolphinfish population. The technical characteristics of the fishery and seasonality factors have an important role in explaining the absence or presence of dolphinfish bycatch in the different boat strata, gear types, and seasons. Moreover, sea surface temperature and lunar phases also present additional explanations. Lunar phase as SST has been frequently used as an explanatory variable affecting catch rates of dolphinfish...|$|E
40|$|During a {{total of}} 20 sets carried out on board a <b>surface</b> <b>longliner,</b> the {{different}} degrees of effectiveness obtained in the capture of swordfish were evaluated using 5 different bait types (natural, artificial and mixed). The results point to substantial and {{significant differences in the}} CPUEs obtained among the different bait types tested to catch swordfish. However, the results show few mean differences that were not statistically significant between the CPUEs obtained using natural bait (control) or mixed bait consisting of artificial bait on the outside-which in itself was of null effectiveness- into which was inserted a piece of natural bait, concealed from view. Both types of bait (control and mixed) were effective in the capture of swordfish despite the differences in constitution and properties. On the basis of these results, it is possible to make an indirect assessment of the importance of visual and odor stimuli in the swordfish to detect and carry out the final attack on its prey. Odor was found to be the key element in this process. RÉSUMÉ Au cours de 20 opérations réalisées à bord d’un palangrier de surface, divers niveaux d’efficacité obtenus dans la capture de l’espadon ont été évalués à l’aide de cinq types d’appât différents (naturel, artificiel et mixte). Les résultats indiquent des différences considérables e...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{effectiveness}} of tori-lines {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the ability of tori-lines to mitigate seabird bycatch and determine what kind of seabird species gather during line settings, attack the bait and are incidentally caught. We conducted two experiments in the western North Pacific and examined the effectiveness for seabird mitigation of light streamer tori-lines which have no long streamers but many light (short) streamers and are mainly used in the North Pacific area. Firstly, {{the effectiveness of}} two different types of tori-line (light streamer (1 m) and long streamer (up to 7 m) tori-line) and of two different colors (yellow and red) of light streamers for seabird bycatch avoidance was evaluated using 567 sets based on data from 20 offshore <b>surface</b> commercial <b>longliners.</b> No significant difference in the bycatch number between the different tori-line types and streamer colors was found. Secondly, we investigated the characteristics of the seabird bycatch in the North Pacific and the effectiveness of three different types of streamers (light, hybrid and modified light types) by detailed observations of seabird attacks using a chartered longline vessel. Although the appearance rate of albatrosses and shearwaters were 40. 9 % and 27. 7 %, Laysan albatross was the main seabird species that followed the vessel but shearwater...|$|R
40|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} Pteroplatytrygon violacea {{is known to}} be a frequent by-catch in longline fisheries around the world. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the parameters affecting to the bycatch of {{pelagic stingray}} by the Spanish surface drifting longline fleet that operates in the Mediterranean Sea. Since the year 2000 until the year 2013, 3007 longline fishing operations were monitored. In these 14 years, we recorded 57, 574 pelagic stingrays by-catches by Spanish longline. Two gear types concentrate 96. 05 % of pelagic stingray by-catch observed: traditional <b>surface</b> <b>longliners</b> targeting swordfish (LLHB) and surface drifting longliners targeting albacore (LLALB). We obtained two statistically significant explicative models for the gears LLHB and LLALB. In both cases, fisheries over continental shelf and summer variables are important parameters. Furthermore, for the LLHB explicative model included the variables: number of hooks, latitude where the setting started, Distance between both extremes of the longline and spring. Moreover, for the LLHB we obtained a relationship between the Capture per Unit of Effort of pelagic stingray from favour sets per year and the North Atlantic Oscillation in winteVersión del edito...|$|E

40|$|This project {{provided}} an exceptional opportunity to describe diving behaviour, movements and to characterise critical habitats of blue sharks in the North-eastern Atlantic using satellite and archival telemetry.   Tracked blue sharks displayed southward movements {{away from the}} tagging areas, exhibiting pronounced site fidelity to localised high-productivity frontal regions.   Blue sharks also displayed {{a high degree of}} variability in vertical movements. Shifts in diving behaviour were detected both within and between individuals, whereas behavioural phases were linked to the thermal structure of the water column in coastal areas, and to changes in prey distribution or type in offshore regions.   High resolution data showed that blue sharks shift between Brownian (in productive habitats) and Lévy (less productive waters) behaviours.   Vertical movements ranged from the surface to 1160 m, and water temperatures varied between 7. 2 - 27. 2 °C.   Behavioural data was also crucial in determining the degree of spatial and temporal overlap, and thus vulnerability, between blue sharks and high-seas longliners.   Confirmed fishing mortality was ~ 11 % with four tagged sharks caught by <b>surface</b> <b>longliners.</b>   Simulations showed that boats/sharks overlap was higher in winter and early spring, with the majority of simulated sharks (~ 88 %) at risk at least one day year- 1.   Our results indicate that, depending on which geographical regions are occupied at specific times, different segments of the blue shark population face differential risk from longlines.   Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA suggested an absence of spatial genetic differentiation throughout the North Atlantic, providing strong evidence that blue sharks comprise a single population in this region.
