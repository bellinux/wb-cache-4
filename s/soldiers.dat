The <b>soldier</b> beetle is {{attracted}} to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that the <b>soldier</b> beetle is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. The <b>soldier</b> beetle is also yellow and can hide among the flowers. The <b>soldier</b> beetle will also drink the nectar from the plant. When the <b>soldier</b> beetle drinks the nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of the <b>soldier</b> beetle will prey on other insects.

The larva <b>soldier</b> beetles prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs. The <b>soldier</b> beetle lays its eggs in the late summer.|$|R

Popular gathering spots for the <b>soldiers</b> included Monument Circle and University Park. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis in 1862 and in 1863, respectively, to house and feed Indiana's <b>soldiers</b> and their families as they passed through Indianapolis. City residents continued to aid Union <b>soldiers</b> by providing food, clothing, equipment, and supplies. Soldiers' aid societies and the Indiana Sanitary Commission, established in 1862 with its headquarters in Indianapolis, raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. The women of Indianapolis also organized groups, usually local Ladies' Aid Societies, to provide <b>soldiers</b> with blankets and clothing, and helped raise funds for additional troop supplies.|$|E

The fighting lasted for several hours, with the <b>soldiers</b> being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The <b>soldiers</b> brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles.

5|$|Croatia {{suffered}} heavy {{military and}} civilian casualties. The Croatian side initially reported 1,798 killed in the siege, both <b>soldiers</b> and civilians. Croatian general Anton Tus later stated that about 1,100 Croatian <b>soldiers</b> were killed, and 2,600 <b>soldiers</b> and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 Croatian <b>soldiers</b> were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek, according to Tus. He noted that the fighting was so intense that losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties from that year. According to figures published in 2006 by the Croatian Ministry of Defence, 879 Croatian <b>soldiers</b> were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000 to 5,000 dead across eastern Slavonia. The 204th Vukovar Brigade lost over 60 percent of its strength in the battle. Croatian officials have given figures of 2,000 killed, 800 missing, 3,000 taken prisoner and 42,852 made refugees in eastern Slavonia as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Estimates for {{the number}} of <b>soldiers</b> and {{casualties}} at the battle vary widely. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song <b>soldiers</b> stationed in Caishi, a number that historian Herbert Franke considers plausible. However, Song estimates {{for the number}} of Jin troops are likely inflated. One document claims that 400,000 Jin <b>soldiers</b> were present at the battle. This number is doubtful, bearing in mind that the Song had only 120,000 <b>soldiers</b> fighting on the entire front. Song historians may have confused the total number of Jin personnel deployed on the front with the number of Jin combatants at Caishi. The inflated figure could have referred to the number of <b>soldiers</b> that the Jin army had before crossing the Huai River toward the Yangtze. The desertions and casualties from suppressing revolts while advancing southward would have shrunk that number by the time the Jin reached the Yangtze. The History of Jin, a document written {{from the perspective of the}} Jin, reports Jin casualties between one meng'an (a Jurchen unit of a thousand <b>soldiers)</b> and a hundred men, and two meng'an and two hundred men. The History of Song reports Jin casualties numbering four thousand <b>soldiers</b> and two commanders of wanhu (ten thousand men) rank. An account of the battle by a different Song source holds that 24,000 Jin <b>soldiers</b> died and that 500 combatants and five meng-an were taken as prisoners. A more conservative Song source estimates that the Jin only had 500 <b>soldiers</b> and 20 ships at Caishi. It is not certain which of these figures is more accurate; Franke believes that the safest conclusion that can be drawn is that the number of Jin casualties was not greater than four thousand.|$|E
