The ring is constructed of layers of clean, unbroken oyster shells mixed with layers of crushed oyster and other shells, with some fish bones. The ring appears to have been rapidly constructed in several episodes. The layers of crushed shell, which include possible post holes, may have been living floors. Artifacts found in the ring include ceramics, shell and bone tools, shark teeth, and sting ray spines. A chert flake was found (the nearest source of chert is 250 km away). Fragments of human bone and a human tooth were found, but excavation was halted in the area to avoid further disturbing a potential grave site.

There is no evidence of human use of the shell ring after 50 BCE.|$|E

40|$|Tracking the {{movement}} of migratory freshwater fish is essential to those invested in rebuilding declining fish populations. Using strontium isotopic signatures to match calcified fish tissues to streams where fish spawn is a useful method of tracking migratory fish where physical tracking methods such as radio, acoustic, or external tags, have proven unsuccessful. In this study, we develop tools to practice this method of tracking fish in Lake Roosevelt and its upstream tributaries in Washington State by analyzing the elemental concentrations and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of water <b>samples,</b> and mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples.</b> 	This study evaluates whether mussel shells act as an appropriate proxy for water chemistry by comparing the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of water samples to the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of mussel <b>shells</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>from</b> the same, or nearby, locations. We compare concentrations of Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Pb, Sr, and U {{in the water and}} mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> to determine the feasibility of using mussel shells as a proxy for water chemistry. If it is determined that the concentrations of these elements in mussel shells reflect that of the surrounding water composition, the elemental composition of mussel shells can be compared to that of calcified tissues in fish, such as otoliths, to infer the location of the natal stream. 	We report analyses of water and mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> collected <b>from</b> Lake Roosevelt, Sanpoil River, Spokane River, Colville River, Kettle River, Pend Oreille River, Kootenay River, and Columbia River in Washington State. Each of these rivers is a tributary to Lake Roosevelt, and each flows through different geologic units. We hypothesize that the differences in the rock units of each stream’s watershed are reflected in the elemental concentrations and strontium isotopic ratios of water in each stream and in the lake. We also hypothesize that the composition of the mussel shells will match the composition of the water samples, therefore allowing us to use the mussel shells as a proxy for local water chemistry. Additionally, we hypothesize that the composition of the mussel shells will vary by location, and {{that we will be able}} to then infer where a fish is from by matching the composition of the fish in question to the mussels we have analyzed. 	We found that 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for water and mussel hinge <b>samples</b> collected <b>from</b> tributaries east of Lake Roosevelt are significantly higher than the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for <b>samples</b> collected <b>from</b> tributaries west of Lake Roosevelt with averages of 0. 7235 and 0. 7089, respectively. The average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios for water and mussel hinge samples collected within Lake Roosevelt is 0. 7158, which is between the averages for samples collected east and west of the lake. Generally, older rocks are exposed on the east side of the lake, and younger rocks on the west side of the lake, so our 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values support the hypothesis that geologic units are a primary control on water chemistry, and that tributary compositions mix to form an average weighed by flow in Lake Roosevelt. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for water and mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> collected <b>from</b> the same locations have a strong, positive linear correlation, suggesting that mussel shell 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios reflect the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the ambient water. With these data, we can distinguish between different streams and the lake, but cannot distinguish between <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> within the same stream or within Lake Roosevelt. 	The Sr:Ca and Fe:Ca ratios of water samples show positive correlations with mussel shell compositions, with R 2 values of 0. 82 and 0. 52, respectively. Ratios of Mg, Ba, Cu, Cd, Pb, and U to Ca showed little or no positive correlation between water and mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples.</b> The elemental concentration data collected for this study do not demonstrate whether a correlation between elemental ratios in water samples and elemental ratios in mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> collected <b>from</b> the same location exists. Positive Sr:Ca and Fe:Ca correlations for water versus mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> indicate that perhaps for some elements, the composition of mussel shells are representative of the composition of ambient water. Using elemental concentration ratios to complement 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic data may enhance our ability to identify correlations between water and mussel <b>shell</b> <b>samples,</b> and ultimately between mussel <b>shell</b> and otolith <b>samples.</b> 	The hinge part of a mussel shell may be used as a proxy for local water composition because the mussel shell composition reflects that of the local ambient water. The hinge of the mussel has the same composition as the whole mussel shell. 	We measured variation of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in the water among different streams and Lake Roosevelt. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for samples collected in tributaries east of Lake Roosevelt, which erode older rocks, are higher for mussel <b>shell</b> and water <b>samples</b> than the average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for mussel <b>shell</b> and water <b>samples</b> collected in tributaries west of Lake Roosevelt, which flow through younger rocks...|$|R
40|$|In {{and around}} the endemic-dominated Lake Baikal, palaearctic species are {{generally}} restricted to shallow, sheltered bays and in- and out-flowing river floodplains. However, we observed populations of the palaearctic snail Lymnaea (Radix) auricularia on the steep, rocky littoral of Lake Baikal proper. We compared the morphology of 542 <b>shells</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>from</b> this new habitat with potential source populations from conventional habitats. A size-free Discriminant Analysis indicated a strong morphological differentiation of the newly established populations from their likely sources. The new populations had a more compact shell shape with a wide aperture, which may be advantageous in wave-exposed habitats where a firm attachment to the substrate is needed. Shells from the conventional habitats were more elongated, with a narrow aperture, which may be advantageous in habitats that have a dry period where retreating into the mud is required and water loss should be limited. These results may suggest that selection is acting on shell shape in Lake Baikal. The apparent recent arrival of this pandemic gastropod in a habitat previously dominated by endemics constitutes a potential ecological threat and an alert to possible ecological change...|$|R

40|$|Previously it {{has been}} argued that midden {{analysis}} from three geographically distinct coastal regions of tropical northern Australia (Hope Inlet, Blyth River, Blue Mud Bay) demonstrates that changes through time in Aboriginal mollusc exploitation reflect broader coastal environmental transformations associated with late Holocene climatic variability (Bourke et al. 2007). It was suggested that, while a direct link between environmental change and significant cultural change in the archaeological record has yet to be demonstrated unambiguously, midden analysis has the potential to provide the as-yet missing link between changes in climate, environment and human responses over past millennia.

40|$|ABSTRACT.

After calibration, the intercepts of the charcoal dates were ~ 100 – 750 years older than the paired <b>shell</b> <b>samples.</b> Due to the hyper-arid conditions in this region that promote long-term preservation of organic material, we argue that the older charcoal dates are best explained by people using old wood for fuel during the Middle Holocene.

40|$|Differences {{in shell}} {{morphology}} in the intertidal prosobranch mollusc Calliostoma zizyphinumwere studied {{from a number}} of sites within four geographical regions of the British Isles with varying exposures to wave action and crab predation. Mean values of damage scarring were highest in <b>shells</b> <b>sampled</b> <b>from</b> Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, and lowest in individuals from the Atlantic Coast. Shells col-lected from the Isle of Man were smaller than those from either the Atlantic coast of Ireland or Strang-ford Lough. Shells from Strangford Lough had taller shells (higher aspect ratio) than shells from the County Down and Atlantic Coast and shells from the County Down coast were more squat (lower aspect ratio) than those from all other areas. Shells from Strangford Lough were significantly thinner than shells from all other geographical areas. The relationships between shell damage scarring and shell size and tallness were not consistent among areas. Shells from Strangford Lough are notable in showing a steep, positive relationship between shell size and scarring and a steep, negative relationship between scarring and tallness. The unusual shell phenotypes observed in shells from Strangford Lough may be explained by rapid shell growth, which would not only allow Calliostoma to attain a size refuge from crab predators but also to recover successfully from repeated crab attacks on the shell lip. Such a strategy would result in larger, thinner shells with a high number of damage scars...|$|R
40|$|Sediment <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> the Ontong-Java Plateau in the Pacific and the 90 ° east ridge in the Indian Ocean {{were used}} to {{investigate}} whether shell size and early diagenesis affect d 11 B of the symbiont-bearing planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides sacculifer. In pristine shells from both study locations we found a systematic increase of d 11 B and Mg/Ca with shell size. Shells in the sieve size class 515 - 865 µm revealed d 11 B values + 2. 1 to + 2. 3 per mil higher than shells in the 250 - 380 µm class. This pattern is most likely {{due to differences in}} symbiont photosynthetic activity and its integrated effect on the pH of the foraminiferal microenvironment. We therefore suggest smaller individuals must live at approximately 50 - 100 m water depth where ambient light levels are lower. Using the empirical calibration curve for d 11 B in G. sacculifer, only shells larger than 425 µm reflect surface seawater pH. Partial dissolution of shells derived from deeper sediment cores was determined by shell weight analyses and investigation of the shell surface microstructure by scanning electron microscopy. The d 11 B in partially dissolved shells is up to 2 per mil lower relative to pristine shells of the same size class. In agreement with a relatively higher weight loss in smaller <b>shells,</b> <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> the Ontong-Java Plateau show a more pronounced dissolution effect than larger shells.

They were compared with oxygen isotope values provided from the same locations together with published whole rock and inoceramid shell Sr contents. In comparison with Sopelana samples, Bidart ones are characterised by the highest Sr contents and the lowest 87 Sr/B 6 Sr ratios. Furthermore, inoceramid remains usually yield lower isotopic values than whole rock ones. These results suggest that carbonate matrix and inoceramid shells have undergone different behaviour during diagenesis. Most of the strontium isotope ratios measured on inoceramid samples from Bidart fall close to the lower Maastrichtian seawater 87 Sr/B 6 Sr curve and are dominated by a wide, non-luminescent middle shell layer. Nevertheless, Sopelana I inoceramid samples show values which lie far from maastrichtian strontium isotope values, which exhibit a whole luminescent shell.

This article discusses the problem of dating shells from sites in the southeastern United States. New results are presented comparing shell, bone, and soil-charcoal age determinations from the Crystal River site, located along the west-central Gulf Coast of Florida. Crystal River is a large multimound site whose occupants engaged in long-distance exchange throughout eastern North America during the Woodland period (~ 1000 BC to AD 1050). In the summer of 2012, test units were excavated in several contexts at the site, including both mounds and occupation areas. Samples were collected for 14 C dating, which were then processed at the University of Georgia Center for Applied Isotope Studies. This article focuses on <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> the stratified <b>shell</b> midden, from which it was hoped to construct a local correction for marine shell {{that could be used}} to date other contexts. The soil-charcoal and bone collagen <b>from</b> these <b>samples</b> have very similar ages (bone <b>samples</b> ranging <b>from</b> about 100 cal BC to cal AD 530 and soil-charcoal from cal AD 345 to 560); however, the <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> collected <b>from</b> the same stratigraphic units are significantly older than the terrestrial dates (ranging from 1300 to 390 cal BC). The difference in calibrated ages between organic materials and the shells ranges between 560 to 1140 yr. This phenomenon cannot be explained solely by the marine reservoir effect. It appears that all the <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> formed in mixed marine (~ 50 − 60 %) contexts, as indicated by the stable isotope ratios and the amount of atmospheric carbon remaining in the samples.

In all the cores, {{the upper part of}} Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 down to about 3 m below seabed show abruptly elevated but highly variable levels of magnetic susceptibility attributable mainly to shipping contamination over the past 160 years. The uncontaminated lower MIS 1 deposits show a consistently low magnetic susceptibility above a sharp increase at the Holocene-Pleistocene boundary. This increase is accounted for by the presence of eroded palaeosol fragments enriched in iron oxides and hydroxides. Acid-sulphate soil development during MIS 2 - 4 on the sub-aerially exposed {{inner continental shelf}} covered by MIS 5 deposits is responsible for the formation of palaeosols.

For the Samoan Archipelago {{in the central}} Pacific, ΔR values have been proposed previously, but, unlike some Polynesian archipelagoes, ΔR values seem not to vary spatially and temporally. Here, we demonstrate such variability by reporting a ΔR of – 101 ± 72 ΔR for the Manu‘a Group—the eastern-most islands in the archipelago—for the colonization period. This value is based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14 C and uranium-thorium (U-Th) series dating of individual coral branches from pre- 2300 cal BP archaeological contexts.

40|$|The archaeological {{significance}} of barnacles {{has been documented}} in several places around the world, but this remains to be realised for South Africa. In the absence of local ethnographic observations, it was proposed that large barnacles (Austromegabalanus cylindricus) were taken to campsites attached to large black mussels (Choromytilus meridionalis) as part of scavenged beach-stranded fauna. Basic observations available until recently for South African West Coast shell middens showed {{that the presence of}} large shore barnacles is chronologically patterned. Some hints regarding transport decisions were also apparent. This paper examines the variability in large barnacle abundance through time and space using mollusc and crustacean <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> eight late Holocene sites situated at different distances from rocky shorelines. Modern knowledge on the ecology of collected species is used to interpret interassemblage variability. This study shows that barnacle abundance depends on at least three aspects, namely: the degree of wave exposure from which barnacles and other shellfish were collected, possible shifts in the main season of shellfish collection in the last 1700 years, and field processing before transporting shellfish loads to camps. Funding of various excavations and the analyses of samples was provided by grants from the University of Cape Town, the Centre for Science Development,Wenner-Gren (Gr. 5699, Chicago, Illinois) and the Swan Fund (Oxford).

40|$|Oxygen {{isotopes}} in <b>shell</b> carbonate <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> {{the marine}} rocky-shore intertidal gastropod Monodonta turbinata (Born) are investigated in both modern analogue specimens and in archaeological specimens from the Grotta dell'Uzzo (Sicily). Variations in shell edge values of δ 18 O in living specimens collected monthly {{over two years}} are closely correlated with monthly seawater temperatures measured {{at the time of}} collection, showing that the species can be used for palaeoseasonality studies. Analyses of shell edge δ 18 O values in archaeological specimens, from Mesolithic through to early Neolithic phases at the Grotta dell'Uzzo, enabled the inference of various seasons of collection of shellfish and how such seasonality varies between the different phases of occupation. Interesting similarities and differences exist between the seasons of marine shellfish exploitation and the seasons inferred from the vertebrate zooarchaeological assemblages. A major inference drawn from the analyses and discussion is that the exploitation of all marine resources (fish and shellfish) increased in the later Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods. ...|$|R

The main purpose was to determinate the progressive post-depositional changes suffered by the shells together with the marl and marly-limestone beds. Petrography, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and cathodoluminiscence (CL) observations, as well as oxygen and carbon isotopic values show that calcite prisms, which form the shell microstructure, have undergone a more intense diagenetic modification in the western (Sopelana section) than in the eastern areas (Bidart section) of the Basque Arc, without any substantial textural changes in the prismatic microstructur...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the stable isotopic composition of bivalve shells provides the data needed to construct climate records at high temporal resolution. Yet, the reproducibility of the results {{and the effect of}} microstructural organization on the isotopic signature and measurements have not been extensively studied. Here, we examine the architectural changes within Arctica islandica <b>shells,</b> specifically if <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> microstructurally different <b>shell</b> layers differ in respect to stable oxygen isotope values. The oxygen isotope profiles of two microstructurally different <b>shell</b> layers, each <b>sampled</b> at different temporal resolution, were compared to each other. Our results show that aragonite, collected from the layer that is dominated by cross-acicular/lamellar structures, tends to be enriched in heavier oxygen isotopes compared to <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> portions of the outer shell layer dominated by homogeneous microstructure. In some cases, this difference exceeded 0. 3 ‰, which can significantly affect the interpretation of a recorded environmental signal. Observed differences in stable oxygen isotope data may be associated with the physiology of the mollusk and the physical and chemical composition of studied shell layers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{determine}} whether dietary Yucca schidigera powder would affect egg yield parameters and egg shell quality of laying Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix Japonica). In this study, 30 female Japanese quails were used. The experimental quails {{were divided into two}} dietary treatment groups of similar mean weight comprising 30 birds each, which was divided into 3 subgroups of birds each. A standard layer feed, basal diet of the trial was supplemented with 0 or 120 ppm Yucca schidigera powder. Feed and water were supplied ad libitum and light was provided 16 hours (from 8. 00 to 24. 00) each day. Laying performance was determined daily by measuring feed intake, feed conversion efficiency (feed intake/egg weight), egg production (number and weight). Egg quality, length, width, shape index (width/length), shell weight, shell thickness of each egg obtained on the sixth days of every week were recorded. After measuring width and length, the egg was broken was then separated and then weighted. <b>Shell</b> <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> top, middle and bottom sites of the egg were measured for thickness using a micrometer and the mean was calculated prior to statistical analysis. The results obtained in this experiment showed that Yucca schidigera supplementation to the diet tended to improve feed conversion efficiency, egg weight (P 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. A {{study of the}} Australian floodplain mussel, Velesunio ambiguus, from Lake Alexandrina, South Australia, was conducted to assess its suitability as a palaeo-climate and -environment indicator. Using 57 <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> two sites, the study was based upon {{the analysis of the}} macro-structure, micro-morphology and elemental geochemistry of growth increments of the aragonitic shells. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of resin-impregnated cross-sections revealed the nature of shell growth increments. Measurements of growth increment frequency and width, with comparison to instrumental temperature and water chemistry data, were used to decipher the environmental controls over mussel growth rate. These comparisons also provide a validation of annual growth periodicity, and ages of shells were estimated to between four and 15 years. Micro-morphology measurements from SEM analysis of three samples revealed 67 to 374 micro-increments (tabular aragonitic crystallites) per growth increment that may imply a daily periodicity. Micro-increment widths commonly exhibit a bimodal pattern, with overall increase, across growth increments. Laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of a suite of elements revealed a variety of signals. Although strong patterns were not observed for established palaeo-climate and -environmental indices such as Mg/Ca (temperature) and Sr/Ca (salinity), Ba/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios often exhibited bimodal oscillations, similar to micro-increment widths, with concentrations increasing {{over the course of the}} growing year. Ba/Ca and Mn/Ca ratios were suggested to reflect intra-annual fluctuations in primary productivity in the lake, which is an indirect function of regional hydrology and climate. This interpretation is supported by the similarity of micro-increment widths, as growth rate of the primary consumer (the mussel) varies with food availability. This study highlights the potential of Velesunio ambiguus as a recorder of intra-annual lake productivity and hydrology, however further studies are necessary to improve the interpretation of data before application to the fossil record.

40|$|Field {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out to study the changes of sea level-along the north coast of Kuwait Bay. Four zones have been studied in detail viz: Kathma, Ghidhai, Mudairah and Al-Bahra. The area is characterized by the existence of several terraces which lie between the Jal-Az-Zor escarpment and the coastline which may represent stages of changes in sea-level. Three techniques have been adopted to study the terraces: 1. Levelling, 2. Radiocarbon dating of shells, and 3. Sediment analysis by particle size analysis and scanning electron microscope. The results show that there are six terraces in the area. The highest levelled point for the First terrace was obtained from Ghidhai at 92. 62 m. above Kuwait Datum, while the least elevation for a fragment of the lowest terrace was 5. 99 metres above Kuwait Datum, at Al-Bahra the terraces, besides having a general tendency to decrease in height from west to east, also indicate local instability and warping. Although the upper terraces can be identified as conspicuous physiographic features, it has been difficult to correlate them according to their height. Radiocarbon dating of a small number of <b>shell</b> <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> the Third, Fourth and Fifth terraces gave a range of ages between > 42, 950 years BP. and 23, 300 + 600 years BP.; no simple correlation between height and age is observable and the possibility of shell contamination cannot be excluded. The evidence as a whole suggests that these upper terraces are not younger than Pleistocene in age. Radiocarbon dating for the extreme lowest terraces gave an age range of between 4, 570 + 70 years BP. and 3, 560160 years BP. which suggests a time of formation in the Holocene. The sediment investigations confirm the existence of three depositional environments; fluvial, Aeolian and marine. The sediment analysis results together with their gemorphological character indicate that {{it is possible that the}} upper two or three terraces originated as a result of fluviatile as well as marine action and were affected by tectonic movements. The lowest terraces are likely to be of marine origin deformed by tectonic movements...|$|E
40|$|We have {{attempted}} to date several <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> Site 642 {{using a combination of}} Sr isotope stratigraphy and Rb-Sr dating of glauconite. A carbonate <b>shell</b> fragment <b>from</b> <b>Sample</b> 104 - 642 B- 22 H- 6, 70 - 73 cm gives a Sr isotope stratigraphy date of 17. 3 +/- 1. 0 Ma, which agrees well with available biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data. Glauconites <b>from</b> a nearby <b>sample</b> (104 - 642 B- 23 H- 1, 66 - 69 cm) give a similar date. One carbonate shell fragment and two fish teeth <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> Core 104 - 642 D- 12 X give concordant Sr isotope stratigraphy ages of about 37 Ma (latest Eocene). Rb-Sr glauconite analyses from one of the samples, while showing some substrate contamination, also support an Eocene age. Our results are in conflict with Miocene palynomorph dates from Core 104 - 642 D- 12 X. As specific reworking of fish teeth and carbonate macrofossils (and also glauconite) from 37 Ma old sediments into three different samples in Core 104 - 642 D- 12 X is most unlikely, we view the 37 -Ma date as the depositional age of the core...|$|R

These ratios were examined to ascertain {{the extent to which they}} correlate with temperature, rainfall, water isotope ratios and other ambient condiditons. ^ The samples studied were collected from a tributary of the River Pra at Krobo, in the Western Region, River Densu at Achimota, in the Greater-Accra Region and a stream in Sunyani, Brong-Ahafo Region, all in southern Ghana approximately 700 km south of the Sahel, and from the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria at Kisumu, Kenya. ^ Molluscan shells and water isotope ratios responded to heavy rainfall, as well as variations in temperature and evaporative effects. Oxygen isotope ratio values can be used to estimate seasonality, and in turn, the life span of the molluscs. For application of this method to fossil molluscan shells for elucidation of paleoclimates, however, additional geological and geographical data are desirable. ...|$|R
