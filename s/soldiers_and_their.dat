5|$|The early {{population}} {{of the city was}} composed almost entirely of <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families, and the layout of the city was similar to that of a garrison. Amr intended for Fustat to serve as a base from which to conquer North Africa, as well as to launch further campaigns against Byzantium. It remained the primary base for Arab expansion in Africa until Qayrawan was founded in Tunisia in 670.|$|E
5|$|Against this fraught background, Philip {{started the}} siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC. Perinthos {{occupied}} a strong position on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip {{did not have a}} large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city. Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 cubits high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and in a short time, a section of the wall was breached. However, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his satraps on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the Byzantians sent a body of <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> best generals.|$|E
5|$|As regiments {{organized}} and reorganized, Union soldiers continued to gather at Indianapolis, sometimes {{as many as}} 12,000 at a time. Indianapolis regiments formed in 1862 included the 70th Indiana, {{under the command of}} Benjamin Harrison, and the 79th Indiana, under the command of Frederick Knefler. Popular gathering spots for the soldiers included Monument Circle and University Park. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis in 1862 and in 1863, respectively, to house and feed Indiana's <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families as they passed through Indianapolis. City residents continued to aid Union soldiers by providing food, clothing, equipment, and supplies. Soldiers' aid societies and the Indiana Sanitary Commission, established in 1862 with its headquarters in Indianapolis, raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. The women of Indianapolis also organized groups, usually local Ladies' Aid Societies, to provide soldiers with blankets and clothing, and helped raise funds for additional troop supplies.|$|E

5|$|As winter {{broke in}} 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, the Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl.

By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, and use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

Immediately, Hmong <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the U.S. technicians that help was coming. In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi. While U.S. fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight. Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead U.S. personnel on Lima Site 85, along {{with a number of}} wounded Hmong soldiers. By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14March when they withdrew from the area.|$|E

In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was {{closely associated with}} the Thousand Homes Scheme, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families, and lower income groups. The land used for this development was the site of the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas.

An intermediate mechanism for physical identification of the <b>soldiers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> origin, date of enrolment, and unit was also called for (VII(c)).

5|$|After the {{briefing}} Phu immediately {{returned to his}} headquarters in Pleiku, where he began planning for the withdrawal with Brigadier Generals Tran Van Cam, Pham Ngoc Sang, Pham Duy Tat, and Colonel Le Khac Ly. To maintain secrecy, Phu ordered his officers to issue orders using only word of mouth instead of written documents, and not to reveal the withdrawal plan to local regional forces. Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had to be quick, with the army taking only enough military equipment and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals Tat and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> dependents on the ground. Sang {{was responsible for the}} movement of vital military equipment and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using air force fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Grand Fleet was dissolved, and Benbow was {{assigned}} to the 4th Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, where she served until March 1926. In 1919, Captain Charles Douglas Carpendale took command of the ship, a position he held until 1921. During this period, from April 1919 to June 1920, the ship took part in anti-communist operations in the Black Sea. Benbow and other elements of the Mediterranean Fleet supported the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. In late January 1920, Benbow was sent from Constantinople to Novorossiysk. There, the ship relieved Iron Duke, and shortly thereafter rescued a group of 150 Russian <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> British adviser, who had been attacked by bandits. On 1 February, Rear Admiral Michael Culme-Seymour hoisted his flag aboard Benbow. Shortly thereafter, men from the ship were sent to inspect White positions in the Kerch Peninsula. Benbow was ordered to return to Constantinople in June, where the Mediterranean Fleet was concentrating to begin supporting Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War; she arrived there on 19 June. On 5 July, Benbow and several other vessels left Constantinople to land a force at Gemlik to secure the harbor in order to hand it over to Greek forces that would arrive later. Benbows men returned to the ship on 16 July after a Greek battalion reached the town.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base {{of support for the}} Union. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to organize and train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E
5|$|From 15 to 20 November, Sydney {{and three}} other cruisers transported 4,000 Allied <b>soldiers</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> {{equipment}} from Alexandria to the Piraeus as reinforcements for the Greek military. On returning to Alexandria, Sydney deployed {{with the majority of}} the Mediterranean fleet to cover multiple convoys across the sea: the Australian cruiser spent the remainder of the month operating throughout the eastern and central Mediterranean, and was bombed by Italian aircraft on 24 November at Souda Bay, but escaped damage. Sydney started December in the Aegean, where she escorted convoys and shelled the port of Valona, then proceeded to Malta for a refit and repairs to her rudder, which lasted {{until the end of the}} year. During this refit, the cruiser was fitted with degaussing equipment. The ship rejoined the fleet on 8 January 1941, when she was instructed to head home after proceeding along the north coast of Africa and linking up with any Australia-bound merchant ships she encountered. The recall was attributed to the need to bring Sydney in for a major refit and give her personnel leave, a plan to spread combat experience throughout the RAN by trading the cruiser with her sister ship, , and a need to protect Australia against the German merchant raiders operating in the area, particularly following the attacks on Nauru.|$|E
