40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the surgical outcome and complications of phacoemulsification and the implantation of an acryl foldable intraocular lens (IOL) with a <b>squared</b> <b>edge</b> in dogs with cataracts. Thirty-two eyes from 26 dogs were examined. The mean follow up period was 75. 9 days ranging from 23 to 226 days. The complications after phacoemulsification were posterior capsular opacity (PCO) around the IOL (n = 11), ocular hypertension (n = 4), focal posterior synechia (n = 4), hyphema (n = 3) and corneal ulcer (n = 2). The complications {{associated with the}} IOL were decenteration of the optic (n = 2) and ventral haptic displacement (n = 1). Most cases of PCO were found only around {{the margin of the}} IOL, and all eyes had vision during the observation period. In conclusion, the implantation of an acryl-foldable lens with a <b>squared</b> <b>edge</b> at the time of phacoemulsification is an effective method for preserving the central visual field of dogs with cataract...|$|R
