40|$|Purpose and hypothesis: Acromion spur is the {{extrinsic}} {{factor for}} impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tear. The Rockwood tilt view {{can be used}} to evaluate prominence of the anterior acromion, however no study has shown the correlation of findings between the Rockwood tilt view and the arthroscopic finding. 				 					Methods: We developed the arthroscopic classification of acromion spur as type 1 flat <b>spur,</b> <b>type</b> 2 bump <b>spur,</b> <b>type</b> 3 heel <b>spur,</b> <b>type</b> 4 keel spur, and type 5 irregular spur. Patients with rotator cuff syndrome who underwent arthroscopic surgery were recruited. Two observers were asked to classify the type of spur from arthroscopic findings and Rockwood tilt views separately in random pattern. The prevalence of supraspinatus tendon tear was also recorded as no tear, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear. 				 					Results: The keel spur (33. 9 %) was the most common finding followed by the heel spur (27. 8 %). The correlation was high especially for the heel, the keel, and the irregular spur (75. 47 %, 74. 03 %, and 72. 73 %, respectively.) These three types of spurs have a high prevalence of full thickness of supraspinatus tendon tear. 				 					Conclusion: The Rockwood tilt view {{can be used to}} evaluate the morphology of an acromion spur, especially the at-risk spur that correlates highly with the full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear. The arthroscopic classification will also be a useful tool to improve communication between the surgeon and the guide for appropriate treatment in a rotator cuff tear patient when encountering the heel, keel, and irregular spur...|$|E
40|$|In {{commercial}} apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) orchards, early cropping is a {{very important}} economic consideration. Orchard turnover is now occurring more rapidly through the release of new varieties and this demands the minimisation of plant establishment costs. It has been reported that young trees with branches produce crops much earlier than those with no branches. A series of experiments have been conducted to explore the factors involved in branch production, and to examine some methods of manipulating or inducing branches in nursery and one-year-old apple trees, particularly <b>spur</b> <b>type</b> 'Red Delicious'. The results presented confirm that <b>spur</b> <b>type</b> Red Delicious apple nursery trees produce very few branches when compared with Golden Delicious and Red Fuji, on MM 106 rootstocks. Chemical treatments, of Cytolin (BA+GA₄₊₇) at 800 ppm (single application) and four sequential applications of 200 ppm, induced lateral shoot formation on nursery trees; but the sequential applications produced narrow branch crotch angles. A more detailed study showed that BA is the main effective ingredient of the mixture, when applied as a single spray. GA₄₊₇ alone induced branching when applied in 4 sequential applications at 200 ppm, but the lateral shoots had narrow crotch angles. The GA₄₊₇- induced branch crotch angles became wider, while the branches were growing. NAA at 10 ppm did not influence the Cytolin- or GA₄₊₇- induced branch crotch angle, when applied at different periods of growth. Cytolin was also applied to one-year-old apple orchard trees to induce lateral shoots, at lower concentrations than applied to the nursery trees. An optimum concentration range of Cytolin concentration of between 80 and 100 ppm is suggested. Concentrations of Cytolin were used up to 200 ppm without phytotoxicity symptoms. The higher concentrations resulted in excessive lateral shoot production but shoot length was reduced. Other growth regulators i. e. M&B 25, 105, thidiazuron, or paclobutrazol were also tested on nursery trees, but they produced unwanted side effects without any significantly {{increase in the number of}} lateral shoots. Mechanical treatments i. e. the removal of young or mature leaves, lower lateral shoots or buds did not induce any increased lateral growth. The removal of leading shoot tips induced a cluster of lateral shoots, immediately below the apical node but these had narrow crotch angles. The results are discussed in terms of the possible relationships between the plant hormones and their influence on lateral shoot induction. The practical considerations required to fully utilise the <b>spur</b> <b>type</b> apple varieties' natural advantages in early cropping are also discussed...|$|E

External <b>spur</b> <b>type</b> miniature brass (ASTM 858) gears with 12 teeth, 9. 8 mm outside diameter and 5 mm face width were manufactured by WSEM. The research work was accomplished in four distinct experimental stages viz., preliminary, pilot, main and confirmation.

In essence, the investigation {{found that it was}} possible to manufacture miniature gears to high quality by using WSEM. Gears up to DIN 5 quality with a good surface finish (1. 2 µm average roughness) and satisfactory surface integrity were achieved. The results suggest that WSEM should be considered a viable alternative to conventional miniature gear manufacturing techniques and that in some instances it may even be superior. This work will prove useful to researchers and professionals in the field of miniature and micro-scale manufacturing and machining...|$|E

The absence of statistically significant variations in the azimuthal velocity across the Carina arm must be due to its abrupt increase behind the shock front, which can be easily blurred out by distance errors. At the same time, the model of cloud particles with a mean free path of 0. 2 - 2 kpc allows both a shock in the spiral arms and free motion of OB-associations along epicyclic trajectories. The velocity field of OB-associations exhibits two nonaccidental deviations from ideal spiral pattern: an 0. 5 -kpc shift between the Cygnus and Carina spiral-arm fragments and the weakness of the Perseus arm in the III quadrant. However, the identified fragments of the Carina, Cygnus, and Perseus arms belong to none of the known <b>spur</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

The reader has in Fig. LXVI. a characteristic type of the plans of the spurred capitals, generally preferred by the sculptors of the convex school, but treated with infinite variety, the spurs often being cut into animal forms, or the incisions between them multiplied, for richer effect; and in our own Norman capital the type c of Fig. XXII. is variously subdivided by incisions on its slope, approximating in general effect to many conditions of the real <b>spurred</b> <b>type,</b> e, but totally differing from them in principle.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{losses are}} of great {{significance}} to the automotive and motorsports industries. Many of these losses are incurred during power transmission through the gearbox. There has been considerable research in this area, however, generally gear losses are not calculated at part load condition, nor are so called dry sump systems considered outside of motor racing. The method developed by Anderson & Loewenthal which considers efficiency over part-load conditions is used here to calculate geartrain losses with varying speed, load and temperature conditions in a <b>spur</b> gear <b>type</b> gearbox for motorsport application. Both oil bath (wet sump) and oil jet (dry sump) systems of lubrications are considered. The Changenet method {{is used to calculate}} the churning losses in the typical oil bath lubrication system. Seventeen different mineral and synthetic oils were evaluated. At 75 kW engine output, 1200 W were lost in the dry sump gearbox whereas 1320 W were lost in the wet-sump gearbox – in 1 st gear at 9000 rpm engine speed. The oils studied showed a spread of total drive efficiency of 97. 8 to 99 % in the most extreme temperature case. Observation of how efficiency and film thickness relate to operating temperatures it is clear that tight temperature control is critical to obtain the potential benefits available from oil optimisation. The dry sump gearbox is predicted to be more efficient only above 5000 rpm engine speed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- “Jitter ” is {{the noise}} {{modulation}} due to random time shifts on an otherwise ideal, or per-fectly on-time, signal transition. In {{the absence of}} ultra-high-speed jitter analyzers, spectrum analysis is an alternate noise measurement for timing jitter. Conventionally, jitter {{has been defined as}} a the in-tegral of the phase noise. This paper presents a modified way of calculating timing jitter using phase-modulation (PM) noise measurements of high-speed digital clocks, which considers the frequency response of the jitter analyzer, providing a more accurate map. Measurements of phase noise are typically much more sensitive to phase (or time) fluctuations than a jitter analyzer. A summary table is provided for mapping the results of these measurements in the Fourier fre-quency domain to jitter in the τ domain for various random (specifically, power-law) noise <b>types,</b> <b>spurs,</b> vibration, and power-supply ripple. In general, one cannot unambiguously map back, that is, translate from jitter measurements to phase noise. 1...|$|R

The gearing shall be on stiff shafts and rigid centers, having no radius rods nor stub gearing. All gears shall be of crucible cast steel, and shall be of ample size to stand rough usage and wear. Master or bull gears shall have roller bearings. Differential gears shall be of the <b>spur</b> gear <b>type</b> and shall be placed on a counter shaft. The bull gears shall be attached to the drive wheels by means of ample spring cushion links to take off sudden strains on the gearing and frame. The crank shaft shall be given as steady a torque as possible by using four quadruple opposed cylinders. These cylinders shall be large enough to give the crank shaft as great a torque as is given to the crank shaft of steam engine of the same nominal rating. The governor shall be constructed {{so that it can be}} set and regulated to run the engine under complete control at any speed from 50 R. P. M. to 220 R. P. M., as desired.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} bright main sequence stars near {{the northern edge of}} the M 33 disk. Clustering on sub-kpc scales is seen among stars with ages near 10 Myr, and two large star-forming complexes are identified. Similar large-scale grouping is not evident among stars with ages 100 Myr. These stars are also distributed over a much larger area than those with younger ages, and it is argued that random stellar motions alone, as opposed to orderly motions of the <b>type</b> <b>spurred</b> by large scale secular effects, can re-distribute stars out to distances of at least 2 kpc (i. e. one disk scale length) from their birth places on 100 Myr timescales. Such random motions may thus {{play a significant role in}} populating the outer regions of the M 33 disk.

40|$|Beer, {{wine and}} spirits are three little words that make {{lots of people}} excited. Alcohol {{can be thought of}} as a {{necessity}} for tourists. In recent years, consumers are becoming more interested in the development and processes behind their favorite libations. This has <b>spurred</b> a new <b>type</b> of tourist; those that are interested in brewery tours, vineyard hopping, or enjoying a day out at their favorite distillery. The beer industry has seen rapid growth expansion in the U. S. In 1980, there were roughly 100 breweries in the nation and today there are over 2500 (Brewers Association, 2013 a). With the rapid expansion of micro-brewing and nano-brewing, tourists are going on brewery based tours in multiple regions, such as Colorado, Oregon, or New England. Tourists are beginning to seek a stronger connection with the communities they are visiting. They want to sample the local cuisine, taste the local beer, and meet the artisans making the products they are interested in purchasing (Grandmaison, 2013). Experiential tourism has shifted the attitudes of consumers; they no longer want to just consume, but also want to make connections. Craft brewing is one industry that can easily accommodate the tourists interested in this new trend that is experiential tourism. Colorado has seen its beer industry take off in popularity. Colorado has roughly 150 breweries and one of the lowest breweries per capita ratios in the U. S. (Brewers Association, 2012 a). With the increase in breweries, there is also a potential increase in visitors to the microbreweries. In a previous study, it was found that a majority of Colorado breweries would expand their business if there was more state support for brewery tourism (Wobbekind, Lewandowski, DiPersio, Ford 2 ̆ 6 Streit, 2012). This expansion would lead to more beer production and provide the breweries with greater motivation to meet the needs of these tourists. Colorado saw over 29 million overnight pleasure trip visitors in 2011, with a majority visiting the front range region, which includes major metropolitan areas such as Colorado Springs and Denver (Dean Runyan Associates, 2013). Breweries have the opportunity to grab some of these tourists by offering tours or tastings. By capitalizing on these tourists with brewery tourism, Colorado can boost and define its profile, effectively meet the needs of these guests, and engage in experiential tourism to keep the dollars coming long after the tourists have gone home, through purchases of their favorite Colorado beer. Brewery based tourism is a way for locations to attract tourists as a supplement to their itinerary or as the main attraction. If a brewery becomes particularly popular, it could bring dollars and tourists into locales to spend money on hotels, restaurants, shopping, and, of course, beer. In addition, it is another attraction for locations that could bring more tourists or have them stay longer. For example, a trip to Denver, could be extended by a day or two as visitors can spend more time engaging in brewery tours or brewpub hopping. The breweries should be excited to be part of this tourism as they can showcase their products, expand sales and brand recognition amongst new visitors. Brewery tourism can feed into word-of-mouth marketing when the visitors return home and tell their friends and family members about the experience. This would possibly result in new tourists making the trip to enjoy the breweries and for all to m purchase more Coloradoan beer. Another reason brewery tourism is important is that it is a point of regional pride. Many nations, states, or cities are proud of their favorite beverages and want to show them to the world. If an already well-known brewery engages tourists, it creates another selling opportunity and tourist attraction. Unfortunately, not much is known about the alcohol tourist, in general, and more information regarding these tourists would be beneficial to not only the producers, but to the overall community in which they are housed. Colorado has prided itself on its beer industry and is a great location for reviewing and analyzing the brewery tourism industry...|$|R
