60|$|The {{material}} {{of the dress}} of this young servitor of Neptune, was a light rose-colored silk, cut in a fashion to resemble the habits formerly worn by pages of the great. His body was belted by a band of gold, a collar of fine thread lace floated on his neck and shoulders, and even his feet were clad {{in a sort of}} buskins, that were ornamented with fringes of real lace and tassels of bullion. The form and features of the child were delicate, and his air as unlike as possible to the coarse and brusque manner of a vulgar <b>ship-boy.</b>|$|E

"I will punctually obey you," [...] {{replied the}} father, [...] "when I have {{satisfied}} {{one part of}} my duty which calls upon me; it concerns the salvation or a soul, {{and there is no}} time to be lost on such an occasion." [...] Immediately he ordered to be carried to his own bed a poor <b>ship-boy,</b> who lay stretched out on a little straw, with a burning fever upon him, without speech or knowledge. The youth was no sooner placed upon the saint's bed, but he came to himself: Xavier made use of the opportunity, and laying himself by the sick person, who had led a most dissolute life, exhorted him so strongly all that night to abominate his sins, and to rely on the mercy of Almighty God, that he saw him die in great contrition, mixed with saving hope.|$|E

50|$|The bulk of {{the crew}} were {{all-purpose}} sailors - usually half of them marinheiros (seamen), the other half grumetes (<b>ship-boys).</b> The partition between the two classes was akin to the modern distinction between able seaman and ordinary seamen, e.g. <b>ship-boys</b> were assigned the drudgery duties, swabbing and scrubbing, moving cargo, etc., while seamen would be given 'higher' responsibilities, e.g. assigned to hold the wheel on the tolda (quarterdeck). The boatswain was considered {{the head of the}} seamen, and served as the intermediary between the seamen and the higher officers (master, pilot, etc.). The boatswain's mate had authority only over the ship-boys; seamen would not obey a boatswain's mate's order.|$|R

60|$|It is in {{consequence}} of this difference in power, and of the mystery that envelops {{the workings of the}} atmosphere, that, in all ages, seamen have been the subjects of superstition, in respect to the winds. There is always more or less of the dependency of ignorance, in the manner with which they have regarded the changes of that fickle element. Even the mariners of our own times are not exempt from this weakness. The thoughtless <b>ship-boy</b> is reproved if his whistle be heard in the howling of the gale, and the officer sometimes betrays a feeling of uneasiness, if at such a moment he should witness any violation of the received opinions of his profession. He finds himself in the situation of one whose ears have drunk in legends of supernatural appearances, which a better instruction has taught him to condemn, and who when placed in situations to awaken their recollection, finds the necessity of drawing upon his reason to quiet emotions that he might hesitate to acknowledge.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Nelson was an admiral {{every inch}} of him. He looked at everything, not merely in its {{possible}} relations to the naval service in general, but in its immediate bearings on his own squadron; to his officers, his men, to the particular ships themselves, his affections were as strong and ardent as those of a lover. Hence, though his temper was constitutionally irritable and uneven, yet never was a commander so enthusiastically loved by men of all ranks, from {{the captain of the}} fleet to the youngest <b>ship-boy.</b> Hence, too, the unexampled harmony which reigned in his fleet, year after year, under circumstances that might well have undermined the patience of the best-balanced dispositions, much more of men with the impetuous character of British sailors. Year after year, the same dull duties of a wearisome blockade, of doubtful policy--little, if any, opportunity of making prizes; and the few prizes, which accident might throw in the way, of little or no value; and when at last the occasion presented itself which would have compensated for all, then a disappointment as sudden and unexpected as it was unjust and cruel, and the cup dashed from their lips! Add to these trials the sense of enterprises checked by feebleness and timidity elsewhere, not omitting the tiresomeness of the Mediterranean sea, sky, and climate; and the unjarring and cheerful spirit of affectionate brotherhood, which linked together the hearts of that whole squadron, will appear not less wonderful to us than admirable and affecting. When the resolution was taken of commencing hostilities against Spain, before any intelligence was sent to Lord Nelson, another admiral, with two or three ships of the line, was sent into the Mediterranean, and stationed before Cadiz, {{for the express purpose of}} intercepting the Spanish prizes. The admiral despatched on this lucrative service gave no information to Lord Nelson of his arrival in the same sea, and five weeks elapsed before his lordship became acquainted with the circumstance. The prizes thus taken were immense. A month or two sufficed to enrich the commander and officers of this small and highly-favoured squadron; while to Nelson and his fleet the sense of having done their duty, and the consciousness of the glorious services which they had performed, were considered, it must be presumed, as an abundant remuneration for all their toils and long suffering! It was, indeed, an unexampled circumstance, that a small squadron should be sent to the station which had been long occupied by a large fleet, commanded by the darling of the navy, and the glory of the British empire, to the station where this fleet had for years been wearing away in the most barren, repulsive, and spirit-trying service, in which the navy can be employed! and that this minor squadron should be sent independently of, and without any communication with the commander of the former fleet, for the express and solitary purpose of stepping between it and the Spanish prizes, and as soon as this short and pleasant service was performed, of bringing home the unshared booty with all possible caution and despatch. The substantial advantages of naval service were, perhaps, deemed of too gross a nature for men already rewarded with the grateful affections of their own countrymen, and the admiration of the whole world! They were to be awarded, therefore, on a principle of compensation to a commander less rich in fame, and whose laurels, though not scanty, were not yet sufficiently luxuriant to hide the golden crown which is the appropriate ornament of victory in the bloodless war of commercial capture! Of all the wounds which were ever inflicted on Nelson's feelings (and there were not a few), this was the deepest--this rankled most! [...] "I had thought" [...] (said the gallant man, in a letter written on the first feelings of the affront), [...] "I fancied--but nay, it must have been a dream, an idle dream--yet, I confess it, I did fancy, that I had done my country service--and thus they use me. It was not enough to have robbed me once before of my West India harvest--now they have taken away the Spanish--and under what circumstances, and with what pointed aggravations? Yet, if I know my own thoughts, it is not for myself, or on my own account chiefly, that I feel the sting, and the disappointment; no! it is for my brave officers; for my noble-minded friends and comrades--such a gallant set of fellows! such a hand of brothers! My heart swells at the thought of them!" ...|$|E
50|$|On the 15th October 1694 Admiral Edward Russell, then {{commanding}} the Mediterranean fleet, gave a grand entertainment at Alicante. The tables were laid under {{the shade of}} orange-trees, in four garden-walks meeting in a common centre, at a marble fountain, which last, for the occasion, was converted into a Titanic punch-bowl. Four hogsheads of brandy, one pipe of Malaga wine, twenty gallons of lime-juice, twenty-five hundred lemons, thirteen hundredweight of fine white sugar, five pounds' weight of grated nutmegs, three hundred toasted biscuits, and eight hogsheads of water, formed the ingredients of this monster-brewage. An elegant canopy placed over the potent liquor, prevented waste by evaporation, or dilution by rain; while, in a boat, built expressly for the purpose, a <b>ship-boy</b> rowed round the fountain, to assist in filling cups for the six thousand persons who partook of it.|$|E

"I am sorry, countess," [...] {{the commandant}} said, [...] "that I {{was obliged to}} quarter these two English boys upon you, but every house in the town is full of sick and wounded; and as they were given over to me as officers, though they look to me more like <b>ship-boys,</b> I could not put them in prison with the twenty or thirty {{soldiers}} whom we captured at the victory on the heights above Inkerman." ...|$|R
50|$|Schiffskinder, {{literally}} meaning <b>ship-boys</b> (in German), {{were the}} crews {{of the ships}} of the Hanseatic League during the late Middle Ages. Schiffskinder and passengers swore allegiance to each other before leaving the harbour. They often fought both on land and at the sea. Sometimes groups of Schiffskinder supported the Teutonic Order armies {{and there is a}} record of one Hochmeister who in 1414 awarded one such group, the Schiffskinder of Gdańsk (Danzig), with privileges for their valor in combat against the Poles.|$|R
60|$|Not a station-house, or bone-house, or work-house in the {{metropolis}} escaped a visitation {{from the hard}} glazed hat. Along the wharves, among the shipping on the bank-side, up the river, down the river, here, there, everywhere, it went gleaming where men were thickest, like the hero's helmet in an epic battle. For a whole week the Captain read of all the found and missing people in all the newspapers and handbills, and went forth on expeditions {{at all hours of}} the day to identify Solomon Gills, in poor little <b>ship-boys</b> who had fallen overboard, and in tall foreigners with dark beards who had taken poison--'to make sure,' Captain Cuttle said, 'that it wam't him.' It is a sure thing that it never was, and that the good Captain had no other satisfaction.|$|R

60|$|Tom Platt {{dealt with}} his interminable trip round the Horn {{on the old}} Ohio in the {{flogging}} days, with a navy more extinct than the dodo--the navy that passed away in the great war. He told them how red-hot shot are dropped into a cannon, a wad of wet clay {{between them and the}} cartridge; how they sizzle and reek when they strike wood, and how the little <b>ship-boys</b> of the Miss Jim Buck hove water over them and shouted to the fort to try again. And he told tales of blockade--long weeks of swaying at anchor, varied only by the departure and return of steamers that had used up their coal (there was no change for the sailing-ships); of gales and cold--cold that kept two hundred men, night and day, pounding and chopping at the ice on cable, blocks, and rigging, when the galley was as red-hot as the fort's shot, and men drank cocoa by the bucket. Tom Platt had no use for steam. His service closed when that thing was comparatively new. He admitted that it was a specious invention in time of peace, but looked hopefully for the day when sails should come back again on ten-thousand-ton frigates with hundred-and-ninety-foot booms.|$|R
