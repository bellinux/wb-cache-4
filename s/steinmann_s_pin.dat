Oral PresentationSmall-angle neutron {{scattering}} experiments {{were carried out}} at room temperature on pD 6. 6 solutions of horse heart azidometmyoglobin (MbN_ 3) at pressures up to 300 MPa. The measurements were performed using various concentrations of MbN_ 3 {{in order to determine}} the second virial coefficient of the protein solution and the actual radius of gyration of the protein. The results [1] shows that the interactions between the macromolecules are always strongly repulsive, even if their magnitude decreases with increasing pressure, whereas the radius of gyration of the protein remains constant. This indicates that the compactness of MbN_ 3 is not altered by pressures up to 300 MPa. However it is possible that a molten globule forms at the highest investigated pressures. Taking advantage of the pressure-induced contrast variation of the protein these experiments allow the partial specific volume of MbN_ 3 to be determined as a function of pressure. Its value decreases by about 5. 4 % between atmospheric pressure and 300 MPa. In this range the isothermal compressibility of hydrated MbN_ 3 is found to be (1. 6 ± 0. 1) 10 ^- 4 MPa^- 1 [1]. This result will be compared with those obtained by means of other techniques. [1] C. Loupiac, M. Bonetti, <b>S.</b> <b>Pin</b> and P. Calmettes, Eur. Jour. Biochem. 269 (2002) 4731 - 473...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{assessment}} of Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S window layer thickness {{and its impact}} on photoresponse uniformity in CdTe thin film photovoltaic (PV) devices is presented. A triple-wavelength laser beam induced current (LBIC) system provided a spatially resolved photocurrent mapping technique. Three diode lasers; λ = 405, 658, 810 nm gave photon absorption and carrier generation characteristics over the spectral range of the Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ CdTe devices. Two contrasting device structures were grown by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), where the uniformity of the Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S window layer was known to vary: 1. uniform 240 nm Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ 2 μm CdTe and 2. a poorly nucleated 40 - 300 nm Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ 2 μm CdTe. Calculated photon penetration depths, δp allowed for the separation of identified defects within the device cross-section. Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 <b>S</b> <b>pin</b> holes were identified in 240 nm Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S/ 2 μm CdTe where 405 nm photon ‘punch-through’ into the absorber material was observed. These pin holes also led to a localised reduction in photoresponse at λ = 658 and 810 nm. In the device structure where the Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S window layer thickness was known to vary from 40 to 300 nm, CdTe pin holes were identified where localised ∼ 50 μm regions of reduced photoresponse, at all wavelengths were observed. Local variations in both Cd 0. 9 Zn 0. 1 S and CdTe thickness were also identified where variable absorption led to a distribution of LBIC photoresponse. It was demonstrated that reduced photoresponse uniformity at all incident wavelengths was related to reduced device shunt resistance, Rsh and open-circuit voltage, Voc...|$|R
40|$|First, {{the present}} work is {{concerned}} with generalising constructions and results in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes from the well-known case of the Klein-Gordon field to Dirac fields. To this end, the enlarged algebra of observables of the Dirac field is constructed in the algebraic framework. This algebra contains normal-ordered Wick polynomials in particular, and an extended analysis {{of one of its}} elements, the stress-energy tensor, is performed. Based on detailed calculations of the Hadamard coefficients of the Dirac field, it is found that a construction of a stress-energy tensor fulfilling necessary physical properties is possible. Additionally, the mathematically sound Hadamard regularisation prescription of the stress-energy tensor is compared to the mathematically less rigorous DeWitt-Schwinger regularisation and it is found that both prescriptions are essentially equivalent in rigorous terms. While the aforementioned results hold in generic curved spacetimes, particular attention is also devoted to a specific class of Robertson-Walker spacetimes with a lightlike Big Bang hypersurface. Employing holographic methods, Hadamard states for the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac field are constructed. These states are preferred {{in the sense that they}} constitute asymptotic equilibrium states in the limit to the Big Bang hypersurface. Finally, solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equation for quantum fields of arbitrary <b>s</b> <b>pin</b> are analysed in the flat Robertson-Walker case. One finds that these solutions explain the measured supernova Ia data as good as the CDM model. Hence, one arrives at a natural explanation of dark energy and a simple quantum model of cosmological dark matter.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reducing}} geometries is {{very often}} evoked to explain experimental shifts of water properties occluded inside small cavities. At nanometric level, the deviation of water properties can be modelled and measured and both results agree that from 5 nm (10 nm at max.) to smaller confinement, the finite size effects play a growing role {{to control the}} water thermodynamics. In the meantime, collecting large-scale evidences, like the phase transitions and chemical saturations states observed/measured in natural aquifers, the threshold between macroscopic and nanoscopic domains appears much more unclear, extending to 0. 1 μm or more. The question thus arises as {{for the existence of}} intermediate mesoscopic behaviors, between truly nanoscopic and truly macroscopic domains. Recently, we accumulated a large number of measurements (vibrational and X spectroscopies, phase transitions) on water occluded in different types of cavities (closed cavities in quartz = fluid inclusions, open nano-channels patterned inside silicon wafers, pores membranes, capillaries), and sometimes on the container. These measurements tend to demonstrate that the properties of the water body can change {{as a function of the}} distance to interfaces (over 1 - 3 micrometers !) and as a function of the confinement degree from around 35 - 40 nm. These measurements open the discussion to the surface-to-volume competition in thermodynamics, especially when addressing two-phases (or more) systems. Thermodynamics of small systems appears attractive to deal with the evident size effect in confinement regime, though it is visible at sizes larger than usually defined. Another challenge is to thermodynamically describe biphasic frontiers using surfacial formalism, possibly requiring, in certain cases, the definition of an interfacial phase with finite width, instead of an abrupt interface between two bulk phases. In both cases, the characteristic threshold between bulk and “others” behaviors should be calculated and generalized on thermodynamic grounds.

As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small <b>pin</b> (<b>S)</b> on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the <b>pin</b> (<b>S)</b> not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour).

Several global topological parameters are used to characterize the protein–protein interaction networks (PINs) for seven organisms. We find that the seven PINs are well approximated by the scale-free networks, that is, the node degree cumulative distribution Pcum(k) scales with the node degree k (Pcum(k) ~ k-α). We also find that the logarithm of the average clustering coefficient Cave(k) scales with k (Cave(k) ~ k-β), for E. coli and S. cerevisiae.

40|$|Proteinase {{inhibitor}} II (PIN 2) proteins {{from the}} Solanaceae family have been previously used in plant transformation to acquire protection against caterpillars. Some of these PIN 2 proteins {{have been shown}} to exhibit exogenous activities against trypsin and/or chymotrypsin in vitro. Despite their application in conferring insect resistance in transgenic plants, the endogenous roles of this family of proteins in various plant species have not been well defined. To investigate the exogenous and endogenous functions of PIN 2 proteins, cDNAs encoding PIN 2 proteins from the weed Solanum americanum (American black nightshade), designated SaPIN 2 a and SaPIN 2 b, were cloned and characterized. The localization of S. americanum SaPIN 2 a and SaPIN 2 b mRNAs and proteins in the reproductive tissues destined to undergo developmental programmed cell death subsequently led to investigations into their function during seed development. Using plant transformation of lettuce and S. americanum, it was evident that: (1) the expression of SaPIN 2 a in transgenic lettuce conferred resistance to cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) caterpillars; and (2) the expression of siRNAs from a PIN 2 -RNAi construct resulted in transgenic S. americanum that were impaired in seed development. These results suggest that <b>S.</b> americanum <b>PIN</b> 2 proteins not only enhance resistance to caterpillars (when expressed exogenously) but they function in inhibiting endogenous proteases that are expressed during seed development.

40|$|The {{study of}} heteromorphy in Primula {{over the past}} 140 years has {{established}} the reproductive significance of this breeding system. Plants produce either thrum or pin flowers that demonstrate reciprocal herkogamy. Thrums have short styles and produce large pollen from anthers {{at the mouth of}} the flower; pins have long styles and produce small pollen from anthers located within the corolla tube. The control of heteromorphy is orchestrated by the S locus with dominant (S) and recessive (s) alleles that comprise a co-adapted linkage group of genes. Thrum plants are heterozygous (<b>Ss)</b> and <b>pin</b> plants are homozygous (ss). Reciprocal crosses between the two forms are required for fertilization; within-morph crosses are impeded by a sporophytic self-incompatibility system. Rare recombination events within the S locus produce self-fertile homostyles. As a first step towards identifying genes located at the S locus, we used fluorescent differential display to screen for differential gene expression in pin and thrum flowers. Rather than only detecting differentially regulated genes, we identified two S locus linked genes by virtue of allelic variation between pin and thrum transcripts. Analysis of pin and thrum plants together with homostyle recombinant reveals that one gene flanks the locus, whereas the other shows complete linkage. One gene is related to Arabidopsis flower-timing genes Col 9 and Col 10; the other encodes a small predicted membrane protein of unknown function. Notwithstanding the diallelic behaviour of the Primula S locus, analysis of pin and thrum plants reveal three alleles for each gene: two pin and one thrum. © 2007 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} {{have been}} investigated of puroindoline-a (Pin-a) and mixed protein systems of Pin-a and wild-type puroindoline-b (Pin-b+) or puroindoline-b mutants (G 46 <b>S</b> mutation (<b>Pin</b> bH) or W 44 R mutation (Pin-bS)) with condensed phase monolayers of an anionic phospholipid (L-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (DPPG)) at the air/water interface. The interactions of the mixed systems were studied at three different concentration ratios of Pin-a:Pin-b, namely 3 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 {{in order to establish}} any synergism in relation to lipid binding properties. Surface pressure measurements revealed that Pin-a interaction with DPPG monolayers led to an equilibrium surface pressure increase of 8. 7 ± 0. 6 mN m- 1. This was less than was measured for Pin-a:Pin-b+ (9. 6 to 13. 4 mN m- 1), but was significantly more than was measured for Pin-a:Pin-bH (4. 0 to 6. 2 mN m- 1) or Pin-a:Pin-bS (3. 8 to 6. 3 mN m- 1) over the complete range of concentration ratio. Consequently, surface pressure increases were shown to correlate to endosperm hardness phenotype, with puroindolines present in hard-textured wheat varieties yielding lower equilibrium surface pressure changes. Integrated amide I peak areas from corresponding external reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ER-FTIR) spectra, used to indicate levels of protein adsorption to the lipid monolayers, showed that differences in adsorbed amount were less significant. The data therefore suggest that Pin-b mutants having single residue substitutions within their tryptophan-rich loop that are expressed in some hard-textured wheat varieties influence the degree of penetration of Pin-a and Pin-b into anionic phospholipid films. These findings highlight the key role of the tryptophan-rich loop in puroindoline-lipid interactions...|$|R
40|$|The American Ornithologists’ Union, 2006. Southeast Asia has {{the highest}} {{relative}} rate of deforestation of any major tropical region, and could lose three quarters of its original forests by 2100 and up to 42 % of its biodiversity. Here, {{we report on the}} current state of its biota and highlight the primary drivers of the threat of extinction now faced by much of the unique and rich fauna and flora of the region. Furthermore, the known impacts on the biodiversity of Southeast Asia are likely to be {{just the tip of the}} iceberg, owing to the paucity of research data. The looming Southeast Asian biodiversity disaster demands immediate and definitive actions, yet such measures continue to be constrained by socioeconomic factors, including poverty and lack of infrastructure. Any realistic solution will need to involve a multidisciplinary strategy, including political, socioeconomic and scientific input, in which all major stakeholders (government, non-government, national and international organizations) must participate.

40|$|The {{exchange}} {{interaction between}} electrons and magnetic spins is considerably enhanced near interfaces, in magnetic multilayers. As a result, a dc current {{can be used}} to generate spin oscillations. We review theory and experimental evidence. The s-d exchange interaction causes a rapid precession of itinerant conduction-electron spins s around the localized spins S of magnetic electrons. Because of the precession, the time-averaged interaction torque between s and S vanishes. An interface between a magnetic layer and a spacer causes a local coherence between the precession phases of differnt electrons, within 10 nm from the interface, and restores the torque. Also, a second magnetic layer with <b>pinned</b> <b>S</b> is used to prepare s in a specific direction. the current-induced drive torque of s on S in the active layer may be calculated from the spin current (Slonczewski) or from the spin imbalance Delta-mu (Berger). Spin current and Delta-mu are proportional to each other, and can arise from Fermi-surface translation, as well as from expansion/contraction.
