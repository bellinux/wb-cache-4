The {{irradiation}} effects on pollen grains were tested {{in terms of the}} ultrastructural changes in the exine and interior of pollen grains, their germination rate, the <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>reaction</b> polymorphism of ovule developed after the pistils were pollinated by the pollen grains which had been irradiated with 60 Co-gamma ray, and the law of genetic variation of their M 1, M 2 progeny. The results showed that 60 Co-gamma ray had no effects on the exine wall of the pollen grains. The interior structure of pollen grain were destroyed significiantly. The interior wall became thin and irregular, and part of it concavitied to the inner. The endoplasmic reticulum depolymerized. The amount and the density of pollen grain inclusions increased. The number of pollen tubes in style decreased by 38 %, compared with the control group (natural pollen grain). The <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>reaction</b> polymorphism of ovule increased. The germination percentage of M 1 progeny was decreased by 41. 03 %.

40|$|Abstract Background In protein engineering, site-directed {{mutagenesis}} methods {{are used to}} generate DNA sequences with mutated codons, insertions or deletions. In a widely used method, mutations are generated by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotide primers designed with mismatching nucleotides {{at the center of}} the primers. In this method, primer-primer annealing may prevent cloning of mutant cDNAs. To circumvent this problem we developed an alternative procedure that does not use forward-reverse primer pair in the same reaction. Results In initial studies we used a double-primer PCR mutagenesis protocol, but sequencing of products showed tandem repeats of primer in cloned DNA. We developed an alternative method that starts with two Single-Primer Reactions IN Parallel using high-fidelity Pwo DNA polymerase. Thus, we call the method with the acronym SPRINP. The SPRINP reactions are then combined, denatured at 95 °C, and slowly cooled, promoting random annealing of the parental DNA and the newly synthesized strands. The products are digested with DpnI that digests methylated parental strands, and then transformed into E. coli. Using this method we generated > 40 mutants in cDNAs coding for human Epithelial Na + Channel (ENaC) subunits. The method has been tested for 1 – 3 bp codon mutation and insertion of a 27 bp epitope tag into cDNAs. Conclusion The SPRINP mutagenesis protocol yields mutants reliably and with high fidelity. The use of a <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> in each <b>amplification</b> <b>reaction</b> increases the probability of success of primers relative to previous methods employing a forward and reverse primer pair in the same reaction. </p...|$|R

Totally 15 ISSR, 8 RAPD and 7 DAMD primers generated 263 amplification products, accounting for 84. 6 % polymorphism across all the genotypes. The Mantel's test of correlation revealed the best correlation between ISSR and cumulative data with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 84. Assessment of population diversity indicated that the maximum intra population genetic diversity was recorded among high FeZn lines (HFL) having maximum values of Nei's genetic diversity (h) (0. 244), Shannon information index (I) (0. 368) {{and the percentage of}} polymorphic loci (Pp) (72. 65 %) while the corresponding lowest values of 0. 074, 0. 109 and 17. 95 % respectively were observed among the members of MDT subpopulation. The mean coefficient of gene differentiation (GST) and the gene flow (Nm) between populations were observed to be 0. 396 and 0. 7680 respectively. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) suggested that maximum genetic variation exists within populations (95 %) than among populations (5 %).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we develop an {{efficient}} and reproducible in vitro regeneration system for two cultivars viz., Jamila and Tomaland of Solanum lycopersicum L., an economically important vegetable crop throughout the world. Sterilization of seeds with 2. 5 % (v/v) NaOCl {{was found to}} be most effective, about 97 % of seeds germinated on cotton in magenta box moistened with sterile half strength (½) Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. Regeneration efficiency of cotyledonary leaf (CL) and cotyledonary node (CN) explants derived from 08  days old aseptic seedling were assessed on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of auxins and cytokinin. CL explants were found more responsive in comparison to CN in both the cultivars. Types of basal media were also assessed and found to {{have a significant effect on}} shoot regeneration. Highest regeneration frequency and maximum number of shoots were standardized from CL explants on MS medium supplied with 6 -benzyl adenine (BA; 5. 0  µM), indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA; 2. 5  µM) and Kinetin (Kin; 10. 0  µM). In vitro regenerated microshoots were rooted on ½MS medium containing 0. 5  µM indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA). Regenerated plantlets with well-developed roots and shoot system were successfully acclimated to ex vitro condition. Genetic uniformity of tissue culture raised plantlets was first time evaluated using flow cytometry and <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>reaction</b> (SPAR) methods viz., DAMD and ISSR.

40|$|The genus Eigenmannia (Teleostei: Gymnotiformes), {{a widely}} {{distributed}} fish genus from the Neotropical region, presents very complex morphological patterns and many taxonomic problems. It {{is suggested that}} this genus harbors a species complex {{that is hard to}} differentiate using only morphological characteristics. As a result, many species of Eigenmannia may be currently gathered under a common name. With the objective of providing new tools for species characterization in this group, an analysis of the polymorphism of DNA inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), obtained by <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> <b>reaction</b> (SPAR), combined with karyotype identification, was carried out in specimens sampled from populations of the Upper Parana, So Francisco and Amazon river basins (Brazil). Specific ISSR patterns generated by primers (AAGC) (4) and (GGAC) (4) were found to characterize the ten cytotypes analyzed, even though the cytotypes 2 n = 38 and 2 n = 38 XX:XY, from the Upper Parana basin, share some ISSR amplification patterns. The geographical distribution of all Eigenmannia specimens sampled was inferred, showing the cytotype 2 n = 31 / 2 n = 32 as the most frequent and largely distributed in the Upper Parana basin. The cytotype 2 n = 34 was reported {{for the first time in}} the genus Eigenmania, restricted to the So Francisco basin. Polymorphic ISSR patterns were also detected for each cytotype. Considering our results and the data reported previously in the literature, it is suggested that many of the forms of Eigenmannia herein analyzed might be regarded as different species.

Further, {{in order to understand}} the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> (SISPA) and <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> isothermal <b>amplification</b> (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit) ] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100 % for SPIA and 99 % for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45 % of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169 - 284 944), only 0. 07 % of the SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0 - 249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is expected and if high sequence depth is desired...|$|R

Several groups of rotaviruses are currently recognized based on the antigenic differences in the major inner shell protein and on the characteristic banding pattern of their 11 dsRNA genome segments. The single-primer amplification of viral dsRNA was developed to express the cloning atypical rotaviruses of unknown sequence directly from very small quantities of human fecal specimens. The human stool sample is an extremely hostile environment from which to extract undegraded RNA, but the successful cloning of all 11 genome segments of group C rotavirus RNA suggests that this method may be generally applicable to other dsRNA viruses {{from a variety of}} biological sources.

High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis was used in this study for screening similar sequences to avoid unnecessary sequencing from genomic libraries and detection of common pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. Four different structures of DNA linear double stranded DNA (dsDNA, 48 kb), linear single stranded DNA (ssDNA, 3. 6 kb), small circular dsDNA (2. 6 kb) and a large circular dsDNA (8. 6 kb) were used as representatives of different types of viral nucleic acids for the evaluation of phi 29 -amplification at limiting concentrations. Phi 29 -amplification of linear ds, large and small circular dsDNA could be amplified 10 - 100 -fold but ssDNA could not be amplified at all. Alternative protocols were adapted for ligating ssDNA and dsDNA to construct large concatemers for efficient phi 29 -amplification. Phi 29 -amplification of ssDNA was found to increase > 10 -fold when it was ligated using T 4 RNA ligase {{in the presence of a}} large excess of background ssDNA compared to that in the absence of background ssDNA. T 4 DNA ligase-mediated phi 29 -amplification of double stranded cDNA (dscDNA) was found to increase > 105 -fold compared to non-ligated dscDNA. CircLigaseä II ssDNA ligase was used for circularization of ssDNA and aid phi 29 -amplification. CircLigaseä II ssDNA ligase-mediated phi 29 -amplification of ssDNA was found to increase > 107 -fold compared to non-ligated sscDNA. A method named RT-Bst was developed for simultaneous reverse transcription and Bst DNA polymerase amplification of cDNA in the same reaction. In a qualitative PCR assay, RT-Bst was found to be more efficient than the QuantiTectä reverse transcription kit (QIAGEN, Crawley, UK). The RT-Bst method was used for amplification of cDNA in 70 nasopharyngeal samples for detection of a panel of 12 pathogenic viruses of the respiratory tract. The performance of multiplex RT-Bst PCR detection of pathogenic viruses was comparable to that of multiplex one-step RT-PCR (performed in this study) and more efficient than immunofluorescence (performed by a hospital diagnostic laboratory). The RT-Bst protocol was further modified using tailed random primers to develop another protocol for whole genome <b>amplification</b> designated RT-Bst <b>Single</b> <b>Primer</b> <b>Amplification</b> (RT-Bst SPA) as a cheaper alternative to sequence independent <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification.</b> HRM analysis was used in this study to demonstrate its application for low cost screening of similar sequences to avoid unnecessary sequencing task from whole genome libraries prepared from MS 2 RNA and tissue culture media positive for influenza B and hRSV.

A Flanders virus specific RT-PCR assay identified a total of five previously unknown environmental viral isolates as Flanders virus. Unidentified viral isolates were obtained during arbovirus surveillance efforts in Florida, either from the Florida Department of Health program (BOL-Tampa) during 2005 – 2009, or collected during an ongoing project at the University of South Florida studying the ecology of arthropod-borne encephalitis viruses at sites located in Florida. In a concurrent study, SISPA was successfully used to characterize an unidentifiable virus isolate related to members of the Bunyaviradae family which was designated as Infirmatus virus. Natural mosquito population (10, 557 mosquitoes) collected in Florida was screened for Flanders virus and members of Bunyaviradae to determine infection prevalence. Although Flanders virus was not detected in this population, Infirmatus virus was identified in 14 mosquito pools with the highest infection prevalence in Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. The SISPA technique was successful for the genetic identification of unknown viral isolates and application of this method to samples with suspected or unidentified viral etiologies may be used to enhance public health surveillance of emerging or re-emerging viruses in Florida...|$|R
40|$|Background: Global {{analysis}} of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome is facilitated by the recent development of tools for large-scale, highly parallel analysis. We describe a novel nucleic acid amplification system that generates products by several methods. 3 �-Ribo-SPIA TM primes cDNA synthesis at the 3 � polyA tail, and whole transcript (WT) -Ribo-SPIA primes cDNA synthesis across {{the full length of}} the transcripts and thus provides whole-transcriptome amplification, independent of the 3 � polyA tail. Methods: We developed isothermal linear nucleic acid amplification systems, which use a <b>single</b> chimeric <b>primer,</b> for <b>amplification</b> of DNA (SPIA) and RNA (Ribo-SPIA). The latter allows mRNA amplification from as little as 1 ng of total RNA. Amplificatio...|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} {{technologies are}} used in the field of molecular biology and recombinant DNA technologies. These techniques are used as leading methods in detecting and analyzing a small quantity of nucleic acids. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most widely used method for DNA amplification for detection and identification of infectious diseases, genetic disorders and other research purposes. However, it requires a thermocycling machine to separate two DNA strands and then amplify the required fragment. Novel developments in molecular biology of DNA synthesis in vivo demonstrate the possibility of amplifying DNA in isothermal conditions without the need of a thermocycling apparatus. DNA polymerase replicates DNA with the aid of various accessory proteins. Recent identification of these proteins has enabled development of new in vitro isothermal DNA amplification methods, mimicking these in vivo mechanisms. There are several types of isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods such as transcription mediated amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, signal mediated amplification of RNA technology, strand displacement amplification, rolling circle amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA, isothermal multiple displacement <b>amplification,</b> helicase-dependent <b>amplification,</b> <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> isothermal <b>amplification,</b> and circular helicase-dependent amplification. In this article, we review these isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies and their applications in molecular biological studies. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{developments}} in DNA microarray technology {{led to a}} variety of open and closed devices and systems including high and low density microarrays for high-throughput screening applications as well as microarrays of lower density for specific diagnostic purposes. Beside predefined microarrays for specific applications manufacturers offer the production of custom-designed microarrays adapted to customers' wishes. Array based assays demand complex procedures including several steps for sample preparation (RNA extraction, amplification and sample labelling), hybridization and detection, thus leading to a high variability between several approaches and resulting in the necessity of extensive standardization and normalization procedures. Results In the present work a custom designed human proteinase DNA microarray of lower density in ArrayTube ® format was established. This highly economic open platform only requires standard laboratory equipment and allows the study of the molecular regulation of cell behaviour by proteinases. We established a procedure for sample preparation and hybridization and verified the array based gene expression profile by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Moreover, we compared the results with the well established Affymetrix microarray. By application of standard labelling procedures with e. g. Klenow fragment exo -, <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> (SPA) or In Vitro Transcription (IVT) we noticed a loss of signal conservation for some genes. To overcome this problem we developed a protocol in accordance with the SPA protocol, in which we included target specific primers designed individually for each spotted oligomer. Here we present a complete array based assay in which only the specific transcripts of interest are amplified in parallel and in a linear manner. The array represents a proof of principle which can be adapted to other species as well. Conclusion As the designed protocol for amplifying mRNA starts from as little as 100 ng total RNA, it presents an alternative method for detecting even low expressed genes by microarray experiments in a highly reproducible and sensitive manner. Preservation of signal integrity is demonstrated out by QRT-PCR measurements. The little amounts of total RNA necessary for the analyses make this method applicable for investigations with limited material as in clinical samples from, for example, organ or tumour biopsies. Those are arguments in favour of the high potential of our assay compared to established procedures for amplification within the field of diagnostic expression profiling. Nevertheless, the screening character of microarray data must be mentioned, and independent methods should verify the results. </p...|$|R

First {{identification}} of porcine parvovirus 6 in North America by viral metagenomic sequencing of serum from pigs infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Virology Journal, 12, 10. doi: 10. 1186 /s 12985 - 015 - 0401 - 6 Background: Currently, eight species in four genera of parvovirus {{have been described}} that infect swine. These include ungulate protoparvovirus 1 (classical porcine parvovirus, PPV), ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 (PPV 3), ungulate tetraparvovirus 3 (which includes PPV 2, porcine hokovirus, porcine partetravirus and porcine PARV 4), ungulate copiparvovirus 2 (which includes PPV 4 and PPV 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (which includes porcine bocavirus 1, 2 and 6), ungulate bocaparvovirus 3 (porcine bocavirus 5), ungulate bocaparvovirus 4 (porcine bocavirus 7) and ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (porcine bocavirus 3, 4 - 1 and 4 - 2). PPV 6, the most recently described porcine parvovirus, was first identified in China in late 2014 in aborted pig fetuses. Prevalence of PPV 6 in China {{was found to be}} similar in finishing age pigs from farms with and without evidence of swine reproductive failure. Methods: Porcine parvovirus 6 (PPV 6) was detected by sequence-independent <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> <b>amplification</b> (SISPA) and confirmed by overlapping and real-time PCR in the serum of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSv) positive samples. Results: Seven nearly complete genomes of PPV 6 were identified in PRRSv genotype 2 positive serum samples submitted to state veterinary diagnostic laboratories in 2014. Further testing using overlapping and real-time PCR determined PPV 6 to be present in 13. 2 % of the serums tested. Additionally, PPV 6 was present in samples from all of the geographic locations sampled encompassing nine states in the United States and one state in Mexico. The presence of PPV 6 in serum indicates that the PPV 6 infection is disseminated and not localized to a specific tissue type. Alignments of the near full length genomes, NS 1, and capsid genes identified one of the five PPV 6 isolates from China (98. 6 - 99. 5 % identity with the North American strains) to be the North American strains nearest relative. Conclusions: These results are the first to report the presence of PPV 6 in North America and demonstrate that the virus is found in multiple geographic areas in the United States and in Mexico. The overall prevalence of PPV 6 in PRRSv viremic animals is relatively low. Further, all of the PPV 6 genomes found in North America are most closely related to a PPV 6 strain first identified in 2014 in healthy pigs from the Tianjin province of China...|$|R
30|$|Noroviruses (NoVs) {{have high}} levels of genetic {{sequence}} diversities, which lead to difficulties in designing robust universal primers to efficiently amplify specific viral genomes for molecular analysis. We here described the practicality of sequence-independent amplification combined with DNA microarray analysis for simultaneous detection and genotyping of human NoVs in fecal specimens. We showed that <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> isothermal linear <b>amplification</b> (Ribo-SPIA) of genogroup I (GI) and genogroup II (GII) NoVs could be run through the same amplification protocol without the need to design and use any virus-specific primers. Related virus could be subtyped by the unique pattern of hybridization with the amplified product to the microarray. By testing 22 clinical fecal specimens obtained from acute gastroenteritis cases as blinded samples, 2 were GI positive and 18 were GII positive as well as 2 negative for NoVs. A NoV GII positive specimen was also identified as having co-occurrence of hepatitis A virus. The study showed that there was 100  % concordance for positive NoV detection at genogroup level between the results of Ribo-SPIA/microarray and the phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences of the capsid gene. In addition, 85  % genotype agreement was observed for the new assay compared to the results of phylogenetic analysis.|$|R
40|$|NuGEN Technologies is a {{provider}} of innovative sample preparation solutions. As such, we offer a wide palette of systems optimized {{for a variety of}} sample types such as whole blood RNA, small quantity RNA from different sources as well as highly degraded RNA i. e. from FFPE specimens. The SPIA® (<b>Single</b> <b>Primer</b> Isothermal <b>Amplification)</b> technology allows rapid linear amplification of input RNA even at picogram level and all of our amplification assays generate microgram amounts of cDNA, known as SPIA product which is suitable for analysis i. e. by qPCR. Reagent modules to further prepare the SPIA product for subsequent analyses on microarrays or massive parallel sequencing complement NuGEN's current offering. NuGEN targets are compatible with all leading microarray formats and NGS platforms. Automating a workflow not only helps maximizing sample throughput but also minimizes variance introduced during the assay. We describe fully automated assays on leading liquid handling systems that enable high-throughput target preparation of up to 96 samples using NuGEN systems for different sample types. The NuGEN assays are scripted in a modular form allowing highest flexibility with regard to both, the number of samples processed at a time as well as integration into the laboratory workflow. Starting from total RNA, the entire process through to target preparation for further analysis on microarrays or sequencing platforms can be completed within two convenient workdays. Basic QC-metrics with these fully automated workflows show equal or superior performance over manual handling. These methods are well suited for adoption by core facilities to increase efficiency, reduce operator variation, and improve reproducibility and data quality. Their compatibility with a range of microarrays and sequencing platforms further enhance the flexibility for the core labs that can adopt a single workflow for a range of instruments and applications...|$|R
40|$|Objective/Background: The {{incidence}} of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), including multi-drug resistant, extensively drug resistant, or totally drug resistant, {{is one of}} the major problems of health policies worldwide. The accumulation of mutations causes multi-drug resistant strains. Mycobacterium abscessus has a plasmid called pMab 2401 containing the trfA 1 gene in its integron part. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible existence of the trfA 1 gene in clinical strains of MTB for the first time. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis in GenBank revealed an absence of any integrons or internal components in MTB. Several specific primers for different genes and the trfA 1 gene of M. abscessus were used in a touch-down (60 – 52) amplification program and followed by loading on gel electrophoresis. Products were extracted and were sequenced. Sequencing results were analyzed carefully and compared with those in the databank. Results: Bands of 500 bp were resulted with pair <b>primers</b> in an <b>amplification</b> <b>reaction</b> by clinical MTB that has 94 % identity with a fragment in most plasmids and phages M 13. It should be noted that such an independent replication system-like structure has not been reported to date in MTB strains. Conclusion: The trfA 1 gene is depends on the replication process. It is necessary to investigate other probable new areas that may be of concern with drug resistance in clinical isolates of MTB...|$|R

40|$|The Rh system, {{a complex}} blood group system, {{comprises}} at least 45 antigens. Red cells expressing c usually express Rh 26. Rare {{cells that are}} c+ Rh:- 26 give variable reactions with anti-c and may have weak expression of f (ce). Serologic and molecular studies were performed with red cells from persons with the c+ Rh:- 26 phenotype occurring in two unrelated Dutch families. Red cells of 11 members of these two families were typed for Rh 26, for c (with monoclonal and polyclonal reagents), and for f (ce). The cDNA of three donors was sequenced, while restricted DNA analysis was carried out on material from available members of the two families. Serologic tests showed that the rare c+ Rh:- 26 phenotype {{was associated with a}} weak expression of c and a normal expression of f. The cDNA analysis of three members of one family revealed a single-point mutation (G 286 A) in exon 2 of the ce allele. Allele-specific <b>primer</b> <b>amplification,</b> polymerase chain <b>reaction</b> followed by allele-specific restriction analysis, and single-strand conformation polymorphism showed the same polymorphism in all other members of both families, whereas it was absent in 80 control donors. The c+ Rh:- 26 phenotype, identified in two families, is associated with a single-point mutation at nucleotide 286 (G 286 A) in the ce allele, which predicts a Gly 96 Ser amino acid substitution. This substitution also affects c, because all anti-c reagents reacted more weakly. Other polymorphic sites apparently are involved {{in the formation of the}} Rh 26 epitope as well, because Rh 26 is expressed only on the c polypeptide, whereas Gly 96 is expressed on all polypeptide...|$|R
40|$|Background: Superficial {{fungal infections}} {{have a major}} impact on {{cosmetic}} health, affecting more than 20 - 25 % of the global population, which is predominantly caused by dermatophytes. As per literature search, molecular strain typing of dermatophytes has not been investigated in India. Therefore, the present study was carried out to characterise the dermatophyte species and strains by molecular methods. Objective: To analyse the genotype variability by applying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting using a simple sequence repetitive oligonucleotide (GACA) 4 primer to identify the species and strain variations among the dermatophytes isolated from a tertiary care centre in Chennai. Materials and Methods: From January 2010 to December 2010, 81 dermatophytes were isolated and included for the present study. A simple sequence repetitive oligonucleotide (GACA) 4 was used as a <b>single</b> <b>primer</b> in the <b>amplification</b> process. Results: The (GACA) 4 -based PCR successfully amplified all the clinical isolates. Trichophyton rubrum and T. rubrum var. raubitschekii produced identical band profiles, where the latter could not be differentiated from the T. rubrum, which are being reported for the first time from south India. Epidermophyton floccosum produced species-specific band profiles. Intra-species variability was not observed among the T. rubrum and E. floccosum isolates. T. mentagrophytes produced three simple, distinct band patterns, which are surprisingly different from the earlier studies. Conclusion: The PCR-based genotype using the short primer is rapid and precise in direct identification of dermatophyte isolates by one-step PCR to the species level and strain discrimination of the T. mentagrophytes variants...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} marine {{phytoplankton}} diversity is uncertain {{in many respects}} because, like bacteria, these organisms sometimes lack defining morphological characteristics and {{can be a challenge}} to grow in culture. Here, we report the recovery of phylogenetically diverse plastid small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene (rDNA) clones from natural plankton populations collected in the Pacific Ocean off the mouth of Yaquina Bay, Oreg. (OCS clones), and from the eastern continental shelf of the United States off Cape Hatteras, N. C. (OM clones). SSU rRNA gene clone libraries were prepared by amplifying rDNAs from nucleic acids isolated from plankton samples and cloning them into plasmid vectors. The PCR <b>primers</b> used for <b>amplification</b> <b>reactions</b> were designed to be specific for bacterial SSU rRNA genes; however, plastid genes have a common phylogenetic origin with bacteria and were common in both SSU rRNA gene clone libraries. A combination of restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, nucleic acid sequencing, and taxon-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridizations revealed that 54 of the 116 OCS gene clones were of plastid origin. Collectively, clones from the OCS and OM libraries formed at least eight unique lineages within the plastid radiation, including gene lineages related to the classes Bacillariophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Prasinophyceae; for a number of unique clones, no close phylogenetic neighbors could be identified with confidence. Only a group of two OCS rRNA gene clones showed close identity to the plastid SSU rRNA gene sequence of a cultured organism [Emiliania huxleyi (Lohmann) Hay and Mohler; 99. 8 % similar]. The remaining clones could not be identified to the genus or species level. Although cryptic species are not as prevalent among phytoplankton as they are among their bacterial counterparts, this genetic survey nonetheless uncovered significant new information about phytoplankton diversity...|$|R
