25|$|Nonoxynol-9 is {{sometimes}} included in <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> for its properties as a nonionic surfactant; it helps break down skin oils that normally protect hair from moisture, {{so that they}} become wet and, hence, softer and easier to shave.

50|$|The {{principal}} {{disadvantages of}} shaving soap {{is lack of}} convenience and space. Creating the lather and preparing the face is more time consuming than with other <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b> In addition, use of a shaving mug and optionally a lather bowl, consumes more space and takes more time than most <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> do.|$|E

50|$|A Colgate-Palmolive {{advertisement}} {{claimed that}} its Palmolive Rapid <b>Shave</b> <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> {{was so good}} {{it could be used}} to shave sandpaper. The commercial showed sandpaper applied with <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> and then <b>shaved.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first can of {{pressurized}} <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> was Rise <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> {{which was}} introduced by Carter-Wallace in 1949. By the following decade this format attained two-thirds of the American market for shaving preparations. The gas in <b>shaving</b> <b>cream</b> canisters originally contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but this substance was increasingly believed to be detrimental to the Earth's ozone layer. This led to restrictions or reductions in CFC use, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency ban in the late 1970s. Gaseous hydrocarbon propellants such as mixtures of pentane, propane, butane and isobutane could be used instead of the CFCs. Because of the large proportion of water in pressurized <b>shaving</b> <b>cream,</b> the risk from the normally flammable hydrocarbons was reduced.|$|R
50|$|Propane {{is used as}} a {{propellant}} {{for many}} household aerosol sprays, including <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> and air fresheners.|$|E
50|$|Shaving soaps {{typically}} {{cost more}} initially, when the shaving mug and soap is purchased. These costs can be significantly reduced by using mugs and bowls {{found in the}} kitchen, or purchased for a small amount at resale stores. Even though shaving soaps may cost more initially when buying the soap and equipment, {{over a longer period}} of time, shaving soaps are comparable in cost, or even cheaper than many <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b> Furthermore, shaving soaps have less ecological impact with respect to aerosol <b>shaving</b> <b>creams.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Shaving {{cream or}} shaving foam [...] is a frothy {{cosmetic}} cream applied to body hair, usually facial hair, to facilitate shaving.

50|$|The primary {{advantages}} of shaving soap over aerosol <b>shaving</b> <b>creams</b> is the additional hydration provided by shaving soaps. For optimal softening of whiskers, the natural oils {{on the face}} and whiskers must be removed. After oil {{is removed from the}} whiskers by the shaving soap and brush, water can more easily penetrate the whiskers. This results in whiskers being more easily cut than when using soapless creams and not brushing.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{commercial}} creams {{are often}} sold in spray cans, {{but can also}} be purchased in tubs or tubes. <b>Shaving</b> <b>creams</b> in a can are commonly dispensed as a foam and sometimes as a gel that starts turning into foam as it is rubbed into the skin, also known as post-foaming shaving gel. Creams that are in tubes or tubs are commonly used with a shaving brush to produce a rich lather (most often used in wet shaving).|$|E
