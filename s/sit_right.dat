Said McCartney in the liner notes, [...] "I worked with Diana Krall, and great jazz musicians like John Clayton. This is an album very tender, very intimate. This is an album you listen to at home after work, {{with a glass of}} wine or a cup of tea." [...] The disc was helmed by LiPuma who has previously worked with Miles Davis and Barbra Streisand, among others. The album is mostly standards, with two originals written in the same style ("My Valentine" [...] and [...] "Only Our Hearts"). [...] "My Valentine", composed by McCartney, the first song released from the album, features Eric Clapton on guitar. Stevie Wonder plays harmonica on [...] "Only Our Hearts". McCartney plays acoustic guitar on [...] "Get Yourself Another Fool" [...] and [...] "The Inch Worm", but otherwise contributes only vocals.|$|E
