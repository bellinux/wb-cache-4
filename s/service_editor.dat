40|$|AbstractModern IDEs {{increase}} developer productivity {{by incorporating}} {{many different kinds}} of <b>editor</b> <b>services.</b> These can be purely syntactic, such as syntax highlighting, code folding, and an outline for navigation; or they can be based on the language semantics, such as in-line type error reporting and resolving identifier declarations. Building all these services from scratch requires both the extensive knowledge of the sometimes complicated and highly interdependent APIs and extension mechanisms of an IDE framework, and an in-depth understanding of the structure and semantics of the targeted language. This paper describes Spoofax/IMP, a meta-tooling suite that provides high-level domain-specific languages for describing <b>editor</b> <b>services,</b> relieving <b>editor</b> developers from much of the framework-specific programming. <b>Editor</b> <b>services</b> are defined as composable modules of rules coupled to a modular SDF grammar. The composability provided by the SGLR parser and the declaratively defined services allows embedded languages and language extensions to be easily formulated as additional rules extending an existing language definition. The service definitions are used to generate Eclipse editor plugins. We discuss two examples: an editor plugin for WebDSL, a domain-specific language for web applications, and the embedding of WebDSL in Stratego, used for expressing the (static) semantic rules of WebDSL...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite {{considerable}} research {{dedicated to}} Semantic Web Services (SWS), structured semantics {{are still not}} used significantly to annotate Web services and APIs. This {{is due to the}} complexity of comprehensive SWS models and has led to {{the emergence of a new}} approach dubbed Linked Services. Linked Services adopt Linked Data principles to produce simplified, RDF-based service descriptions that are easier to create and interpret. However, current Linked <b>Services</b> <b>editors</b> assume the existence of services documentation in the form of HTML or WSDL files. Therefore, we introduce SmartLink, a Web-based editor and search environment for Linked Services. Based on an easy-to-use Web form and a REST-ful API, SmartLink allows both humans as well as machines to produce light-weight service descriptions from scratch...|$|R
