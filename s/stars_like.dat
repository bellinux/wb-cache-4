5|$|By the 1960s, {{the term}} {{rhythm and blues}} had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like soul music were used to {{describe}} popular music by black artists. In the 1980s, however, rhythm and blues came back into use, most often {{in the form of}} R, a usage that has continued to the present. Contemporary R arose when sultry funk singers like Prince became very popular, alongside dance-oriented pop <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Michael Jackson and Madonna.|$|E

5|$|Heavyweight boxing {{champion}} Evander Holyfield guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, appearing at the mall to help train Phineas for the big thumb wrestling match against Buford. Holyfield's guest performance was heavily expected since the original announcement of guest stars lined up for the series released in September 2007. Cast members response to working with Holyfield was highly positive; Vincent Martella and Alyson Stoner, who portray Phineas and Isabella respectively, cited working along guest <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> him as a benefit of working on the show.|$|E
5|$|Mu Arae has a listed {{spectral}} type of G3IVV. The G3 part {{means the}} star {{is similar to the}} Sun (a G2V star). The star may be entering the subgiant stage of its evolution as it starts to run out of hydrogen in its core. This is reflected in its uncertain luminosity class, between IV (the subgiants) and V (main sequence dwarf star <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> the Sun).|$|E

Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for foulings on Pelé that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.|$|E

5|$|Two {{different}} kinds of spouge were popular in the 1960s, raw spouge (Draytons Two style) and dragon spouge (Cassius Clay style). The spouge industry grew immensely {{by the end of}} the 1970s, and produced popular <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Blue Rhythm Combo, the Draytons Two and The Troubadours. Recent years has seen a resurgence of interest in spouge among some quarters, with people like Desmond Weekes of the Draytons Two indicating that spouge should be encouraged because it is a national form that can reach international audiences and inspire the nation's pride in their cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence <b>stars,</b> <b>like</b> Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> the Sun or Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E
5|$|Manne's {{father and}} uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas. He also worked {{with a number of}} musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.|$|E

5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
5|$|Virginia has {{launched}} many award-winning traditional musical artists and internationally successful popular music acts, {{as well as}} Hollywood actors. Virginia {{is known for its}} tradition in the music genres of old-time string and bluegrass, with groups such as the Carter Family and Stanley Brothers, as well as gospel, blues, and shout bands. Contemporary Virginia is also known for folk rock artists like Dave Matthews and Jason Mraz, hip hop <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Pharrell Williams and Missy Elliott, as well as thrash metal groups like GWAR and Lamb of God. Notable performance venues include The Birchmere, the Landmark Theater, and Jiffy Lube Live. Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts is located in Vienna and is the only national park intended for use as a performing arts center.|$|E

5|$|In Anurag Kashyap's period crime drama Bombay Velvet (2015), (based on the {{historian}} Gyan Prakash's book Mumbai Fables) co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Karan Johar, Sharma {{was cast in}} the role of a jazz singer, Rosie Noronha. Her character was referenced from yesteryear <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Brigitte Bardot, Helen and Waheeda Rehman. As part of her preparation, Sharma watched a lot of films of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a documentary showing the development of hair and make-up over the years. She also revealed to have used temporary lip enhancers as a part of her make up in the film, citing it as the reason behind her changed appearance on a chat show in 2014, and refuting media speculations about her having undergone plastic surgery. Bombay Velvet was screened at the Locarno and Bucheon film festivals, but critical reviews on it were mixed.|$|E
5|$|Italian pop rock has {{produced}} major <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> Zucchero, and {{has resulted in}} many top hits. The industry media, especially television, are important vehicles for such music; the television show Sabato Sera is characteristic. Italy was {{at the forefront of}} the progressive rock movement of the 1970s, a style that primarily developed in Europe but also gained audiences elsewhere in the world. It is sometimes considered a separate genre, Italian progressive rock. Italian bands such as The Trip, Area, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM), Arti e Mestieri, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, New Trolls, Goblin, Osanna, Saint Just and Le Orme incorporated a mix of symphonic rock and Italian folk music and were popular throughout Europe and the United States as well. Other progressive bands such as Perigeo, Balletto di Bronzo, Museo Rosenbach, Rovescio della Medaglia, Biglietto per l'Inferno or Alphataurus remained little known, but their albums are today considered classics by collectors. A few avant-garde rock bands or artists (Area, Picchio dal Pozzo, Opus Avantra, Stormy Six, Saint Just, Giovanni Lindo Ferretti) gained notoriety for their innovative sound. Progressive rock concerts in Italy tended to have a strong political undertone and an energetic atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective <b>stars</b> <b>like</b> this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.|$|E
