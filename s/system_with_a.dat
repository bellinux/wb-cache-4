Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E

40|$|Almost-linear systems being introduced, {{the facts}} about the systems were cleared, and it was shown that the almost-linear systems contain linear <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero initial state as a sub-class [1]. In this paper, based on the these results of almostlinear systems [1], we will discuss the {{real-time}} realization problem of linear <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero initial state, namely, we will treat the problem to obtain the systems by single-experiment. The algorithm for the problem is presented. It {{is well known that}} a usual method to obtain linear <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero initial state is solved through two problems. One is the problem to obtain linear <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> zero initial state and the other is the state estimation problem for the <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-zero initial state [2], that is usually called the observer problem. And the situation of these two problems is very rare in practice. This paper presents a new method to obtain them directly on real-time (equivalently, by a singleexperiment). Therefore, this new method is more useful and practical than usual. ...|$|R

In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E

5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal <b>system</b> (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E
