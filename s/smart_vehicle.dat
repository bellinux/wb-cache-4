25|$|The first {{efforts of}} the Kontogouris {{brothers}} involved attempts to build a light truck called Hellas in Germany. In 1957, they acquired rights to a production technology of a multi-purpose vehicle developed by Swiss engineer Dr. Wilfried Fahr. In 1961, Kontogouris created their first company (FARCO) in Thessaloniki, Greece, to produce the vehicle, called FARMOBIL, with BMW 700 flat-2 engine. Ironically, this <b>smart</b> <b>vehicle</b> was not certified for the Greek market and all production was exported to several countries around the world. In 1963, the company was acquired by Chrysler and renamed it Chrysler Hellas S.A. In 1967, production in Greece was stopped by the American company, and was transferred to other countries. Meanwhile, in 1961 ambitious plans {{were made by the}} Kontogouris Brothers for a new company (to be called NAMCO) with a new factory in Patras, Greece to produce under licence a German-designed (Neckar) three-wheeler truck and other vehicles, but were not materialized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Compared with smart spaces {{addressed}} previously, the <b>smart</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{space is}} quite special. First, unlike room, it {{is a high}} mobile space. Second, it requires frequent information exchange with the outer environment; for instance, it may need local traffic information and other local services. The complex vehicle space needs a software infrastructure of high adaptation to meet the complex and easy variational situations. This paper proposes a semantic and adaptive middleware platform, i. e., ScudWare, for <b>smart</b> <b>vehicle</b> space. In ScudWare, techniques of multiagent, context-aware, and adaptive component management are smoothly synthesized. It consists of three key components, namely 1) semantic virtual agents; 2) a semantic context management service; and 3) an adaptive component management service. This enables entities in <b>smart</b> <b>vehicle</b> space to interact autonomously, provides semantic-integration context awareness, and supports componentbased adaptability and scalability. A test bed of smart car space is built to evaluate the ScudWare, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of ScudWare.

40|$|Research in <b>Smart</b> <b>Vehicle</b> System {{has been}} {{developed}} recently. <b>Smart</b> <b>vehicle</b> system {{has a lot of}} its application nowadays like automatic vehicle locator, long distance power car control, car park sensor, road human detection, and also GPS navigation etc. The weakness of those systems are, there weren’t no notification system that will call medic and police if a car crash or emergency occur which is very helpful to save people. Therefore this final project was proposed due to completing the <b>Smart</b> <b>Vehicle</b> application from the previous research. Based on the tests and the results, this tools can detect car deceleration during ‘sudden brake’ test from 40 km/hour and 60 km/hour until stop with the maximum acceleration result at 1, 0 g for 40 km/hour to stop and 1, 31 g for 60 km/hour to stop. On the crash test the result was average on 8 g, this was because of the accelerometer range limitation. The accelerometer can only measure acceleration for +/- 6 g as its best accuration. Based on those data, if the decelerations are above 6 g then the vehicle is stated as ‘crash’. The system that have been built was complete its desire contribution to detect car crash by the rapid deceleration from accelerometer sensor with boundaries of measurement range at +/- 6 g. the emergency condition initiated by the driver by pressing push button and then the latitude and longitude will be send to the monitoring server.

40|$|With {{the wide}} spread of self driving cars, {{the need for}} safer and secure roadways became evident in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For {{flexible}} deployment of <b>smart</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the ITS, <b>smart</b> <b>vehicles</b> communicate freely with each others using ad-hoc paradigm known as Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) over a universally available pool of channels. Unfortunately, this open access to the ITS system can be exploited by hackers to fuzz the system, break into it and cause a roadway danger. In this paper, we examine the possible security threats in the ITS system due to the exploitation of the vehicles GPS system. We propose a novel driver assistant system called Detect and Defend on a Stick System (D 2 S 2) to detect and protect against GPS Spoofing attack. In order to validate the D 2 S 2 mechanism, our simulation experiments were focused on developing a mechanism to detect malicious vehicle (the 2 ̆ 2 attacker 2 ̆ 2) that would lie about its GPS coordinates and defending the target vehicle (the 2 ̆ 2 victim 2 ̆ 2) from taking potentially dangerous evasive maneuvers. The victim vehicles defense system is observed under both normal non-attack and attack circumstances and positive results are obtained...|$|R
