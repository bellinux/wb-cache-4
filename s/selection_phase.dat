5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial. Scientific jury selection is used during the jury <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> of the trial—when lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors and they and the judge choose which people will be on the jury. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.|$|E

25|$|Coutts {{describes}} dreams {{as playing}} {{a central role}} in a two-phase sleep process that improves the mind's ability to meet human needs during wakefulness. During the accommodation phase, mental schemas self-modify by incorporating dream themes. During the emotional <b>selection</b> <b>phase,</b> dreams test prior schema accommodations. Those that appear adaptive are retained, while those that appear maladaptive are culled. The cycle maps to the sleep cycle, repeating several times during a typical night's sleep. Alfred Adler suggested that dreams are often emotional preparations for solving problems, intoxicating an individual away from common sense toward private logic. The residual dream feelings may either reinforce or inhibit contemplated action.|$|E

2500|$|Women {{began to}} apply for combat support and light combat roles in the Artillery Corps, {{infantry}} units and armored divisions.

Many Israeli women were accepted to the pilot <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> in the Israeli Air Force flight academy some completed it successfully. The first female jet fighter pilot, Roni Zuckerman, received her wings in 2001. By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers. [...] When the Second Lebanon War broke out, women took part in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action. In November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander.|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 1995, {{while she}} was a student of {{aeronautics}} at the Technion {{as part of the}} academic reserve, Alice Miller appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after being turned down for the pilot <b>selection</b> <b>phase</b> in the Israeli Air Force flight academy. Following her appeal, Israeli president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, made chauvinistic comments that ridiculed the idea of women as fighter pilots: [...] "Listen maideleh, {{have you ever seen a}} man knitting socks? Have you ever seen a female surgeon or a female being a conductor of an orchestra? Women are not able to withstand the pressures required for fighter pilots." [...] The Israeli Supreme Court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller did not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in the IDF. Following the petition, formerly all-male military units began accepting women, including the Israeli Air Force flight academy, the Israeli navy officers' course, various artillery courses, the Israeli air defense [...] and the Israeli Border Police. The Equality Amendment to the Military Service law, enacted in January 2000, completed the Supreme Court ruling as it defined the right of female soldiers to volunteer for combat professions. This law stated that [...] "The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men." [...] The amendment drafted by female lawmakers granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was [...] "suitable" [...] was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

40|$|The <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is an {{important}} of a SAT Solver based on conflict-driven DPLL. This paper presents a new <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> strategy, in which the weight of each literal {{is defined as the}} sum of its implied-literals static weights. The implied literals of each literal is computed dynamically during the search. Therefore, it is call a dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> strategy. In general, computing dynamically a weight is time-consuming. Hence, so far no SAT solver applies successfully a dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection.</b> Since the implied literal of our strategy conforms to that of the search process, the usual two watched-literals scheme can be applied here. Thus, the cost of our dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is very low. To improve Glucose 2. 0 which won a Gold Medal for application category at SAT 2011 competition, we build five <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> schemes using the dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> policy. On application instances of SAT 2011, Glucose improved by the dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> is significantly better than the original Glucose.

40|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>selection</b> is {{the process}} of {{customizing}} the applied set of compiler optimization phases for individual functions or programs to improve performance of generated code. Researchers have re-cently developed novel feature-vector based heuristic techniques to perform <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> during online JIT compilation. While these heuristics improve program startup speed, steady-state per-formance was not seen to benefit over the default fixed single se-quence baseline. Unfortunately, it is still not conclusively known whether this lack of steady-state performance gain is due to a fail-ure of existing online <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> heuristics, or because there is, indeed, little or no speedup to be gained by <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> in online JIT environments. The goal of this work is to resolve this question, while examining the <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> related behavior of optimizations, and assessing and improving the effectiveness of ex-isting heuristic solutions. We conduct experiments to find and understand the potency of the factors that can cause the <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> problem in JIT compilers. Next, using long-running genetic algorithms we deter-mine that program-wide and method-specific <b>phase</b> <b>selection</b> in the HotSpot JIT compiler can produce ideal steady-state performance gains of up to 15 % (4. 3 % average) and 44 % (6. 2 % average) respec-tively. We also find that existing state-of-the-art heuristic solutions are unable to realize these performance gains (in our experimental setup), discuss possible causes, and show that exploiting knowl-edge of optimization phase behavior can help improve such heuris-tic solutions. Our work develops a robust open-source production-quality framework using the HotSpot JVM to further explore this problem in the future...|$|R
