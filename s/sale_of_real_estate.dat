The Task Force was divided on the effect of mortgage insurance on profit recognition. [Note: A consensus on the effect of mortgage insurance was subsequently reached under another Issue.

Firstly, we present the field <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> in Slovenia and baseline research based on an international research analysis.

General hypothesis H 1, states {{that there is a}} correlation between the number <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> residential properties in 2015 and sociological characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> broker (gender, age). Confirmation or rejection of the hypothesis and answers to researched questions were based on a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was sent on the 17 th and the 25 th of April as well as on May 6 th 2016. I’ve received 106 responses of respondents. The research shows that I cannot confirm nor reject the general hypothesis H 1. Based on χ 2 test dependencies among the factors considered, I confirmed that there is a statistically significant correlation between the number <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estates</b> and gender <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> agent, but no statistically significant correlation was found between the number <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>real</b> <b>estates</b> and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> agent’s age.
