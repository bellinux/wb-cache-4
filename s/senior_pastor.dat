40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study {{invitation}} and succession cases of <b>senior</b> <b>pastors</b> in Korean churches. This thesis is written as Korean churches are currently facing major issues concerning the succession of <b>senior</b> <b>pastors</b> from the first generation to the second generation. The study deals with the biblical backgrounds and theological foundations of the Old and New Testament in relation to pastoral succession. It also compares and analyzes various pieces of data. The investigation of the invitation types is designed to contribute toward discovering {{what may be the}} most desirable invitation system for <b>senior</b> <b>pastors.</b> Surveys were distributed to gather data about the invitation and succession of <b>senior</b> <b>pastors</b> in ten Korean churches. The surveys specifically collected information on the categories of invitation, public announcement, and (nepotistic) succession. Solutions for the future of changes in senior pastoral leadership in Korean churches are provided through comparison, analyses, and research. In Korean churches, there are very few cases in which assistant <b>pastors</b> become <b>senior</b> <b>pastors</b> in the same church due to restrictions that are put in place, creating limitations on potential candidates for succession. This study attempts to find a plausible safety system that may prevent negative effects of such cases. This thesis contains the case of this writer, who succeeded the retiring pastor in the same church, and concludes with a solution for the issue of succession in Korean churches...|$|R
