40|$|Many waste {{collection}} operations {{run on the}} traditional fixed round - fixed time service, where commercial and domestic customers have their bins serviced at agreed intervals. With remote sensing technology now coming onto the market that allows waste receptacles to report their fill levels at regular intervals (e. g. daily), there is the opportunity for dynamic optimisation of collection schedules to better meet their true servicing needs. This paper investigates this possibility using a case study involving collections of donated goods (e. g. clothing, books) from Oxfam charity banks and shops. Oxfam operates a network of around 1300 donation banks across the UK, currently serviced on a fixed <b>schedule</b> <b>basis,</b> and there is considerable interest in the transport cost reductions that could be realised through optimising collections using real-time feedback on donation rates (a dynamic and heterogeneous variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with time windows, working time restrictions and customer selection). The case study is based on one of Oxfam’s 33 defined operating areas in the UK comprising collections from 37 bank sites and 50 shops...|$|R
40|$|Effectiveness of two {{chemical}} {{approaches in}} controlling brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal.) {{and their impact}} on the predator carabid beetle, Ophionea indica (Thunberg) were evaluated at Bangladesh Agricultural University during aman season. Carbofuran (Brifer 5 G) was applied in Need Based Control (NBC), as judged by periodic monitoring on the level of the pest population and recommended economic thresholds. Schedule Based Control (SBC) consist of application of carbofuran (Brifer 5 G) and monocrotophos (Azodrin 40 WSC) on a <b>schedule</b> <b>basis.</b> Mean number of brown planthoppers and the carabid beetles were compared in different control approaches including the natural control, where no insecticide was applied and the control was largely by the activities of naturally occurring predators. In natural control approach a high level of predatory carabid beetle was found in the field compared to the need based and schedule based protection. The population of carabid beetle fluctuated quite synchronously with the density of brown planthopper. The carabid beetle, O. Indica was found to keep the brown planthopper population down to a considerable level when chemical insecticide was not applied...|$|R
2500|$|In 1977, BIA {{applied to}} the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to serve Dublin, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Zürich and Geneva from Gatwick on a regular, year-round <b>scheduled</b> <b>basis.</b> (At that time British Airways, British Caledonian and Dan-Air applied to serve these and other {{destinations}} from Gatwick on a regular <b>scheduled</b> <b>basis</b> as well.) In support of its application, BIA had proposed to begin operating these services with three 65-seater Fokker F-28 1000 series [...] "Fellowship" [...] jet aircraft, which it was planning to acquire second-hand from Germanair, rather than the larger BAC One-Eleven 500s its rivals had planned to use on their services. These had almost twice the seating capacity of the Fokker jets. Using smaller aircraft would have enabled BIA to offer more frequent flights, thereby offering a more attractive product for the business travel market. BIA reckoned that this would improve its chances of being awarded these licences.|$|E

30|$|Electric power {{utilities}} {{around the}} globe witnessing whole modernization and rebuilding lately, because of the developing smart grid innovations [3]. One of the real strengths driving this pattern is the combination of renewable energy technologies (RET) into power generation. Unit commitment (UC) is a traditional problem in the electric network which empowers effective asset planning at least cost, yet fulfilling all the network and system constraints [4]. Renewable energy joining with the current customary fossil fuel plants has prompted revolutions in the power sector [5] in heading towards sustainable development. Wind energy asset with high penetration was planned along thermal units to cut down emissions [6]. Lately, backed by the cost effective manufacturing process and fiscal policy implications around the world, solar photovoltaic energy was also considered on short-term <b>scheduling</b> <b>basis</b> [7]. Because {{of the way that}} renewable energy brings in instability into the framework, it is essential to consider the reliability before incorporating them into the framework. In the UCP with strict limitations like load fulfilment and other reliability issues (system reserve, stability and regulation, etc.) handling the uncertainty through either accurate forecasting methods or suppressing the variability by employing storage technologies is a key prospect [8].|$|R
40|$|Empoasca terminalis Dist. (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) {{is a new}} but {{increasingly}} important pest of soybean in South Sulawesi province of Indonesia. Farmers are dependent mostly upon insecticide use for {{the control of the}} leafhopper. Insecticide is applied on a <b>schedule</b> <b>basis,</b> usually once in 2 - 3 days and {{not on the basis of}} action thresholds. Action threshold is used to prevent over-treatment and under-treatment of the intended crops. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to determine the action thresholds of E. terminalis on two varieties with different levels of resistance to the insect: Mahameru (susceptible) and Gepak Kuning (resistant). Besides that, it was also sought to know the number of insecticide applications required for each action threshold on each variety. Results showed that the action thresholds of E. terminalis were 10 and 5 nymphs per 16 leaves for resistant and susceptible cultivars, respectively. On Mahameru and Gepak Kuning the numbers of insecticide applications necessary to maintain the action thresholds were 5 - 7 and 1 - 2 times during the season, respectively. Therefore, total number of insecticide applications based on the action thresholds can be reduced substantially in comparison with the farmers practice which is one application for every 2 - 3 days or up to 16 applications during the season...|$|R

In IEEE 802. 16 standard has added these services and called them as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR). Both of these services designed for real time and non real time traffic.

40|$|A {{design study}} was {{completed}} {{to explore the}} theoretical physical capacity (TPC) of the John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK) runway system for a northflow configuration assuming impedance-free (to throughput) air traffic control functionality. Individual runways were modeled using an agent-based, airspace simulation tool, the Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES), with all runways conducting both departures and arrivals on a first-come first-served (FCFS) <b>scheduling</b> <b>basis.</b> A realistic future flight schedule was expanded to 3. 5 times the traffic level of a selected baseline day, September 26, 2006, to provide a steady overdemand state for KJFK runways. Rules constraining departure and arrival operations were defined to reflect physical limits beyond which safe operations {{could no longer be}} assumed. Safety buffers to account for all sources of operational variability {{were not included in the}} TPC estimate. Visual approaches were assumed for all arrivals to minimize inter-arrival spacing. Parallel runway operations were assumed to be independent based on lateral spacing distances. Resulting time intervals between successive airport operations were primarily constrained by same-runway and then by intersecting-runway spacing requirements. The resulting physical runway capacity approximates a theoretical limit that cannot be exceeded without modifying runway interaction assumptions. Comparison with current KJFK operational limits for a north-flow runway configuration indicates a substantial throughput gap of approximately 48 %. This gap may be further analyzed to determine which part may be feasibly bridged through the deployment of advanced systems and procedures, and which part cannot, because it is either impossible or not cost-effective to control. Advanced systems for bridging the throughput gap may be conceptualized and simulated using this same experimental setup to estimate the level of gap closure achieved...|$|R
