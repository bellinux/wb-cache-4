5|$|Finally, to keep Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{distracted from}} Danny's fanfare, TGS producer, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) sends {{them to the}} makeup {{department}} to have plaster face-prints made while NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) talks to them. Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake. This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E
5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
5|$|Modern DST {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> {{a large part of}} a summer day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.|$|E

25|$|In all, 1,663 {{passengers}} and crew had been rescued from Andrea Doria. The badly damaged Stockholm, {{through the use of}} both her own lifeboats and those from the stricken Andrea Doria, took on a total of 545 survivors, of whom 234 were crew members from the Andrea Doria; 129 survivors had been rescued by Cape Ann, 159 by Pvt. William H. Thomas, 77 by Edward H. Allen, including Captain Calamai and his officers, and one very fortunate American sailor who <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the entire collision and evacuation had been lucky enough to be rescued from the abandoned, sinking liner by the tanker Robert E. Hopkins. Île de France undoubtedly played the largest role in the rescue, having taken on a total of 753 survivors.|$|E

500|$|Until then, Peel {{had been}} {{ineffective}} in the match. Several of the England team, including Peel, drank {{heavily in the}} night thinking the game was lost, but overnight rain drastically {{changed the nature of}} the pitch. Peel had not sobered up when play was scheduled to start, although Stoddart had given him a cold shower to speed up the process, and arrived late. As another player was also missing, the start was delayed; this allowed the pitch to dry further and therefore become more sticky and difficult to bat on. Peel had <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the overnight storm and was astonished when he saw the state of the pitch, suspecting someone had watered it. He reportedly said: [...] "Gi' me t'ball, Mr Stoddart. Ah'll get t'buggers out before lunch". With Briggs, Peel bowled Australia out, taking five wickets to go with the one he took the previous evening to finish with six for 67. Australia scored 166 and lost by ten runs. One Australian newspaper reported that Peel [...] "found the match rather a trying one, and came in fairly done up". The English team were praised for fighting back, but the role of the weather was acknowledged, and some critics blamed the Australians for batting badly in the second innings.|$|E

He held a towel over his face as paramedics removed him to an ambulance. He was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital, and the hearing was adjourned for the day.

However, both Patsy and John Ramsey said they did not remember putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBenét. Police reported that they found JonBenét's nine-year-old brother Burke Ramsey's fingerprints on the bowl. The Ramseys have always maintained that Burke <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the entire episode until he was awakened several hours after the police arrived.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most famous}} part of Goldberg's {{life is the}} portion, {{probably}} in 1741, recounted by J.S. Bach's biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel, which involved the composition {{of a set of}} variations by Bach as a soporific to help the insomniac Count Keyserlingk fall asleep. Keyserlingk's favorite chamber harpsichordist was the 14-year-old Goldberg, whose technical accomplishments were so spectacular that they made it possible for him to perform a work of such extraordinary difficulty. Whether the count actually <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> performances of the piece is not recorded, but he did indicate that Bach's composition was a great favorite of his. According to Forkel, writing in 1802, sixty years after the event: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January 1839, Charles married Emma at Maer, Staffordshire in an Anglican {{ceremony}} {{arranged to}} also suit the Unitarians, {{conducted by the}} vicar, their cousin John Allen Wedgwood.

Immediately afterwards Charles and Emma rushed off to the railway station, raising their relative's eyebrows, and ate their sandwiches and toasted their future from a [...] "bottle of water" [...] on the train.

2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} Muncie [...] "was gifted with size, speed and power", while The Miami News said he possessed the {{strength}} of a fullback and the elegance of a halfback. U-T San Diego added that he was [...] "widely considered the most talented running back of his era", and the San Francisco Chronicle said Muncie [...] "could have been the greatest running back in NFL history, a 2.0 version of Jim Brown" [...] if he had the discipline of running backs like Walter Payton or Roger Craig. [...] "His head is the only thing holding him back", said Jim Brown. [...] "If he had total dedication, he could achieve any goal." [...] While he was in New Orleans, he frequently <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> meetings whenever he attended them at all. Whenever the Saints broke the huddle, quarterback Archie Manning had to walk by Muncie and tell him exactly what he was supposed to do in the upcoming play. Manning recalled years later that it was obvious that Muncie [...] "wasn't thinking about football" [...] during the week.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a certain}} {{constraint}} at the breakfast table. Mr. Fox had heard the serenades, although his consort had <b>slept</b> soundly <b>through</b> the turmoil; and, while carefully avoiding any reference to the incidents of the night, he was anxiously hoping that somebody would say something about them. Mrs. Easterfield saw that Mr. Du Brant was in a bad humor, and she hoped he was angry enough to announce his early departure. But he contented himself with being angry, and said nothing about going away.|$|R
2500|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} tracks on Prayers on Fire were written or co-written by Cave, [...] " [...] {{was a kind of}} {{reaction}} to the major disappointments we felt when we went to England... began to see a vision and I don't think we were positively influenced ... we didn't want to be like the English New Wave pop groups of the time". Pew observed [...] " [...] stinks, quite honestly ... The engineer <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the entire session for a start". In Melbourne, in December 1980 and January 1981, they joined engineer and producer, Tony Cohen, in Armstrong's Audio Visual Studios (A.A.V. Studio 2) and Richmond Recorders, to record their tracks. Music journalist, Toby Creswell, noted that the band [...] "struggled with creating their own identity some of them also began indulging an appetite for alcohol and heroin". Cave was embarrassed by [...] "Zoo Music Girl" [...] but noted [...] "we were digging for something and we kind of just found it with some songs" [...] and cited [...] "King Ink" [...] as an example of [...] "a certain kind of sound that we wanted to work with on records after that".|$|E
2500|$|Dulness {{takes her}} throne, and Pope {{describes}} the allegorical tableau of her throne room. Science is chained beneath her foot-stool. Logic is gagged and bound. Wit has been exiled from her kingdom entirely. Rhetoric is stripped {{on the ground}} and tied by sophism. Morality is dressed in a gown that is bound by two cords, of furs (the ermines of judges) and lawn (the fabric of bishops sleeves), and at a nod from Dulness, her [...] "page" [...] (a notorious hanging judge named Page who had had over one hundred people executed) pulls both cords tight and strangles her. The Muses are bound in tenfold chains and guarded by Flattery and Envy. Only mathematics is free, because it is too insane to be bound. Nor, Pope says, could Chesterfield refrain from weeping upon seeing the sight (for Chesterfield had opposed the Licensing Act of 1737, which is the chaining of the Muses). Colley Cibber, however, slumbers, his head in Dulness's lap. (In a note, Pope says that it is proper for Cibber to sleep through the whole of Book IV, as he had had no part in the actions of book II, <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> book III, and therefore ought to go on sleeping.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually <b>slept</b> <b>through</b> the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E

50|$|Theseus tells Amyntor {{that the}} King is dying, {{but he is}} {{surprised}} that no noise has been made about the dead king yet. When they have their bull dance that day, Herakles has seemingly gone mad and almost kills Theseus before falling dead. With the King dead, Asterion needed more money to buy troops to take power, so he drugged the bull and bet on Theseus to die, at great odds. They swear they will have vengeance. Theseus feels strange before falling asleep, later finding out that he <b>slept</b> right <b>through</b> an earthquake.|$|R
60|$|As {{one story}} of the kind {{produces}} another, and as all the company seemed fully engrossed by the topic, and disposed to bring their relatives and ancestors upon the scene, there is no knowing how many more ghost adventures we might have heard, had not a corpulent old fox-hunter, who had <b>slept</b> soundly <b>through</b> the whole, now suddenly awakened, with a loud and long-drawn yawn.
