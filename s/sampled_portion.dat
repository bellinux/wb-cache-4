The development is performed for sensors that integrate time-domain information to provide a single data point (standard metal detector), those that provide a <b>sampled</b> <b>portion</b> of the time-domain waveform, and those that operate at several discrete frequencies. This approach is compared to standard thresholding techniques, and it is shown to provide substantial improvements when evaluated on measured data.

40|$|Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular, {{iterative}} algorithm for computing {{strategies in}} extensive-form games. The Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) variants reduce the per iteration time cost of CFR by traversing a smaller, <b>sampled</b> <b>portion</b> of the tree. The previous most effective instances of MCCFR {{can still be}} very slow in games with many player actions since they sample every action for a given player. In this paper, we present a new MCCFR algorithm, Average Strategy Sampling (AS), that samples {{a subset of the}} player’s actions according to the player’s average strategy. Our new algorithm is inspired by a new, tighter bound on the number of iterations required by CFR to converge to a given solution quality. In addition, we prove a similar, tighter bound for AS and other popular MCCFR variants. Finally, we validate our work by demonstrating that AS converges faster than previous MCCFR algorithms in both no-limit poker and Bluff. ...|$|E
40|$|In large {{extensive}} form {{games with}} imperfect information, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular, iterative algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria. While the base algorithm performs a full tree traversal on each iteration, Monte Carlo CFR (MCCFR) reduces the per iteration time cost by traversing just a <b>sampled</b> <b>portion</b> of the tree. On the other hand, MCCFR’s sampled values introduce variance, {{and the effects}} of this variance were previously unknown. In this paper, we generalize MCCFR by considering any generic estimator of the sought values. We show that any choice of an estimator can be used to probabilistically minimize regret, provided the estimator is bounded and unbiased. In addition, we relate the variance of the estimator to the convergence rate of an algorithm that calculates regret directly from the estimator. We demonstrate the application of our analysis by defining a new bounded, unbiased estimator with empirically lower variance than MCCFR estimates. Finally, we use this estimator in a new sampling algorithm to compute approximate equilibria in Goofspiel, Bluff, and Texas hold’em poker. Under each of our selected sampling schemes, our new algorithm converges faster than MCCFR...|$|E

40|$|Pebble counts {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used field methods to assess the size distribution of bed surface sediment in gravel-bed and cobble-bed streams. Although the term ‘‘pebble count’ ’ is in widespread use, there is no standardized methodology used for the field application of this procedure. Each pebble count analysis is the product of several methodological choices, any of which are capable of influencing the final result. Pebble counts have nine individual components: 1. Length of the sampling reach. 2. Sampling scheme (spatially integrated over the reach or segregated into different units). 3. Sampling pattern (transects, small-scale grids, or random). 4. <b>Sampled</b> <b>portion</b> of stream width. 5. Spacing and number of particles collected per transect. 6. Sample size per reach. 7. Identifying the particles to be extracted. 8. Measuring particle size. 9. Particle-size analyses. For each component, there are several methodological options illustrated in figure 1. For example, the component “particle-size determination ” includes the options of measuring the particle b-axis with a ruler, visually estimating the particle b-axis size class, or passing a particle through a gravelometer template. Because there are virtually countless variations on pebble count protocols, the question of how results differ when applied to the same study reach is important. The overarching aim of this study is to raise awareness of the fact that selection of different methodological options can have notable consequences on the results. To demonstrate some of these cause-and-effect connections, we examined the procedures and results of three pebble count protocols on two mountain, gravel-bed streams. Methods This study compares two wellknown pebble count protocols and one rigorous pebble count protocol in two mountain gravel-bed streams i...|$|E
40|$|Although silicic rocks (i. e. granites and rhyolites) {{comprise}} a minor {{component of the}} <b>sampled</b> <b>portion</b> of the lunar crust, recent remote sensing studies [e. g., 1 - 4] indicate that several un-sampled regions of the Moon have significantly higher concentrations of silicic material (also high in [K], [U], and [Th]) than sampled regions. Within these areas are morphological features that are best explained by the existence of chemically evolved volcanic rocks. Observations of silicic domes [e. g., 1 - 5] suggest that sizable networks of silicic melt were present during crust formation. Isotopic data indicate that silicic melts were generated over a prolonged timespan from 4. 3 to 3. 9 Ga [e. g., 6 - 8]. The protracted age range and broad distribution of silicic rocks on the Moon indicate that their petrogenesis was an important mechanism for secondary crust formation. Understanding the origin and evolution of such silicic magmas is critical to determining {{the composition of the}} lunar crustal highlands and will help to distinguish between opposing ideas for the Moon's bulk composition and differentiation. The two main hypotheses for generating silicic melts on Earth are fractional crystallization or partial melting. On the Moon silicic melts are thought to have been generated during extreme fractional crystallization involving end-stage silicate liquid immiscibility (SLI) [e. g. 9, 10]. However, SLI cannot account for the production of significant volumes of silicic melt and its wide distribution, as reported by the remote global surveys [1, 2, 3]. In addition, experimental and natural products of SLI show that U and Th, which are abundant in the lunar granites and seen in the remote sensing data of the domes, are preferentially partitioned into the depolymerized ferrobasaltic magma and not the silicic portion [11, 12]. If SLI is not the mechanism that generated silicic magmas on the Moon then alternative processes such as fractional crystallization (only crystal-liquid separation) or partial melting should be considered as viable possibilities to be tested...|$|E
40|$|The Kori No. 1, {{which began}} {{operation}} in 1978, replaced its cask handling crane in 2000. To prove {{the safety of}} recycling and reuse of crane scrap, a particular calculation method for surface contamination was used. Because surface radioactive contamination of steel {{is limited to a}} few-microns-thick layer, we can calculate the total(removable and fixed contamination) activity of the sample conservatively by this surface removal sampling means. If we multiply the ratio of total surface and the area of the selected surface by its activity, total activity of the scrap can be estimated. Conservatively, the <b>sampled</b> <b>portion</b> {{can be used as a}} representative sample of the scrap. Both the inner and outer part of the scrap was sampled separately, and gamma spectra were analyzed to check whether activation had occurred. Before sampling, the entire surface of the steel is scan surveyed by several kinds of GM and GP detectors. Contaminated parts were segregated, or decontaminated to the background. Almost one sample per one ton of steel was collected. Gamma spectra of 62 samples were analyzed by 100 % efficiency HP Ge detector. Only 60 Co was detected, and its highest activity was 0. 01 Bq/g,. This level of activity is much lower than the ''clearance levels'' outlined in IAEA TecDoc- 855. (4). The total alpha and total beta for 6 samples were measured in the laboratory by low background alpha, using a beta gas proportional counter. Activities were much lower than 0. 005 Bq/g. A representative sample was taken from the complete mixture of 62 samples. Gamma activities of nuclides were measured to estimate the dose to the public. This study revealed that activities of nuclides were lower than 'clearance levels' if decontaminated until the lower limit of detection level of the portable field instrument. New surface removal sampling method was tested. This method allows us to easily calculate the specific activity for the solid material...|$|E
