2500|$|Another {{inspiration}} {{for much of}} Copland's music was jazz. Although familiar with jazz back in America—having listened to it and also played it in bands—he fully realized its potential while traveling in Austria: [...] "The impression of jazz one receives {{in a foreign country}} is totally unlike the impression of such music heard in one's own country... when I heard jazz played in Vienna, it was like hearing it for the first time." [...] He also found that the distance from his native country helped him <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States more clearly. Beginning in 1923, he employed [...] "jazzy elements" [...] in his classical music, but by the late 1930s, he moved on to Latin and American folk tunes in his more successful pieces. Although his early focus of jazz gave way to other influences, Copland continued to make use of jazz in more subtle ways in later works.|$|E

2500|$|Fernós {{argued that}} the Commonwealth realm {{relationship}} between Canada and the United Kingdom surpassed a simple form of autonomy, instead being a kind of association superior to any status that would keep the sovereignty of Puerto Rico {{in the hands of}} Congress. He considered his proposal a [...] "free federated commonwealth" [...] and a [...] "republic lacking international relations", which would be freely delegated to the Federal Government of the United States. Among other observations, Fernós also [...] noted how ridiculous it was to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Congress hold the sovereignty of Puerto Rico when it wasn't the sovereign of the United States or its people and only served {{as a representative of the}} popular vote. He ultimately condemned the idea of a status where sovereignty was forfeit in favor of autonomy, comparing such an arrangement to a monarchy. The following year, Fernós analyzed the complications of directly transitioning from the colonial economic model established by the United States and listed what he considered could be possible steps for a prosperous sovereignty. On July 21, 1940, the founding assembly for the new party was held with the collaboration of 2,000 delegates. Fernós, who thought that the socio-economic issues should be attended first, was largely responsible for drafting the respective part of the party's program, being joined by Vicente Géigel Polanco and Rafael Arjona Siaca.|$|E
