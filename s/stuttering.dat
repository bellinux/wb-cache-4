5|$|<b>Stuttering</b> (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of <b>stuttering</b> is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the validity of real-time measurement of percent syllables <b>stuttered</b> (%SS), and whether slowing down the rate of presentation of recorded speech samples, or independent measurement {{of the number of}} <b>stutters</b> and the number of syllables improved this validity. Method: Eight speech–language pathologists (SLPs) measured %SS from 16 × 3 -minute audio samples of <b>stuttered</b> speech, presented in the following ways: (1) concurrently counting <b>stutters</b> and syllables at original speed, (2) concurrently counting <b>stutters</b> and syllables with the speed of presentation slowed by about a third, (3) independently counting <b>stutters</b> and syllables at original speed, or (4) independently counting <b>stutters</b> and syllables at reduced speed. All measures were compared with previously determined ‘expert consensus’ values. SLPs also rated each method for ease of use. Results: Results showed {{no significant difference between the}} expert consensus measures and any of the measurement methods in terms of validity or reliability, despite SLPs generally finding the modified methods easier to use. Conclusions: Neither slowing down the rate of presentation nor counting <b>stutters</b> and syllables independently improved the validity or reliability of real-time measurement of %SS by SLPs. 10 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Sigi Schmid {{was born}} in Tübingen, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved {{with his family to}} the United States; they took up {{residence}} in Torrance, California, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a prisoner of war during World War II, worked at Pabst Brewing; his mother, Doris, ran a Los Angeles-based German deli, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making him feel German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a <b>stuttering</b> speech disorder he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching Bundesliga clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for the inaugural American Youth Soccer Organization team, an achievement for which he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his <b>stuttering,</b> he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

40|$|The PCR {{amplification}} of tetranucleotide short {{tandem repeat}} (STR) loci typically produces a minor product band 4 bp {{shorter than the}} corresponding main allele band; this {{is referred to as}} the <b>stutter</b> band. Sequence analysis of the main and <b>stutter</b> bands for two sample alleles of the STR locus vWA reveals that the <b>stutter</b> band lacks one repeat unit relative to the main allele. Sequencing results also indicate that the number and location of the different 4 bp repeat units vary between samples containing a typical verses low proportion of <b>stutter</b> product. The results also suggest that the proportion of <b>stutter</b> product relative to the main allele increases as the number of uninterrupted core repeat units increases. The sequence analysis and results obtained using various DNA polymerases appear to support the slipped strand displacement model as a potential explanation for how these <b>stutter</b> products are generated...|$|R

25|$|There is {{evidence}} of differences in linguistic processing between people who <b>stutter</b> and {{people who do not}} <b>stutter.</b> Brain scans of adult people who <b>stutter</b> have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.|$|R
25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for <b>stuttering,</b> several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize <b>stuttering</b> through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some <b>stuttering</b> therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited {{as a result of}} <b>stuttering,</b> and consequently exacerbates <b>stuttering</b> symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact <b>stuttering</b> can have on the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} the present study was to extend {{previous}} research by analyzing the ability of adults who <b>stutter</b> to use phonological working memory in conjunction with lexical access to perform a word jumble task. Method Forty English words consisting of 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -letters (n = 10 per letter length category) were randomly jumbled using a web-based application. During the experimental task, 26 participants were asked to silently manipulate the scrambled letters to form a real word. Each vocal response was coded for accuracy and speech reaction time (SRT). Results Adults who <b>stutter</b> attempted to solve fewer word jumble stimuli than adults who do not <b>stutter</b> at the 4 -letter, 5 -letter, and 6 -letter lengths. Additionally, adults who <b>stutter</b> were significantly less accurate solving word jumble tasks at the 4 -letter, 5 -letter, and 6 -letter lengths compared to adults who do not <b>stutter.</b> At the longest word length (6 -letter), SRT was significantly slower for the adults who <b>stutter</b> than the fluent controls. Conclusion Results of the current study lend further support to the notion that differences in various aspects of phonological processing, including vision-to-sound conversions, sub-vocal stimulus manipulation, and/or lexical access are compromised in adults who <b>stutter...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Post-transplantation chimerism {{testing is}} {{important}} to monitor the engraftment of donor stem cells and for the diagnosis of relapse. Detecting the presence of donor/recipient-specific short tandem repeats (STRs) is a frequently used method for engraftment study. Unfortunately, {{the interpretation of the}} STR-based chimerism tests is often subject to interference by the presence of a <b>stutter</b> peak, which is one 4 -base repeat unit smaller than an authentic allele. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically analyze and resolve the effect of <b>stutter</b> peaks on the interpretation of STR-based chimerism tests. The AmpFlSTR Identifiler Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to amplify 15 STR loci using genomic DNA from 30 randomly selected, healthy donors. We found that the <b>stutter</b> peaks had locus-specific characteristics. The <b>stutter</b> percentage was defined as the percentage of the <b>stutter</b> peak area/main STR peak area. Based on mean values for the 30 DNA samples, the <b>stutter</b> percentage varied from locus to locus and ranged from 3. 12 % to 10. 71 % for 15 STR loci. The locus-specific <b>stutter</b> effect can be eliminated through appropriately adjusted equations. The usefulness of these equations in the prediction of relapse was confirmed by the 5 % sensitivity test. Hence, this report offers a valuable scheme to enhance the accuracy of chimerism testing...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} posited that the longest {{uninterrupted}} stretch (LUS) of tandem repeats, {{as defined by}} the number of exactly matching repeating motif units, is a better predictor of rates of <b>stutter</b> than the parental allele length (PAL). While there are cases where this hypothesis is likely correct, such as the 9. 3 allele in the TH 01 locus, there can be situations where it may not apply as well. For example, the PAL may capture flanking indel variations while remaining insensitive to polymorphisms in the repeat, and these haplotypic changes may impact the <b>stutter</b> rate. To address this, rates of <b>stutter</b> were contrasted against the LUS as well as the PAL on different flanking haplotypic backgrounds. This study shows that rates of <b>stutter</b> can vary substantially depending on the flanking haplotype, and while there are cases where the LUS is a better predictor of <b>stutter</b> than the PAL, examples to the contrary are apparent in commonly assayed forensic markers. Further, flanking variation that is 7 bp from the repeat region can impact rates of <b>stutter.</b> These findings suggest that non-proximal effects, such as DNA secondary structure, may be impacting the rates of <b>stutter</b> in common forensic short tandem repeat markers...|$|R
25|$|<b>Stuttering</b> is {{generally}} not {{a problem with the}} physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress do not cause <b>stuttering,</b> but they can trigger <b>stuttering</b> in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger <b>stuttering</b> in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem {{in the manner of a}} positive feedback system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition. Neither acute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to <b>stuttering.</b>|$|E
25|$|No single, {{exclusive}} {{cause of}} developmental <b>stuttering</b> is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple {{factors contributing to}} <b>stuttering.</b> Among these is the strong evidence that <b>stuttering</b> has a genetic basis. Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are {{three times as likely}} to develop a stutter. However, twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for <b>stuttering</b> to occur, and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stuttering</b> is {{typically}} a developmental disorder beginning {{in early childhood}} and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children. The mean onset of <b>stuttering</b> is 30 months. Although there is variability, early <b>stuttering</b> behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent. Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech. With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of <b>stuttering</b> are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.|$|E
