50|$|Pressure {{regulators}} limit excessive and varying inlet {{pressures to}} a constant outlet pressure. This {{is done to}} maintain the desired performance of a <b>sprinkling</b> <b>device.</b> They accomplish this by automatically modulating their area of opening. By changing the area of opening as upstream pressures fluctuate, pressure loss through the regulator changes proportionally. This allows them to maintain the downstream pressure at a relative constant.|$|E
50|$|In 1869, Frederick Grinnell, a Massachusetts-born engineer, {{purchased}} a controlling interest in Providence Steam and Gas and became its president. Fire protection {{was a new}} science in this time period and depended on manually turning on the sprinklers. In 1874, Henry S. Parmelee of New Haven, Connecticut, patented an automatic <b>sprinkling</b> <b>device,</b> and four years later the Providence Steam and Gas Pipe Co. secured the right to manufacture and install it, paying royalties to the inventor. In 1881, Grinnell patented an improved, more sensitive sprinkling system.|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the new plant protection methods is strongly related to the {{rapid development}} of the technical realization means. Hence {{it is necessary to}} perform an integration of the research works in the domain of the agro-pharmaceutical products and also in the domain of the <b>sprinkling</b> <b>devices</b> and machines. The diversity of <b>sprinkling</b> <b>devices</b> and machinery, the physical-chemical features of the pesticides, of the pathogens, require particularly pretentious endeavor regarding the preparation, the applying and the evaluation of each treatment. The applying quality consists in assuring a certain commercial product dose (active substance) per surface unit. The assurance of the phyto-sanitary product dose per surface unit and of the solution repartition uniformity (the quality working indices) – the principal conditions for the realization of a treatment - depend on respecting the solution norm, its concentration and the constructive and functional parameters of the sprinkling machinery’s active organs...|$|R
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the {{experimental}} SM prototypes with watering in circular motion (the fluid-power-driven and electrically-driven ones) under the complex soil-relief conditions. The mathematical simulators {{for the change}} of bearing strength of soil in the inudation, for the interaction of running gears of SM with the supporting surface for the rolling of their bogies off the slopes have been developed. The new dependence of soil strength on the watering mode has been offered. The methodology of design and creation of complex soil-relief conditions for the SM in the circular motion has been developed. The series of machine prototypes have been made and have been gone into production. The new makes and the arrangement schemes of <b>sprinkling</b> <b>devices,</b> of running gears of machines have been offered. 12916 production models of diverse SM makes have been introduced in Russian Federation, Ukraine, Byelorussia, MoldaviaAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
