The Greek cargo ship M/V Evriali (10,000 DWT) was transporting 7,400 tons steel from Mariupol, Ukraine (formerly Zhdanov) to Italy, and had already passed the strait southwards.|$|E
25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and sat by it so he knew that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, who said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> {{the right time and}} insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

500|$|Marge {{believes}} she has higher morals {{than most other}} characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent The Itchy & Scratchy Show and being a prominent member of the [...] "Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene." [...] She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, {{but many of the}} townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her frequent failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms. Marge is {{the only member of the}} family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him [...] "don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win.". Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with her daughter, Lisa, who is a feminist. For example, in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] (season one, 1990) When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Ms. Botz, the babysitter, Bart, Lisa and Maggie asked Marge for some grub, but she quickly refused and they ran away.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{for some}} occult reason I shrank from asking {{the name of}} this [...] "one who had gone down to the Darkness," [...] {{although}} I was sure that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the question. So I merely remarked, without showing surprise-- ...|$|E
