50|$|The Stellwerk (<b>signal</b> <b>house</b> at {{the train}} station) is listed as a Swiss {{heritage}} site of national significance. The entire urbanized village of Kerzers {{is part of the}} Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites.|$|R
50|$|On {{the exhibit}} area outside, a water tower was added near the {{existing}} <b>signal</b> <b>house.</b> There {{is also a}} model railway, a children's playground, and an area for special events, {{as well as a}} turntable.|$|R
50|$|On {{the left}} of the museum, there is an {{exhibition}} room of train tickets and train models of not only KCR trains but also Japanese Shinkansen and Eurostar. The further internal part of the room is a refurbished ticket office and <b>signalling</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1849, a two-story, brick lightkeeper's {{house with}} a wooden lantern was built {{as one of the}} lights. During the American Civil War, this served the Confederacy as a <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> to {{communicate}} between Fort Fisher and Fort Caswell. This house was destroyed by storms.|$|R
50|$|At {{the south}} end, {{a series of}} {{projecting}} nested bays descends to an entrance to track level. To its south is an old <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> also sided in metal. The crew quarters can also be entered from the center platform. Its interior is given over to employee-related functions and is not open to the public.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{proximity}} to Tel Aviv, Mazkeret Batya has recently experienced a growth spurt. Mazkeret Batya is a mixed community of religious and secular Jews. Historic landmarks include Beit Ha'Itut (<b>Signal</b> <b>House),</b> the Great Synagogue, Beit Meshek HaBaron ("The Baron's Farmhouse", now housing a cultural center), the saqiya-type water-rising system with its wooden wheels, well and pool, and an old farmyard.|$|R
25|$|The Ashley House {{was sold}} to John Warner Kinsey in 1882, who renamed the {{building}} as the eponymous Kinsey Hotel. Kinsey would later move to nearby Harvey Cedars, abandoning the hotel. A new hotel, the Sans Souci, was built in 1883 {{with the intention of}} attracting winter sportsmen. A fourth hotel, The Social, opened to boarders in 1884. Between 1884 and 1886, a direct railroad connection was completed to increase the city's tourism capabilities. The first train reached Barnegat City on June 28, 1886. A large keeper's house was completed in 1889 by the Federal Lighthouse Bureau to house the three keepers and their families. In 1899, Benjamin Archer sold the Sans Souci, which was subsequently renamed the Sunset Hotel. During the Spanishâ€“American War, the United States Life-Saving Service kept watch for enemy ships and a <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> was constructed offshore; but the <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> was complete shortly after the peace was declared.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the logic}} {{unit in the}} <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> and field <b>signalling</b> devices are {{connected}} with multi-core metallic cables; and those signalling facilities in the station yard are controlled by the control commands for signal aspects, reversing of points etc. that are electrically trans-mitted by the combination of voltage at each core wire. So, in large signalling work, we have to carry out wiring and inter-connection checking of core wires of each cable, in addition to exten-sive wiring construction. Since that on-site work must be done only in the limited intervals of the train schedule at night, the work inevitably take long time. Furthermore, errors in work cause trans-portation disruption, as the process of checking is so complicated. In order to solve those problems, we developed a station yard net-work-based signal control system that connects the logic unit in the <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> and field <b>signalling</b> devices and transmits control com-mands to those signalling facilities using digital data.

50|$|The now {{demolished}} {{station was}} located in the Mountpleasant area of County Louth, north of Dundalk and close to Aghnaskeagh, Ravensdale, Currathir Bridge and Ballymakellelt. Although the station once comprised a Station <b>House,</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>House,</b> and platform, the disused structures were destroyed in the 1970s {{as a result of}} law-enforcement officials considering that they had been used to support Irish Republicans in the Northern Ireland Troubles.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a serious}} fire in 1967. While the cast iron tower was undamaged, {{the rest of the}} structure, the light, and the fog signal were destroyed. The lantern and the remains of the fog <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> were removed then, so that it now looks very much the same as it did before the pier was extended. It remains an active light, owned and {{maintained}} by the US Coast Guard.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} {{built by the}} Pennsylvania Railroad in 1872, and shared service with the Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad, which had a station across the tracks. The station house was closed by PRR in 1965, and is currently a local business. It also contained a <b>signal</b> <b>house,</b> which for a time served as a rail museum but now houses the Huntingdon County Chamber of Commerce. Efforts to save the former H&BTM station failed when it was demolished in 2001.|$|R

50|$|The light station {{includes}} the keeper's {{house and a}} fog signal building, from which the tower holding the light rises. These are mounted on a rectangular granite pad {{at the end of}} the breakwater. The keeper's house is a 1-1/2 story frame structure with a gambrel roof and brick chimney. The fog <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> and tower are a brick structure, the house covered by a gable roof. The tower rising from it is square in shape, with a projecting iron railing and gallery around the lantern house.|$|R
50|$|The station {{physically}} {{resembles the}} nearby Beverley Road station as the layout and station house are both the same. There are some differences, however. This station has blue columns while Beverley Road has green, {{there is a}} <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> for New York City Transit use on the north end that replicates the station house across the street, {{and the location of}} the station house in relation to the platforms, is slightly to the north compared to the same location at Beverley Road. Colors at this station are green and beige.|$|R
50|$|William Henry Woodgate {{was born}} at Beer, Devon, UK, in 1827 and was baptised on 1 January 1828. In the 1841 Census, he was living at <b>Signal</b> <b>House,</b> Beer, with his parents Robert & Elizabeth Woodgate and his younger siblings. Willam, who had married Margaret (Mary Ann) Heberley in 1863, was accused and found guilty at the Supreme Court of murder of the newborn baby of his niece Susan Woodgate, who was the {{daughter}} of his brother Robert. He was thought to be the father of her child.|$|R
50|$|Houses in Main Street and Post Office Lane are dated 1693 and 1776; Brae House and White House, also in Main Street, are dated 1771 and 1778 {{and have}} a sundial at first floor level. On Pierhead stands the small {{hexagonal}} Light Tower built in 1817 and now restored, marking the old ferry pier. Nearby, the octagonal, castellated <b>Signal</b> <b>House</b> (or Tower House) is the old ferry office. In the 19th century, people awaiting a ferry sheltered {{on the ground floor}} of this building and the Superintendent of the Queensferry Passage had his office on the floor above.|$|R
50|$|In September 2014 it was {{announced}} that local officials were considering a new station stop along the CapeFlyer route in Bourne for the 2015 season. According to the announcement, the station stop would be located on government land under the Bourne Bridge. Construction was confirmed in November 2014, when the state announced construction of the station, along with planned trackside improvements and <b>signal</b> <b>houses</b> {{on both sides of the}} bridge, as well as improvements to switches in the area. Additionally, a 4,000 foot siding will be constructed in order to facilitate waiting trains at the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Libby Island Light {{is located}} on South Libby Island, one of two islands (collectively known as the Libby Islands) marking the southernmost {{approach}} to Machias Bay on the northeastern coast of Maine. The light station's principal feature is the lighthouse, an unpainted conical granite tower 42 ft in height, with its base 16 ft in diameter and its upper parapet 12 ft in diameter. The tower {{is located on}} the southern shore of the island, with a fog <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> to its west. A boat landing {{is located on the}} northern shore of the island, and a small helipad is near its center.|$|R
5000|$|While serving at Two Lights, on January 28, 1885, that he {{risked his}} life to save two sailors from the {{schooner}} Australia which had wrecked on the rocks below the station. According to the official Coast Guard website, Hanna braved a blizzard in freezing temperatures, {{at the risk of}} his life, to throw a line to the ship which was being battered against the rocks. He successfully got both sailors off the ship and brought them to the nearby fog <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> where the sailors were able to be warmed to save them from exposure and frostbite.|$|R
50|$|This {{station was}} between Tanjong Pagar railway {{station at the}} {{southern}} end of Singapore island and Woodlands Train Checkpoint at the northern end. It was a crossing loop station and <b>signalling</b> control <b>house.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blandford Camp is {{currently}} {{the home of the}} Royal <b>Signals,</b> <b>housing</b> both the headquarters of the corps as well as the headquarters of the Defence College of Communications and Information Systems (DCCIS), the Royal School of Signals (which includes 11 Signal Regiment), and the Royal Signals Museum. A number of other telecommunications-related units, such as the MOD Land Systems Reference Centre, are also housed on the site. Over the years, however, the camp has been home to Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, Army and joint-Service units, as well as to a US Army hospital complex. The site has also been used as a road racing circuit.|$|R
50|$|Wind Point Lighthouse was {{designed}} by Orlando Metcalfe Poe and constructed in 1880. The beacon was originally powered by a three-wicked kerosene lamp, magnified by a third-order Fresnel lens. The light was electrified in 1924, and replaced a DCB-24R airport beacon in 1964. The DCB-24R failed in 2007, {{and was replaced by}} a VRB-25 lens. A <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> (horns removed, resonators still in place) remains on the grounds as well as a garage, two storage buildings, and an oil house. The Village of Wind Point has maintained the lighthouse and grounds since 1964, and uses the old keepers' quarters as a village hall and police headquarters.|$|R
5000|$|The light {{station was}} {{authorized}} in 1817, and its first tower was a wood frame structure that was blown down about 1822. The present tower {{was built in}} 1823, and a keeper's house added the following year. [...] A fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed in the tower in 1855, and a fog signal and several outbuildings (like the keeper's house since demolished) were built the following year. The present fog <b>signal</b> <b>house</b> was built in 1884. The light was automated in 1974, and converted to solar power in 2000. [...] The tower is now {{the property of the}} United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and is not open to the public.|$|R
5000|$|Power line {{communication}} {{units that}} send <b>signal</b> over <b>house</b> wiring have {{been referred to}} as [...] "wireless" [...] intercoms. Though they are technically wired intercoms, they are based on existing wiring and thus require no additional wires.|$|R
50|$|Monhegan is a {{small island}} {{community}} 10 mi {{off the coast of}} Maine, consisting of Monhegan Island, and a number of nearby smaller islands. Its harbor is situated in the channel between Monhegan and Manana Islands, just west of the main island. The Manana Island Sound Signal Station is located at the highest point on Manana Island, and consists of several buildings and structures. The present <b>signal</b> equipment is <b>housed</b> in small brick building, built in 1906 on the foundation of the original <b>signal</b> <b>house,</b> originally for use as an oil house. The former main signal building is a brick structure about 33 x 20 ft, built in 1889 on the site of an earlier wood frame structure. It is topped by a low tower that was originally used to house a Daboll trumpet. A shed covering several iron pressure tanks is attached to one side. The keeper's house, dating to 1855, is a much-altered 1-1/2 story wood frame building.|$|R
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} <b>signal</b> <b>house,</b> which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now <b>houses</b> maritime <b>signal</b> flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, {{the station}} was {{electrified}} and the lamp was replaced with a 1000 watt electric bulb, and the incandescent oil vapor lamp was moved to Au Sable Point Lighthouse in Northern Michigan. Split Rock was outfitted with a fog <b>signal</b> <b>housed</b> in a building next to the light tower. The original signal {{was a pair of}} sirens driven by two Franklin [...] gasoline-driven air compressors manufactured by Chicago Pneumatic Tool Company. In 1932 the gasoline engines were replaced with diesel engines. The steam sirens were replaced with a Type F-2-T diaphone (be-you) type signal in 1936. The station and the fog signal were electrified four years later, but discontinued in 1961.|$|R
