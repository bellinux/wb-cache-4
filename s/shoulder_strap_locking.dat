40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} spacing of backpack <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> on cervical muscle activity, acromion and scapular position, and upper trapezius (UT) pain. [Subjects] Fourteen males aged 20 – 32 years, were recruited. [Methods] We measured the MPS (midcervical paraspinal) activity, acromial angle, scapular distance, and UT pain after gait carrying a backpack with different <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> spacings. [Results] The MPS, scapular inferior distance, and UT pressure pain threshold was significantly decreased and the acromion angle was significantly increased when carrying a backpack with wide <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> compared to narrow <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps.</b> [Conclusion] A backpack with wide <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> may cause scapular depression syndrome and chronic UT pain...|$|R

50|$|Most officer {{designated}} ranks (Heer and Luftwaffe) {{wear this}} particular silver metallic tissue cordon already on <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps,</b> {{next to the}} lower end of the mounting loop. The only exemption exists concerning the Oberfähnrich <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap,</b> to be worn on service - and dress uniform. This particular <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> shows the silver piping on its outline, indicating the officer career, but lacks the bronze-colored edging that usually hedges the center part of the insignia with NCO-ranks as opposed to the service uniform <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> of a Hauptfeldwebel (OR7). However, rank badges on the mounting loops of Hauptfeldwebel and Oberfähnrich are identically.|$|R
50|$|A haversack {{or small}} pack is a {{bag with a}} single <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap.</b> Although similar to a backpack, the single <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> differentiates this type from other backpacks. There are {{exceptions}} to this general rule.|$|R
50|$|The rank {{insignia}} {{consisted of}} <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> and sleeve stripes. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> {{had to be}} worn on uniform jackets and consisted of twisted gold-braids (no pips or stars) on padding in navy blue weapon color.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} bra <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> pressures, to investigate how bra strap cushions moderated this pressure and increased comfort, and {{to investigate the}} effects of variations in bra <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> configuration on vertical breast motion, breast discomfort, shoulder pressures, and comfort. Methods: Fourteen healthy women (C+ bra cup size) ran on a treadmill wearing a sports bra under five strap conditions (no straps, traditional vertical alignment, crossed-back alignment, and with and without bra strap cushions inserted under the <b>straps).</b> Bra <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> pressure, vertical breast displacement, breast pain, and shoulder comfort were measured during each trial. Results: Maximal pressures from 0. 83 to 2. 67 N·cm- 2 and mean pressures from 0. 52 to 1. 06 N·cm- 2 were recorded during running. The bra strap cushions only reduced maximal <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> pressure in the crossed-back strap orientation. Vertical breast displacement was significantly less in the crossed-back orientation compared with no straps, and breast pain was significantly reduced in both the traditional and crossed-back orientation compared with the no strap condition. No significant between-condition difference was found in shoulder comfort regardless of <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> orientation, although the crossed-back strap orientation resulted in significant increases in shoulder force and mean pressure values compared with the traditional strap orientation. Conclusion: The bra <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> cushion was not effective in decreasing the bra <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> pressure due to design flaws that prevented it from adequately increasing the strap–shoulder contact area. However, modifying <b>shoulder</b> <b>strap</b> orientation from a traditional to a crossed-back configuration could alleviate the common problem of bra <b>shoulder</b> <b>straps</b> slipping off {{the shoulders of the}} wearer, without decreasing the overall efficacy of the sports bra in providing breast support...|$|R
