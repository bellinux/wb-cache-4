40|$|Based on the {{structural}} {{analysis of sample}} knitted fabrics and the knit geometric theory, we have built an algorithm that can make three-dimensional structure models for weft knitted fabrics such as welt <b>stitches,</b> tuck <b>stitches,</b> cross <b>stitches,</b> rib <b>stitches</b> and purl <b>stitches.</b> In order to reduce computational complexity, we have set the anchoring point on the diametral plane of yarn in the knitting chart. Drawing from the beginning knitting point to the finished knitting point, a smooth knit curve model can be obtained with the cardinal spline curve. Using this algorithm, we have developed the weft knit three-dimensional structure modeling software that can display the three-dimensional model of knitted fabrics including welt stitches; tuck <b>stitches,</b> cross <b>stitches,</b> rib <b>stitches</b> and purl <b>stitches.</b> Our work confirms 3 -D modeling of three foundation knits of weft knit (plain <b>stitches,</b> purl <b>stitches,</b> rib <b>stitches),</b> tuck <b>stitches,</b> welt <b>stitches</b> and cross <b>stitches</b> with a commercially available PC. This software {{can be used by}} someone with no understanding of knitting to gain an understanding of the knitting process, and determine the structure of a knitted fabric product. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R

During the ceremony, Victor has Victoria arrested {{in an attempt}} to stop the wedding. J.T. gains full custody of Reed and moves to Washington, DC with his new wife Mackenzie for her job. Victoria and her siblings pursue a lawsuit against Victor to gain control of a cosmetics line. After Victoria miscarries a child with Billy, he illegally pays $2,000,000 for a child, whom they name Lucy in January 2011. Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) gains custody of Lucy and Billy leaves town without disclosing his whereabouts to his wife. Victoria later pursues divorce proceedings in Billy's long absence. After their divorce, Victoria and Billy's mother, Jill Fenmore, try unsuccessfully to locate Billy whose daughter has Leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. The pair find each other in a New York airport bar, reunite, and remarry in December 2011. As they return home from their honeymoon, Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) arrives, announcing she is pregnant with Billy’s child. Chelsea barters with Billy demanding 3 million dollars. She later gives birth to a boy, Johnny, but gives Billy full custody of their son. Victoria decides to stay in her marriage to Billy and help him raise the child. Later, Victoria returns to Newman Enterprises to try and save it from Sharon’s destruction. While on business in Miami in November 2012, she is kidnapped by Eddie G. (Blake Gibbons), who demands that Billy repay a gambling debt as a ransom. Eddie is shot and killed in front of her, and she is finally rescued by her brother Nick, and recovers. Billy later relapses in his gambling addiction, and the couple briefly separate. However, Victoria again decides to reconcile with Billy and continue their marriage. In October 2013, Billy's daughter Delia is struck and killed by Adam in a hit and run accident. Billy embarks on an affair with a woman in his grief support group, Kelly Andrews (Cady McClain). Meanwhile, Victoria grows close with <b>Stitch</b> Rayburn (Sean Carrigan). Victoria files for legal separation after Billy's affair with is exposed, and she ends up sleeping with <b>Stitch.</b> Victoria then finds out she is pregnant but is unsure of the child's paternity.

5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a <b>stitch</b> or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Birbhum is a {{major centre}} of cottage industries. Perhaps the most notable cottage {{industry}} is a non-profit rural organisation named Amar Kutir. Other main industries in Birbhum are agriculture-based industries, textiles, forestry, arts and crafts. Sriniketan is noted for its dairy industry and as a forestry centre. Some of the notable forms of cottage industries of Birbhum include textile—especially cotton and locally harvested tussar silk, jute works, batik, kantha <b>stitch,</b> macramé (weaving by knotting threads), leather, pottery and terracotta, solapith, woodcarving, bamboo and cane craft, metal works and tribal crafts. There are 8,883 small and medium scale industries. Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk harvesting and weaving, rice and oilseed milling, lac harvesting, and metalware and pottery manufacture.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Experimental {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} to understand the bearing strength of <b>stitched</b> and unstitched uniweave T 300 /QY 9512 laminates with single-lap single-bolt joint configuration in this article. The objectives of the studies are {{to determine the effects}} of <b>stitching</b> node position, stacking sequence, and hygrothermal environment on the bearing strength and the load–displacement curves of <b>stitched</b> laminates. A three-dimensional finite element model is also developed to investigate the bearing properties of mechanically fastened joints in unstitched and <b>stitched</b> laminates. Hashin’s three-dimensional failure criterion is used to predict the progressive ply failure. The <b>stitching</b> node position effect is of primary interest. A good agreement between experimental results and numerical predictions is observed. The results show that the bearing strength decreased when the <b>stitching</b> node position was close to the hole boundary.

40|$|The {{performance}} is studied of a <b>stitched</b> uniweave fabric composite {{and that of}} a toughened tape composite. The effects of <b>stitching</b> on compression fatigue life are addressed. Post impact compression fatigue and open hole fatigue tests were run on an AS 4 / 3501 - 6 uniweave with <b>stitching</b> and a toughened IM 7 / 8551 - 7 tape without <b>stitching.</b> <b>Stitching</b> was found to increase the thickness and consequently {{the weight of the}} composite material. The two materials were compared on an equal carbon content basis as well as on an equal weight basis. The excess thickness in the <b>stitched</b> uniweave composite was responsible for the lower fatigue life, on an equal carbon basis, compared to the toughened resin tape composite. Comparison of fatigue lives on an equal carbon content basis indicated that puncture or crimp type damage from <b>stitching</b> has very little effect on compression failure. Post impact fatigue test showed that although the damage area in the <b>stitched</b> uniweave composite was twice that of the toughened tape composite, the fatigue lives of the <b>stitched</b> composite were significantly longer than those of the toughened composite. Thus, it appears that the increase in thickness from <b>stitching</b> is much more of a penalty than crimped fibers or puncture type damage from <b>stitching...</b>|$|R

It does not mean to surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E
