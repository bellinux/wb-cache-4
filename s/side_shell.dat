For overcoming those above disadvantages, a kind of new efficient and energy saving shell-and-tube heat exchanger with sidelling flow in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> is developed, the traditional segmental baffles are substituted by leading type shutter baffles, therefore, the fluid in some local regions flows over tubes inclinedly. The velocity distribution and velocity variation at the same position of main flow region in sidelling flow heat exchanger and segmental baffle heat exchanger is studied and compared. It is confirmed that, with the leading type shutter baffles in <b>shell</b> <b>side,</b> the vortex in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> is weaken, flow field is greatly homogenized, and the velocity in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> is increased. Shutter baffles are helpful to reduce the pressure drop in <b>shell</b> <b>side</b> and increase effective heat transfer area, which provides references for structure improving of shell-and-tube heat exchanger...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and investigates two common techniques of modeling large periodic <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> openings in global {{finite element models}} for evaluation of passenger ship hull girder static response in early design phase. The first technique is based on homogenization of <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> structure and modeling <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> openings with homogenized orthotropic material using 4 -noded and 8 -noded shell elements. Second technique is direct modeling of <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> openings using coarse mesh, where cost of simplification to geometry and mesh size is studied. The proposed techniques are validated with respect to 3 D fine mesh analysis in two cases. First, periodic <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> model is studied for evaluation of correct in plane response under uniform axial and shear loading. Second, the techniques are investigated in a box-like ship under 4 -point bending load. Accuracy of both techniques is evaluated by means of hull girder deflection, longitudinal deck forces and <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> vertical shear forces. In addition, the performance in border of periodic grid and at areas of high strain gradients is investigated. The results indicate that equivalent orthotropic modeling of both central and offset openings gives accurate global deflection and longitudinal bending response in a simple model where strain gradients are small. When significant strain gradients are introduced e. g. where internal longitudinal bulkheads are discontinuous, the deflection and longitudinal bending response accuracies are compromised. Local response of orthotropic model is less accurate and especially compromised at edges of periodic grid and areas of high strain gradient. Additional local errors arise due to micropolar behavior of offset openings, where the equivalence is only achieved in forces but not in moments due to application of classical theory of elasticity. No significant difference in response is observed whether 4 - or 8 -noded elements are applied. For coarse mesh modeling a sensitivity analysis is performed taking account effect of simplification of structure and mesh size. A reasonable compromise between modeling effort, computational cost and accuracy is found at 4 x 4 elements per opening. Despite being stiffer in uniformly loaded periodic <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> model, the accuracy of coarse mesh modeling is shown to be reliable in application to box-like ship, where performance is not significantly affected by strain gradients and boundary effects...|$|E
40|$|Lightweight {{structures}} are increasingly used for high-speed ships. This paper presents a systematic approach to analyse the structural behaviour of a lightweight deckside shell system using high strength steel. An analytical {{model of the}} deckside shell system was first given, which includes the effects of stiffeners for the deck and <b>side</b> <b>shell,</b> the support conditions of the centreline girder (CL-girder), the influence of transverse beams, and {{the interaction between the}} <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> and the lightweight deck as parts of problems to the solution. By changing several geometric parameters, the sensitivity of both overall and local stress and deflection for the deckside shell system was investigated. The different geometric parameters analysed comprise the influence for variation in the thickness of the web for transverse beams, longitudinal stiffeners and the CL-girder, the thickness of lower flange for the transverse beam and, the thickness for the panel. Furthermore, the influence of the lightweight deck and loads from the deck above on the <b>side</b> <b>shell,</b> the effects of the <b>side</b> <b>shell</b> and loads from top deck on the deck, the support conditions for the CL-girder, and the influence of deck loads on the eigenmodes were also analysed. By evaluating the results obtained from FE simulation, the support conditions of the CL-girder, the thickness of the panels and the lower flange of the transverse beams were found to be the most relevant parameters affecting both the stress and the deflection distribution of the structure. The dynamic characteristics of the structure were also analysed. The FE analysis concerning buckling of the structure was present. The results enable naval architects and structural engineers to design new extreme lightweight deck structure more reliable and economical. And some suggestions for future research are also given...|$|E
