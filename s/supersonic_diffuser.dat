50|$|A <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> is a duct that {{decreases}} in {{size in the}} direction of flow. As the duct increases in size, fluid temperature, pressure, and density increase, while velocity decreases.

50|$|Work in the 1940s, {{for example}} by Oswatitsch, showed that {{supersonic}} compression within a duct, {{known as a}} <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser,</b> becomes necessary at M2-3 to increase the pressure recovery over that obtainable with external compression. As flight speed increases supersonically the shock system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake {{is said to be}} unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake is said to be started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed in a split second from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in intake pressure and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft.|$|E

A simple theory for predicting the approximate amplitude of small pressure pulsation in terms of mass-flow decrement from minimum-stable mass flow is developed and found to agree with experiments. Cold-flow tests at a Mach number of 1. 94 of ram-jet models having scale factors of 3. 15 : 1 and Reynolds number ratios of 4. 75 : 1 with several <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> configurations showed only small variations in performance between geometrically similar models.

There was no appreciable variation in stability limits of any of the models when the combustion-chamber length was increased by a factor of three. The unsteady-flow performance and wave patterns were also similar when considered on a reduced-frequency basis determined from the relative lengths of the model. The negligible effect of Reynolds number on stability of the off-design configurations was not anticipated in view of the importance of boundary layer to stability, and this result should not be construed to be generally applicable.

40|$|Simulation {{technology}} {{can play an}} important role in rocket engine test facility design and development by assessing risks, providing analysis of dynamic pressure and thermal loads, identifying failure modes and predicting anomalous behavior of critical systems. This is especially true for facilities such as the proposed A- 3 facility at NASA SSC because of a challenging operating envelope linked to variable throttle conditions at relatively low chamber pressures. Design Support of the feasibility of operating conditions and procedures is critical in such cases due to the possibility of startup/shutdown transients, moving shock structures, unsteady shock-boundary layer interactions and engine and diffuser unstart modes that can result in catastrophic failure. Analyses of such systems is difficult due to resolution requirements needed to accurately capture moving shock structures, shock-boundary layer interactions, two-phase flow regimes and engine unstart modes. In a companion paper, we will demonstrate with the use of CFD, steady analyses advanced capability to evaluate <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> and steam ejector performance in the sub-scale A- 3 facility. In this paper we will address transient issues with the operation of the facility especially at startup and shutdown, and assess risks related to afterburning due to the interaction of a fuel rich plume with oxygen that is a by-product of the steam ejectors. The primary areas that will be addressed in this paper are: (1) analyses of unstart modes due to flow transients especially during startup/ignition, (2) engine safety during the shutdown process (3) interaction of steam ejectors with the primary plume i. e. flow transients as well as probability of afterburning. In this abstract we discuss unsteady analyses of the engine shutdown process. However, the final paper will include analyses of a staged startup, drawdown of the engine test cell pressure, and risk assessment of potential afterburning in the facility. Unsteady simulations have been carried out to study the engine shutdown process in the facility and understand the physics behind the interactions between the steam ejectors, the test cell and the <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser.</b> As a first approximation, to understand the dominant unsteady mechanisms in the engine test cell and the <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser,</b> the turning duct in the facility was removed. As the engine loses power a rarefaction wave travels downstream that disrupts the shock cell structure in the <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser.</b> Flow from the test cell is seen to expand into the <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> section and re-pressurizes the area around the nozzle along with a upstream traveling compression wave that emanates from near the first stage ejectors. Flow from the first stage ejector expands to the center of the duct and a new shock train is formed between the first and second stage ejectors. Both stage ejectors keep the facility pressurized and prevent any large amplitude pressure fluctuations from affecting the engine nozzle.

40|$|Steady {{operation}} of <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffusers</b> near critical mass flow {{is interrupted by}} a transient process known as buzz. This phenomenon consists of a random sequence of individual relaxation cycles. Mass flow entering the diffuser during steady operation is suddenly cut off by a strong interaction between the subcritical shock and boundary layer {{on the surface of}} the external compression generator, which blocks the inlet. Air in the plenum chamber, stored at high pressure, then ?blows down? until the inlet can restart. The subsequent supercritical flow entering the diffuser exceeds the flow rate at the exit and the plenum chamber is re-charged to the original condition. A distinction is drawn between this phenomenon and a high frequency wave-type resonance noticed at low mass flows and during an individual buzz cycle after the diffuser shock system has been expelled. For the large diffuser tested here, this high frequency oscillation compares well to the 8 th closed-end organ pipe mode of the diffuser at low mass flows and to the 9 th mode during the shock-expelled phase of the buzz cycle. It is shown that burning almost always ceases in the presence of buzz. When burning was maintained during buzz, it was found to have no qualitative effect on the buzz cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this work}} {{is the fact that}} in turbulent flows where compressibility effects are important, they are often poorly understood. A few examples of such flows are those associated with astrophysical phenomena and those found in combustion chambers, <b>supersonic</b> <b>diffusers</b> and nozzles, and over high-speed airfoils. For this project, we are primarily interested in compressibility effects near solid surfaces. Our main objective is an improved understanding of the fundamentals of compressible wall-bounded turbulence, which can in turn be used to cast light upon modeling concepts such as the Morkovin hypothesis and the Van Driest transformation. To this end, we have performed a direct numerical simulation (DNS) study of supersonic turbulent flow in a plane channel with constant-temperature walls. All of the relevant spatial and temporal scales are resolved so that no sub grid scale or turbulence model is necessary. The channel geometry was chosen so that finite Mach number effects can be isolated by comparing the present results to well established incompressible channel data. Here the fluid is assumed to be an ideal gas with constant specific heats, constant Prandtl number, and power-law temperature-dependent viscosity. Isothermal-wall boundary conditions are imposed so that a statistically stationary state may be obtained.
