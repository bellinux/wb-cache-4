The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the relationship between CTP parameters and histopathological features of PCa tissue, using a <b>sector-wise</b> approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with biopsy-proven PCa underwent prospectively a CTP scan prior to radical prostatectomy. Blood flow (BF), mean blood volume (BV) and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated, with the prostate being divided into eight sectors. Corresponding <b>sector-wise</b> histopathological analysis of whole-mount prostatectomy specimens was performed to determine tumoral area (mm(2)), mean microvessel density (MVD), Gleason patterns (primary, secondary) and total Gleason score. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze the association between CTP and histopathological parameters. RESULTS: BF correlated weakly with tumoral area [ρs coefficient (p-value) : 0. 25 (0. 00) ] and MVD [ρs coefficient (p-value) : 0. 23 (0. 00) ]. No valuable correlation was found between CTP parameters and primary and secondary Gleason patterns, whereas total Gleason score was weakly correlated with BV [ρs coefficient (p-value) : 0. 22 (0. 00) ] and MTT [ρs coefficient (p-value) : 0. 25 (0. 00) ]. CONCLUSION: BF correlates weakly with size and vascularity of PCa.
