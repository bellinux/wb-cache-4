2500|$|In a {{judgment}} (published on June 16, 2008), Manhattan <b>Surrogate</b> <b>Court</b> Judge Renee Roth ruled that Helmsley was mentally unfit when she executed her will. Hence, the Court, amid settlement, reduced the [...] $12million trust {{fund for the}} pet Trouble to $2 million. Of the $10 million originally bequeathed to Trouble, $4million was awarded to the Charitable Trust, and $6million was awarded to Craig and Meegan Panzirer, who had been disinherited by the will. [...] The ruling requires the Panzirers to keep silent about their dispute with their grandmother and deliver to the court any documents they have about her. It has been alleged that they were omitted from the will because they failed to name any of their children after Helmsley's late husband.|$|E
2500|$|Litigation {{involving}} 40 {{lawyers at}} 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate {{for nearly three}} years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing [...] "to do anything to stop him." [...] The <b>Surrogate</b> <b>Court</b> of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: Harry Demopoulos; J. Carter Brown (later also involved in overturning the will of Albert C. Barnes); Marion Oates Charles, the sole trustee from Duke's last will; James Gill, a lawyer; Nannerl O. Keohane, president of Duke University; and John J. Mack, president of Morgan Stanley. The fees for their lawsuits exceeded $10 million, and were paid by the Duke estate. These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology.|$|E
