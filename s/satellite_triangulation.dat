40|$|The {{feasibility}} of structuring the <b>satellite</b> photogrammetric <b>triangulation</b> as an iterative Extended Kalman estimation algorithm is demonstrated. Comparative numerical {{results of the}} sequential against batch estimation algorithm are presented. Difficulty of accurately modeling of the attitude motion is overcome by utilizing the on-board angular rate measurements. Solutions of the differential equations and the evaluation of state transition matrix are carried out numerically...|$|R
50|$|The Army Map Service of the US Army Corps of Engineers, was {{the premier}} map making {{agency of the}} US Department of Defense from 1941-68. The major task of the Army Map Service (AMS) was the compilation, {{publication}} and distribution of military topographic maps and related products required by the Armed Forces of the United States. The AMS was also involved {{in the preparation of}} extraterrestrial maps of satellite and planetary bodies; the preparation of national intelligence studies; the establishment of world geodetic control networks by both <b>satellite</b> and conventional <b>triangulation</b> methods; and the logistic military planning of Corps of Engineer items. Another major responsibility of the AMS is to maintain the largest geodetic and topographic data libraries for the Department of Defense.|$|R
40|$|Ambient {{intelligence}} {{is a new}} information paradigm, where people are empowered through a digital environment that is ?aware? of their presence and context and is sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to their needs. Hence, {{one of the important}} requirements for ambient intelligent environments (AIEs) is the ability to localize the whereabouts of the user in the AIE to address her/his needs. In order to protect user privacy, the use of cameras is not desirable in AIEs, and hence, {{there is a need to}} rely on nonintrusive sensors. There are various localization means that are available for outdoor spaces such as those which rely on <b>satellite</b> signals <b>triangulation.</b> However, these outdoor localization means cannot be used in indoor environments. The majority of nonintrusive and noncamera-based indoor localization systems require the installation of extra hardware such as ultrasound emitters/antennas, radio-frequency identification (RFID) antennas, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization system that is based on WiFi signals which are free to receive, and they are available in abundance in the majority of domestic spaces. However, free WiFi signals are noisy and uncertain, and their strengths and availability are continuously changing. Hence, we present a fuzzy logic-based system which employs free available WiFi signals to localize a given user in AIEs. The proposed system receives WiFi signals from a large number of existing WiFi access points (up to 170 access points), where no prior knowledge of the access points locations and the environment is required. The system employs an incremental lifelong learning approach to adjust its behavior to the varying and changing WiFi signals to provide a zero-cost localization system which can provide high accuracy in real-world living spaces. We have compared our system in both simulated and real environments with other relevant techniques in the literature, and we have found that our system outperfo- ms the other systems in the offline learning process, whereas our system was the only system which is capable of performing online learning and adaptation. The proposed system was tested in real-world spaces from a living lab intelligent apartment (iSpace) to a town center apartment to a block of offices. In all these experiments, our system has been highly accurate in detecting the user in the given AIEs, and the system was able to adapt its behavior to changes in the AIE or the WiFi signals. We envisage that the proposed system will play an important role in AIEs, especially for privacy concerned situations like elderly care scenarios...|$|R

50|$|The Echo {{satellite}} was {{a balloon}} satellite launched into Earth orbit in 1960 {{and used for}} passive relay of radio communication. PAGEOS was launched in 1966 for worldwide <b>satellite</b> <b>triangulation,</b> allowing for greater precision in the calculation of different locations on the planet's surface.|$|E
5000|$|Pageos had a {{diameter}} of exactly 100 ft, consisted of a [...] thick mylar plastic film coated with vapour deposited aluminium enclosing a volume of [...] and {{was used for the}} Weltnetz der Satellitentriangulation (Worldwide <b>Satellite</b> <b>Triangulation</b> Network) - a global cooperation organized by Hellmut Schmid (Switzerland & USA) 1969-1973.|$|E
50|$|It {{also had}} 107.9 MHz beacon {{transmitters}} for telemetry purposes, powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells {{mounted on the}} balloon. During the latter portion of its life, the spacecraft {{was used to evaluate}} the technical feasibility of <b>satellite</b> <b>triangulation.</b> It had a total mass of 180 kg.|$|E
50|$|PAGEOS' {{predecessors}} in <b>satellite</b> <b>triangulation</b> {{were the}} balloons Echo 1 (1960, 30 m) and Echo 2 (1964, 40 m) which {{were also used}} for passive telecommunication. Their apparent magnitude (brightness) was 1 mag, that of Pageos 2 mag (like Polaris) due to its higher orbit. Pageos could therefore be observed simultaneously e.g. from the ground {{in places such as}} Europe and North America. PAGEOS appeared as a slow-moving star (at first glance it would appear to be stationary). Its orbital period was approximately three hours. Because of its high orbit and polar inclination it would avoid the Earth's shadow and be observed any time of the night (low-orbit satellites are only observable shortly after sunset and before sunrise). In the early 1970s PAGEOS varied from 2nd apparent magnitude to beyond visibility over a period of a few minutes.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{collection}} of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied {{in the development of}} WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (Figure 38). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric <b>Satellite</b> <b>Triangulation</b> Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (Figure 39). Data from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was also used which included camera (Baker-Nunn) and some laser ranging.|$|E

Geoidal undulations obtained can be made consistent with dynamically determined ones {{at the expense of}} slight changes in the currently accepted parameters defining the gravity field of the level ellipsoid...|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} {{global solution}} for the earth's gravitational field and station positions employed a combination of 21 weeks of Doppler tracking data from seven satellites, {{a complete set of}} 5 -deg mean gravity anomalies, and geometric constraints from the worldwide <b>satellite</b> <b>triangulation</b> network on 17 of the stations. To this is now added geoid heights over the major part of the oceans obtained from GEOS 3 altimeter observations. The solution has a form based on the simple density-layer method and is equivalent to a solution in spherical harmonics to the tenth degree and order. The rms difference of 5 -deg mean geoid heights of the new solution with the GEM 10 solution is 5. 6 m...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{improvement}} in service coverage obtained by three different ways of hybridising (terrestrial and <b>satellite)</b> <b>triangulation</b> location methods for cellular networks. Though the authors assume that terrestrial cellular networks use Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD) in 2 G or Observed Time Difference Of Arrival (OTDOA) in 3 G, and that the satellite GNSS uses Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS), their analysis can easily be generalized to address any other triangulation method. A simple analytical model is presented, which is used for evaluating the service coverage of each approach. The numerical results show how hybridisation leads to a high improvement and an easy balance between traffic and geographical coverage. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Adjustment of the BC- 4 worldwide geometric <b>satellite</b> <b>triangulation</b> net is described, along with procedures for correcting type II {{data and the}} contents of magnetic tapes containing data from the Pageos network. Computational steps for the further reduction of partially reduced satellite image plate coordinates are outlined. The problem of improving existing triangulation systems by means of satellite super-control points was studied. The SAO- 69 geometric solution was scaled with C-band radar data, resulting in SAO and C-band adjustment compatible {{with one another in}} the Western Hemisphere. The North America solution NA- 6, obtained from GEOS 1 data, was readjusted with new heights as constraints on all 30 optical stations and {{is referred to as the}} NA- 8 solution...|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} is reported on precise and accurate {{descriptions of the}} earth's surface and gravitational field and on time variations of geophysical parameters. A new computer program was written {{in connection with the}} adjustment of the BC- 4 worldwide geometric <b>satellite</b> <b>triangulation</b> net. The possibility that an increment to accuracy could be transferred from a super-control net to the basic geodetic (first-order triangulation) was investigated. Coordinates of the NA 9 solution were computed and were transformed to the NAD datum, based on GEOS 1 observations. Normal equations from observational data of several different systems and constraint equations were added and a single solution was obtained for the combined systems. Transformation parameters with constraints were determined, and the impact of computers on surveying and mapping is discussed...|$|E
