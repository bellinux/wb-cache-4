5|$|Tintin began {{appearing}} in video games when Infogrames Entertainment, SA, a French game company, released the side <b>scroller</b> Tintin on the Moon in 1989.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, ETC {{introduced}} the Source Four Revolution, ETC's first moving fixture. The Revolution was awarded both the EDDY and ABTT awards. The Revolution {{has the same}} filament structure as famous HPL Source Four lamp, as opposed to most other moving lights, which use arc lamps. Also, the Revolution uses a gel string color <b>scroller</b> instead of the typical color wheel, thus allowing lighting designers to use familiar gel choices.|$|E
25|$|Three {{video games}} {{based on the}} series were {{released}} only in Japan. One of them was an action platformer released for the Super Famicom by BEC in 1994, in which each level {{one of the eight}} adult cyborgs (001 is not playable) is selected as the leader of a strike force for a particular mission and the player is allowed to choose two others to accompany them. The other game (released by Telenet Japan's subsidiary Riot) in 1993 was for the Mega CD and is also a side <b>scroller.</b>|$|E
50|$|Layout: Fittables, <b>scrollers,</b> lists, drawers, panels.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>scrollers</b> were plain {{horizontal}} <b>scrollers,</b> but demo coders {{also paid}} {{a lot of attention to}} creating new and different types of scrolling. The characters could, for example, continuously alter their shape, take unusual flying paths or incorporate color effects such as raster bars. Sometimes it makes the text nearly unreadable.|$|R
5000|$|Some color <b>scrollers</b> are {{configured}} for [...] "daisy chain" [...] connection, {{by which}} 4-pin power/control cable feeds into {{and then out}} {{of a number of}} <b>scrollers.</b> The number of units that can be daisy chained together is limited by a head-feet restriction. Head-feet is defined as the total sum of the lengths of cable from each device to a single power supply. It is a way to account for the voltage drop in the power/signal cable caused the current drawn from each unit and the length of the cable. If you exceed the recommended [...] "head feet" [...] you may experience performance problems with all of the <b>scrollers</b> on the chain.|$|R
25|$|A ring {{of eight}} {{programmable}} moving searchlights called Syncrolites are used. The fixtures have dousers to control brightness, and {{are equipped with}} a color <b>scroller</b> with 14 different colors, including the four colors selected specifically for the show: Lavender, Mint, Pumpkin, and Lagoon. As of December 2011, a transition to new firework product began. The new product is more environmentally friendly, however they can not create the original four colors of the show. Instead, standard colors (Orange, Green, Magenta, and Yellow) replaced Lavender, Mint, Pumpkin, and Lagoon Blue. The color scrollers were fitted with new colors to match the product change.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound was}} {{provided}} by Solotech. Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in color matching material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with <b>scroller</b> under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour. Pyrotechnics and jets of smoke used in the show were created by Lorenzo Cornacchia of Pyrotek Special Effects and Tait Towers.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used type of <b>scroller</b> is the single string <b>scroller.</b> This type has only one string of color anywhere from 2 to 33 frames long.|$|E
50|$|Color <b>scrollers</b> utilize from 1 to 4 {{channels}} {{depending on}} their capabilities. One channel is required for every string of gel (up to 3) and one channel is required for optional control settings. Optional settings include: Remote fan control (ability to control the fan's speed and on/off status), preset color string mixed color positions (for <b>scrollers</b> with multiple strings), preset effects/times, and control over the speed the string moves.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sections}} of the game include minigames based on other genres, such as shoot 'em ups and side <b>scrollers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Color <b>scrollers</b> come in many {{different}} sizes and are mountable on nearly every type of conventional lighting instrument. Sizes include: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Scroller</b> units (show {{commands}} for {{accessing the}} elements of an ordered set of objects).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Interior {{view of a}} Chroma Q 6" [...] single string <b>scroller,</b> with scroll.|$|E
50|$|Most color scrollers use DMX512 {{addressing}} protocol. Each <b>scroller</b> unit {{is given}} an address or identifying number. Earlier <b>scroller</b> models used binary DIP switches {{to set the}} address, however most scrollers currently include digital addressing systems. Once addressed, the unit is then connected with other color scrollers and run back to a power supply (typically with 4-pin XLR cable. 4-pin is used to differentiate power lines from data.) The power supply receives the DMX control signal from the Lighting control console and distributes control signal (either DMX or a proprietary manufacturers signal) to each color <b>scroller</b> unit along with 24 volts DC. Depending on the manufacturer, power supplies can power anywhere from 1 to 64 units.|$|E
25|$|Other {{uses for}} the four-pin XLR include some <b>scrollers</b> (colour {{changing}} devices for stage lighting), AMX analog lighting control (now obsolete) and some pyrotechnic equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Color <b>scrollers,</b> irises, top hats, and {{barn doors}} (all {{lighting}} instrument attachments) are also available. On-stage film and projection equipment are only available through special arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Sprite <b>scrollers</b> {{were placed}} in the border. By tricking the {{hardware}} not to draw the border around the screen, sprites could be moved into this area and displayed.|$|R
50|$|Image Fight was {{released}} {{one year after}} Irem's successful horizontal <b>scroller,</b> R-Type, and, although not directly related, the two games have some similarities.|$|E
50|$|The version {{released}} for the Sega CD has {{the addition}} of some 2D sprite mid-level enemies, and a hidden side <b>scroller</b> game based on R-Type.|$|E
5000|$|IGN ranked U.N. Squadron 37th on its [...] "Top 100 Super Nintendo Games" [...] list, {{which made}} it the highest ranking side <b>scroller</b> shooter game on that list.|$|E
50|$|Procedural {{generation}} is often disguised as compression {{in order to}} increase the amusement value. See, for example, the end <b>scrollers</b> of The Product by Farbrausch and Zoom3 by AND.|$|R
50|$|RDM was {{ratified}} in 2006. It took a {{while for}} it to be widely adopted. There are now several mainstream lighting consoles supporting RDM as well as a growing list of RDM “responders” such as colour <b>scrollers,</b> dimmers, and moving lights. Data distribution products including wireless DMX/RDM links are now available.|$|R
50|$|Electricians install (hang), {{point and}} shape the beam (focus), and {{connect to power}} (circuit) {{lighting}} instruments. Additionally they may add gel to color the light, patterns (or gobos) to create texture or shape a light into pictures, and accessories that give the designer the ability to change {{some aspect of the}} light, such as <b>scrollers</b> (color changers) or pattern effects (gobo rotators).|$|R
5000|$|Introduced as an {{alternative}} to a color <b>scroller,</b> High End System's Colormerge unit was an add-on dichroic color changer. It was a color mixing unit made to be used with the ETC Source Four ellipsoidal fixture. Unlike a traditional color <b>scroller,</b> it was installed inside the unit between the reflector assembly and shutters. It provided CMY color mixing via dichroic glass plates. [...] "Colormerge" [...] was a relatively expensive device which lacked reliability - these problem ultimately caused it to fail in the marketplace. It was discontinued in 2004. https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200437/http://www.highend.com/support/discontinued/colormerge.asp ...|$|E
50|$|The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland was {{published}} by NewKidCo, released on Game Boy Color in 1999. This game is a platforming side <b>scroller</b> based on the movie of the same name.|$|E
5000|$|According to the developers, one of {{the reasons}} they chose to do a side <b>scroller,</b> as opposed to a {{vertical}} <b>scroller,</b> was so they could put in lots of visual humour. Players can expect to see, among other things, spacefighters with knives strapped to them and various humorous signs. They can also expect most of the weapons in the weapon shop have advertising posters, emblazoned with messages such as [...] "Ultimate destructive power!" [...] or [...] "As seen on TV!". Also, cultural references are scattered throughout the game, both in the equipment and the actual levels.|$|E
50|$|Scrolling texts, also {{referred}} to as scrolltexts or <b>scrollers,</b> played an important part in the birth of the computer demo culture. The software crackers often used their deep knowledge of computer platforms to transform the information that accompanied their releases into crack intros. The sole role of these intros was to scroll the text on the screen in an impressive way.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{there are}} [...] "true" [...] CYM mixing <b>scrollers</b> that utilize three {{independently}} controlled gel strings - namely, the ColorFader system manufactured by Morpheus Lights of Las Vegas, NV. Independent {{control of the}} gel strings permits users to cross-fade [...] "from any color to any color" [...] directly (without going through undesired colors as on a single or double string color changer).|$|R
25|$|Conventional (non-intelligent) {{fixtures}} {{are designed}} to accept {{a number of different}} accessories intended to assist in the modification of the output. The most common, found on almost all stage lights, is the gel frame holder. The gel frame holder is intended to hold gel, mounted in cardboard or metal gel frames. Other common accessories include gobo holders or rotators, iris holders, donuts, barn doors and color <b>scrollers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Weapons at {{the players}} {{disposal}} will include laser guns and flamethrowers. The player will have pets {{to assist them}} in tasks. The player will encounter large bosses. The game is a side <b>scroller.</b>|$|E
50|$|BloodRayne: Betrayal is a 2011 side-scrolling action-adventure game. It is {{the third}} title in the BloodRayne series. Unlike the {{previous}} 3D hack 'n slash games before it, this game is a 2D side <b>scroller.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally {{developed}} for the Commodore 64 platform, the game was also ported to the Commodore Amiga. Note that the Commodore 64 version of Denaris {{should not be confused}} for the similar space game Denarius, a top-down space <b>scroller</b> game.|$|E
50|$|As a result, crack intros {{began to}} feature big {{colourful}} effects, music, and <b>scrollers.</b> Cracking groups {{would use the}} intros not just to gain credit for cracking, but to advertise their BBSes, greet friends, and give themselves recognition. Messages were frequently of a vulgar nature, and on some occasions made threats of violence against software companies or the members of some rival crack group.|$|R
5000|$|Besides, {{by the end}} of 2013, two of the 40 brand-new Yutong ZK5125A trolleybuses {{have arrived}} Ji'nan. These new trolleybuses are {{featured}} with 12-meter body length, air-conditioning, one-step low floor, leather-covered seats, [...] "maternal-and-child" [...] seat, full CANBUS system, Chinese LED head <b>scrollers,</b> secondary Lithium battery system and more. These new trolleybuses may be employed by either the Route 101 or 102, replacing the oldest batch of JK6120D.|$|R
5000|$|The demo also {{features}} an easter egg, unlockable in the menu by pressing down both analog sticks (L3 and R3) on the Sixaxis. The resulting menu item allows {{the viewer to}} watch an [...] "oldskool demo" [...] with a starfield, two DYCP <b>scrollers</b> (using the Amiga character set) and various other early demo effects such as blitter objects and metaballs (intentionally made to look low resolution), with chiptune music accompanying it.|$|R
