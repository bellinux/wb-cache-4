25|$|Under Louisiana's codified system, the Louisiana Civil Code, private law—that is, <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> {{between private}} sector parties—is based on {{principles}} of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from Roman law, transmitted through French law and Spanish law, as the state's current territory intersects {{the area of}} North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the Napoleonic Code, as the latter was enacted in 1804, {{one year after the}} Louisiana Purchase. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.|$|E

Therapeutic Jurisprudence is a perspective or framework, and its use suggests the need to conduct empirical research to determine whether outcomes resulting from the application of <b>substantive</b> <b>laws,</b> legal rules, and legal procedures and from the behavior of legal actors have therapeutic (helpful) or antitherapeutic (harmful) consequences, both intended and unintended. In addition, therapeutic jurisprudence involves a reform agenda, as it urges that findings from the behavioral and social sciences be used to transform laws, rules, procedures. and the behavior of legal actors in a manner that promotes well-being. This interdisciplinary focus enables therapeutic jurisprudence scholarship and practice to encompass a broad array of subject areas...|$|R
25|$|There are {{a number}} of places where it is clear that law was {{borrowed}} in one direction or another. Large sections on the Church have been translated wholesale from the Collectio Canonum Hibernensis into a section of the Law tract Bretha Nemed.

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century, the great bulk of {{litigation}} in England was conducted through the various forms of action which had developed from trespass. This remained the case until the nineteenth century, when these kinds of forms of action were abolished in succession by statute. By 1875, all remaining forms had been replaced by a single form uniform writ whereby the plaintiff endorses the statement for a claim. By that time, the change was purely procedural, but it also freed the <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> from the old medieval forms of action. It permitted the development of broad concepts, such as liability in tort which could never have come about when confined by the old forms of action, such as trover. This served to rationalize the law. Just as forms of assumpsit replaced debt, so in the seventeenth century trover replaced detinue.|$|E
25|$|Another problem (also {{compounded}} {{by the absence of}} implementing legislation) is the apparent lack of understanding by many judges in Mexico of the law of the Convention. Mexican judges frequently seem to ignore the fact that a case before them arises out of a return application under the Convention, and instead simply apply the procedural and <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> that would govern a Mexican custody dispute. The result is almost always that those courts deny return without evaluating the merits of the application under the law of the Convention. U.S. Embassy officials report that the Mexican Central Authority has taken some preliminary steps to address this problem. The Mexican Central Authority actively participated in June 2003 in a conference hosted by the U.S. Embassy to educate family law judges about the Hague Convention. The Mexican Central Authority has also started to contact judges it believes may be presiding over a Convention case {{for the first time to}} provide support and guidance, and, in particular, to emphasize the distinction between the court's role in Convention cases and its role in domestic custody determinations.|$|E

500|$|Crucially, {{martial law}} as then {{understood}} {{was not a}} form of <b>substantive</b> <b>law,</b> but instead a suspension {{of the rule of}} law; it was the replacement of normal statutes with a law based on the whims of the local military commander. It was, however, based on certain firm rules, primarily that it should only be used [...] "in time of war or open rebellion in the realm". In previous reigns, this had not been a problem, with monarchs such as Elizabeth I instituting martial law without issues. Charles, however, lacked both the public popularity of Elizabeth and the support within Parliament, and his justification for martial law was not as sound. As a result, the opposition in Parliament, already aggrieved with his behaviour, was further inflamed.|$|E
500|$|In 1756 Blackstone {{published}} {{the first of}} his full legal texts, the 200 page An Analysis of the Laws of England. Published by the Clarendon Press, the treatise was intended to demonstrate the [...] "Order, and principal Divisions" [...] of his lecture series, and a structured introduction to English law. Prest calls this [...] "a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law [...] [...] including constitutional, civil and criminal law, public and private law, <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and procedure, as well as some introductory jurisprudential content". The initial print run of 1,000 copies almost immediately sold out, leading to the printing of three more 1,000-book lots over the next three years, which all sold out. A fifth edition was published in 1762, and a sixth, edited to take into account Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, in 1771. Because {{of the success of the}} Commentaries, Prest remarks that [...] "relatively little scholarly attention has been paid to this work"; at the time, however, it was hailed as [...] "an elegant performance [...] [...] calculated to facilitate this branch of knowledge".|$|E
500|$|Blackstone's primary {{legacy is}} his written work, {{specifically}} the Commentaries on the Laws of England. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was [...] "almost inexhaustible" [...] in the 18th and 19th centuries, although the Commentaries {{emphasis on the}} sovereignty of Parliament drew ire. Alexis de Tocqueville described Blackstone as [...] "an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment". Other commentators differ; one described him as [...] "the core element in the British Enlightenment", comparing him to Montesquieu, Beccaria and Voltaire. Academics {{have said that the}} Commentaries were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of <b>substantive</b> <b>law.</b> At the time of publication, the common law of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. The Commentaries helped to solidify legal thinking. At the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone's work gave the Law [...] "at least a veneer of scholarly respectability". William Searle Holdsworth, one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that [...] "if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that , and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [...] law".|$|E
50|$|Conflict of {{laws in the}} United States is {{the field}} of {{procedural}} law dealing with choice of law rules when a legal action implicates the <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> {{of more than one}} jurisdiction and a court must determine which law is most appropriate to resolve the action. In the United States, the rules governing these matters have diverged from the traditional rules applied internationally. The outcome of this process may require a court in one jurisdiction to apply the law of a different jurisdiction.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{procedural}} differences, the <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> regarding {{the grounds of}} judicial review in Scotland {{are similar to those}} in other western legal systems, with decisions in one jurisdiction regarded as highly persuasive in the others.

2500|$|In England the {{exclusive}} jurisdiction of deciding rights to arms, and claims of descent, is vested in the Court of Chivalry.

However, the records of this are sparse, not least because the Court never gave reasoned judgments (the Lord Chief Justice who sat in 1954 offering the sole exception to this, no doubt because of his professional background as a common law Judge).

In some states, his warning went unheeded and some courts and legislatures have created vague and ill-defined definitions to describe what constitutes a public nuisance.

2500|$|Though the Supreme Court did not {{explicitly}} decide whether Benitez met the proper standard, its opinion nonetheless proceeded with an unfavorable analysis of his case. [...] The Court believed that his {{statements in the}} record showed {{that he may have}} been confused about the <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> of the safety valve provision, but not that there was a [...] "causal link" [...] between his confusion and the Rule 11 violation. [...] The strength of the government's case was also a factor, and the Court did not think that the proper Rule 11 warning would have changed his [...] "assessment of his strategic position." [...] This was especially true because the written plea agreement included the warning that it would be irrevocable, and it had been read to him in Spanish.

2500|$|Thus, a privative clause {{does not}} prevent the High Court from exercising {{judicial}} review if an authority has failed to exercise power in a bona fide manner, or if the action taken or decision made is irrelevant to the subject manner of the legislation or does not come within the power conferred on the authority. While a statutory clause will be inconsistent with section75(v) if it purports to prevent the Court from determining whether a Commonwealth officer has engaged [...] "in unlawful or unauthorized conduct" [...] or acted [...] "on the basis that an invalid decision is valid and enforceable", a clause will not be unconstitutional if it {{has the effect of}} altering the procedural or <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> that the Court must apply to ensure that [...] "the impugned decision or conduct is in fact valid or lawful".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Erie was handed down, it had long been settled that when a federal court hears a state cause of action brought in federal district court in diversity, the statutory law of the state would be applied. However, {{in the case of}} Swift v. Tyson, 41 U.S. 1 (1842), [...] the Supreme Court had held that the federal courts need not also apply the court-made common law of the states. This had led to forum shopping, a litigation tactic whereby plaintiffs would seek to sue in federal court instead of state court {{in order to have a}} different <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> applied. In light of this inequity, the Supreme Court had to determine whether federal courts should apply state common law. [...] However, the Court did not decide whether or not the new ruling applied to equity jurisprudence.|$|E
40|$|Competition {{policy is}} {{made at the}} {{national}} level but {{a great deal of the}} business activity that it seeks to regulate takes place at the international level. Though it is universally accepted that some level of international cooperation is necessary to make regulation effective under these conditions, there is a considerable diversity of views on the question of how much cooperation is appropriate. The presence of international activity distorts competition policy in at least two ways. First, it causes the preferred domestic policies of states to diverge from what they would be in the absence of such activity. States that are net exporters of goods sold in imperfectly competitive markets have an incentive to weaken their antitrust rules and states that are net importers of such goods have reason to tighten theirs. Second, the choice of law rules adopted to establish the jurisdictional reach of domestic law create an additional divergence between the <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> actually chosen and those that would be chosen by a closed economy. States that choose to limit their laws to activities that take place within their territory are better off if they also weaken their <b>substantive</b> <b>laws.</b> States that extend the reach of their laws generate overlapping jurisdiction and force firms to run a gauntlet of legal rules that includes the strictest elements of each state’s laws, leading to a de facto regulatory standard that is stricter than that of any single state. This chapter explains why these problems cannot be resolved through the sort of low levels of cooperation that dominate current international antitrust efforts. Information sharing in particular cannot address the distortions to competition policy generated by cross-border business. Choice of law strategies can improve the regulatory framework, but can only partially address the problem and even this would require a dramatic change to existing policies. What is required, then, is a deeper form of cooperation on the subject of <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> or international standards. Though cooperation of this sort is difficult to achieve, there is no other way to address the policy distortions created when national authorities try to regulate international competition...|$|R
