40|$|Abstract Background Carbenoxolone (CBX) is {{a widely}} used gap {{junctional}} blocker. Considering several reports indicating that transient gap junctional blockade could be a favourable intervention following injuries to central nervous tissue, and some current enthusiasm in studies using systemic injections of CBX, {{it is imperative to}} consider the penetration of CBX into central nervous tissue after <b>systemic</b> <b>administrations.</b> So far, only very indirect evidence suggests that CBX penetrates into the central nervous system after <b>systemic</b> <b>administrations.</b> We thus determined the amounts of CBX present in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid of rats after intraperitoneal administration, using high performance liquid chromatography Results CBX was found in the blood of the animals, up to 90 minutes post-injection. However, the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of CBX was negligible. Conclusion Thus, we conclude that, most likely, CBX does not penetrate the blood brain barrier and therefore recommend careful consideration in the manner of administration, when a central effect is desired. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare from a societal perspective {{the costs of}} <b>systemic</b> methotrexate <b>administration</b> with those of laparoscopic salpingostomy {{for the treatment of}} patients with tubal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: An economic evaluation was set up in tandem with a multicenter randomized clinical trial that compared <b>systemic</b> methotrexate <b>administration</b> and laparoscopic salpingostomy for the treatment of 100 hemodynamically stable patients with laparoscopically confirmed unruptured tubal pregnancy. Data on resources used for treatment and lost production time were prospectively collected and costs of both treatments were calculated by multiplying actual expenses for resource units at a single center and resource unit use measured in all centers. Costs were originally calculated in Dutch guilders and converted to US dollars at a rate of 1. 67 guilders/$ 1. RESULTS: Because clinical outcomes of the trial were equivalent for the 2 strategies a cost-minimization analysis was done. Mean total costs per patient were $ 5721 for <b>systemic</b> methotrexate <b>administration</b> and $ 4066 for laparoscopic salpingostomy, with a mean difference of $ 1655 (95 % confidence interval, $ 906 -$ 2414). Costs of <b>systemic</b> methotrexate <b>administration</b> were similar to those of salpingostomy for patients in whom the initial serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentration was 3000 IU/L. CONCLUSIONS: Although <b>systemic</b> methotrexate <b>administration</b> is safe and effective for the treatment of tubal pregnancy, it does not necessarily reduce costs. Systemic methotrexate therapy could reduce costs if administered to patients with low initial serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations without confirmatory laparoscop...|$|R

25|$|Administration {{through the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract is sometimes termed enteral or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, {{in the sense}} that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for <b>systemic</b> <b>administration,</b> as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.|$|E
