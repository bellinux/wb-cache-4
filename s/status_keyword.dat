40|$|An {{established}} body {{of literature}} shows that females {{have higher levels of}} fear than males. Research suggests that women typically resort to rather constraining beha-vioral actions that limit their participation in public life. However, it is unclear whether the strategies women use to avoid victimization are tied to community context, especially for high-risk populations, such as women offenders. We build from insights of previous research by examining what strategies female probationers and parolees use to avoid victimization and their perception of how effective such strategies are in keeping them safe, whether the subjective and objective measures of neighborhood context is related to women’s strategies and whether the strategies used to avoid vic-timization vary by race and economic <b>status.</b> <b>Keyword...</b>|$|E

As a result of various prejudices and stereotypes women bear the so called double burden, meaning their professional and family life. In this thesis we describe the development of women's labour market in the world, in the European Union and also in Slovakia. We focus on individual indicators of their difficult position and later their comparison with the men's labour market. We analyse different forms of government support, especially their difficult position considering their responsibilities at home. Moreover we apply to women mainly as mothers. By research analysis of Institute for Public Affairs we will show you the significant differences between different indicators of their economic <b>status.</b> <b>Keywords</b> female labour market, Slovakia, mother, stereotypes, state promotio...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2008. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract With {{the era of}} Grid computing, data driven experiments and simulations have become very advanced and complicated. To allow specialists from various domains to deal with large datasets, aside from developing efficient extraction techniques, {{it is necessary to}} have available computational facilities to visualize and interact with the results of an extraction process. Having this in mind, we developed an Interactive Visualization Framework, which supports a service-oriented architecture. This framework allows, on one hand visualization experts to construct visualizations to view and interact with large datasets, {{and on the other hand}} end-users (e. g., medical specialists) to explore these visualizations irrespective of their geographical location and available computing resources. The image-based analysis of vascular disorders served as a case study for this project.

40|$|Abstract. In Nigeria, girl-child {{education}} has been facing a number of challenges such as early marriage and economic hardship. That fewer women apply for entry to universities {{is a result of}} their being fewer girls completing secondary education and this problem has its roots in primary school. In the context of an evolving market-oriented, competitive and private-sector driven economy, corporate capitalism and globalization, education is expected to produce women that are versatile enough to acquire competitive positions as well as generate their own employment. However, the schools are often characterized by outmoded operational processes and management structures which are largely incapable of producing female entrepreneurs with the capacity to generate ideas and to turn such ideas to profitable and emotionally satisfying ventures through perseverance and hard work. Education for women and girls therefore, should aim at reversing the trend of gender discrimination by ensuring full empowerment of women in the true sense of raising their <b>status.</b> <b>Keywords.</b> Education, Entrepreneur, Competitiveness, Paradigm shift, Girl-child, Gender.

The tasks performed by internal investigation {{police officers are}} more difficult than those allocated to other officers, because internal investigation officers are investigating colleagues. This study examined the information sources {{that are available to}} internal investigation police officers, as well as how the officers analyze collected information. In-depth interviews with eight officers who have held their current positions for between 8 months and 3 years revealed that the main information sources used by the officers were their peer officers, informants, the Internet, personal profile, wiretapping, and surveillance. For each case, the information sources varied according to the stage of investigation. The financial <b>status,</b> <b>keywords</b> used in conversation, daily habits, and some behaviors were the primary information sources when the officers analyzed the collected information.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} a link between changes in body odor and health status in humans. The main aim {{was to create a}} theoretical overview of the available studies concerning humans, which are compared with studies conducted on mammals. Alteration of body odor due to the ongoing disease may negatively influence not only the odor attractiveness of a potential partner, but also may cause changes in behavioral response to a chemical stimulus for other members of the species. One may assume formation of perceptual adaptations exhibiting sensitivity to markers of health status in both sexes. Recognition of ill individuals may be crucial during social interactions, to prevent transmission of pathogens, but in mate choice the health status may also serve as an important indicator of resistance to infection, which can affect the viability of the offsprings.

40|$|Using {{literature}} on the professions, the article explores how a new political model for funding and steering may affect professional autonomy. Professional groups’ efforts to independently practice their profession during times of political change are elaborated. The professional group in questions is artists, the context is Sweden, and the new model is called the Collaborative Cultural Model. This model entails {{a shift in the}} funding and realization of cultural policy from the national to the regional level. From a situation in which civil servants with specific culture knowledge were involved, politicians, representatives of civil society, civil servants and artists are now to work together to create a regional culture plan. In the article, two different outcomes of the new model are discussed as possible. It can lead to de-professionalization process, particularly if the policy on keeping outside influences at “arm’s length” weakens. On the other hand, negotiations between different actors could result in artists’ knowledge becoming more prominent and receiving more recognition than previously. This, in turn, could promote professional artists’ <b>status.</b> <b>Keywords</b> : Cultural policy, public funding, autonomy, artistic (de) professionalization, dominated and dominating  </p...|$|R

The population pharmacokinetics of ceftolozane/tazobactam were characterized in healthy volunteers, subjects {{with varying degrees of}} renal function, and patients with cIAI or cUTI. Serum concentration data from 376 adults who received ceftolozane/tazobactam in doses ranging from 500 to 3000 mg were analyzed to identify factors contributing to the pharmacokinetic variability. Ceftolozane/tazobactam pharmacokinetics were well described by a linear two-compartment model with first-order elimination and moderate between-subject variability in both clearance and volume of distribution (Vc). For both ceftolozane and tazobactam, clearance was highly correlated with renal function with creatinine clearance influencing exposure, and infection influencing Vc. Body weight was an additional covariate affecting the Vc of ceftolozane. Other covariates tested, such as age, body weight, sex, ethnicity, and presence of infection, had no clinically relevant effects on exposure. The final pharmacokinetic models adequately described the plasma concentrations of ceftolozane and tazobactam and form the basis for further modeling and simulation including evaluation of probability of target attainment in a diverse population with varying demographics, degrees of renal function, and infection <b>status.</b> <b>Keywords</b> ceftolozane/tazobactam, population pharmacokinetics, b-lactam antibacterials, complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infection...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the use of mobile {{telephony}} has become increasingly popular amongst various social and age groups around the world. Out of a need to understand this phenomenon, scholars have conducted {{a number of studies}} on the use of mobile phones and their characteristics such as mobility and accessibility. Few of these studies however, have focused their attention on this phenomenon in less developed countries. This thesis examines the key dimensions associated with the motivations and social implications of the use of mobile phones in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, by high school students. I specifically address the relationship between the motivational factors that lead to the purchase and use of mobile phones as well as the implications for interpersonal relationships and the social structure. I used the Domestication model (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996) along with the notions of 'context', 'rappropriation' and 'revelation' to answer the main research questions and attain the objectives of the study. The overall research findings of this thesis are based on data collected via questionnaire, interviews, and observations held in public places during a two-month field study in Port-au-Prince. The data analysis reveals several findings; the participants' main motives for acquiring and using mobile phones are to provide a sense of security in emergency situations, as a means to communicate with friends and family members and as a symbol to display their <b>status.</b> <b>Keywords.</b> Less developed countries, mobile phone, mobility, immediacy, domestication, motivation, interpersonal relationships, culture, rappropriation...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses Danish {{survey and}} {{register}} data {{to examine the}} effect of maternal inputs on child health at birth. The paper adds to the literature in several ways: First, while previous studies mainly have focused on maternal smoking, this paper factors in a larger number of maternal health behaviors, most importantly prenatal alcohol consumption. Second, it uses prenatal maternal reports on inputs and objective administrative data on child outcomes. Both features of the data reduce the threat of recall bias and measurement error. Third, the paper identifies the effect of health behaviors by exploiting variation between siblings. The results of the paper confirm and extend earlier findings. Maternal smoking decreases birth weight and fetal growth, with smaller effects in sibling models. The negative alcohol effect on birth outcomes is pronounced and remains intact in sibling models. Both effects suggest a dose-response relationship.

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{has suggested that}} female status offenders are often treated more harshly than male status offenders in juvenile court processing. This finding is often explained by the traditional role perspective which suggests that the juvenile court is attempting to protect the sexuality of girls. In addition, there is theoretical and empirical evidence that the effect of gender may vary by race/ ethnicity. This study examines the joint effects of gender and race/ethnicity in the adjudication of status offenders. The findings suggests that Native American boys are the most likely to be adjudicated followed by Black girls and Hispanic girls. Examination of the treatment of girls separately found that White females were the least likely to be adjudicated and Hispanic girls were significantly more likely than White girls to be adjudicated. For males, Native Americans, followed by Hispanic males, were the most likely to be adjudicated.

One factor  in the  working  environment that cause work  inefficiency  is physical factor namely  heat stress, noise and lighting. The influence of physical  factors are indicated by  physical performance of the worker’s blood pressure  and fatigue level. Objective: to find out  the influence of work capacity and physical factors in the working  environment on the blood pressure, pulse, fatigue level of worker in  Arc Furnacearea  and Rolling Mill section, PT Inti General Yaja Steel Semarang. Methode: Type of the research was quasy experimental  with one group pre and post test design. The population were 178 worker  and   47 workers were  taken in this research. Confounding factors was cigarettes, cafein, drug consumption, and nutrition status. Result: There was  found differences of blood pressure before working  and after working (systole; p- Wilcoxon Sign Ranks = 0, 001, diatole; p- Wilcoxon Sign Ranks, = 0, 003). The average before working (systole= 119, 7 mmHg, diastole= 84 mmHg) was higher than after working (systole= 107, 2 mmHg, diastole= 78, 9 mmHg). There was  also  differences of  pulse rate before working  and after working  (p-paired t test= 0, 001).

The developments occurred {{because of the need}} to track and record accounting information in an efficient way toward the purpose of decreasing the violation of government regulations and increasing the consciousness of accountants in this field. Therefore it is crucial for the accounting system to function in an appropriate way, because it {{is directly related to the}} economical development and good organization of the financial market in the state of Kosovo. Since the state is still passing through the period of transition, many changes have occurred on the principles of the accounting system. The methodology used while making this research is the semi-structured interviewing. By this method the literature of Kosovo was reviewed and the results and findings are based on consultations with business firms, professionals at the field of accounting and also books related to accounting development.

40|$|This {{research}} identifies {{methods of}} detecting signs of visual complaints associated with stereoscopic displays. Two potential causes for contradictory results concerning these signs {{in previous research}} are hypothesized: (1) not all clinical tests are equally appropriate, and (2) {{there is a natural}} variation in susceptibility amongst people with normal vision. An optometric screening differentiated participants with moderate binocular status (MBS) from those with good binocular status (GBS). In a 2 × 2 within-subjects design (2 -D vs. 3 -D and MBS vs. GBS), a questionnaire and eight optometric tests (i. e., binocular acuity, aligning prism, fixation disparity, heterophoria, convergent and divergent fusional reserves, vergence facility, accommodation response) were each administered before and immediately after a reading task. Results revealed that only participants with MBS in 3 -D conditions showed clinically meaningful changes in fusion range, experienced more visual discomfort, and performed worse on the reading task. A combination of fusion range measurements and self-report is appropriate for evaluating visual complaints of stereoscopic stills, and people with a MBS are more susceptible to visual complaints associated with stereoscopic displays.
