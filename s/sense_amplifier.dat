50|$|<b>Sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are {{required}} to read the state contained in the DRAM cells. When the access transistor is activated, the electrical charge in the capacitor is shared with the bitline. The bitline's capacitance {{is much greater than}} that of the capacitor (approximately ten times). Thus, the change in bitline voltage is minute. <b>Sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{are required}} to resolve the voltage differential into the levels specified by the logic signaling system. Modern DRAMs use differential <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and are accompanied by requirements as to how the DRAM arrays are constructed. Differential <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> work by driving their outputs to opposing extremes based on the relative voltages on pairs of bitlines. The <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> function effectively and efficient only if the capacitance and voltages of these bitline pairs are closely matched. Besides ensuring that the lengths of the bitlines and the number of attached DRAM cells attached to them are equal, two basic architectures to array design have emerged to provide for the requirements of the sense amplifiers: open and folded bitline arrays.|$|R

The circuit consists of logic cell arrays, dual-rail bit-lines, latch <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and control blocks. By latch <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> a read-out scheme sensing the differential voltage of dual-rail bit-lines caused by charge sharing {{is used for}} high-speed opera-tion. As an application of the proposed PLA, a 32 -bit binary comparator is designed and implemented in a 0. 6 -µm double-poly, triple-metal CMOS process.

50|$|After {{a memory}} word is fetched, the memory is {{typically}} inaccessible {{for an extended}} period of time while the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are charged for access of the next cell. By interleaving the memory (e.g. cells 0, 4, 8, etc. are stored together in one rank), sequential memory accesses can be performed more rapidly because <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> have 3 cycles of idle time for recharging, between accesses.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} circuits in the periphery of CMOS memories[1]. Their performance strongly affects both memory access time, and overall memory power dissipation. As with other ICs today, CMOS memories are required to increase speed, improve capacity and maintain low power dissipation. These objectives are somewhat conflicting when it comes to memory sense-amp design. With increased memory capacity usually comes increased bit-line parasitic capacitance. This increased bit-line capacitance in turn slows down voltage sensing and makes bit-line voltage swings energy expensive resulting in slower more energy hungry memories This paper examines the challenges in today’s sense-amp design, presents the limitations of the most commonly used voltage <b>sensing</b> <b>amplifier</b> and explains how these limitations are overcomed with the use of current <b>sensing</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Page...|$|R
50|$|The <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{operation}} in DRAM is {{quite similar to}} the SRAM, but it performs an additional function. The data in DRAM chips is stored as electric charge in tiny capacitors in the memory cells. The read operation depletes the charge in a cell, destroying the data, so after the data is read out the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> must immediately write {{it back in the}} cell by applying a voltage to it, recharging the capacitor. This is called memory refresh.|$|E
5000|$|This {{operates}} equivalently {{to standard}} SDRAM's activate command, specifying a row address to be {{loaded into the}} bank's <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> array. To save power, a chip may be configured to only activate {{a portion of the}} <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> array. In this case, the SR1..0 bits specify the half or quarter of the row to activate, and following read/write commands' column addresses are required to be limited to that portion. (Refresh operations always use the full row.) ...|$|E
50|$|To read a {{bit from}} a {{particular}} memory cell, the wordline along the cell's row is turned on, activating all the cells in the row. The stored value (Logic 0 or 1) from the cell then comes to the Bit-lines associated with it. The <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{at the end of}} the two complimentary bit-lines amplify the small voltages to a normal logic level. The bit from the desired cell is then latched from the cell's <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> into a buffer, and put on the output bus.|$|E

50|$|The first {{generation}} (1 Kbit) DRAM ICs, {{up until the}} 64 Kbit generation (and some 256 Kbit generation devices) had open bitline array architectures. In these architectures, the bitlines are divided into multiple segments, and the differential <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are placed in between bitline segments. Because the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are placed between bitline segments, to route their outputs outside the array, an additional layer of interconnect placed above those used to construct the wordlines and bitlines is required.|$|R
50|$|To access memory, a row {{must first}} be {{selected}} and loaded into the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> This row is then active, and columns may be accessed for read or write.|$|R
5000|$|In modern {{computer}} memory, a <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is one of}} {{the elements}} which make up the circuitry on a semiconductor memory chip (integrated circuit); the term itself dates back to the era of magnetic core memory. [...] A <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is part of the read circuitry that is used when data is read from the memory; its role is to sense the low power signals from a bitline that represents a data bit (1 or 0) stored in a memory cell, and amplify the small voltage swing to recognizable logic levels so the data can be interpreted properly by logic outside the memory.|$|E
5000|$|To {{read from}} VCSDRAM, after the Active command, a [...] "Prefetch" [...] command is {{required}} to copy data from the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> array to the channel SDRAM. This command specifies a bank, 2 bits of column address (to select the segment of the row), and 4 bits of channel number. Once this is performed, the DRAM array may be precharged while read commands to the channel buffer continue. To write, first the data is written to a channel buffer (typically previous initialized using a Prefetch command), then a Restore command, with the same parameters as the Prefetch command, copies a segment of data from the channel to the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> array.|$|E
5000|$|When {{done with}} reading all the columns {{in the current}} open row, the word-line is {{switched}} off to disconnect the storage cell capacitors (the row is [...] "closed") from the bit-lines. The <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> is switched off, and the bit-lines are precharged again.|$|E
50|$|As part {{of their}} designs, <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> aim at a minimum sense delay, {{required}} level of amplification, minimum power consumption, fit into restricted layout areas, and high reliability and tolerance.|$|R
50|$|The DRAM {{cells that}} are on the edges of the array do not have {{adjacent}} segments. Since the differential <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> require identical capacitance and bitline lengths from both segments, dummy bitline segments are provided. The advantage of the open bitline array is a smaller array area, although this advantage is slightly diminished by the dummy bitline segments. The disadvantage that caused the near disappearance of this architecture is the inherent vulnerability to noise, which affects the effectiveness of the differential <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Since each bitline segment does not have any spatial relationship to the other, it is likely that noise would affect only one of the two bitline segments.|$|R

2500|$|The {{prefetch}} architecture {{takes advantage}} of the specific characteristics of memory accesses to DRAM. Typical DRAM memory operations involve three phases: bitline precharge, row access, column access.

40|$|An {{extremely}} low energy per operation, single cycle 32 bit/word, 128 kb SRAM is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS. In the 850 MHz boost mode, total energy consumption is 8. 4 pJ/access. This reduces to 3. 6 pJ/access {{in the normal}} 480 MHz mode and bottoms out at a very aggressive 2. 7 pJ/access in the 240 MHz low power mode. Several techniques were combined to obtain these performance numbers. Short buffered local bit lines reduce {{the impact of the}} cell read current on memory delay. Extended global bitlines are used which improves delay and energy consumption and which reduces the number of <b>sense</b> <b>amplifiers</b> in the memory to 32.

5000|$|All storage {{cells in}} the open row are sensed simultaneously, and the <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> outputs latched.

5000|$|Modern sense-amplifier {{circuits}} {{consist of}} two to six (usually four) transistors, while early sense amplifiers for core memory sometimes contained as many as 13 transistors.

50|$|In theory, reading only {{requires}} asserting {{the word}} line WL {{and reading the}} SRAM cell state by a single access transistor and bit line, e.g. M6, BL. Nevertheless, bit lines are relatively long and have large parasitic capacitance. To speed up reading, a more complex process is used in practice: The read cycle is started by precharging both bit lines BL and BL, i.e., driving the bit lines to a threshold voltage (midrange voltage between logical 1 and 0) by an external module (not shown in the figures). Then asserting the word line WL enables both the access transistors M5 and M6, which causes the bit line BL voltage to either slightly drop (bottom NMOS transistor M3 is ON and top PMOS transistor M4 is off) or rise (top PMOS transistor M4 is on). It {{should be noted that}} if BL voltage rises, the BL voltage drops, and vice versa. Then the BL and BL lines will have a small voltage difference between them. A <b>sense</b> <b>amplifier</b> will sense which line has the higher voltage and thus determine whether there was 1 or 0 stored.
