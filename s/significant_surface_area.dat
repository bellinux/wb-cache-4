40|$|SummaryNeurons {{establish}} their unique morphology by elaborating multiple neurites that subsequently form axons and dendrites. Neurite initiation entails <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> expansion, necessitating {{addition to the}} plasma membrane. We report that regulated membrane delivery coordinated with the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for neuritogenesis and identify two independent pathways that use distinct exocytic and cytoskeletal machinery to drive neuritogenesis. One pathway uses Ena/VASP-regulated actin dynamics coordinated with VAMP 2 -mediated exocytosis and involves a novel role for Ena/VASP in exocytosis. A second mechanism occurs in the presence of laminin through integrin-dependent activation of FAK and src and uses coordinated activity of the Arp 2 / 3 complex and VAMP 7 -mediated exocytosis. We conclude that neuritogenesis can be driven by two distinct pathways that differentially coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis.

30|$|In {{this article}} we present a summary of {{systematic}} experimental studies of both thermo-physical properties and heat transfer in nanofluids. We believe that the underestimated complexity and the controversy of nanofluid systems {{is related to the}} solid/liquid boundary layers between nanoparticles and the liquid, which at <b>significant</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of nanoparticles contribute to the fluid properties, resulting in three-phase systems. The approach to nanofluids as three-phase systems (instead of traditional consideration of nanofluids as two-phase systems of solid and liquid) allows for deeper understanding of correlations between the engineering parameters, nanofluid properties, and cooling performance. The factors contributing to the fluid cooling efficiency are discussed first, followed by a review of nanofluid engineering parameters and a brief analysis of their contributions to basic thermo-physical properties. Finally, a systems engineering approach is used to describe how various nanofluid parameters contribute to the cooling performance. The latter also offers insights into the principles of the efficient nanofluid design.|$|E

Precise encephalometric data about precuneus are important in the studies of brain lateralization, sex dimorphism, and brain functions in general. In this study, total and visible (exstrasulcal) <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the precuneus were measured on 50 brains of the adult persons (31 male, and 29 female), together with the investigation of {{its relationship to the}} side (left/right) and gender (sex dimorphism). The average total <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the precuneus was 16. 07 cm 2 on the right (males 16. 44 cm 2, females 15. 27 cm 2), and 15. 44 cm 2 on the left (males 15. 67 cm 2, females 14. 62 cm 2). The average visible (extrasulcal) <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of cortex of precuneus was 9. 97 cm 2 on the left (males 10. 75 cm 2, females 8. 91 cm 2), and 9. 38 cm 2 on the right (males 10. 25 cm 2, females 8. 19 cm 2). Exstrasulcal <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of the left precuneus was larger, by 0. 59 cm on the average, which was not statistically <b>significant.</b> Total <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of precuneus of males was significantly larger on the right (16. 44 cm 2) (p< 0. 01) than on the left (15. 67 cm 2). In females it was also larger on the right (15. 27 cm 2) than on the left (14. 62 cm 2), but with no statistical significance. Visible (exstrasulcal) <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of both, (left and right precuneus of males) was highly significantly larger in comparison with the females (p< 0. 001). The obtained results and other facts suggested that sex dimorphism of human brain, including precuneus, was present, but not always easily observable studied or proven in all the details...|$|R
40|$|XRD (X-ray diffraction), XRF (X-ray fluorescence), TG (thermogravimetry), FT-IES (Fourier {{transform}} infrared emission spectroscopy), FESEM (field emission scanning electron microscope), TEM (transmission electron microscope) and nitrogen–adsorption–desorption {{analysis were}} used to characterize the composition and thermal evolution {{of the structure of}} natural goethite. The in situ FT-IES demonstrated the start temperature (250 °C) of the transformation of natural goethite to hematite and the thermodynamic stability of protohematite between 250 and 600 °C. The heated products showed a topotactic relationship to the original mineral based on SEM analysis. Finally, the nitrogen–adsorption–desorption isotherm provided the variation of <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and pore size distribution as a function of temperature. The <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> displayed a remarkable increase up to 350 °C, and then decreased above this temperature. The <b>significant</b> increase in <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> was attributed to the formation of regularly arranged slit-shaped micropores running parallel to elongated direction of hematite microcrystal. The main pore size varied from 0. 99 nm to 3. 5 nm when heating temperature increases from 300 to 400 °C. The hematite derived from heating goethite possesses high <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and favors the possible application of hematite as an adsorbent as well as catalyst carrier...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPrevious studies {{reported}} reduced volumes of many brain regions for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). It {{has also been}} suggested {{that there may be}} widespread changes in network features of TLE patients. It is not fully understood, however, how these two observations are related. MethodsUsing magnetic resonance imaging data, we perform parcellation of the brains of 22 patients with left TLE and 39 non-epileptic controls. In each parcellated region of interest (ROI) we computed the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and, using diffusion tensor imaging and deterministic tractography, infer the number of streamlines and their average length between each pair of connected ROIs. For comparison to previous studies, we use a connectivity ‘weight’ and investigate how ROI <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> number of streamlines & mean streamline length contribute to such weight. ResultsWe find that although there are widespread <b>significant</b> changes in <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and position of ROIs in patients compared to controls, the changes in connectivity are much more subtle. Significant changes in connectivity weight can be accounted for by decreased <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and increased streamline count. ConclusionChanges in the <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of ROIs can be a reliable biomarker for TLE with a large influence on connectivity. However, changes in structural connectivity via white matter streamlines are more subtle with a relatively lower influence on connection weights...|$|R
