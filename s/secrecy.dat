5|$|Moreover, the Council's <b>secrecy</b> {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of <b>secrecy</b> arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent the public from being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|Project X was not {{intended}} to be the title of the film, but it was kept to capitalize on interest generated by the rumored <b>secrecy</b> surrounding the project. Adding to the <b>secrecy,</b> producers decided to not send full scripts to any prospective cast member, instead providing only watermarked individual pages.|$|E

5|$|A {{practice}} {{match was}} recorded on January 13, 2011, {{and the official}} matches were recorded on January 14, 2011. All participants maintained <b>secrecy</b> about the outcome until the match was broadcast in February.|$|E
5|$|Rowling and her {{publishers}} {{have brought}} a series of legal injunctions to ensure the books' <b>secrecy</b> before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from civil liberties campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|The servers of LastPass were vulnerable, {{but due to}} {{additional}} encryption and forward <b>secrecy,</b> potential attacks {{were not able to}} exploit this bug. However, LastPass recommended that its users change passwords for vulnerable websites.|$|E
5|$|Woodward {{asserts that}} the U.S. is {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that this program in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. This program may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The <b>secrecy</b> surrounding the program can, according to Woodward, in some ways {{be compared to the}} Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of <b>secrecy.</b> Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E
5|$|A {{copy of the}} recipe, {{signed by}} Sanders, is held inside a safe inside a vault in KFC's Louisville headquarters, along with eleven vials {{containing}} the herbs and spices. To maintain the <b>secrecy</b> of the recipe, half of it is produced by Griffith Laboratories before it is given to McCormick, who add the second half.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the <b>secrecy</b> of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{may also}} reveal private keys of {{compromised}} parties, which would enable attackers to decrypt communications (future or past stored traffic captured via passive eavesdropping, unless perfect forward <b>secrecy</b> is used, {{in which case}} only future traffic can be decrypted if intercepted via man-in-the-middle attacks).|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} omission {{from the}} Atomic Energy of 1946 was {{any mention of}} non-governmental use of nuclear energy, since military applications overshadowed all others at the time. The restrictions of the act related to <b>secrecy,</b> the control of fissile materials, the ownership of patents and the operation of production facilities placed a number of legal roadblocks {{in the way of}} private nuclear power stations.|$|E
5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and aesthetic effect. The 'vertical rule' is important for interpreting the glyphs correctly, so it may have assisted in <b>secrecy</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|In February 1945, Purnell {{arranged}} for Commander Frederick Ashworth {{to go to}} Guam to brief Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz on the project. He provided Ashworth with a letter from King stressing the project's importance {{and the need for}} <b>secrecy.</b> Ashworth selected a base site for the Manhattan Project's operations. He inspected facilities on Guam and Tinian, and chose the latter.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the major tests, {{a large number of}} minor trials were also carried out, from June 1955 and extended through to April 1963. Although the major tests had been carried out with some publicity, the minor tests were carried out in absolute <b>secrecy.</b> These minor tests left a dangerous legacy of radioactive contamination at Maralinga.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{concerns}} for <b>secrecy</b> kept the military designation of the Katyushas from being {{known by the}} soldiers who operated them. They were called by code names such as Kostikov guns, after {{the head of the}} RNII, the Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute, and finally classed as Guards Mortars. The name BM-13 was only allowed into secret documents in 1942, and remained classified until after the war.|$|E
5|$|It begins after Oberon {{has ordered}} Puck to anoint {{the eyes of}} Demetrius with the love-juice. Titania and her fairies merrily revel ("Come all ye songsters of the sky"), and Night ("See, even Night"), Mystery ("Mystery's song"), <b>Secrecy</b> ("One charming night") and Sleep ("Hush, no more, be silent all") lull them asleep and leave them to {{pleasant}} dreams.|$|E
5|$|Lansdowne visited Agra in November 1890. He and the Munshi met, and Lansdowne {{arranged}} for Karim to be seated with the viceregal staff during a durbar.

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While <b>secrecy</b> {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|<b>Secrecy</b> for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire. British signals intelligence (Ultra) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region, but did not realise that an operation was imminent.|$|E
5|$|Seeing no {{alternative}} to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the federation. Goh Keng Swee, who had become skeptical of merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme <b>secrecy</b> in order to present the British government, in particular, with a fait accompli.|$|E
5|$|The keel of Yamato, {{the lead}} ship of the class, was laid {{down at the}} Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937, in a {{dockyard}} {{that had to be}} adapted to accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and gantry cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme <b>secrecy</b> was maintained throughout construction, a canopy even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view. Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command. A great effort was made in Japan to ensure that the ships were built in extreme <b>secrecy</b> to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} <b>secrecy</b> of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} which {{contributed to the}} {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of South Vietnamese commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South Vietnamese civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of <b>secrecy,</b> which South Vietnamese commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. It is hard to fathom how South Vietnamese commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost <b>secrecy.</b> So when North Vietnamese forces attacked the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, there was little South Vietnamese commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 2013, Beyoncé {{worked on}} the project in strict <b>secrecy,</b> sharing details of the album with a small circle of people and {{continually}} shifting the deadline, which was only finalized a week before its release. She later explained that her intent was to reinstate {{the idea of an}} album release as a significant, exciting event which had lost meaning in the face of hype created around singles.|$|E
5|$|A decade later, the {{brothers}} invested in FortuneFish, a new Nottingham-based mobile game studio started by Tim Stamper's son. FortuneFish released a rhythm-based platform game in 2017 whose {{art and music}} recalled Rare's signature Donkey Kong Country-era style. The company {{is one of several}} new ventures planned by the Stampers. Tim Stamper broke with his reputation for <b>secrecy</b> around the same time by posting publicly on Twitter about Rare's canceled Project Dream.|$|E
5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme <b>secrecy,</b> but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict <b>secrecy,</b> the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the books}} that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and <b>secrecy</b> over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E
5|$|Despite their success, {{the band}} has had several feuds with the {{corporate}} {{side of the}} recording industry. The first was their notable conflict with TVT Records regarding the band's first album, Pretty Hate Machine, which led Reznor to record his follow-up album in <b>secrecy</b> to avoid the label's influence. NIN signed to Interscope Records afterward, but {{after the release of}} their fifth studio album Year Zero in 2007, Reznor announced that the band would release future material independently. The band signed with Columbia Records for the release of their eighth album Hesitation Marks (2013) but returned to self-releasing material with the second Nine Inch Nails EP, Not the Actual Events (2016).|$|E
5|$|For the JATO project, {{they were}} joined by Caltech {{mathematician}} Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who ensured the <b>secrecy</b> of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.|$|E
5|$|He was {{transferred}} to Lublin {{in the summer of}} 1942, where he joined the staff of SS-Brigadeführer Odilo Globočnik, the SS and Police Leader of the Kraków area, as part of Operation Reinhard, the code name given to the establishment of the three extermination camps at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. Nothing is known of his activities in the six months he served with Operation Reinhard; participants were sworn to <b>secrecy.</b> But according to the transcripts of his later trial, Göth was responsible for rounding up and transporting victims to these camps to be murdered.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great <b>secrecy,</b> with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, a {{panel of}} judges was formed to select the final mascots, {{comprising}} representatives of the organizers of Rio 2016, the International Olympic Committee, the Brazilian Olympic Committee, and the Brazilian Paralympic Committee, along with professionals {{in the fields of}} animation, illustration, advertising and market research. The judges unanimously chose a set of two mascots, one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games, created by Birdo, a São Paulo-based animation company. Birdo and the organizers then began to create content featuring the mascots, working in <b>secrecy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Incidents {{had also}} {{occurred}} in the Soviet space program, but due to the government's policy of <b>secrecy,</b> these were not disclosed until well after the Apollo 1 fire. Cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance experiment in a high-oxygen isolation chamber, {{less than three weeks}} before the first Vostok manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Jean Brooks as Jacqueline Gibson, {{the elder}} sister of Mary Gibson. Jacqueline is Mary's only {{relative}} and {{was responsible for}} raising her. Characterized as a depressive, she {{was the owner of}} La Sagasse, a cosmetics company in Manhattan prior to her disappearance. Mary describes Jacqueline as tall and strikingly beautiful. After becoming involved with the Palladists and falling into a deep depression, Jacqueline confided in Dr. Judd about the cult. As a result of the cult's strict rules about <b>secrecy,</b> it is mandated that she must die for revealing information about them.|$|E
5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete <b>secrecy,</b> wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; they even disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E
