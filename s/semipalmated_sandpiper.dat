500|$|The {{first three}} field records of Blyth's pipit, {{including}} an atypical pale individual on the Isles of Scilly, proved difficult, but following {{the occurrence of}} trapped individuals, on Fair Isle in 1993 and Suffolk in 1994, these were accepted. Some records of citrine wagtail and short-toed treecreeper were accepted only after prolonged consideration. Prior to the publication in 1984 of Jonsson and Grant's stint identification paper, a number of stints (Calidris) proved difficult to assess; a paper covering four such cases was published in 1986.

500|$|A {{review of}} <b>semipalmated</b> <b>sandpiper</b> records {{took place in}} the 1970s, {{resulting}} in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of rufous turtle dove records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of lesser kestrel records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of Siberian stonechat were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted. In 2003, the committee revised its assessment criteria for male pine buntings, redefining some birds previously considered hybrids [...] as acceptable, but requiring an overall greater level of precision in descriptions, and reviewed past records in the light of these changes.|$|E

40|$|Background: Geolocators {{are useful}} for {{tracking}} movements of long-distance migrants, but potential negative effects on birds have not been well studied. We tested for effects of geolocators (0. 8 – 2. 0 g total, representing 0. 1 – 3. 9 % of mean body mass) on 16 species of migratory shorebirds, including five species with 2 – 4 subspecies each {{for a total of}} 23 study taxa. Study species spanned a range of body sizes (26 – 1091 g) and eight genera, and were tagged at 23 breeding and eight nonbreeding sites. We compared breeding performance and return rates of birds with geolocators to control groups while controlling for potential confounding variables. Results: We detected negative effects of tags for three small-bodied species. Geolocators reduced annual return rates for two of 23 taxa: by 63 % for <b>semipalmated</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and by 43 % for the arcticola subspecies of dunlin. High resighting effort for geolocator birds could have masked additional negative effects. Geolocators were more likely to negatively affect return rates if the total mass of geolocators and color markers was 2. 5 – 5. 8 % of body mass than if tags were 0. 3 – 2. 3 % of body mass. Carrying a geolocator reduced nest success by 42 % for <b>semipalmated</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and tripled the probability of partial clutch failure in <b>semipalmated</b> and western <b>sandpipers.</b> Geolocators mounted perpendicular to the leg on a flag had stronger negative effects on nest success than geolocators mounted parallel to the leg on a band. However, parallel-band geolocators were more likely to reduce return rates and cause injuries to the leg. No effects of geolocators were found on breeding movements or changes in body mass. Among-site variation in geolocator effect size was high, suggesting that local factors were important. Conclusions: Negative effects of geolocators occurred only for three of the smallest species in our dataset, but were substantial when present. Future studies could mitigate impacts of tags by reducing protruding parts and minimizing use of additional markers. Investigators could maximize recovery of tags by strategically deploying geolocators on males, previously marked individuals, and successful breeders, though targeting subsets of a population could bias the resulting migratory movement data in some species...|$|R

40|$|Declines in avian {{populations are}} a global concern, {{particularly}} for species that migrate between Arctic-temperate and tropical locations. Long-term population studies offer opportunities {{to detect and}} document ecological effects attributable to long-term climatic cycles such as the El Ni~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this study, we report possible population-level effects of such climatic cycles on shorebird species that use two non-breeding season sites in Ecuador (Santa Elena peninsula area, near La Libertad). During our 9 -year study period (1991 / 1992 e 1999 / 2000), there was a particularly strong ENSO warm phase event during 1997 / 1998. Population trend data for three species of shorebird, Western <b>Sandpipers</b> (Calidris mauri), <b>Semipalmated</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (C. pusilla), and Least Sandpipers (C. minutilla), indicated abundances gener-ally declined during the 1990 s, {{but there was an}} increase in the proportion of first-year birds and their abundance in the years following the 1997 / 1998 ENSO warm phase. There was some support for variation in apparent survivorship associated with the onset of the ENSO warm phase event in our population models, based on captureemarkerecapture data. Following the 1997 / 1998 ENSO event onset, individuals for all three species were significantly lighter during the non-breeding season (F 1, 3789 6. 6, p 0. 01). Least-squares mean mass (controlling for size, sex and day of capture) for first-year birds dropped significantly more than for adults following ENSO (first-year mass loss 0. 69 0. 12 g; adult mass loss 0. 34 0. 11 g, F 1, 3789 5. 31, p 0. 021), and least-squares mean mass dropped most during the period when sandpipers prepare for northward migration by gaining mass and moulting into breeding plumage. Least Sandpipers may have declined the most in mean mass follow-ing ENSO (0. 76 0. 19 g), whereas <b>Semipalmated</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> were 0. 52 0. 12 g lighter, and Western Sandpipers 0. 40 0. 13 g lighter, bu...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{potential}} selective importance of predation danger {{on the evolution}} of migration strategies of arctic-breeding calidrid sandpipers. Adult calidrids truncate parental care for reasons not obviously related to levels of food abundance on the breeding areas or at migratory stopover sites, suggesting that a different trade-off occurs between providing additional care and adult survivorship. The southward migrations of adult western sandpipers precede those of migratory peregrine falcons by almost a month. By moving early and quickly, adults remain ahead of migrant falcons all the way to their non-breeding areas, where they rapidly moult flight feathers. They complete the moult just as falcons arrive in late September¿October. By migrating early, they avoid exposure to falcons when they are unusually vulnerable, due to the requirements for fuelling migratory flight and of wing feather moult. Juvenile western sandpipers migrate south just as falcon numbers start to increase, but do not moult flight feathers in their first winter. Pacific dunlin use an alternative strategy of remaining and moulting in Alaska after falcons depart, and migrating to their overwintering sites after migrants have passed. East of the Rocky Mountains, the southbound migration of falcons begins 4 ¿ 6 weeks later. Southbound <b>semipalmated</b> <b>sandpipers</b> make extended migratory stopovers, but their lengths of stay shorten prior to falcon migration to the sites in September. Predation danger also may affect the evolution of migration routes. Southbound western sandpipers fly directly from Alaska to southern British Columbia, in contrast to the multi-stage journey northward along the Alaska panhandle. We estimate that a direct flight would be more economical on northward migration, but may be avoided because it would expose sandpipers to higher mass-dependent predation danger from migratory falcons, which travel north with sandpipers. By contrast, few raptors are present in Alaska during preparation for the southward flight. A temporal and spatial window of safety may also permit <b>semipalmated</b> <b>sandpipers</b> to become extremely vulnerable while preparing for trans-Atlantic southward flights. Danger management may account for the these previously enigmatic features of calidrid migration strategies, and aspects of those of other birds...|$|R

Because providing adequate energetic resources for migratory birds is {{a high priority for}} wetland management, we also measured invertebrate abundance at managed wetlands in the RWB to determine how food abundance influences the occupancy and abundance of sandpipers on wetlands throughout the migratory period. To quantify habitat use, we surveyed wetlands every 7 – 10 days in both regions and visually estimated wetland attributes. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of sandpipers at wetlands in the RWB. The wetland vegetation characteristics that predict sandpiper occupancy are similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR support a higher abundance of sandpipers than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that sandpipers make stopover decisions that balance local and regional wetland conditions. Managers should maintain the cues (i. e., mudflat) and ecological conditions beyond invertebrate abundance that predict sandpiper habitat use to successfully provide resources for sandpipers during migratory stopover if that is a goal of wetland management...|$|R
