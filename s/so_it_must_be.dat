5|$|Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 {{rely on the}} Archimedean {{property}} of the real numbers: {{that there are no}} nonzero infinitesimals. Specifically, the difference 1 − 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two values are the same.|$|E
5|$|There {{a number}} of local Welsh breeds of cow, {{including}} the Welsh Black, a breed which dates back to at least 1874. Cattle farming accounts {{for the majority of}} agricultural output in Wales—in 1998 the production of beef contributed 23% of Welsh agricultural output, whilst in 2002 25% of agricultural output was in the production of dairy products. Welsh beef has a European Union Protected Geographical Indicator, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> wholly reared and slaughtered in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water {{is less of a}} problem.|$|E

5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

25|$|The TECP {{humidity}} sensor {{is a relative}} {{humidity sensor}}, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> coupled with a temperature sensor {{in order to measure}} absolute humidity.

25|$|Fresh fish is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} food product, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are filleted and displayed for sale {{on a bed of}} crushed ice or refrigerated. Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated train and truck transportation has made fresh fish more widely available inland.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the ability}} of thiols to undergo redox reactions, {{cysteine}} has antioxidant properties. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> biosynthesized from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in most Western diets, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting substrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The single-point cutting tools or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> replaced when worn out.|$|E

25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as metallurgical coal), which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The result is pig iron, and is too rich in dissolved carbon, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> treated further to make steel.|$|E
25|$|Up to {{at least}} the seventeenth century bloodhounds were of all colours, but in modern times the colour range has become more restricted. The colours are usually listed as black and tan, liver and tan, and red. White is not {{uncommon}} on the chest, and sometimes appears on the feet. Genetically, the main types {{are determined by the}} action of two genes, found in many species. One produces an alternation between black and brown (liver). If a hound inherits the black allele (variant) from either parent, it has a black nose, eye rims and paw-pads, and if it has a saddle, it is black. The other allele suppresses black pigment and is recessive, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> inherited from both parents. It produces liver noses, eye rims, paw-pads, and saddles.|$|E
25|$|If the {{splitting}} {{goes all}} the way up to the root, it creates a new root with a single separator value and two children, which is why the lower bound on the size of internal nodes does not apply to the root. The maximum number of elements per node is U−1. When a node is split, one element moves to the parent, but one element is added. <b>So,</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> possible to divide the maximum number U−1 of elements into two legal nodes. If this number is odd, then U=2L and one of the new nodes contains (U−2)/2 = L−1 elements, and hence is a legal node, and the other contains one more element, and hence it is legal too. If U−1 is even, then U=2L−1, so there are 2L−2 elements in the node. Half of this number is L−1, which is the minimum number of elements allowed per node.|$|E
