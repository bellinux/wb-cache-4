2500|$|Many reviewers {{complained of}} painful and {{frustrating}} physiological symptoms when playing the Virtual Boy. Bill Frischling, writing for The Washington Post, experienced [...] "dizziness, nausea and headaches." [...] Reviewers attributed the problems {{to both the}} monochromatic display and uncomfortable ergonomics. Several prominent scientists concluded that the long-term side effects could be more serious, and articles published in magazines such as Electronic Engineering Times and CMP Media's TechWeb speculated that using any immersive headset such as the Virtual Boy could cause sickness, flashbacks, and even permanent brain damage. Nintendo, {{in the years after}} Virtual Boy's demise, has been frank about its failure. Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America, <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that the Virtual Boy [...] "just failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Novak disputed Armitage's {{claim that}} the {{disclosure}} was [...] "inadvertent". In a column titled [...] "The real story behind the Armitage story", Novak stated: [...] "First, Armitage did not, as he now indicates, merely pass on something he had heard and that he 'thought' might be so. Rather, he identified to me the CIA division where Mrs. Wilson worked, and <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that she recommended the mission to Niger by her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. Second, Armitage did not slip me this information as idle chitchat, as he now suggests. He made clear he considered it especially suited for my column... {{he noted that the}} story of Mrs. Wilson's role fit the style of the old Evans-Novak column — implying to me it continued reporting Washington inside information." [...] Novak also disputes Armitage's claim that he learned he was Novak's [...] "primary source" [...] (Novak's phrase) only after reading Novak's October 1 column: [...] "I believed [...] contacted me October 1 because of news the weekend of September 27–28 that the Justice Department was investigating the leak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were {{a fool to}} bet at cards, Cal," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>flatly.</b> [...] "But that is {{no reason}} why Stillwater should cheat you. I'll do what I can, but you must promise to leave playing for high stakes alone in the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We're {{going to}} see Riverdance, and that's final," [...] <b>said</b> Tom, <b>flatly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's his name?' <b>said</b> Cytherea <b>flatly.</b> Her {{breath and}} heart had begun their old tricks, and {{came and went}} hotly. Miss Hinton could not see her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hadn't," [...] <b>said</b> Dora <b>flatly.</b> [...] "And I don't {{believe you}} had--really--either," [...] she added, with {{a flash of}} insight that {{was not to be}} {{expected}} of her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{like this}} at all," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>flatly.</b> [...] "Maybe after all {{it would be much}} better to send Tom home and place him under the care of a specialist. If he remains here there is no telling what he will do next. Supposing Spud or Stanley had been drowned in that well hole?" [...] and Dick gave a shiver.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't fool me on a {{thing like}} this," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>flatly.</b> [...] "Onct I see a place it hangs in my mind forever. Same way with a trail. Why onct I struck a trail in the south o' the State, kind o' a mixed trail too. I didn't see thet trail fer nigh onto six years, but when I did see it ag'in I knew it jes' as quick as I clapped eyes on it." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. Well, anyhow, she did; {{and nothing}} would please my mother but that I {{should do the}} same thing. I <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> {{that it was not}} worth my while to face the grind since I was not going in for teaching; but I offered to try for fourth wrangler or thereabouts for fifty pounds. She closed with me at that, after a little grumbling; and I was better than my bargain. But I wouldn't do it again for that. Two hundred pounds would have been nearer the mark.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{promise you}} half the treasure," [...] <b>said</b> Tom <b>flatly.</b> [...] "But {{if you will}} really help us, we'll promise that you shall lose nothing by the transaction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{ruined the}} bread," [...] <b>said</b> Felicity <b>flatly.</b> [...] "It's {{as heavy as}} a stone. I declare, Sara Stanley, I'd rather have a little common sense than be a great story teller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe it," [...] <b>said</b> Anne <b>flatly.</b> In {{her secret}} soul {{she thought that}} the beautiful, poetical things said to AVERIL would win any girl's heart completely. Besides, it was gruesome to hear of AVERIL, the stately, queen-like AVERIL, [...] "pitching" [...] any one. AVERIL [...] "declined her suitors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{it seems}} {{that some of the}} neighbors had told my wife of all that {{happened}} at the club, and she was nearly frightened out of her wits because I had stayed away so long. When I told her of my promise to Cheeko, she <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that she wouldn't lift a paw to help an idle fellow who was always finding fault with everybody instead of getting in his winter's supply of nuts; but after hearing how badly off he was, she took it all back and set about making the herb tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{suspended}} until Doctor Wallington can {{investigate the}} whole matter more thoroughly. He {{wanted me to}} apologize to Sharp, and I <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that I wouldn't do it, because I hadn't anything to apologize for. He got mad at first, and threatened me with instant dismissal. Then I warmed up, and said I was innocent of all wrongdoing, and perhaps I'd {{be able to prove}} it some day, and if so, and I was dismissed, I'd sue the college for loss of reputation. That brought matters to a head, and I guess the doctor saw I was in deadly earnest. He told me I could consider myself suspended for two weeks, or until he could {{get to the bottom of}} the affair. So I've got a holiday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is not!" [...] Bresnahan <b>said</b> <b>flatly.</b> [...] "I {{can speak}} {{by the book}} there. Carol, honey, I'm {{surprised}} to find you talking like a New York Russian Jew, or one of these long-hairs! I can tell you, only you don't need to let every one in on it, this is confidential, I got it from a man who's close to the State Department, but {{as a matter of}} fact the Czar will be back in power before the end of the year. You read a lot about his retiring and about his being killed, but I know he's got a big army back of him, and he'll show these damn agitators, lazy beggars hunting for a soft berth bossing the poor goats that fall for 'em, he'll show 'em where they get off!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never," [...] I <b>said,</b> {{firmly and}} <b>flatly.</b> This {{had to be}} absolute. I felt that {{once and for all}} the [...] "old place" [...] must be ruled out of the {{discussion}} till I could discover where it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure we {{are very}} glad--and we wish you all {{possible}} happiness," [...] <b>said</b> Anne, very <b>flatly</b> and inadequately, as she felt. She was not prepared for such an occasion. She had never imagined herself offering betrothal felicitations to Miss Cornelia.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] <b>said</b> Davy <b>flatly.</b> [...] "Catch me! I have to {{do things}} I don't want to now 'cause you and Marilla'll send me to bed if I don't. But when I grow up you can't do that, and there'll be nobody to tell me not to do things. Won't I have the time! Say, Anne, Milty Boulter says his mother says you're going to college to see if you can catch a man. Are you, Anne? I want to know." ...|$|R
5000|$|The general {{director}} of the Family Service Association of America <b>said</b> <b>flatly,</b> [...] "Victims of poverty, illness, and everyday misfortune should not be made a public spectacle or seemingly {{to be put in}} the position of begging for charity." ...|$|E
5000|$|So {{when the}} man {{appeared}} as usual with their shrieks and products from another world and rushed to greet happy Roque Lina with his beloved songs, he found himself facing the unkindly presence of the girl's father. [...] "Here I am selling," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> to her father. [...] "And my daughter is not rice. So you can go with your music elsewhere, before we have problems. Or I do not know! [...] ". And without adding another word, he took Roque Lina's arm and dragged her with him.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Sands was {{inducted}} into her Alma Mater Bloomsburg High School’s Graduates of Distinction Hall of Fame. She also was asked to threw the ceremonial first pitch to the USA Olympic Softball team during the squads visit to Williamsport in 2007. In addition, {{she sat on the}} panel on two Society for American Baseball Research meetings celebrated in 1974 and 1995. I am truly blessed! The good Lord gave me the love of baseball and the talent to play. I had a dream and God intervened and made it possible. Now it's my turn to repay that debt, she <b>said</b> <b>flatly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I'm going back," [...] <b>said</b> the q-b <b>flatly,</b> and {{she swung}} round. The last red was {{smouldering}} beyond the lost, thin-wooded hills of this interior. A fleece of blue, half-luminous smoke floated over the obscure village. The high-way wound down-hill at our feet, pale and blue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} Dr Watts," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs Monnerie <b>flatly.</b> [...] "The {{point from which}} we have strayed, my dear, is {{that even if you}} were not born great, you were born exquisite; and now here's this Angélique rigmarole----" [...] Her face creased up into its old good-humoured facetiousness: [...] "Was it three inches, Miss Bowater?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I <b>said,</b> {{a trifle}} <b>flatly.</b> I forgot to resent his calling me darling. I {{wondered}} if things wouldn't be rather dull when Max gave up proposing to me. It {{was the only}} excitement I had. But of course it would be best--and he couldn't go on at it forever, so, by the way of gracefully dismissing the subject, I asked him what Miss Shirley was like.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Pilzer founded Zane Prep, Inc. which {{distributes}} Zane Math {{and other}} STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) programs through Zaniac after-school learning centers. By 2016 Zane Prep had opened ten Zaniac Learning Center locations and Pilzer {{and the company}} were featured in national publications ranging from The Boston Globe to CNBC to U.S. News and World Report. Franchise Times magazine compared Pilzer to Elon Musk, and quoted Pilzer saying about Zaniac Instructors: “We don’t hire $40 an hour instructors and mark them up to $80,” he <b>said,</b> <b>flatly.</b> “We hire ivy league-bound future Nobel Prize winners.” ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{review in}} the Boston Globe stated that Ruby & the Rockits {{has no right to}} be as likable as it is, and called the show [...] "a warm intergenerational comedy that never pushes life lessons in your face." [...] Similarly, The Hollywood Reporters Randee Dawn noted the [...] "same unicorn-and-rainbows flavor Disney has been {{shilling}} out for years", but adds that this [...] "makes it practically perfect in every way." [...] In a review for Variety, Brian Lowry called the show [...] "borderline ridiculous" [...] and stated that [...] "theres nothing much to recommend." [...] Furthermore, the Los Angeles Times review <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that [...] "it is not especially good." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many reviewers {{complained of}} painful and {{frustrating}} physiological symptoms when playing the Virtual Boy.

5000|$|In Season Eight's second episode [...] "The Longer You Stay", Weaver {{failed to}} answer {{repeated}} pages from Doctors Malucci & Chen {{when a patient}} being tended to by them had complications. Weaver was finally hauled in by Dr. Carter when he ran from the ER to get her personally from Doc Magoo's, sustaining a painful fall in the process. But after the patient died and she <b>flatly</b> <b>said</b> to the three [...] "You killed him.", she was seen back at Doc Magoo's where she found the pager she left in the bathroom stall.|$|R
5000|$|John Rockwell {{wrote in}} the New York Times [...] "...it can be <b>flatly</b> <b>said</b> that the best {{performance}} (and the most unusually interesting piece, too) was Mr. Hegyi's account of Barber's one-movement symphony, which had its premiere in 1936, was revised in 1944 and championed by Artur Rodzinski and Bruno Walter. The score blends considerable passion with Barber's wonderfully characteristic arching lyricism. Mr. Hegyi, who has {{a good deal of}} experience with 20th-century American music, given the Albany Symphony's venturesome commitment to that cause, played it with a sure technical command that never {{got in the way of}} expressivity." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} 2014 situation, others came {{forward in the}} {{following}} days, including 2011-12 ACHA team players Katie Vaughan, Ashton Schaffer and Abbey Dufoe. Vaughan said that [...] "it {{became clear to me}} that this man has a destructive personality and he meant the team no well-being" [...] while recalling a conversation involving Brandwene pressing her about personal issues. Both she and Schaffer detailed other instances of emotional manipulation that almost caused them to end decade-plus playing careers, while Dufoe <b>flatly</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "no one should be treated like that." [...] One father of an anonymous current player said that his daughter would transfer if Brandwene is retained as coach, and that [...] "he has heard other parents say the same thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{debate in}} 1987, Brown {{had been asked}} {{if there were any}} {{circumstances}} in which he could support Edwards in the general election. He demurred a straight answer to the [...] "hypothetical" [...] question. Roemer, however, <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that he would not support Edwards in a second race regardless of Edwards' opponent. This was somewhat ironic in that Roemer's father, Charles E. Roemer, II, had been Edwards' first commissioner of administration. The senior Roemer, however, had been convicted of bribery in 1980 and later served a prison sentence. Some think Roemer's answer to the question about possibly supporting Edwards gave him the needed momentum to overcome Livingston, Tauzin, and Brown. Ironically, though in 1991, Roemer did endorse Edwards over the unendorsed Republican candidate, David Duke.|$|E

5000|$|In October 2013, Stapp {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that extensive work was done on the new album throughout 2011 and 2012. However, the project was suddenly abandoned, and Stapp stated he was unaware as to why. Stapp also hinted that the relationship between himself and Tremonti had once again broken down, leaving the future of the band uncertain. In December 2013, Stapp elaborated on this, saying Tremonti is dictating to him what he wants the band's creative direction to be, and that Stapp does not want to work with him [...] "under those circumstances". In January 2014, Stapp once again confirmed {{in an interview}} the personal and creative differences between him and Tremonti, stating that future material by the band looks unlikely to happen at the moment, and that he is concentrating on his solo career. Despite these differences, Stapp has maintained that the band is still together, if inactive, saying that [...] "There's no real time table, we're still a band." [...] He's also said that he's always open to continuing to work on a new album when the time is right and if everyone can agree to continue. However, in October 2014, Mark Tremonti <b>said</b> <b>flatly</b> that the band has [...] "no plans at the moment" [...] to reform for another album or tour.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, Quaife was {{inducted}} into the UK Music Hall of Fame with Kinks, marking the final reunion of the four original band members. In December 2007, Record Collector published an interview with Ray Davies, in which he was quoted as saying, [...] "I spoke to Quaife about a month ago and he dearly wants to make another record with me". The tabloid press picked up on this quote, {{and turned it into a}} story saying that the Kinks were reforming for a tour in 2008. However, in an interview aired on the Biography Channel in December 2008, Quaife <b>flatly</b> <b>said</b> he would never participate in any type of Kinks reunion. In March 2009, Quaife released a statement that he was permanently retiring from the public eye.|$|R
40|$|There {{was once}} {{consensus}} that the earth is flat. Similarly, the international legal situation of Israeli settlements is <b>flatly</b> <b>said</b> to be criminal. The truth is different and more complex. Ben Saul’s recent article on the “dirty politics of Israel’s criminal colonial enterprise” was passionate in its hostility to Israeli settlements but its legal arguments were lacklustre. He declared the existence of 50 years of consensus among the United Nations General Assembly, Security Council and the International Court of Justice concerning the illegality of the settlements, but {{there has never been}} such a thing. Urban construction by Israelis in the area known as the “West Bank” began in the 1970 s and now cover about 2 % of the territory. Opinion concerning the legality of these Jewish settlements varies across experts and also across particular buildings...|$|R
