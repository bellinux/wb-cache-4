40|$|Abstract Despite {{the growing}} {{literature}} on facultative sex-ratio adjustment in chromosomal sex-determining ver-tebrate taxa (birds, mammals), {{the consistency of}} results is often low between studies and species. Here, we investigate the primary and <b>secondary</b> offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of a small passerine bird, the Eurasian Penduline Tit (Remiz pendu-linus) in three consecutive years. This species has a uniquely diverse breeding system, in which the male (and/or the female) abandons the nest during egg-laying, and starts a new breeding attempt. This allowed us to test (1) whether patterns of parental care, i. e., male-only care, female-only care or biparental desertion, influence offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio,</b> and (2) whether the offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> is repeatable between successive clutches of males and females. Using molecular markers to sex 497 offspring in 176 broods, we show that (1) offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> {{does not depend on}} which parent pro-vides care, and (2) the offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> is not repeatable between clutches of a given individual. The overall primary and <b>secondary</b> offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> at a population level is not different from parity (54 ± 6 % males, and 50 ± 3 % (mean ± SE), respectively). We suggest that ecological and phenotypic factors, rather than individual traits of parents, may influence offspring’s sex, and conclude that there is currently no evidence for a facultative adjustment of off-spring <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> in the Penduline Tit...|$|R

The present study aimed at determining whether this male-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> was due to an imbalance of fertilization by X and Y chromosome-bearing sperms {{or whether it was}} the consequence of a sex-related differential survival of embryos. The sex of embryos sired by sham-operated (SH) controls or males subjected to bilateral ablation of ampullary glands (AGX), CGX and SVX was determined from chromosomal spreads at 10 h post coitum and 10 days post coitum.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that the <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> of wild vertebrate populations are determined by mechanisms that are directly influenced by environmental characteristics. The Trivers–Willard (TWH) and extrinsic modification (EMH) hypotheses postulate differing determinants of mammalian offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> TWH states that mothers allocate resources according to their current condition and sex-specific offspring costs. EMH states that environmental forces that affect maternal condition determine offspring <b>sex</b> <b>ratios,</b> independently of maternal tactics of sex-biased allocation. We statistically assessed support {{for each of these}} hypotheses using long-term life histories of the allied rock-wallaby, Petrogale assimilis; a continuously breeding, polygynous, weakly dimorphic marsupial.

However, <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> were male-biased under good environmental conditions and for high quality mothers or mothers in good condition. Sex differences in offspring survival contributed to these biases: (1) environmental conditions strongly influenced survival to pouch emergence (in support of EMH) and (2) maternal quality affected survival to the end of maternal care (in support of TWH).

40|$|Sex of {{offspring}} in most turtles {{is determined}} by temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). In sea turtles, higher incubation temperatures produce female hatchlings and primary <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> are often highly female-biased. Because of {{the current rate of}} climate warming, highly female-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> have raised concern among scientists and managers because populations might become too female biased for genetic viability. We tested the effects of higher incubation temperatures on embryo and hatchling mortality and on <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in a population of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the eastern Pacific. The long-term study provided a large sample size in a location influenced by El Niño Southern Oscillation that resulted in highly variable climatic conditions between seasons. High temperatures reduced emergence success. Output of female hatchlings increased with incubation temperature as it reached {{the upper end of the}} transitional range (range of temperatures that produce both sexes) (30. °C) and decreased afterwards because high temperatures increased mortality of 'female clutches'. Effect of temperature on female hatchling output lessened female-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> from 85 % female primary <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> to 79 % <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> of total number of hatchlings emerged). If male turtles reproduce more often than females, operational <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> will be closer to 1 : 1.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} suggests that individual variability in sex-related traits may be influenced by variations in hormonal exposure during fetal development. In litter-bearing mammals, fetuses develop in utero and may be subjected to differing hormonal environments based upon the sex of neighboring fetuses. Female fetuses developing between two males tend to show masculinized anatomical, physiological and behavioral traits as adults. Female fetuses developing without adjacent males, on the other hand, tend to show more feminized traits as adults. These traits include permanently altered hormone levels, reproductive organs, aggressive behaviors, <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> and susceptibility to endocrine disruption. This intrauterine effect is due to the transfer of testosterone from male fetuses to adjacent fetuses. While these effects have been most clearly demonstrated in mice, other rodents and swine also show intrauterine position (IUP) effects. Some of these effects are similar to the influence of prenatal stress on adult phenotypes. A few reports on human twins suggest that variability in some masculine and feminine traits may be due to intrauterine hormonal signals. IUP effects may impact a number of scientifi...|$|R

The goal is to describe the development of this index in 1950 - 2008 period {{in the world}}. First, the world is analyzed at the level of "subregion", followed by the analysis of the continents and then a summary of the results. Calculations for the level of "subregion" are compared with estimates of the UN.

The summary of this paper consists of theoretical assumptions that could affect the child's sex. That is why, these assumptions are often associated with epigenetic factors influencing the sex of some animals. In the analysis of the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> the importance of data reliability, which plays a key role, is highlighted.

40|$|Introduction <b>Secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> (SSR) is the {{proportion}} of males to females at birth. It {{has been shown in}} many different mammalian species, many factors are associated with SSR. Changes in <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> in dairy cows is considered economically important and the ability to change it could affect the revenues and profitability of a dairy farm. Thus, sperm or embryo sexing techniques in recent years has attracted more attention. Most breed of dairy cattle {{are more likely to have}} female calf is born to use them as replacement heifers and in order to maintain their productive herd number. On the contrary, when the goal is the production of meat, bull calves due to higher growth rates and production efficiency, are more convenient and more economically efficient. The aim of present study was to investigate some key factors affecting SSR in Iranian Holstein cows. According to Fisher, the sex ratio in the population under the control of natural selection is not always the same. There is overwhelming evidence to support the theory that shows Fisher Primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> sex ratio can deviate from this balance and natural selection caused a change in this ratio can be in certain circumstances. For example, the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of 52 : 48 has been reported in dairy cows. Studies on mammalian species suggest that several factors, including latitude of the location, the dominant regional climate model, time and frequency of mating to ovulation, diet, age of parents, physical score, breed and produced eggs from ovarian left or right can have a significant effect on the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio.</b> Weather conditions may modify the internal environment and the effect on physiological mechanisms or through the impact on the frequency and type of foods available to parents, the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> is impressive. The impact on the quantity and quality of parent's access to food sources in many species of mammals, the sex ratio has been fixed. Previous reports have shown that high environmental temperature and higher rates of evaporation from a week to a month before conception <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> was increased. Materials and method The demographic, production and reproduction data of six large dairy farms between years 1375 and 1389 were used. The rolling average of 305 d fat corrected milk yield was 8145 kg with a range of 7578 to 8670 Kg. Breeding Center of Iran and the herds covered by the registration and recording them on a regular basis carried out by experts dairy cooperatives. The flocks were in the area northeast of the country. Production data (date corrected milk production and the cumulative production by 60 and 305 days of lactation), reproductive data (such as calving year, calving season, type of birth, sex of calf, the latest information on AI, days open), and details the possible removal of the flock or death were recorded.

40|$|OBJECTIVEIn {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the evidence for}} sex differences in fetal programming {{within the context of}} the proposed viability-vulnerability tradeoff. METHODSWe briefly review the literature on the factors contributing to primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> <b>Sex</b> differences in fetal programming are assessed by summarizing previously published sex difference findings from our group (6 studies) and also new analyses of previously published findings in which sex differences were not reported (6 studies). RESULTSThe review and reanalysis of studies from our group are consistent with the overwhelming evidence of increasing risk for viability among males exposed to environmental adversity early in life. New evidence reported here support the argument that females, despite their adaptive agility, also are influenced by exposure to early adversity. Two primary conclusions are (i) female fetal exposure to psychobiological stress selectively influences fear/anxiety, and (ii) the effects of female fetal exposure to stress persist into preadolescence. These persisting effects are reflected in increased levels of anxiety, impaired executive function and neurological markers associated with these behaviors. CONCLUSIONSA tacit assumption is that females, with their adaptive flexibility early in gestation, escape the consequences of early life exposure to adversity. We argue that the consequences of male exposure to early adversity threatens their viability, effectively culling the weak and the frail and creating a surviving cohort of the fittest. Females adjust to early adversity with a variety of strategies, but their escape from the risk of early mortality and morbidity has a price of increased vulnerability expressed later in development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Sex</b> <b>ratios</b> can inXuence mating behaviour, {{population}} dynamics and evolutionary trajectories; yet {{the causes of}} natural <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> variation are often uncertain. Although <b>secondary</b> (birth) <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are typically 1 : 1, we recorded female-biased ter-tiary (adult) <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in about half of our 48 samples and male-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> in none of them. This pattern implies that some populations experience male-biased mortality, perhaps owing to variation in predation or resource limita-tion. We assessed the eVects of predation and/or inter-speciWc resource competition (intraguild predation) by measuring the local catch-per-unit-eVort (CPUE) of species (Rivulus killiWsh and Macrobrachium prawns) that may diVerentially prey on male guppies. We assessed the eVects of resource levels by measuring canopy openness and algal biomass (chlorophyll a concentration). We found that guppy <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> were increasingly female-biased with increasing CPUE of Macrobrachium, and perhaps also Riv-ulus, and with decreasing canopy openness. We also found an interaction between predators and resource levels in that the eVect of canopy openness was greatest when Macrob-rachium CPUE was highest.

40|$|Sexual dimorphisms {{in adult}} size (SSD) and {{development}} time (SDTD) occur in many groups of organisms. In insects, {{some of the}} best examples occur in parasitoid wasps where most studies report that females are larger than males but take longer to develop. Sex-specific differences in the effects of size on reproductive success is generally regarded as the main factor responsible for SSD in parasitoids. Most studies also assume that development time must be extended in order to achieve larger size. Here, SSD and SDTD were compared in the solitary endoparasitoid, Microplitis mediator that develops in larvae of the moth Pseudoplusia includens. The relationship between male and female body size and development time were isometric in M. mediator, but contradict most predictions of parasitoid development models. Across first to fourth instars at parasitism, male wasps were consistently larger than females but completed their development significantly faster. The longer development time in female wasps was due primarily to an extended pupal phase, whereas the duration of larval development did not vary significantly with offspring <b>sex.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> (percentage male) also did not vary with host instar. We conclude that SSD in M. mediator is not only a function of extended development time, but also because of several possible factors: (i) selection favours an increase in male size (relative to female size); (ii) female size is constrained because of predation risk, (iii) as a cost of reducing the cost of inbreeding or (iv) constraints on egg maturation rate. We argue that failure to look carefully at how parasitoids grow can lead to incorrect conclusions about the basis or significance of SSD.

40|$|Across various animal taxa {{not only}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> but also the primary sex ratio (at conception) shows {{significant}} deviations from the expected equal proportions of sons and daughters. Birds are especially intriguing to study this phenomenon as avian females are the heterogametic sex (ZW); therefore sex determination might be under direct control of the mother. Avian sex ratios vary in relation to environmental or maternal condition, which can also affect the production of maternal steroids that in turn are involved in reproduction and accumulate in the developing follicle before meiosis. As the proximate mechanisms underlying biased primary sex ratio are largely elusive, we explored how, and to what extent, maternal steroid hormones {{may be involved in}} affecting primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> in clutches of various species of pigeons. First we demonstrated a clear case of seasonal change in sex ratio in first eggs both in the Rock Pigeon (Columba livia) and in a related species, the Wood Pigeon (Columba palumbus), both producing clutches of two eggs. In the Homing Pigeon (Columba livia domestica), domesticated from the Rock Pigeon, testosterone treatment of breeding females induced a clear male bias, while corticosterone induced a female bias in first eggs and we argue that this is in line with sex allocation theory. We next analyzed treatment effects on follicle formation, yolk mass, and yolk hormones, the latter both pre- and post-ovulatory, in order to test a diversity of potential mechanisms related to both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> manipulation. We conclude that maternal plasma hormone levels may affect several pre- ovulatory mechanisms affecting primary sex ratio, whereas egg hormones are probably involved in <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> manipulation only. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEven though Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula) is a well-studied, {{keystone}} {{tree species}} with high ecological, commercial and cultural value, significant gaps {{in our understanding}} of its reproductive biology exist, particularly the factors limiting fruit and seed production, seed fate and the persistence of the seed bank. Therefore, a detailed quantitative assessment of these factors was conducted at five sites in the low altitude savannas of South Africa. Sites varied with respect to fire regime, large mammals, geology and rainfall. Most sites showed male-biased <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> and the minimum fruiting stem diameter ranged between 7. 1 and 15. 7 cm across sites. Sites with higher levels of disturbance (fire and large browsers) had trees producing fruit at larger minimum stem diameters than sites with lower levels of disturbance. Fruit production was highly variable between individuals, within and between sites, and from year to year. Variability in fruit production across years at one site was greater than the variability across sites in one year, indicating that drivers such as weather, insect herbivory, fire and predator numbers, which vary annually, play a greater role than more constant drivers such as mammalian herbivory, soil types or long-term rainfall. No significant relationship was found between environmental variables (rainfall and temperature) and annual fruit production, indicating a trade-off between vegetative growth and reproduction between years. Since marula fruits are large and heavy, the species relies primarily on mammalian dispersal agents such as the African elephant, which have also been shown to increase the germination rate. However, rodents also appear to {{play a significant role in}} seed dispersal. Seed predation rates tend to be highest in areas of low disturbance (no fire and no large browsers). While marula has a small persistent seed bank, recruitment appears to be reliant on the current season's fruit crop. This study provides a detailed quantitative assessment of important reproductive and seed fate vital rates for future population modelling...|$|R
40|$|Because {{workers in}} the eusocial Hymenoptera are {{more closely related to}} sisters than to brothers, theory predicts that natural {{selection}} should act on them to bias (change) sex allocation to favor reproductive females over males. However, selection should also act on queens to prevent worker bias. We use a simulation approach to analyze the coevolution of this conflict in colonies with single, once-mated queens. We assume that queens bias the primary (egg) <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> and workers bias the <b>secondary</b> (adult) <b>sex</b> <b>ratio,</b> both at some cost to colony productivity. Workers can bias either by eliminating males or by directly increasing female caste determination. Although variation among colonies in kin structure is absent, simulations often result in bimodal (split) colony <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> This occurs because of the evolution of two alternative queen or two alternative worker biasing strategies, one that biases strongly and another that does not bias at all. Alternative strategies evolve because the mechanisms of biasing result in accelerating benefits per unit cost with increasing bias, resulting in greater fitness for strategies that bias more and bias less than the population equilibrium. Strategies biasing more gain from increased biasing efficiency whereas strategies biasing less gain from decreased biasing cost. Our study predicts that whether queens or workers evolve alternative strategies depends upon the mechanisms that workers use to bias the <b>sex</b> <b>ratio,</b> the relative cost of queen and worker biasing, and the rates at which queen and worker strategies evolve. Our study also predicts that population and colony level sex allocation, as well as colony productivity, will differ diagnostically according to whether queens or workers evolve alternative biasing strategies and according to what mechanism workers use to bias sex allocation...|$|R

Explanations of the association include reduced conception of males and increased fetal deaths among males. The latter explanation has been supported by research reporting that the sex ratio in California fell 3 months, but not 8, 9 or 10 months, {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11, 2001. California’s distance from the attacks raises the questions of whether the results arose from chance and would be found elsewhere.

Mice on the low DCAD diet had a lower urine pH (mean (±s. d.) 6. 0 ± 0. 1) than mice on the high DCAD diet (8. 2 ± 0. 6), but DCAD did not affect the percentage of mice that became pregnant, the number of offspring per pregnant mouse or the sex ratio of the neonate group. These results suggest that blood pH alone does not alter sex ratio and that an altered systemic pH is not the reason for reported mineral-related variations in sex ratio...|$|E
40|$|The human <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> {{reportedly}} {{falls in}} populations subjected to exogenous stressors such as earthquakes or {{political and social}} upheavals. Explanations of the association include reduced conception of males and increased fetal deaths among males. The latter explanation has been supported by research reporting that the sex ratio in California fell 3 months, but not 8, 9 or 10 months, {{after the terrorist attacks}} of September 11, 2001. California's distance from the attacks raises the questions of whether the results arose from chance and would be found elsewhere. We contribute to the literature by testing the association between the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> and the events of September 11 in New York City. We replicate the California tests by applying interrupted time-series methods, which control for secular trends, seasonality and other forms of autocorrelation, to 91 cohorts born in New York City during 28 -day periods from January 1996 to June 2002. As hypothesized, the sex ratio in New York City in the period 1 January to 28 January 2002 fell to 1, which was the lowest observed value during the test period and significantly (i. e. P < 0. 01, two-tailed test) below the value expected from history. Our findings support the male fetal loss explanation of the association between exogenous population shocks and the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|Social parasitism, one of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} phenomena in ants, has evolved to various levels, the most extreme form being parasites that have lost the worker caste and rely completely on the host's worker force to raise their brood. A remarkable feature of workerless social parasites is the small size of sexuals. It has been suggested that reduced size evolved as a means {{to take advantage of the}} host's caste-determination system, so that parasite larvae develop into sexuals with less food than is required to produce host workers. An important consequence of size reduction is that it might restrict the host workers' ability to discriminate between the brood of the social parasite and their own brood and might protect parasite sexuals from elimination. We found that sexuals of the workerless inquiline ant Plagiolepis hene were significantly smaller than the sexuals of their host Plagiolepis pygmaea, but remarkably similar to the host workers. The size variance of parasite sexuals was much lower than that of their host; this result possibly suggests that there is very stabilizing selection acting on size of the parasite sexuals. Comparison of the primary (egg) and <b>secondary</b> (adult) <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> of the parasite and host showed that miniaturization of their sexuals has been accompanied by their ability to develop into sexuals even when the host P. pygmaea actively prevents production of its own sexuals. These results suggest that the inquiline's size and caste threshold have been reduced such that all individuals in a parasite brood will develop into sexuals. We also found that the adult <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of P. xene was heavily female-biased. This bias probably stems from local mate competition that arises from sexuals mating within the nest. There was no significant difference between the proportion of haploid eggs and adult males produced; this observation indicates that a female-biased <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> is achieved by queens producing a higher proportion of diploid eggs rather than by a higher mortality of haploid males...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study we showed that broods from the viviparous eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) were significantly male biased in 1998 {{in the vicinity of}} a large kraft pulp mill on the Swedish Baltic coast. One suggested hypothesis was that masculinizing compounds in the effluent were affecting gonadal differentiation of the embryos, resulting in skewed <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> In this article, we present further evidence for a causal relationship between the exposure to the effluent and the malebiased <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> Analyses of historical samples showed that the eelpout produced male-biased broods close to the mill in 1997 in addition to 1998. During 1999, the mill was shut down for 17 days, coinciding with the period when the gonads of the eelpout embryos differentiate. Subsequently, in the fall of 1999, the <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> were no longer male biased; however, the following year (2000), a significant male bias reappeared. Investigations at 13 sites for up to 4 years showed a relatively stable <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> around 50 / 50, with the exceptions by the mill and with few observations of deviating ratios at other sites. Several reports document endocrine disturbances in fish near pulp and paper mills, including the expression of male <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> characters in female fish. The repeatedly identified male bias at the investigated mill, the normalization after mill shutdown, and the reappearance the following year indicate that pulp mill effluents also can affect <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> of nearby fish.

40|$|By {{analyzing}} isofemale strains {{extracted from}} a natural population of Nasonia vitripennis, we detected variation for the <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> produced in fresh hosts (first <b>sex</b> <b>ratios)</b> and in previously parasitized hosts (second <b>sex</b> <b>ratios).</b> Under simple assumptions of population structure, this between-strain heterogeneity of first <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> results in heterogeneity of fitnesses. There is approximately ten percent difference in average fitnesses between the strains. (The fitnesses of second <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> are analyzed {{in the accompanying}} paper.) Average first and average second <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> are uncorrelated. There is significant between-female heterogeneity within some strains for first <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> but not for second <b>sex</b> <b>ratios.</b> In addition, the average direct-developing and diapause first <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> (but not second <b>sex</b> <b>ratios)</b> are significantly correlated.

40|$|Many {{factors have}} been {{hypothesized}} to affect the human <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> (the annual percentage of males among all live births), among them race, parental ages, and birth order. Some authors have even proposed warfare as a factor influencing live birth sex ratios. The hypothesis that during and shortly after periods of war the human <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> is higher has received little statistical treatment. In this paper we evaluate the war hypothesis using 3 statistical methods: linear regression, randomization, and time-series analysis. Live birth data from 10 different countries were included. Although we cannot speak of a general phenomenon, statistical evidence for an association between warfare and live birth sex ratio was found for several countries. Regression and randomization test results were in agreement. Time-series analysis showed that most human sex-ratio time series can be described by a common model. The results obtained using intervention models differed somewhat from results obtained by regression methods...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-dimensional logistic model to study populations with two genders. The growth {{behavior of a}} population is guided by two coupled ordinary differential equations given by a non-differentiable vector field whose parameters are the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> (the ratio of males to females at time of birth), inter-, intra- and outer-gender competitions, fertility and mortality rates and a mating function. For the case {{where there is no}} inter-gender competition and the mortality rates are negligible with respect to the density-dependent mortality, using geometrical techniques, we analyze the singularities and the basin of attraction of the system, determining the relationships between the parameters for which the system presents an equilibrium point. In particular, we describe conditions on the <b>secondary</b> <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> and discuss the role of the average number of female sexual partners of each male for the conservation of a two-sex species.

In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> {{are not necessarily}} even, which has important demographic consequences. We examined the <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> of juvenile pelagic stage loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta offshore Madeira Island, North Eastern Atlantic, using laparoscopy and histology.

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{maternal}} families collected from natural populations {{showed that the}} <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> in Silene alba was slightly female biased. <b>Sex</b> <b>ratio</b> varied among populations and among families within a female biased population. Crosses among plants from the most female biased population and the most male biased population showed that the <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> polymorphism was inherited through or expressed in the male parent. Males from one family in particular exhibited a severe female bias, characterized by less than 20 % male progeny. The inheritance of <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> was investigated using a reciprocal crossing design. <b>Sex</b> <b>ratios</b> from reciprocal crosses were significantly different, indicating either sex-linkage or cytoplasmic inheritance of <b>sex</b> <b>ratio.</b> The <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> produced by males generally resembled the <b>sex</b> <b>ratios</b> produced by their male parents, indicating that the <b>sex</b> <b>ratio</b> modifier was Y linked.
