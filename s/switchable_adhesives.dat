40|$|Progress in {{adhesion}} technology {{over the}} last few decades has led to widespread replacement of mechanical fasteners with adhesive bonds. Despite the advances, it remains challenging to produce materials that are sticky on demand. In this feature article we highlight recent efforts to develop reversibly <b>switchable</b> <b>adhesives,</b> that exhibit the ability to trigger adhesion in response to an environmental change – for example, pH, solvent, temperature, mechanics, and electro/magnetic field. We review two initially separate design principles to induce switchable adhesion: (1) chemical functionality and (2) topography. Combining both approaches may lead to novel hierarchical adhesives with interesting property profiles...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple method to {{reversibly}} switch the adhesive force between two surfaces that {{are decorated with}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) graft polymers. By employment of a PMMA/isopropanol/water or a PMMA/ethanol/water cosolvent system, we can tune the swelling of the brushes. In pure isopropanol or ethanol the polymer grafts are collapsed, and the adhesion is high when the contacting brushes are pulled apart. In an 80 – 20 vol % isopropanol–water or ethanol–water composition, the brushes are swollen. In these systems the adhesion is approximately 5 times smaller compared to the adhesion measured in the pure solvent systems. Moreover, we show that PMMA/isopropanol/water cosolvent systems perform better as <b>switchable</b> <b>adhesives</b> than PMMA/ethanol/water cosolvent systems. In the latter pulling events can arise when the swollen brushes are kept in contact for a longer time, such that the adhesion hysteresis can become large and the surface coating can be damaged due to bond-breaking events...|$|E
40|$|Soft {{adhesives}} {{require an}} optimum balance of viscous and elastic properties. Adhesion is poor when {{the material is}} either too solidlike or too liquidlike. The ability to switch tack adhesion off at a desired time has many applications, such as in recycling, disassembly of electronics, and painless removal of wound dressings. Here, we describe a new strategy to switch off the tack adhesion in a model nanocomposite adhesive in which temperature is the trigger. The nanocomposite comprises hard methacrylic nanoparticles blended with a colloidal dispersion of soft copolymer particles. At relatively low volume fractions, the nanoparticles (50 nm diameter) accumulate near the film surface, where they pack around the larger soft particles (270 nm). The viscoelasticity of the nanocomposite is adjusted via the nanoparticle concentration. When the nanocomposite is heated above the glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles (T(g) = 130 °C), they sinter {{together to create a}} rigid network that raises the elastic modulus at room temperature. The tackiness is switched off. Intense infrared radiation is used to heat the nanocomposites, leading to a fast temperature rise. Tack adhesion is switched off within 30 s in optimized compositions. These one-way <b>switchable</b> <b>adhesives</b> have the potential to be patterned through localized heating...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study and characterise the {{properties}} and the behaviour of the adhesive that switches off and on when heat is applied. To study the changes, the adhesive coated on PEN film was laminated on to microscope glass slide to and then tested after curing at different temperatures and times. The properties of the <b>switchable</b> <b>adhesive</b> changed when it is cured at different temperatures. The adhesive was seen to switch from PEN film to glass slide after it was cured at 80 °C. The surface energy of the adhesive was studied {{before and after the}} switch and {{it was found that the}} surface energy changes from 50 dynes/cm to 70 dynes/cm, after the curing temperature increased to 80 °C. The FTIR showed another change after curing the laminate at 160 °C. From the peel tests the second change was seen to start already at 140 °C and it was seen that this change occurs faster with higher curing temperatures. The change at higher temperatures was also detected with DSC. To characterise the reaction further, the reaction kinetics was calculated based on FTIR analysis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Suction based {{attachment}} {{systems for}} {{pick and place}} handling of fragile objects like glass plates or optical lenses are energy-consuming and noisy and fail at reduced air pressure, which is essential, e. g., in chemical and physical vapor deposition processes. Recently, an alternative approach toward reversible adhesion of sensitive objects based on bioinspired dry adhesive structures has emerged. There, the switching in adhesion is achieved by a reversible buckling of adhesive pillar structures. In this study, we demonstrate that these adhesives are capable of switching adhesion not only in ambient air conditions but also in vacuum. Our bioinspired patterned adhesive with an area of 1 cm 2 provided an adhesion force of 2. 6 N ± 0. 2 N in air, which was reduced to 1. 9 N ± 0. 2 N if measured in vacuum. Detachment was induced by buckling of the structures due to a high compressive preload and occurred, independent of air pressure, at approximately 0. 9 N ± 0. 1 N. The switch in adhesion was observed at a compressive preload between 5. 6 and 6. 0 N and was independent of air pressure. The difference between maximum adhesion force and adhesion force after buckling gives a reasonable window of operation for pick and place processes. High reversibility of the switching behavior is shown over 50 cycles in air and in vacuum, making the bioinspired <b>switchable</b> <b>adhesive</b> applicable for handling operations of fragile objects...|$|R
40|$|The gecko {{adhesive}} {{system has}} attracted significant attention since {{the discovery that}} van der Waals interactions, which are always present between surfaces, are predominantly responsible for their adhesion. The unique anisotropic frictional-adhesive capabilities of the gecko adhesive system originate from complex hierarchical structures and just as importantly, the anisotropic articulation of the structures. Here, by cleverly engineering asymmetric polymeric microstructures, a reusable <b>switchable</b> gecko-like <b>adhesive</b> can be fabricated yielding steady high adhesion (FâŠ¥ ≈ 1. 25 N/cm 2) and friction (Fâ̂¥ ≈ 2. 8 N/cm 2) forces when actuated for "gripping", yet release easily with minimal adhesion (FâŠ¥ ≈ 0. 34 N/cm 2) and friction (Fâ̂¥≈ 0. 38 N/cm 2) forces during detachment or "releasing", over multiple attachment/detachment cycles, with a relatively small normal preload of 0. 16 N/cm 2 to initiate the adhesion. These adhesives {{can also be used}} to reversibly suspend weights from vertical (e. g., walls), and horizontal (e. g., ceilings) surfaces by simultaneously and judiciously activating anisotropic friction and adhesion forces. This design opens the way for new gecko-like adhesive surfaces and articulation mechanisms that do not rely on intensive nanofabrication in order to recover the anisotropic tribological property of gecko adhesive pads, albeit with lower adhesive forces compared to geckos. A <b>switchable</b> gecko-inspired <b>adhesive</b> that shows anisotropic adhesion and friction properties is presented. With proper actuation, the polymer-based dry adhesive provides strong adhesion and friction forces for attachment (or gripping), or weak forces for detachment (or releasing). The reusability of the dry adhesive is also demonstrated over multiple attachment/detachment cycles. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we present}} {{work on the}} development, characterization, and analysis of an easy-to-fabricate, reusable bioinspired <b>switchable</b> <b>adhesive</b> that consists of a film-terminated fibrillar layer atop a substrate. We use a dynamic rod model and stability analysis to define and analyze the buckling of a fibril subjected to a prescribed shear displacement and a constant normal compressive force. Following this analysis, we present work on the switchable adhesive: a film-terminated fibrillar interface with two metastable states. In the first state, a thin film spanning the fibrillar surface results in strongly enhanced adhesion due to crack-trapping. In the second state, the thin film collapses onto the substrate between fibrils and resembles a rough surface. We perform indentation experiments (pull-off and adhesion hysteresis), which demonstrate differences in the adhesive response of the two states. We show that the adhesive state has a pull-off load up to 70 {{times higher than the}} non-adhesive state and has up to 20 times larger adhesion hysteresis. Friction experiments show that in the collapsed state there is no static friction peak and that even in sliding friction, which is not enhanced for the adhesive state over the control samples (flat, unstructured PDMS), the collapsed state exhibits much lower sliding friction forces. We determine the pressure-to-collapse the thin film to switch from the adhesive to the non-adhesive state using hydrostatic pressure experiments. Finally, we perform both linear plate and von Kärman plate analyses on the thin film as it deforms under an applied pressure to gain insight into both bistability and the pressure required to collapse the thin film and in doing so, turn off the adhesion. We find that the von Kärman plate theory more accurately captures the pressure required to initiate collapse of the thin film onto the substrate, most likely because of the large deflections taking place during collapse. To account for pressurization that occurs in our sealed samples during hydrostatic pressure experiments, we model the rate dependence in the hydrostatic pressure experiments. Pressurization and diffusion of gas through the thin film reduces the dependence on interfibrillar spacing...|$|R
40|$|Functional dry {{adhesives}} are dry adhesives {{that rely}} on dry adhesive structures for adhesion but also include additional functionality that enables adhesion switching or sensing capabilities. This thesis describes the design and testing of functional dry adhesives. Electro-dry-adhesives with flexible electrodes were fabricated. When a high voltage {{was applied to the}} flexible electrodes, fabricated from mixing and curing Carbon Black (CB) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an electrostatic field was generated between opposing electrodes and between the Electro-dry-adhesive and the surface it was attached to. The generated electrostatic field resulted in an increased shear adhesion force over the shear adhesion measured without the applied electrostatic field applied as well as the ability to self-preload. Magnetic field <b>switchable</b> dry <b>adhesives</b> were designed with a backing layer composed of iron oxide particles embedded within PDMS. The design of the dry adhesive backing layer allowed increased or decreased measured adhesion forces when the magnetic field was present during only the pull-off portion of the normal dry adhesion test cycle depending on the orientation of the magnetic field. Decreased adhesion was observed when the magnetic field was present during either the entire adhesion test cycle or when the magnetic field was present during only the preload portion of the dry adhesion test cycle regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field. Force and torque sensing dry adhesives were designed and fabricated by molding CB-PDMS. Force sensing was observed when the device was both compressed and extended by measuring a change in the resistance across the device terminals. Torque sensing was observed when the dry adhesive backing layer was twisted again by comparing resistance changes across the device terminals. The design of the force and torque sensing dry adhesives allowed the user to differentiate between forces in compression and extension as well as torques. Finally, a low cost method of fabricating dry adhesives was developed that utilizes commercially available meshes as a mold. The ability to utilize commercially available meshes instead of cleanroom fabrication techniques may save on overall fabrication costs and allow dry adhesives to be fabricated in large sheets...|$|R
