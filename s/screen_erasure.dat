40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{design of a}} LED dot matrix written display system using Single Chip Micyoco (SCM). It completes the data acquisition function through the light pen with excellent photographic performance phototransistor, then it can achieve the following functions, such as click light, draw light, reverse display, entire <b>screen</b> <b>erasure,</b> stroke erasure, multi characters written and so on. The display includes two parts, handwriting screen and color dot matrix screen display, which are connected by wireless. By light pen writing in the writing area, it can display in color dot matrix display area, {{it also has the}} function of key operation and has a USB interface. Therefore, it can transfer text and picture messages to dot matrix display area. This paper presents the hardware design and its schematics, gives the general flowchart of software. This design is a low-cost wireless display design scheme, it has the advantages of simple design, easy to use, etc...|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computer}} terminals that did not physically print on paper and so offered more flexibility regarding <b>screen</b> placement, <b>erasure,</b> and so forth, printing control codes were adapted. Form feeds, for example, usually cleared the screen, there being no new paper page to move to. More complex escape sequences were developed {{to take advantage of}} the flexibility of the new terminals, and indeed of newer printers. The concept of a control character had always been somewhat limiting, and was extremely so when used with new, much more flexible, hardware. Control sequences (sometimes implemented as escape sequences) could match the new flexibility and power and became the standard method. However, there were, and remain, a large variety of standard sequences to choose from.|$|R
