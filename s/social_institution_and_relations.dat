The effect is, when going to sea, klothok boat fishermen are become less and their income also reduced. In this critical economy situation, klothok boat fishermen need to do some strategy. The statement of problems in this research is about how survival strategy for klothok boat fishermen in famine season? The purpose of study is finding out survival strategy done by klothok boat fishermen in famine season. The research uses descriptive qualitative research. Location is in Dusun Lebak Timur sub-village Tlonto Raja Village Pasean Sub-District Pamekasan District. Research subject determination uses purposive sampling and consists of 5 people. Data collection technique uses interview, observation and documentation study. Research result explains that informer do strategy such as economic strategy and social strategy. Economic strategy is work division where one person’s wife do trading. Social strategy is by using <b>social</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>relations,</b> such as pawning (gold) to pawn shop (done by three people), borrowing money to relatives and neighbors (done by three people) and borrowing money with interest system (done by two people). Each informer could do more than one strategy. Theory used to analyze this problem is theory from James S. Coleman, it is rational choice. There are two main elements, actors and sources. Actors manage sources to fulfill needs and purposes determined by values or choices. Actors in this case are fisherman. This research shows that in reaching their purposes, fisherman need facilitators as the bridge in the process of getting sources. Sources obtained are analyzed to fulfill daily needs. Strategy conducted by fisherman family is to form their rationality choices on the hard condition they faced in achievement to survive in bad season...|$|E

40|$|Cross-border {{migration}} for {{the purpose}} of marriage is on the rise, and at present it constitutes {{one of the most common}} forms of long-term international mobility in East Asia. This special issue of Cross-Currents analyzes marriage migration in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan as a subject of governance. The articles included here demonstrate that marriage migration has attracted considerable policy attention and public anxiety not because it is about “marriage” or “migration” per se, but because it is perceived to be inseparable from a wide range of other issues, such as sexual morality, family norms, national identity, and border security. In particular, the long-lasting social relationships marriage migration creates and the role of marriage migrants (the vast majority of whom are women) in rearing the next generation of the state’s sovereign subjects tie marriage migration to state security concerns. Popular anxieties about marriage migration are often based on projections into the future rather than observations about the present reality. On one hand, the fact that marriage migration is deeply embedded in myriad <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> <b>relations</b> that cannot be dealt with in isolation causes a projection-based mode of governance; on the other hand, it renders transnational marriage particularly hard to govern, which further exacerbates anxiety. But this should not be seen as a failure in public policy. The articles in this special issue argue that such projections, imaginations, and self-perpetuating anxieties are important parts of how nationhood is constructed in the current era. As such, marriage migration as a subject of governance provides us with a special angle to examine how politics works in subtle and sometimes invisible ways on local, national, and transnational levels [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Italians are “Macaronis”, the English are “Roastbeef”, the French are “Frogs” and the Germans are “Krauts” [1]. In other words, food {{is often}} used to define and {{differentiate}} social groups. Claude Fischler [1] points out that human beings mark their membership of a culture or social group by asserting the specificity of what they eat or by defining differences with others. Eric B. Ross describes diet as an “evolutionary product of environmental conditions and of the basic forces, especially <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>relations,</b> that determine their use” [2]. Work by Manuel Calvo [3] observed that in situations of migration, certain features of cuisine are sometimes retained even when the original culture and language have already been forgotten. This suggests that culture and diet are deeply connected. Understanding dietary patterns and food preferences 1 of humans is therefore central to several research communities. It is not only relevant from an anthropological and sociological view point, but also from a medical point of view since food preferences and diet obviously impact health.|$|R

It is therefore inevitable that educationists turn to digital literacy practices to examine their contribution to, and influence on, learning. This article explores the digital literacy practices {{of a group of}} higher education students with minimal previous access to digital resources, as well as how they compensate for uneven access, with a view to examining what they perceive to be challenges and possibilities offered by technology. Thus the article highlights how they are ‘caught-between’ two worlds: the technologicised and non-technologicised. The work is framed by New Literacy Studies, which suggests that literacy is a contextualised practice positioned in <b>relation</b> to <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> the power <b>relations</b> that sustain them (Gee, 1996). Emerging themes indicate that students perceive digital practices to have symbolic value, and provide access to cultural capital. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Both {{social economy}} and {{informal}} economy define complex economic phenomena, multifaceted, which generated multiple platform debate and analysis among economists, sociologists and lawyers. Perspectives on these concepts {{are the most}} diverse and present work attempts to link these views to find common denominators, but also the elements that differentiate them. Official social economy interacts with the informal economy through the initial use of capital and generating links between different forms of capital. Underground economy is based more on use of illicit and immoral capital, while {{the development of a}} formal social require networks of trust, reciprocal links with other groups <b>and</b> <b>institutions,</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>relations</b> that are based on values and norms recognized by society. The interplay of social economy - informal economy is manifested either through a transition from the sphere of the informal (unofficial) to formal (official) or by maintaining and emphasizing underground activities as a result of using illegal or informal social networks and social capital already existing. From the perspective of this study, social economy-binomial informal economy should be seen as: a) mediating factor between the official and unofficial; b) factor of influence to ensure a legal and institutional framework apt to limit and discourage underground activities; c) factor of transition from the informal economy to the social economy. </p...|$|R

I argue that the ways slavery is, and, more tellingly, is not represented at heritage sites, and in State-sponsored cultural performances provides a lens for examining a larger ambivalence concerning race in the Cuban national imaginary. 3 Rather than focusing on slavery {{as a mode of}} institutionalized violence, a set of social <b>relations,</b> <b>and</b> ideological structures, Cuban heritage narratives, cultural productions and visual representations highlight cultural contributions made by peoples of African descent to Cuban national identity. 4 While slave resistance is sometimes mentioned or enacted, racism and race are usually relegated to a fairly distant past. Cuban narratives thus downplay the racialized history of the nation and instead promote an inclusive, post-racial nationalism. It is as though enslaved people left an imprint, while the <b>institutions,</b> <b>social</b> <b>relations</b> <b>and</b> ideologies responsible for their enslavement vanished without a trace. In particular, I want to interrogate the intricate and dialectical interplay between two modes of cultural presentation that Cuban cultural institutions deploy in their treatment of Black culture that...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in social}} {{structures}} occurring {{during the process}} of economic growth can be considered direct consequences of this process, while other changes are caused by factors such as technological progress, that affect simultaneously social structures and growth. This chapter focuses on that part of the circular argument that goes from growth to social structures. It does not consider the effect of social changes on growth. The chapter is thus an attempt to isolate the pure "income effect" in the evolution of social structures and to disentangle the effect of economic growth from the effect of other factors in observed changes in social structures. Section 1 examines the nature of the statistical relationships existing between social indicators and development across countries and/or across periods, in order to illustrate the differences in social structures associated with differences in income. It also discusses the difficulty of obtaining precise estimates {{of the size of the}} income effect from this kind of evidence and the need to rely on more structural analyses. Section 2 reviews theoretical models of the effect of economic growth on social structures, with an emphasis on several dimensions of social differentiation and on economic inequality. Section 3 focuses on the empirical evidence in support of this structural view of the consequences of growth for social structures. Section 4 concludes by emphasizing the importance of sectoral shifts, the role of the market in integrating the economy and society, and the social costs of sectoral adjustments. The effect of changes in social structures on <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> on <b>social</b> <b>relations</b> is only briefly discussed in the Conclusions. ...|$|R

Osim što donosi pregled teorijskih razmatranja i perspektiva koje se bave konceptima suvereniteta, nacionalne sigurnosti i države, ovaj rad pruža uvid i u njihove problematične karakteristike i dimenzije. Rad će nastojati pokazati na koji način državne prakse povezane s nacionalnom sigurnošću i suverenitetom, uslijed kompleksnosti društvenih i političkih institucija i odnosa, nerijetko u stvarnosti odstupaju od normi i pravila koja ih definiraju. Analiza koncepata suvereniteta, nacionalne sigurnosti i države nastojat će objasniti zbog čega se oni nalaze u problematičnom prostoru između normativnog i empirijskog, te utvrditi na koji način to utječe na stvarne društvene procese, odnose, kretanja i institucije.

40|$|China {{has entered}} {{a period of}} rural and urban {{transformation}} which brings up serious challenges for sustainable development on various levels of geographical scale and creates growing discrepancies between regions with respect to economic prospects for farming communities. The separation between urban and rural planning in contemporary China raises important questions about community participation, the role of local and regional authorities, interaction between governments, markets and civil society. Some Western countries have faced similar problems in the last decades and developed sophisticated systems of rural development which effectively address the rural-urban divide. A pivotal element is public participation. Participation in the planning process {{is at the heart}} of the emerging communicative paradigm in planning theory. So far the emerging body of literature about participatory planning in Western countries is in need of translation into specific applications tailor made to Chines governance. This paper builds on selected building blocks developed in state of the art international planning theory. The theoretical framework is elaborated taking into consideration idiosyncrasies of Chinese land use laws and regulations. The results of our empirical research suggests that China has developed elementary bottom-up practices starting in the ninenteen nineties. These practices have triggered new laws, decrees and ordinances by various levels of government. Two arguments stand out in the emerging debate about participation in land use planning i. e. effectiveness and ligitimacy. In the context of changing <b>institutions</b> <b>social</b> <b>relations</b> <b>and</b> emerging markets these concepts are in need of closer inspection and discussion.
