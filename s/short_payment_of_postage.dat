25|$|In 1680 William Dockwra, an English {{merchant}} in London, and {{his partner}} Robert Murray established the London Penny Post, a mail system that delivered letters and small parcels inside the city of London for the sum of one penny. The postage for the mailed item was prepaid {{by the use of}} a hand-stamp to frank the mailed item, confirming <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> Though this 'stamp' was applied to a letter instead of a separate piece of paper it is considered by many historians as the world's first postage stamp.|$|R
50|$|Stamped {{receipts}} {{were also}} given for all letters {{sent to the}} Post Office for dispatch. For the convenience of the residents, a register was kept <b>of</b> their individual <b>postage</b> accounts on the understanding that all postage due would be regularly settled every month. The first postage stamps were introduced for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> only in 1854. In the early days, the flagstaff at Government Hill (now Fort Canning) was eagerly watched as flying of a flag at daylight, or the firing of a gun at night, signified {{the arrival of a}} ship with mail. This infused new life into the quiet community.|$|R
25|$|The first stamps did {{not need}} to show the issuing country, so no country name was {{included}} on them. The UK remains the only country to omit its name on postage stamps, using the reigning monarch’s head as country identification. Following the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>postage</b> stamp in the UK, prepaid postage considerably increased the number of letters mailed. Before 1839, the number of letters sent in the UK was typically 76 million. By 1850 this increased five-fold to 350 million, continuing to grow rapidly {{until the end of the}} 20th century when newer methods <b>of</b> indicating the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> reduced the use of stamps.|$|R

25|$|Postage stamps have {{facilitated}} {{the delivery of}} mail since the 1840s. Before then, ink and hand-stamps (hence the word 'stamp'), usually made from wood or cork, were often used to frank the mail and confirm the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> The first adhesive postage stamp, {{commonly referred to as}} the Penny Black, was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840. The invention of the stamp was part of an attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which, in the early 19th century, was in disarray and rife with corruption. There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp.|$|R

His remaining depictions are confined to regular issues.|$|R
25|$|A {{postage stamp}} {{is a small}} piece of paper that is {{purchased}} and displayed on an item of mail as evidence <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage.</b> Typically, stamps are printed on special custom-made paper, show a national designation and a denomination (value) on the front, and have an adhesive gum on the back or are self-adhesive. Postage stamps are purchased from a postal administration (post office) or other authorized vendor, and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail, as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registration. They are sometimes a source of net profit to the issuing agency, especially when sold to collectors who will not actually use them for postage.|$|R

50|$|The use of stamps was optional: letters {{could still}} be sent {{requiring}} <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> on delivery. Indeed, the post office did not issue any 2-cent value for prepaying drop letters in 1847, and these continued to be handled as they had been. Nevertheless, many Americans took up using stamps; about 3,700,000 of the 5¢ and about 865,000 of the 10¢ were sold, and enough of those have survived to ensure a ready supply for collectors, although the demand is such that a very fine 5¢ sells for around $500 as of 2003, and the 10¢ in very fine condition sells for around $1,400 in used form. Unused stamps are much scarcer, fetching around $6,000 and $28,000 respectively, if in very fine condition. One can pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of these figures if the stamps are in poor condition.|$|R

The most immediate concerns of the Confederate postmaster general was the organization of his department and providing for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> so that it would become self-financing.

Both stamps included an engraving of the young Queen Victoria, without perforations, as the first stamps were separated from their sheets by cutting them with scissors.

5000|$|The {{delivery}} of letters without compensation {{and without the}} affixation or <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> any <b>postage</b> is allowed under 39 CFR 310.3(c) by third parties, and under 39 CFR 310.3(b) for one's own letters which includes regular employees only delivering company mail. Thus, {{it is not a}} violation of the PES if one delivers a letter of one's friend even without affixation <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> or if a company has one of its regular employees deliver mail that originates from the company to its customers. Compensation is considered to include barter and goodwill. Thus an individual or business who receives a benefit for the {{delivery of}} letters does not fall under such a free carriage exception. For example, buying a friend dinner in exchange for having him deliver a letter is not considered without compensation; in such a case one would be required to affix and cancel a sufficient amount <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> to the letter.
