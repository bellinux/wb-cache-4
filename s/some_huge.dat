In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's pebbles.|$|E

25|$|Count Dracula (1970), {{directed}} by Jesus Franco starring Christopher Lee as Dracula. In {{spite of its}} star, Franco's film is {{not a part of}} the Hammer series, and was shot on a small budget. Lee is made up to look like the description of the Count from Stoker's novel, and he does seem to grow younger as the story progresses, but the film otherwise takes <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> liberties with the plot. The international cast includes Herbert Lom as Van Helsing and Klaus Kinski as Renfield.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1960s, the Iraqi {{government}} {{criticized the}} IPC {{and used the}} IPC as a central piece of their anti-western propaganda. The Soviet-Iraqi agreement of 1969 emboldened the Iraqi government and in 1970 they {{made a list of}} demands including ownership of 20% of the company's assets and more control. The IPC by this time was taking the Iraqi government very seriously and made <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> concessions. They agreed to increase oil production substantially and also increase the price of its crude oil in certain areas. They also offered an advance payment on royalties.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the famous}} city's squares – <b>some</b> <b>huge,</b> majestic and often adorned with obelisks, some small and picturesque – got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The {{principal}} ones are Piazza Navona, Piazza di Spagna, Campo de' Fiori, Piazza Venezia, Piazza Farnese, Piazza della Rotonda and Piazza della Minerva. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the Fontana di Trevi by Nicola Salvi.

25|$|Michelle Ann Fowler (also Holloway) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Susan Tully {{from the first}} episode in 1985 until the character's departure in 1995. In December 2016, it was announced Michelle would be returning to the show after 21 years, with actress Jenna Russell taking over the role making her first appearance on 24 December 2016. In her first stint Michelle made <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> mistakes during her time in Albert Square mainly through having a habit of choosing the wrong men and her stubborn nature meant that she rarely accepted help or listened to good advice. Being determined and outspoken, {{she has never been}} afraid to defend herself or her beliefs. Since the recast to Russell in 2016, Michelle's storylines have revolved around her having had an illegal relationship with her student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor) in America, a love triangle involving her niece Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), crashing her car into the local chip shop and being stalked by Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey).|$|E

500|$|Though the {{maneuvers}} were otherwise unremarkable, {{they proved}} a valuable learning {{tool for the}} Americans, who got a chance not only to experience British methods, but the violent conditions of the North Sea, as well. As Admiral Rodman noted upon returning from the exercise, [...] "I have seen the largest battleships apparently sucked under until only the superstructures on the upper deck were visible when they would slowly rise from their submergence and the water pour off their decks as it might from <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> turtle... to the surface." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Allied {{conference at}} Chantilly, Haig issued {{instructions}} for army commanders on 17 November 1916, {{with a general}} plan for offensive operations {{in the spring of}} 1917. The Chief engineer of the Third Army, Major-General E. R. Kenyon, composed a list of requirements by 19 November, for which he had 16 Army Troops companies, five with each corps in the front line and one with XVIII Corps, four tunnelling companies, three entrenching battalions, eight RE labour battalions and 37 labour companies. Inside the old walls of Arras were the Grand and Petit places, under which there were old cellars, which were emptied and refurbished for the accommodation of 13,000 men. Under the suburbs of St Sauveur and Ronville were many caves, <b>some</b> <b>huge,</b> which were rediscovered by accident in October 1916. When cleared out the caves had room for 11,500 men, one in the Ronville system housing 4,000 men.

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it would be foolish to pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E

2500|$|Gregg's {{early career}} was in ABC cinema {{followed}} by a managing a Social Club at Cowley at the huge British Leyland site. Moving up north to Southport, Gregg became the Director of Tourism and Attractions for Southport. During his time working for Sefton Council, the Southport Theatre Complex was built adjacent to the Floral Hall venue. This provided the town with two venues that went on to host <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> stars performing that {{had never before been}} seen in Southport. Following his departure from Sefton and a brief post with the Prince of Wales Hotel group, an opportunity came in 1977, aged 36, to purchase the Ardwick Theatre in Manchester – soon followed by the New Theatre in Oxford – and so Apollo Leisure had lift off, and gradually over the following years Apollo became the biggest theatre owners/management team in the United Kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|Unger’s {{subsequent}} {{solo exhibition}} at the Trans Hudson Gallery in 1997 featured five sculptures that display her strong interest in organic forms. [...] Shanks consists of three nine-foot vertical bony shafts, each with a rounded point {{on the floor and}} topped with a bulbous knob. [...] Two knobs, imitating the ball of a ball-and-socket joint, protrude just above the middle of each shaft. [...] The white hydrocal was roughly scarred to give the appearance of bone. [...] One critic got the impression that the sculpture was the leg bone of <b>some</b> <b>huge</b> prehistoric animal. [...] Another believed the sculptures were like stern goddesses gazing down on their followers. [...] The sculpture exemplified Unger’s inclinations – rational yet connected to nature, serene but passionate, rigorously formed yet playful. [...] Unger also included a wall-mounted sculpture titled Black Heart, a darkly poetic version of a heart that hovers without apparent support. [...] Its black scorched and pitted surface looks like damaged skin over muscle. [...] Its mythic presence is in line with the symbolism of the origin of emotion. [...] It suggests that life processes are just as metaphysical as they are scientific.|$|E
