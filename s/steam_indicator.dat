5000|$|An [...] "X-Y" [...] {{recorder}} {{drives the}} chart {{depending on the}} value of another process signal. For example, a universal testing machine may plot the tension force on a specimen against its length. Depending on the particular recorder, either the paper chart is moved or else the pen carriage has two axes of motion. Examples of an x-y recorder date back to the 18th century {{in the form of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>indicator</b> diagrams used to record pressure and volume in steam engines.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the next}} six years, he {{made a number of}} other {{improvements}} and modifications to the steam engine. A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on {{the two sides of the}} piston was one. He described methods for working the steam [...] "expansively" [...] (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the <b>steam</b> <b>indicator</b> which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from [...] "running away" [...] were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.|$|E

50|$|The {{most useful}} {{instrument}} for analyzing {{the performance of}} steam engines is the <b>steam</b> engine <b>indicator.</b> Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The <b>steam</b> engine <b>indicator</b> traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, {{which can be used}} to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines. See image of indicator diagram below (in Types of motor units section).|$|R

5000|$|McNaught {{patented}} his compound {{steam engine}} in 1845 (Patent no. 11001). He relocated to Manchester in 1849. The Robertson Street workshop was operated by William McNaught & Son as [...] "Makers of Steam-Engine <b>Indicators,</b> <b>Steam</b> Gauges, etc" [...] at 12 Hampden Terrace, Glasgow, {{at least until}} 1895.|$|R
25|$|Bioindicators {{can also}} be used to {{independently}} confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat resistant microbe Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus), which is extremely resistant to <b>steam</b> sterilization. Biological <b>indicators</b> may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one commercially {{available}} chemical <b>steam</b> sterilization <b>indicators</b> were processed {{in an empty}} autoclave for various times at temperatures between 240 and 270 degrees F (ca. 116 and 132 degrees C). The time required to reach a sterilized reading at each temperature was plotted on a semilogarithmic time-temperature plot and compared with the time-temperature sterilization curve for Bacillus stearothermophilus. Five of the indicators had time-temperature kinetics {{similar to those of}} B. stearothermophilus, but three of these overestimated the effect of processing. Two of the indicators overestimated the effect of processing and were less sensitive to temperature changes when was B. stearothermophilus. Thirteen of the indicators had time-temperature curves that crossed the B. stearothermophilus plot. One indicator produced such ambiguous results that no determinations could be made with it. Out of 21 indicators tested, only 2 appear to be capable of accurately integrating the time-temperature effect at temperatures between 240 and 270 degrees F. The other indicators should be used only after careful analysis of their suitability for use at a given temperature...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with Geoff Keighley, Newell said {{that due to}} Valve's management-free structure, the company would only develop [...] "a super classic kind of product" [...] if {{a large number of}} employees began working on it together. He said this was unlikely as they would need to heed the lessons learned in supporting Portal 2. In 2016 and 2017, three key writers for the Half-Life and Portal series, Marc Laidlaw, Erik Wolpaw, and Chet Faliszek, left Valve. Journalists took this, coupled with the commitment Valve was making to supporting Dota 2, Counter-Strike and <b>Steam,</b> as an <b>indicator</b> that the Half-Life series was no longer in development.|$|R
