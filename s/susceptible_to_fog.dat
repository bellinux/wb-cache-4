At this time the Wagga Wagga Council (not yet a city) operated a civilian aerodrome. This was located on Hammond Avenue, East Wagga. Many other councils had hoped to host the new base. The Mayor of Junee, H.G. Weaver, claimed that Junee was a better choice. He said that Junee was less <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> had flatter surrounding terrain and could offer railway workshops (the roundhouse) for aircraft repair.

50|$|The {{construction}} of airports {{has been known}} to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>fog</b> in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{in overall}} {{appearance}} to the Manual Command Line of Sight (MCLOS), radio frequency guided Blowpipe, Javelin is slightly more compact, uses Semiautomatic Command Line of Sight (SACLOS) radio frequency guidance and is fitted with Semi and improved warhead. The operator {{is equipped with}} a 6× magnification sight and a long range T.V. camera to locate targets. Although the Javelin's accuracy is somewhat <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> smoke, <b>fog,</b> or clouds, it is claimed to be virtually impossible to decoy it away from a target with flares.|$|R
50|$|Foggy Bottom {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} late 18th and 19th-century neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. Foggy Bottom is west of the White House and {{downtown}} Washington, in the Northwest quadrant, bounded roughly by 17th Street to the east, Rock Creek Parkway to the west, Constitution Avenue to the south, and Pennsylvania Avenue to the north. Much of Foggy Bottom is occupied by the main campus of the George Washington University (GW). Foggy Bottom is thought to have received its name due to its riverside location, which made it <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> concentrations of <b>fog</b> and industrial smoke, an atmospheric quirk.|$|R
50|$|The TelefériQo {{opened in}} July 2005, {{and is a}} tourist attraction. At the summit there are restaurants, coffee bars and stores. There are hiking trails with points where {{pictures}} can be taken of Quito. Due to the increased altitude and the wind on the mountain it is cooler than the city and is <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> especially in the mornings. The height of the upper station is enough to cause symptoms of altitude sickness in some individuals.|$|E
5000|$|During 1939, the RAAF {{were looking}} to {{establish}} an inland training base. Pursuing this, Group Captain A. H. [...] "Harry" [...] Cobby (top scoring World War One ace) contacted Wagga resident Hughie Condon {{and asked him to}} suggest possible sites suitable for the establishment of an RAAF station. Condon was well suited to the task, being regional Examiner of Airmen with the Dept. of Defence. He recommended a site at the village of Forest Hill, this being situated about five nautical miles East of Wagga. The site was situated above the Murrumbidgee flood plain and was of suitable dimension. It was already serviced by rail, offered frontage to the Sturt Highway, and was sufficiently distant from the town of Wagga Wagga. Cobby flew to inspect the site, arriving in an RAAF Avro Anson. He agreed with Condon's assessment and the go-ahead was soon given. The identified land was resumed from the Brunskill and Lyons families {{in the first half of}} 1939 and before long, a Fearnes bus was shuttling workers to the site.It is of note that this was planned as a permanent base and preceded the Empire Air Training Scheme. At this time the Wagga Wagga Council (not yet a city) operated a civilian aerodrome. This was located on Hammond Avenue, East Wagga. Many other councils had hoped to host the new base. The Mayor of Junee, H.G. Weaver, claimed that Junee was a better choice. He said that Junee was less <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>fog,</b> had flatter surrounding terrain and could offer railway workshops (the roundhouse) for aircraft repair. The mayor of Narromine was unhappy that his suggested site was not even inspected. The building layout was carefully designed so as to enable the aircraft landing area to have potential for 'all over' operations. Aircraft could potentially touch down anywhere, in any direction, according to the pilots' operational needs.RAAF Forest Hill became operational on 29 July 1940 and initially was home to 2SFTS. Service Flying Training Schools conducted advanced training of graduates of the Elementary Flying Training Schools.At the close of WW2, civilian flying recommenced. A decision was made to accommodate civilian flying operations at Forest Hill. A Bellman hangar was allocated for civilian use and Mobil/Vacuum installed an aircraft refuelling facility. At this time the council aerodrome on Hammond Avenue fell into disuse.With new transport aircraft, such as the Convair Metropolitan, coming into widespread use, it was decided to construct a bitumen runway. This was timed so as to be completed for Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Wagga in 1954.|$|E

40|$|The susceptibilities of 374 {{selected}} beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative anaerobes (including 22 cefoxitin-resistant strains and 36 strains refractory to the enhancing {{effect of}} beta-lactamase inhibitors) and 20 beta-lactamase-negative strains were tested by agar dilution against selected new agents. The organisms included 217 Bacteroides fragilis group strains, 137 non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides spp., and 40 fusobacteria. All strains were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem. For the B. fragilis group, 96 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> ampicillin-sulbactam, 95 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefoperazone-sulbactam, 94 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> tosufloxacin, 91 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefoxitin, 88 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> trospectomycin, and 73 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefotetan. For the beta-lactamase-positive non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides spp., {{greater than or}} equal to 94 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefoxitin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, and trospectomycin, 90 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefotetan, and 85 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> tosufloxacin (the most resistant strains were B. bivius and B. disiens). For the beta-lactamase-positive fusobacteria, {{greater than or equal}} to 97 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoperazone-sulbactam, trospectomycin, and cefoxitin, 90 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefotetan, and 89 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> tosufloxacin. All agents showed excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (for trospectomycin, 95 % were susceptible; for all other drugs, 100 % were susceptible). Overall, both carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were most active. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and cefoperazone-sulbactam lacked activity against some cefoxitin-resistant B. fragilis group strains but had excellent activity against other organisms. Tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, had very good activity against B. fragilis group strains (94 % susceptible), good activity against other beta-lactamase-positive strains (less than or equal 85 % susceptible), and excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (100 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 0. 5 microgram/ml). Trospectomycin was active against > 90 % of all strains except for B. fragilis group strains (88 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 32 microgram/ml). Clinical studies are required to delineate the role of newer agents in the therapy of anaerobic infections...|$|R
40|$|The susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 476 strains) and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae (1, 676 strains) {{to various}} oral β-lactam, macrolide-azalide, and {{fluoroquinolone}} antimicrobial agents {{were determined by}} broth microdilution. Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States. MIC data were interpreted according to pharmacodynamically derived breakpoints applicable to the oral agents tested. Among H. influenzae strains, 41. 6 % were β-lactamase positive. Virtually all H. influenzae strains were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate (98 %), cefixime (100 %), and ciprofloxacin (100 %), while 78 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefuroxime, 57 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin, 14 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefprozil, 9 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> loracarbef, 2 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefaclor, and 0 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> azithromycin and clarithromycin. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 49. 6 % were penicillin susceptible, 17. 9 % were intermediate, and 32. 5 % were penicillin resistant, with penicillin MICs for 50 and 90 % of the isolates tested of 0. 12 and 4 μg/ml, respectively. Overall, 94 % of S. pneumoniae isolates were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 69 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> azithromycin and clarithromycin, 63 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefprozil and cefuroxime, 52 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefixime, 22 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> cefaclor, and 11 % were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> loracarbef. Although ciprofloxacin has marginal activity against S. pneumoniae, no high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were found. Significant cross-resistance was found between penicillin and macrolides-azalides among S. pneumoniae isolates, with 5 % of the penicillin-susceptible strains being macrolide-azalide resistant, compared with 37 % of the intermediate isolates and 66 % of the resistant isolates. Resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae isolates from patients younger than 10 years of age, middle ear and paranasal sinus specimens, and the southern half of the United States. With the continuing rise in resistance, judicious use of oral antimicrobial agents is necessary in all age groups...|$|R
