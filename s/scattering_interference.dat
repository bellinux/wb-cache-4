[...] The amplitude of light scattered from within any transparent dielectric {{is proportional to the}} inverse square of its wavelength and to the volume of material, that is to the cube of its {{characteristic length}}. The wavelength dependence is characteristic of dipole scattering and the volume dependence will apply to any scattering mechanism. Objects with x ≫ 1 act as geometric shapes, scattering light according to their projected area. At the intermediate x ≃ 1 of Mie <b>scattering,</b> <b>interference</b> effects develop through phase variations over the object's surface. Rayleigh scattering applies to the case when the scattering particle is very small (x ≪ 1, with a particle size < 1 /10 wavelength) and the whole surface re-radiates with the same phase. [...] Because the particles are randomly positioned, the scattered light arrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases; it is incoherent and the resulting intensity is just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes from each particle and therefore proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength and the sixth power of its size.

40|$|Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray {{scattering}} is an emerging approach to image the dynamical {{evolution of the}} electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [G. Dixit, O. Vendrell, and R. Santra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 109, 11636 (2012) ]. In this work, we present {{a detailed analysis of}} time-resolved {{x-ray scattering}} from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of <b>scattering</b> <b>interference</b> between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the <b>scattering</b> <b>interference,</b> which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray time-resolved imaging for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent <b>scattering</b> <b>interference</b> vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent <b>scattering</b> <b>interference</b> contribution do not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} concerns the perfor-mance of smart antenna algorithms when used in code-division multiple access (CDMA) wireless communication systems. Com-plex pseudonoise (PN) spreading, despreading, and pilot-aided channel estimates in the cdma 2000 reverse link are some of major characteristics that {{are different from those}} in the IS- 95 CDMA systems. These different features are included in our analysis. Four computationally efficient smart antenna algorithms are introduced: 1) smart antenna based on maximum output power criteria without lagrange multiplier; 2) smart antenna based on maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise output power ratio (SINR) criteria with eigenvector solution; 3) smart antenna based on maximum SINR output criteria without eigenvector solution; 4) more simplified smart antenna based on maximum SINR output criteria without eigenvector solution. Algorithms (1) and (4) require only 4 computational instruction cycles per snapshot where is the number of antenna array elements. Algorithms (2) and (3) require 2 and (4 + 2 2) operations per snapshot, respectively. These computational loads are signif-icantly smaller than those of typical eigenvalue decomposition blind detection approaches. Bit error rates (BERs) resulting from these algorithms are evaluated through simulation. Double spike power delay profile with equal or unequal power is used. Also, a cluster of interfering users and <b>scattered</b> <b>interference</b> users are considered. For BER comparisons, antenna diversity using equal gain combining is also analyzed.

We show that the majority of interference rejection can be accomplished with a space/slow-time adaptive processor (i. e., STAP), while TSI can be sufficiently mitigated using a tapped reference beam in fast-time. Simultaneous optimization of the STAP and reference beam weights with appropriate constraints yields the desired sum and difference components of the monopulse processor.

The first efforts to describe the FTSTS signals based on the fully-phased Green's function-based quasiparticle <b>scattering</b> <b>interference</b> theory, however lacked the full similarity to the FTSTS data, in part {{due to the lack of}} accurate information on the tunneling and scattering matrix elements.

The result shows that in the cross-sectional presentation an enhanced correlation exists between the FTSTS data and the theoretical simulation even without the accurate model for the tunneling and the scattering matrix elements and without the assumption for particle-hole symmetry, suggesting that it can be a new starting point of a more robust quantum physical analysis framework appropriate for the phase transition study in the high-Tc superconductors and other strongly correlated electron systems...|$|E
