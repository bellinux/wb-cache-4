2500|$|A <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> is {{the result}} of a single mutated gene. Over 4000 human {{diseases}} are caused by single-gene defects. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy, however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not [...] "hard and fast", although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, achondroplasia is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for achondroplasia have a severe skeletal disorder of which achondroplasics could be viewed as carriers. Sickle-cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition. When a couple where one partner or both are sufferers or carriers of a <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> wish to have a child, they can do so through in vitro fertilization, which means they can then have a preimplantation genetic diagnosis to check whether the embryo has the genetic disorder.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} of 2 review papers on {{genetics}} and genomics appearing as part of the series on "omics.

Rare variants with large effect sizes are responsible for <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorders,</b> whereas complex polygenic diseases are typically due to multiple genetic variants, each exerting a modest effect size. To illustrate the clinical implications of genetic variants with large effect sizes, 3 common forms of hereditary cardiomyopathies are discussed as prototypic examples of <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorders,</b> including their genetics, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and treatment.

40|$|Cerebral {{autosomal}} dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> of the cerebral small blood vessels caused by mutations in the Notch 3 gene. The exact prevalence of this disorder was unknown currently, {{and the number}} of reported CADASIL families is steadily increasing as the clinical picture and diagnostic examinations are becoming more widely known. The main clinical manifestations are recurrent stroke, migraine, psychiatric symptoms, and progressive cognitive impairment. The clinical course of CADASIL is highly variable, even within families. The involvement of the anterior temporal lobe and the external capsule on brain magnetic resonance imaging was found to have high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating CADASIL from the much more common sporadic cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD). The pathologic hallmark of the disease is the presence of granular osmiophilic material in the walls of affected vessels. CADASIL is a prototype <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> that has evolved as a unique model for studying the mechanisms underlying cerebral SVD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alkaptonuria {{is a rare}} <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> {{characterized}} by black pigmentation of cartilage and other connective tissues. Premature degenerative arthritis affects the large joints {{in many of these}} of patients. Medical treatment is limited to a protein-restricted diet (phenylalanine and tyrosine) with surgery reserved for end-stage joint disease. As in other metabolic bone diseases, there are concerns about the quality and strength of affected bones and therefore the suitability and longevity of replacement arthroplasty. The histopathology and outcome of joint replacement for alkaptonuric arthritis is unknown and limited to sporadic case reports. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: We describe 11 joint replacements in 3 patients with alkaptonuric polyarthropathy, including shoulder and elbow replacements not previously reported. No prosthetic failures occurred in up to 12 years of follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Total joint replacement is an acceptable treatment for degenerative joint disease in alkaptonuric patients, with implant survival comparable to that found in patients with osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Current {{population}} studies characterize idiopathic scoliosis as a <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> {{that follows}} the patterns of mendelian genetics, including variable penetrance and heterogeneity. The role of melatonin and calmodulin {{in the development of}} idiopathic scoliosis is likely secondary, with indirect effects on growth mechanisms. Reported abnormalities of connective tissue, skeletal muscle, platelets, the spinal column, and the rib cage are all thought to be secondary to the deformity itself. Although no consistent neurological abnormalities have been identified in patients with idiopathic scoliosis, it is possible that a defect in processing by the central nervous system affects the grow-ing spine. The true etiology of idiopathic scoliosis remains unknown; however, it appears to be multifactorial. Idiopathic scoliosis is a pathological entity of un-known etiology.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is characterised as a <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> with a simple, {{autosomal recessive}} mode of inheritance. However, translation of CFTR genotype into CF phenotype {{is influenced by}} nucleotide sequence variations at multiple genetic loci, and individuals heterozygous for CFTR mutations are predisposed {{to a range of}} CFTR-related conditions, such as Disseminated Bronchiectasis. CF disease severity and CFTR-related conditions are more akin to complex, multifactorial traits, which are increasingly being associated with mutations that perturb gene expression. We have identified a patient with Disseminated Bronchiectasis, who is heterozygous for a single nucleotide substitution in the CFTR 52 ̆ 7 UTR (c. - 34 C>T). The c. - 34 C>T mutation creates an upstream AUG codon and upstream open reading frame that overlaps, and is out of frame with, the CFTR protein coding sequence.

40|$|Our visual {{world is}} dynamic in nature. The ability to encode, mentally represent, and track an object’s {{identity}} {{as it moves}} across time and space is critical for integrating and maintaining a complete and coherent view of the world. Here we investigated dynamic object processing in typically developing (TD) infants and infants with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> associated with deficits in dorsal stream functioning. We used the violation of expectation method to assess infants’ visual response to expected versus unexpected outcomes following a brief dynamic (dorsal stream) or static (ventral stream) occlusion event. Consistent with previous reports of deficits in dorsal stream-mediated functioning in individuals with this disorder, these results reveal that, compared to mental age-matched TD infants, infants with FXS could maintain the identity of static, but not dynamic, object information during occlusion. These findings {{are the first to}} experimentally evaluate visual object processing skills in infants with FXS, and further support the hypothesis of dorsal stream difficulties in infants with this developmental disorder...|$|E
40|$|Cholesterol is {{essential}} for neuroactive steroid production, growth of myelin membranes, and normal embryonic and fetal development. It also modulates the oxytocin receptor, ligand activity and G-protein coupling of the serotonin- 1 A receptor. A deficit of cholesterol may perturb these biological mechanisms and thereby contribute to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as observed in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) and some subjects with ASDs in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE). A clinical diagnosis of SLOS can be confirmed by laboratory testing with an elevated plasma 7 DHC level relative to the cholesterol level and is treatable by dietary cholesterol supplementation. Individuals with SLOS who have such cholesterol treatment display fewer autistic behaviours, infections, and symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity, with improvements in physical growth, sleep and social interactions. Other behaviours shown to improve with cholesterol supplementation include aggressive behaviours, self-injury, temper outbursts and trichotillomania. Cholesterol ought to {{be considered as a}} helpful treatment approach while awaiting an improved understanding of cholesterol metabolism and ASD. There is an increasing recognition that this <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> of abnormal cholesterol synthesis may be a model for understanding genetic causes of autism and the role of cholesterol in ASD...|$|E

HPS is frequently fatal {{and is the}} most common <b>single-gene</b> <b>disorder</b> in Puerto Rico. We previously characterized the human HPS cDNA and identified pathologic mutations in the gene in patients with HPS. The HPS protein is a novel apparent transmembrane polypeptide that seems to be crucial for normal organellar development. Here we describe the structural organization, nucleotide sequence, and polymorphisms of the human HPS gene. The gene consists of 20 exons spanning about 30. 5 kb in chromosome segment l 0 q 23. 1 -q 23. 3. One of the intervening sequences {{is a member of the}} novel, very rare class of so-called “AT-AC” introns, defined by highly atypical 5 ' and 3 ' splice site and branch site consensus sequences that provide novel targets for possible pathologic gene mutations.
