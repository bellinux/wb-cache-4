The silicon micromachined gas chromatography system (SMGCS) is composed of a miniature <b>sample</b> <b>injector</b> that incorporates a 10 microliter sample loop; a 0. 9 meter long, rectangular shaped (300 micrometer width and 10 micrometer height) capillary column coated with a 0. 2 micrometer thick copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) stationary phase; and a dual detector scheme based upon a CuPc-coated chemiresistor and a commercially available 125 micrometer diameter thermal conductivity detector (TCD) bead. Silicon micromachining was employed to fabricate the interface between the <b>sample</b> <b>injector</b> and the GC column, the column itself, and the dual detector cavity. A novel IC thin-film processing technique was developed to sublime the CuPc stationary phase coating on the column walls that were micromachined in the host silicon wafer substrate and Pyrex (r) cover plate, which were then electrostatically bonded together. The SMGCS can separate binary gas mixtures composed of parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) when isothermally operated (55 - 80 degrees C).

When the ion source was operated on CO_ 2 at a flow {{rate of about}} 200 µ 1 per minute, negative carbon ion beams up to 20 µA were obtained, at an energy of 35 keV. Radiocarbon measurements were performed on standard reference gases and the dynamic response to square-wave pulses of gas was determined. Time constants in the ion source are less than 1 s, which should allow analysis of chromatographic peaks of CO_ 2 with very little broadening. A combustion device has been constructed to generate CO_ 2 for direct injection into the source. Argon carrier gas is used to buffer the pressure at one atmosphere in the <b>sample</b> gas <b>injector.</b> A dedicated ion-beam injector, with higher angular acceptance and higher transmitted currents, is being constructed for the AMS system...|$|R
40|$|Lahore is {{the second}} largest city of Pakistan with {{population}} of about ten million where almost 100 % population depends for their nutrition need on groundwater supplies. Hence the water quality plays controlling role in the health of local population. To determine the groundwater quality of the Lahore, 33 water samples were collected from tubewells, shallow wells and four samples from Lahore canal which is recharge source. The water samples were analyzed for E-coli by standard multiple tube method as per guideline of WHO. The results indicate that 100 % water <b>samples</b> collected from <b>injector</b> pumps installed at shallow depth 120 to 150 feet are polluted due to intrusion of sewage water. However the water samples from deep tubewells installed at 400 to 700 feet depth are free from any E-coli. Recommendations are made to over come contamination problem in shallow aquifer...|$|R
