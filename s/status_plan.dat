40|$|Language {{planning}} is the deliberate shaping {{of a language}} or its spheres of usage to achieve particular ends (Tonkin, 2003, p. 14). Language planning may also {{be defined as a}} government authorized, long term sustained and conscious effort to alter a language itself or to change a language’s functions in a society for the purpose of solving communication problems (Weinstein, 1980, p. 55). Language planning has three foci: <b>status</b> <b>planning,</b> acquisition planning, and corpus <b>planning.</b> <b>Status</b> <b>planning</b> refers to the allocation of languages or language varieties to given functions, e. g. medium of instruction, official language, vehicle of mass communication (Cooper, 1989, p. 32). Acquisition planning refers to the efforts to influence the allocation of users or the distribution of languages/literacies by means of creating or improving opportunity or incentive to learn them or both; and corpus planning refers to the efforts related to the adequacy of the form or structure of languages/literacies (Hornberger, 2006, p. 28). This paper depicts the <b>status</b> and acquisition <b>planning</b> of the English language in Indonesia; besides, the paper presents some Indonesian government’s policies concerning the <b>status</b> and acquisition <b>planning</b> of the language. Regarding the <b>status</b> <b>planning,</b> English is the primary foreign language in Indonesia with several functions, such as a language for global communication and a source to develop the Indonesian language.

Preemraff Lysekil is constructing of a new gas and oil producing addition. This project goes under the name GOP (Gas-Oil-Project) and is an investment of 3, 5 billion SEK. An earlier simulation model has been extended with GOP in order to again verify the <b>status,</b> <b>plan</b> preventative maintenance and to design further extension. With help from the model the following calculations were made:, load flow analysis, short circuit power, voltage dips during faults, voltage dips during motor starts, reactive power compensation, possible load increase, control of the selectivity plan, availability / reliability, verification of emergency power and total starting currents from motor groups. The model was also extended with models for five different expansion strategies {{to see how they}} would affect the existing system. The model was further extended with the overhead lines feeding Preemraff Lysekil to analyze whether they could handle the load increase or not. The results from the system-study calculations showed that Preemraffs power system is well designed, however some problems were found. Results from the pre-study showed that there will be problems keeping the voltage above required levels with further expansions. The affect on the actual distribution system due to these expansions will not cause any problems...|$|E
30|$|A broad body of {{literature}} analyses the impact of health on retirement plans. Empirical {{studies have shown that}} poor health is associated with early exit from the labor market (e.g., Alavinia and Burdorf 2008; Jones et al. 2010; van den Berg et al. 2010). Furthermore, mental health (problems) has become increasingly important in the retirement discussion (e.g., Alavinia and Burdorf 2008; Karpansalo et al. 2004). A poor health status can be caused either by sudden health shocks, or it can evolve gradually over time. For this reason, an individual’s health status is not only important for actual retirement timing, but it also plays an important role for retirement planning. Dwyer and Mitchell (1999), for example, have demonstrated that people who classify themselves as having a poor health <b>status</b> <b>plan</b> to retire on average 1 to 2  years earlier. This finding is in line with McGarry (2004), who also concludes that poor self-reported health has significant effects on retirement planning. Furthermore, McGarry (2004) suggests that changes in health affect retirement expectations stronger than changes in financial variables such as income or wealth. Moreover, it has been found that workers’ expectations about their remaining life expectancy affect the retirement planning process. Using Dutch panel data on retirement behavior, van Solinge and Henkens (2009) have revealed that workers with a higher perceived life expectancy plan to retire later (but often fail to realize their plan as firm-side and job pressures prevent them from carrying out their retirement intentions).|$|E

40|$|Two {{woodland}} SSSI Management Plans {{have been}} produced, conforming to the CCW guidelines for appropriate conservation management planning (CMS). The planning procedure has proven successful {{in its ability}} for enabling flexibility, where the different conservation interest of the two woodlands have enabled their national designations. Plan 1 identifies appropriate management objectives for Coed Afon Pumryd, which is nationally designated for its unique assemblage of ravine slime moulds, myxomycetes. This is an unusual plan as it not only identifies management objectives for the qualifying features of slime moulds, but also states management objectives for the woodland as a site feature. This is justified as the humid conditions provided by the woodland canopy is essential in providing the bryophytes host, and therefore, the slime mould assemblage in a favourable conservation <b>status.</b> <b>Plan</b> 2 adopts a standard approach to woodland, Coed Llechwedd, management planning. Management objectives are stated {{for each of the}} qualifying features, which are the woodland quality, assemblage of breeding birds and assemblage of invertebrates. The successful completion of management plans from the CMS format proves to be a very helpful tool for any site manager determine whether the features of a site are in a favourable conservation status. Targets and Limits of Acceptable Change are stated for each feature, from which the current status of each feature can be precisely indicated. Factors that may influence the features are also identified, and are also targeted and given Limits of Acceptable Change. One of the main benefits of the planning system is the continuity it provides between plans and managers. This ability could prove to be of great value in the huge task of producing the numerous Biodiversity Habitat and Species Action Plans. Indeed, much of the terminology used in these plans are derived from CMS. CMS has received much global acceptance, with plans implemented in areas of India and Costa Rica...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{developments}} {{enable to}} deliver rotational IMRT with standard C-arm gantry based linear accelerators. This upcoming treatment technique was benchmarked in a multi-center treatment planning study against static gantry IMRT and rotational IMRT {{based on a}} ring gantry for a complex parotid gland sparing head-and-neck technique. Methods Treatment plans were created for 10 patients with head-and-neck tumours (oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx) using the following treatment planning systems (TPS) for rotational IMRT: Monaco (ELEKTA VMAT solution), Eclipse (Varian RapidArc solution) and HiArt for the helical tomotherapy (Tomotherapy). Planning of static gantry IMRT was performed with KonRad, Pinnacle and Panther DAO based on step&shoot IMRT delivery and Eclipse for sliding window IMRT. The prescribed doses for the high dose PTVs were 65. 1 Gy or 60. 9 Gy and for the low dose PTVs 55. 8 Gy or 52. 5 Gy dependend on resection <b>status.</b> <b>Plan</b> evaluation was based on target coverage, conformity and homogeneity, DVHs of OARs and the volume of normal tissue receiving more than 5 Gy (V 5 Gy). Additionally, the cumulative monitor units (MUs) and treatment times of the different technologies were compared. All evaluation parameters were averaged over all 10 patients for each technique and planning modality. Results Depending on IMRT technique and TPS, the mean CI values of all patients ranged from 1. 17 to 2. 82; and mean HI values varied from 0. 05 to 0. 10. The mean values of the median doses of the spared parotid were 26. 5 Gy for RapidArc and 23 Gy for VMAT, 14. 1 Gy for Tomo. For fixed gantry techniques 21 Gy was achieved for step&shoot+KonRad, 17. 0 Gy for step&shoot+Panther DAO, 23. 3 Gy for step&shoot+Pinnacle and 18. 6 Gy for sliding window. V 5 Gy values were lowest for the sliding window IMRT technique (3499 ccm) and largest for RapidArc (5480 ccm). The lowest mean MU value of 408 was achieved by Panther DAO, compared to 1140 for sliding window IMRT. Conclusions All IMRT delivery technologies with their associated TPS provide plans with satisfying target coverage {{while at the same}} time respecting the defined OAR criteria. Sliding window IMRT, RapidArc and Tomo techniques resulted in better target dose homogeneity compared to VMAT and step&shoot IMRT. Rotational IMRT based on C-arm linacs and Tomotherapy seem to be advantageous with respect to OAR sparing and treatment delivery efficiency, at the cost of higher dose delivered to normal tissues. The overall treatment plan quality using Tomo seems to be better than the other TPS technology combinations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Tiv {{language}} {{is one of}} the major languages spoken in central Nigeria. The {{language is}} of the Benue-Congo subclass of the Bantu parent family. It has over four million speakers spoken in five states of Nigeria. The language like many other Nigerian languages is in dire need of language planning efforts and strategies.
