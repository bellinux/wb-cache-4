40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} adverse {{outcomes}} amongst <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> childhood cancer using the British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS) and the Pancare Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Survivor Care and Follow-up studies (PCSF). The specific aims were to investigate (1) adverse outcomes up to 50 years <b>of</b> follow-up in <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> Wilms’ tumour; (2) risks of hospitalisations due to renal morbidities in childhood cancer survivors; (3) risk of subsequent primary neoplasms arising in the digestive system in <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> childhood cancer; and (4) adverse outcomes beyond 50 years <b>of</b> follow-up in <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> heritable retinoblastoma. This thesis demonstrated that <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> Wilms’ tumour are at substantial risk of premature mortality, particularly {{for those who}} have survived 30 years from original diagnosis. This particular group <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> have the highest risk of hospitalisations due to renal morbidities, such as chronic renal failure, and subsequent primary neoplasms in specific organs in the lower digestive system. <b>Survivors</b> <b>of</b> heritable retinoblastoma who received external beam radiotherapy experienced an increased risk of subsequent primary neoplasms developing above the shoulder, whereas those who received brachytherapy were similar to those who did not receive any radiotherapy and did not experience an increased risk of subsequent primary neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|Many {{long term}} {{sequelae}} result from previous treatment for malignancy in childhood. However, little information exists on cardiopulmonary response and energy expenditure during exercise and their possible associations with excess body fat. Measurements of body composition and exercise capacity both at low intensity and maximal aerobic capacity {{were made on}} 56 long term <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> childhood malignancy (35 <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 21 <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> other malignancies) and 32 siblings acting as controls. Female <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> ALL had significantly greater mean (SD) body fat than <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> other malignancies and siblings (32. 5 (6. 4) % v 24. 3 (4. 4) % and 26. 3 (8. 5) % respectively, p < 0. 005).

Stroke volume, measured indirectly, was reduced and heart rate raised in ALL survivors at sub-maximal exercise levels. Peak oxygen consumption was significantly reduced in girls and boys treated for ALL compared with siblings (30. 5 v 41. 3 ml/kg/min for girls, p < 0. 05 and 39. 9 v 47. 6 ml/kg/min for boys, p < 0. 05 respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background Concern {{regarding}} the health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) <b>of</b> long-term <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> thyroid cancer has risen due to the rapid increase {{in the incidence of}} thyroid cancer, which generally has an excellent prognosis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the status of HRQOL in disease-free <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and to evaluate the important determinants of HRQOL. Methods This was a cross-sectional study in which we interviewed consecutive disease-free <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> DTC. Three different validated questionnaires ("EORTC QLQ-C 30 " for various functional domains, the "brief fatigue inventory (BFI) " and the "hospital anxiety and depression scale" (HADS)) were used. Data from a large, population based survey of 1, 000 people were used as a control. Results The response rate for the questionnaires was 78. 9 % (316 / 401). Disease-free <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> DTC showed a decreased HRQOL in all five functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social) on the EORTC QLQ-C 30 compared with controls (P P Conclusions Although disease-free <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> DTC are expected to have disease-specific survival comparable to the general population, they experience a significantly decreased HRQOL. Anxiety, depression, and fatigue were the major determinants of the decreased HRQOL.
