60|$|So a <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> {{was agreed}} upon, and some law {{passed by the}} Council, the only {{governing}} body among the Abati, for they possessed no representative institutions, under which law a kind of conscription was established for a while. Let me say at once that it met with the most intense opposition. The Abati were agriculturalists who loathed military service. From their childhood they {{had heard of the}} imminence of invasion, but no actual invasion had ever yet taken place. The Fung were always without, and they were always within, an inland isle, the wall of rock that they thought impassable being their sea which protected them from danger.|$|E

Others demurred to any grant of means for military purposes which might be construed into an act of hostility. To meet this scruple it was suggested that the grant might be made for the purpose of encouraging and protecting all settlers on the waters of the Mississippi.

60|$|The Durhams {{had cleared}} the path, {{but the other}} regiments of Lyttelton's Brigade {{followed}} hard at their heels, and before night they had firmly established themselves upon the hill. But the fatal slowness which had marred General Buller's previous operations again prevented him from completing his success. Twice {{at least in the}} course of these operations there is evidence of sudden impulse to drop his tools {{in the midst of his}} task and to do no more for the day. So it was at Colenso, where an order was given at an early hour for the whole force to retire, and the guns which might have been covered by infantry fire and withdrawn after nightfall were abandoned. So it was also at a critical moment at this action at Vaalkranz. In the original <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> it had been planned that an adjoining hill, called the Green Hill, which partly commanded Vaalkranz, should be carried also. The two together made a complete position, while singly each was a very bad neighbour to the other. On the aide-de-camp riding up, however, to inquire from General Buller whether the time had come for this advance, he replied, 'We have done enough for the day,' and left out this essential portion of his original scheme, with the result that all miscarried.|$|E
60|$|It {{may appear}} {{somewhat}} affected, that {{in so much}} discourse upon this extraordinary party, I should say so little of the Earl of Bute, who is the supposed head of it. But this was neither owing to affectation nor inadvertence. I have carefully avoided the introduction of personal reflections of any kind. Much {{the greater part of}} the topics which have been used to blacken this nobleman are either unjust or frivolous. At best, they have a tendency to give the resentment of this bitter calamity a wrong direction, and to turn a public grievance into a mean personal, or a dangerous national, quarrel. Where there is a regular <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> carried on, it is the system, and not any individual person who acts in it, that is truly dangerous. This system has not risen solely from the ambition of Lord Bute, but from the circumstances which favoured it, and from an indifference to the constitution which had been for some time growing among our gentry. We should have been tried with it, if the Earl of Bute had never existed; and it will want neither a contriving head nor active members, when the Earl of Bute exists no longer. It is not, therefore, to rail at Lord Bute, but firmly to embody against this Court party and its practices, which can afford us any prospect of relief in our present condition.|$|E
60|$|By gradual {{reinforcements}} {{the force}} under French had {{by the end}} of January attained the respectable figure of ten thousand men, strung over a large extent of country. His infantry consisted of the 2nd Berkshires, 1st Royal Irish, 2nd Wiltshires, 2nd Worcesters, 1st Essex, and 1st Yorkshires; his cavalry, of the 10th Hussars, the 6th Dragoon Guards, the Inniskillings, the New Zealanders, the N.S. W. Lancers, some Rimington Guides, and the composite Household Regiment; his artillery, the R and O batteries of R.H.A., the 4th R.F.A., and a section of the 37th Howitzer Battery. At the risk of tedium I have repeated the units of this force, because there are no operations during the war, with the exception perhaps of those of the Rhodesian Column, concerning which it is so difficult to get a clear impression. The fluctuating forces, the vast range of country covered, and the petty farms which give their names to positions, all tend to make the issue vague and the narrative obscure. The British still lay in a semicircle extending from Slingersfontein upon the right to Kloof Camp upon the left, and the general <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> continued to be an enveloping movement upon the right. General Clements commanded this section of the forces, while the energetic Porter carried out the successive advances. The lines had gradually stretched until they were nearly fifty miles in length, and something of the obscurity in which the operations have been left is due to the impossibility of any single correspondent having a clear idea of what was occurring over so extended a front.|$|E

Ultrasonic motors also offer arbitrarily largerotation or sliding distances, while piezoelectric actuators are limited by the static strain that may be induced in the piezoelectric element.|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the USCID Fourth International Conference on Irrigation and Drainage held in Sacramento, California, USA, 3 - 6 October, 2007 The irrigation network of this study consists of three branch canals (the Machai Branch Canal, the Pehure High Level Canal (PHLC) and the Maira Branch Canal) connected {{to each other in}} such a way that the Machai Branch and the PHLC feed the Maira Branch Canal for providing a reliable irrigation service. The Machai Branch Canal has limited and erratic discharges and can not fulfill the peak water requirements of the Maira Branch Canal and therefore any deficiency in the supplies to the Maira Branch Canal is automatically compensated by the PHLC. PHLC is an automatic canal and has been equipped with Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) discharge controllers at its head whereas the Machai Branch Canal has fixed supply based operations. The Maira Branch Canal is also an automatically downstream controlled irrigation canal, which is operated according to crop water requirements using Crop Based Irrigation Operations (CBIO) model. Under this <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> the flows remain changing most of the time following the crop water requirements curve. The frequent changes in discharges keep the canal in unsteady state conditions, which affect the functioning of automatic discharge and water level regulation structures. Efficient system operation is a prerequisite for getting better water productivity and the precise understanding of the behavior of the structures and canal's hydrodynamics against such changes is a key for getting effective system operations. In this paper the canal's hydrodynamic behavior and the automatic structures' functioning have been assessed and suggestions have been provided to fine tune the automatic discharge controllers in order to avoid the oscillatory and abrupt hydrodynamic behavior in the canal. The guidelines have been provided for the operation of the secondary system for achieving smooth and sustainable operations of the canals. In addition to this the effects of any discharge variation in the Machai Branch Canal on the automatic discharge controller's behavior also has been assessed...|$|E

It is situated on the Hawkesbury River near Windsor and consists of three areas: Cattai Park at the junction of Cattai Creek and the Hawkesbury River, Hope Farm which adjoins Cattai Park to the north, and Mitchell Park approximately 2. 5 kilometres upstream along Cattai Creek. Part of the national park was an original First Fleet grant and the park contains important historic and archaeological resources, including a homestead built in the 1820 s, ruins of a stone windmill which {{is thought to be}} the oldest industrial building in Australia, convict-built dry stone walls, and a range of other features which reflect changes in the place since the early nineteenth century. The national park also contains a number of Aboriginal sites which are of importance {{to our understanding of the}} Cattai area prior to European settlement. This plan of management places a high priority on the protection and interpretation of the cultural values of the park. Important remnants of vegetation communities that were once common in the Sydney area also remain in Cattai National Park, including valuable wetland areas, tall forests and gallery rainforest. Priority is given in this plan of management to protecting these remnant areas and to the regeneration of the native vegetation in many other places within the park. Cattai National Park provides facilities for recreational pursuits such as camping, picnicking, bushwalking and horse-riding. The three sections of the park will continue be managed to provide complementary recreational opportunities.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an obfuscation problem, in which indistinguishability is considered relatively to programs with distinguishable functionality. The functionality remains undisclosed owing to unknown parameters in the program’s input.
