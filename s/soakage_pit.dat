50|$|All in all, WASEP’s {{integrated}} intervention package consists of:1. Community Mobilization and ParticipationWASEP trains partner {{villages to}} take ownership of {{all aspects of}} the intervention including water supply, sanitation, drainage, operation, maintenance and health and hygiene education. Responsibility for a scheme is entrusted to a village Water and Sanitation Committee and beneficiaries pay tariffs to cover the operations and maintenance costs. WASEP’s design process is participatory in nature involving communities, particularly women, at all stages of the intervention.2. Water Quality ManagementA key objective of WASEP is to provide potable water to meet World Health Organization standards. WASEP most often sources water from natural mountain springs or water channels of the Indus River requiring installation of village level filtration plants. The system is easy to operate, and does not require electricity, making it ideal for rural settings. The plant design is the result of extensive research and helps mitigate the high level of turbidity and mirco-biological contamination experienced in many of the target areas.3. Potable Water SupplyAfter source testing, water is collected and piped through high-density polyethylene pipes to a storage reservoir, and then onwards into the village where each home or cluster of homes is provided with a tap-stand providing 45-70 liters of water per capita per day. Responsible water use and management is promoted in areas where water supply is limited through village education sessions. Communities contribute to the construction of the water supply scheme by providing local material and unskilled labor free of cost to the program. WASEP ensures that water is potable at all points in the supply chain.4. Gray Water DrainageWASEP installs infrastructure for the disposal of dirty (gray) and excess (spillover) water at each tap-stand, comprising cemented platforms with a drain, leading to either a <b>soakage</b> <b>pit</b> or an existing overland channel, where it is diluted before re-entering the system of water supply.5. Household Sanitation InfrastructureHygienic sanitation facility {{plays an important role in}} WASEP’s intervention. Following a comprehensive and objective information session on the options available, communities choose the sanitation technology of their preference. Three basic types are available to communities to meet different cultural preference for latrine facilities. Households are motivated to construct the latrine themselves and are provided with technical assistance and construction advice to build efficiently.6. Health and Hygiene EducationTo focus on health and hygiene awareness WASEP has initiated a Community and School Health Improvement Program through which household and schools visits are made once every two months. This program addresses topics such as diarrhea, worms, personal hygiene and operation and maintenance of water scheme. Additionally, at each visit, health and hygiene promoters monitor progressive changes in the health and hygiene related behavior of each household.|$|E

Most of the houses and buildings are attached {{with some kind of}} a sewage disposal facility as central sewage disposal systems are limited. Urbanization is expected to create many problems in terms of black water disposal due to limitation of land. A study was done in Gampaha municipality area, an urban center, where there is no central sewage treatment facility. The objectives of the study were to analyze the current situation of the black water disposal system in the study area and to identify the shortcomings of the black water disposal system comparing with the standards. The study was conducted within the urban center in five GN divisions. Random samples of 44 households were selected to represent all the five GN divisions. Selected households were interviewed to collect basic data needed and physical measurements were also taken where necessary. The data categories collected are household information, toilet type and size, desludging interval and distance to nearest well. The code of practice for the design and construction of septic tanks reports that 80 % of urban communities use septic tanks for sewage disposal, but this study reveals that only 18 % of the population uses septic tanks. Over 82 % uses typical <b>soakage</b> <b>pits</b> that are constructed with loosely constructed brick walls and bare bottom open to soil for their sewage disposal. Over 68 % of the households have their toilet pits within 15 m to the nearest well, which is below the recommended distance. Only 30 % of the households comply with over 15 m to the nearest well that is recommended for septic tanks. The recommended distance for the <b>soakage</b> <b>pits</b> to the nearest well is 30 m and only 9 % of the households meet this standard. The black water disposal pits are over sized in general, so that the desludging interval is more than 10 years. Recently constructed houses, due to limitation of space, have reduced the size of the pits reducing the size of desludging interval.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) and {{phosphorus}} (P) are two essential macronutrients required in agricultural production. The major share of this production relies on chemical fertilizer that requires energy and relies on limited resources (P). Since these nutrients are {{lost to the}} environment, {{there is a need}} to shift from this linear urban metabolism to a circularmetabolisminwhich N and P fromdomestic waste and wastewater are reused in agriculture. A first step to facilitate a transition to more circular urban N and P management is to understand the flows of these resources in a coupled urban-agricultural system. For the first time this paper presents a Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) approach for the assessment of the coupled agricultural and urban systems under limited data availability in a small island. The developed SFA approach is used to identify intervention points that can provide N and P stocks for agricultural production. The island of St. Eustatius, a small island in the Caribbean, was used as a case study. The model developed in this study consists of eight sub-systems: agricultural and natural lands, urban lands, crop production, animal production, market, household consumption, <b>soakage</b> <b>pit</b> and opendump landfill. A total of 26 flows were identified and quantified for a period of one year (2013). The results showed that the agricultural system is a significant source for N and P loss because of erosion/run-off and leaching. Moreover, urban sanitation systems contribute to deterioration of the island's ecosystem through N and P losses fromdomesticwaste andwastewater by leaching and atmosphericemission. Proposed interventions are the treatment of blackwater and greywater for the recovery of N and P. In conclusion, this study allows for identification of potential N and P losses and proposes mitigation measures to improve nutrient management in a small island contex...|$|E

Due to {{the high number of}} employees, these factories are always encountered with the problem of handling large quantities of low strength sewage generated from lavatories, canteens and kitchens. In such factories sewage is usually handled using conventional septic tank - <b>soakage</b> <b>pit</b> systems. Such systems are commonly found infested with insects, and promote further breeding. They cause nuisance due to obnoxious odor, and is a major cause for severe ground and surface water pollution. It has been noted that these factories have critical problems of handling sewage during rainy season, especially when the factory is located in areas with high ground water table such as a marshy land or near a surface water body. The activated sludge suspended growth aerobic systems designed to treat sewage in most of the factories have various operational problems which increase the operator involvement and therefore the plants performance are operator dependent. Activated sludge suspended growth aerobic systems are more susceptible for sludge bulking which leads to poor effluent quality and the unbulking process is very difficult and ~time consuming. In addition to this, the several parameters such as SVI, MLVSS, etc have to be monitored carefully in the conventional activated sludge systems for the proper operation and the maintenance which increase the operational and the maintenance cost. The maintenance departments of factories always request a trouble free sewage treatment plant to minimize their involvement in operation of the plant. Therefore the submerged attached growth aerobic systems are becoming the most appropriate system as an alternative of the activated sludge system for treating low strength effluent, sewage from factories. A leading company in Sri Lanka which provides turnkey solutions for waste water and sewage has introduced submerged attached growth aerobic and anaerobic treatment systems to overcome above issues [...] Depending on the affordability of the client and the space availability they have introduce submerged attached growth aerobic systems in two ways.

However no proper study has been carried out to find out the most appropriate submerged attached growth system to treat sewage generated from factories.

However, some factories consist of a conventional activated sludge system and a higher percentage of activated sludge processes found in these factories are in the malfunctional stage due to the least attention by the factory management. The activated sludge systems require a very high attention for the proper operation. The major problem of such factories is the giving of the least priority for the above issue and therefore the allocation of competent personal to operate plant is neglected.,. ' Therefore, their key demand is to provide them a treatment system to treat sewage with minimal operational difficulties and minimal labour involvement to overcome above problem. This research was therefore carried out with the following objectives to fulfill the above requirement. The broad objective is the study and compare the performance of aerobic attached growth and aerobic. suspended growth processes designed for factory sewage and recommend the most appropriate treatment regime for the factory sewage with regard to less operational and maintenance issues. Therefore, BOD removal efficiency and nitrogen removal efficiency have been compared for both processes in order to evaluate the performance of the each process. The estimation of sludge wasting, appropriation of process control parameters and operational issues in both processes are studied for the justification of the operational feasibility of each process. The land utilization and operational and maintenance cost have been estimated to identify the economical feasibility of each process. This study has proved that the BOD removal efficiencies of each process are equal and the nitrogen removal percentages are 43 % and 37 % in attached growth process and suspended growth process respectively. Sludge production is 27 % less in attached growth process and thereby sludge handling is easy and esthetically good. The operational issues have been proved less in attached growth process. Annual operational and maintenance cost for the attached growth aerobic process is 30 % less over suspended growth aerobic process. Land requirement (foot print) is 13 % less in attached growth process over suspended growth process. Unit cost Rsl m 3 of treated water for attached growth process has been proved that 32 % less.

40|$|The {{impact of}} septic tank {{effluent}} disposal on groundwater quality was investigated at Oxford. The Oxford township {{can be regarded}} as typical of many small communities on the Canterbury Plains which have a high density of septic systems serviced by <b>soakage</b> <b>pit</b> drainage. The primary concern with grouped septic systems is the potential for both chemical and microbial groundwater contamination. The alluvial gravel aquifers of the Canterbury Plains are especially susceptible to microbial contamination due to the high rates of groundwater flow which may transport both bacteria and viral contaminants over large distances. Geological investigations established the presence of an areally extensive, tuff derived, clay unit which forms an aquitard beneath the unconfined aquifer in the north of the Oxford area. Recharge of the unconfined aquifer above the clay unit is exclusively from rainfall infiltration while to the south, groundwater levels respond to rainfall infiltration and influent seepage from the Eyre River. The presence of two hydrogeologically distinct gravel units within the unconfined aquifer was determined by application of the column dilution technique. Point dilution tests showed the average groundwater velocity of 130 m/day in the upper gravel unit to be significantly higher than the 40 m/day measured in the underlying gravels. The presence of discrete channels of preferred flow within the unconfined aquifer system was also established by point dilution tests, intrachannel velocities ranging from 210 to 400 m/day. A resistivity salt tracing test indicated groundwater flow in an easterly direction with a velocity of 250 m/day through an observed channel feature. Groundwater quality monitoring showed a significant degree of groundwater contamination close to the Oxford township. Concentrations of faecal coliform bacteria in excess of drinking water standards were detected up to 900 m downgradient of the nearest septic tank. Elevated levels of chemical indicators (N 03 -N, CL-) were also detected in all monitoring wells. The pattern of groundwater contamination was complex, reflecting both the heterogeneity of groundwater flow through the unconfined aquifer system and the influence of monitoring well location. Predictive modelling indicated the potential for the transport of faecal coliform bacteria up to 2. 6 km downgradient of Oxford. Modelling also suggested increased urban development within Oxford to have a relatively minor effect on the overall extent of groundwater contamination. Additional hydrogeological and water quality data, aided by the application of numerical solute transport modelling techniques, may provide a more accurate estimate of the impact of septic tank effluent disposal on groundwater quality. Future sewage disposal options for Oxford have to balance the low potential for microbial contamination of drinking water supplies outside the groundwater zone delineated by this study, against the environmental acceptability continuing contamination of this zone. This study has identified the need for further research into the effects of septic tank effluent discharge on groundwater quality in the Canterbury region, to provide a sound base for future resource management decisions...|$|E

This research project {{was supported by}} Redd Barna (Norwegian Save the Children) and the International Rescue Committee. Some historical information was supplied by Fred Cuny. Sanitation Systems. (202) Southeast & Far East Asia /Thailand. (802. 4 J) The digital Cuny Archive was made available in part through funding assistance from USAID. A conventional aquaprivy consists of a squat plate with a drop-pipe making a water seal directly into a small septic tank underneath. Anaerobic digestion of the faecal material {{takes place in the}} tank, and excess effluent is drained off into a nearby seep away (also called ?<b>soakage</b> <b>pit?).</b> To function properly, the septic tank must be water-tight, and the water seal where the pipe empties into the tank must be maintained. The sludge which accumulates in the septic tank after the partial breakdown of the faecal matter must be periodically removed. During the normal use of a familysized tank, desludging will be necessary only every few years (Kalbermatten et al., 1980). Variations on the aquaprivy include the self-topping or sullage aquaprivy which can accept household waste-water, and the sewered aquaprivy where effluent flows directly into a sewage system. In theory, the aqua privy meets technical criteria for an excreta disposal system not requiring excessively high inputs of technology, money or water. When properly maintained, surface soil and water are protected from contamination, and there should be minimal nuisance from flies and odour (Wagner and Lanoix, 1958). In practice, however, the aquaprivy has not always been successfully employed. In most cases, this is because the water seal was not maintained when insufficient water was introduced into the tank on a regular basis. This may have occurred where water supply was not located close enough to the aquaprivy, or where there was reluctance, for cultural reasons, to carry water into the toilet (Iwugo, 1981). When the water seal is not maintained, mosquitoes and flies breed in the privy creating a health hazard, and odour becomes a problem. In other cases, disposal of the liquid effluent into the soil failed, so that the seepaway required frequent mechanical emptying. Strategies to achieve this task have not always been adequate (McGarry, 1977). The drop-pipe may also become clogged where solid materials are used for anal cleansing. Aquaprivies were invented in India in the early 1900 s (Williams, 1924). They have subsequently been used in many countries in Asia and their application appears to be successful on that continent (McGarry, 1977). Aquaprivies have been installed in several African countries including Botswana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, with mixed results (Iwugo, 1981). In one African nation, the building of aquaprivies has been banned because of some of the problems outlined above. Some aquaprivies were constructed in the West Indies in the 1950 s and 1960 s, with good public acceptance (Sebastian and Buchanan, 1965). Aquaprivies appear to have been used most satisfactorily where water is used for anal cleansing, daily washing of the toilet bowl is practiced, and soil is sufficiently permeable to absorb all effluent. Recently, authors have recommended against the aquaprivy as a viable sanitation option in most situations because there are technically superior systems- available at a lower cost (Kalbermatten et alf 1980). In addition, although the aquaprivy was previously considered a viable intermediate technology option, the necessity of relatively frequent and regular maintenance not required by many other excreta disposal systems has led to some questioning of its suitability for developing countries...|$|E

In such factories sewage is usually handled using conventional septic tank - <b>soakage</b> <b>pit</b> systems. Such systems are commonly found infested with insects, and promote further breeding.

It has been noted that these factories have critical problems of handling sewage during rainy season, especially when the factor) ' is located in areas with high ground water table such as a marshy land or near a surface water body. / To solve the problem of handling septic tank effluents. Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) treatment plants have been provided in several factories due to their lower cost arid minimum use of land area. Most of these plants produce effluents of quality far better than what is stipulated by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) effluent standards. Parameters such as BOD are sometimes being reduced even down to undetectable levels which are rather unnecessary. Moreover, it has been noted by the industry that there may be possibilities to cut down the monthly electrical cost by operating the treatment plants at optimal levels of treatment. On the other hand, treatment plant contractors have noted that the bid prices were relatively high due to over-treatment specified and set under conventional design criteria. Over-treatment and possibly higher than necessary, raw-BOD value for design purposes, seem to be the problem areas. Therefore, it is important to find a better value for aeration factor expressed in terms of oxygen dissolved in clean water (ODCW), for the use in calculations of aerobic sewage treatment plant designs, treating septic tank effluents. The lengthy calculations needed for designing aeration tanks and selection of number and type of aerators are therefore perceived to be correctly, easily and quickly done if a proper empirical value for aeration factor is available. ITic research was therefore carried out with the following objectives: 1. A reasonably accurate value for the oxygen requirement in oxidation of 1 kg of BOI) (Aeration factor) used in design calculations. / 2. To propose a reasonably correct value for septic tank effluent BOD for garment factories. / 3. To calculate the cost saving with a new value of aeration factor both operational and capital. It was found by the experiments carried out in this research, and samples taken simultaneously elsewhere that the average septic tank effluent BOD was around 250 mg/ 1 and ranged between 186 mg/ 1 to 284 mg/l against the previously used value of 300 mg/ 1 which is 17 % less. / The aeration factor used for carbonaceous oxygen in designing above SBR plants was 4 kgOi/kg BOD and the value proposed in literature for various other countries range from 1 - 2. 5 kg 02 /kg BOD depending on temperature fluctuations. This research suggests 3. 5 kg 02 /kg BOD, as an appropriate value for respiration factor in treating septic tank effluents from Sri Lankan garment factories. This is a reduction of 12. 5 % in oxygen requirement compared to previously used value. The effect of application of above two parameters in the form of electrical power and capital saving were approximately 27 % and 25 % respectively for the particular SBR design used for them research...|$|E

40|$|Colombo City is the {{commercial}} capital of Sri Lanka {{with an estimated}} resident population of over 750, 000 spread over 3741 hectares (ha) and has a population density over 1188 per ha. It {{is located in the}} western coast of Sri Lanka and is in wet zone. The topography is of flat terrain with a mix of land and water. Considering the population and the limited undeveloped land available, the disposal of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and Sewer is a major environmental problem in Colombo. The major object of this thesis is to identify and evaluate a productive waste management system that is not only environmental friendly but also sustainable and cost effective. In this context, as a sustainable technology, applicability of anaerobic digestion is investigated and methane generation potential of the waste is evaluated. In order to identify a sustainable waste management system, the quantity of waste generated within the city of Colombo is identified. The current practices of disposal of these wastes are then reviewed to identify any issues regarding its sustainability. The majority of the MSW is currently disposed as open landfill that is causing pollution of waterways, with its leachate, as well as the polluting the atmosphere around it with its bad odour. The sewer is discharged to sea or disposed via a self-contained <b>soakage</b> <b>pit.</b> Except for few small-scale anaerobic digestion plants that use solid waste for generation of biogas for localized use, there is no large-scale waste to energy projects in operation in Sri Lanka. The sewer is not used productively at all. Having identified the quantity of waste and the disposal methods practiced, the priority is to identify sustainable and productive methods of disposal of wastes that suits best the local conditions. With this in view research hitherto carried out are studied and available literature is reviewed. The objective is to ascertain the processes that productively harness the energy potential of MSW and Sewer, individually or in combination. There are many physical and chemical methods for treatment of wastes. However bioconversion of waste provides the best options for tapping the energy of the wastes. Of the two main bioconversion methods aanaerobic processes exhibit many advantages over aerobic digestion with its ability of handling high organic loading rates and low sludge production. However, the reason for the increase in applications of anaerobic processes, is, its potential for production of energy using the biogas generated. The methane so produced can replace fossil fuel and therefore has a direct positive effect on greenhouse gas reduction. Therefore, compared with other bioconversion technologies for treatment of MSW and sewer/wastewater, the energy and environment benefits make anaerobic digestion an attractive option. Anaerobic treatment of waste in an engineered landfill bioreactor is found to be the best option for treatment of MSW. Whilst providing a decrease in long term environmental risks and low operational and closure costs it provides with valuable energy source in generation of methane. As for sewer generation of methane in anaerobic processes can be enhanced with co-digestion of different types of waste suitably selected. In this regard co-digestion of sewer and wastewater with food waste is found to be productive and is applied in this study. Literature review is carried out to determine suitable models to predict the methane generation potential. The "First Order Decay Model" is identified as the appropriate model for prediction of methane from MSW in landfills. The "Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 " is applied for prediction of methane from sewer and waste water. Chemical composition of MSW is the primary parameter which affects the methane generation. The chemical composition is computed applying the ultimate analysis and using a stoichiometric based approach. For sewer and waste water the basic parameters of BOD and COD concentrations are available from data gathered. Apart from these two parameters the other parameters relevant to local conditions are not available. Therefore values that closely fit the local conditions are taken from the literature. The study determines the methane generation potential of MSW approximately 2. 1 x 106 m 3 per annum and anaerobic co-digestion of sewer and food substrates generate 9. 1 x 106 m 3 per annum. If parameters could be determined for the wastes generated locally the accuracy of the methane generation potential could be further enhanced. In this context, further studies, should be directed from the conventional landfills to "Anaerobic Bioreactor Controlled" landfill, where circulation of liquids including leachate is carried out to increase the biogas yield. For sewer the focus should be on the most economical foot print of parallel banks of number of continuous-flow stirred-tank reactors (CSTR) operating in series to accommodate the total flow rate of sewer...|$|E
