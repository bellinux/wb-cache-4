The DA welcomed Abahali's endorsement, stating that this had come after two years of engagement.|$|E

Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I'm sure it's got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> through.

6000|$|We {{have fallen}} now into {{the mistake of}} idealism. Man always falls {{into one of the}} three mistakes. In China, it is tradition. And in the South Seas, it seems to have been impulse. Ours is idealism. Each of the three modes is a true life-mode. But any one, alone or dominant, brings us to destruction. We must depend on the wholeness of our being, {{ultimately}} only on that, which is our Holy Ghost within us. Whereas, in an ideal of love and benevolence, we have tried to automatize ourselves into little love-engines always stoked with the sorrows or beauties of other people, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> up steam of charity or righteous wrath. A great trick is to pour on the fire the oil of our indignation at somebody else's wickedness, and then, when we've got up steam like hell, back the engine and run bish! smash! against the belly of the offender. Because he said he didn't want to love any more, we hate him for evermore, and try to run over him, every bit of him, with our love-tanks. And all the time we yell at him: [...] "Will you deny love, you villain? Will you?" [...] And by the time he faintly squeaks, [...] "I want to be loved! I want to be loved!" [...] we have got so used to running over him with our love-tanks that we don't feel in a hurry to leave off.|$|E

When you are married, you and Kitty can live in the back building,--for, of course, your house will now be {{the same thing as}} a back building,--and you can have the second floor. We won't have any separate tables, because it will be a great deal nicer for you and Kitty to live with me, and it will simply be your paying board for two persons instead of one. And you know you can manage your vineyard just as well {{from the bottom of the}} hill as from the top. The lower rooms of what used to be your house can be made very pleasant and comfortable for all of us. I have been thinking about the room on the right that you had planned for a parlor, and it will make a lovely sitting-room for us, which is a thing we have never had, and the room on the other side is just what will suit beautifully for a guest-chamber. The two houses together, with the roof of my back porch properly joined to the front of your house, will make a beautiful and spacious dwelling. It was fortunate, too, that you painted your house a light yellow. I have often looked at the two together, and thought what a good thing it was that one was not one color and the other another. As to the pump, it will be very easy now to put a pipe from what used to be your back porch to our kitchen, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> water without being obliged to carry it. Between us we can make all sorts of improvements, and some time I will tell you of a good many that I have thought of.|$|E
