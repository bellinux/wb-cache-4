40|$|In recent years, {{genome-wide}} association studies (GWAS) {{have successfully}} identified loci that harbor genetic variants associated with complex diseases.

However, {{the large number of}} pairs to be tested for epistasis poses significant challenges, in terms of both computational (run-time) and statistical (multiple hypothesis testing) considerations. In this paper, we propose a new method {{to reduce the number of}} tests required to identify epistatic pairs <b>of</b> ge-nomic <b>loci.</b> The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to reduce the data by identifying <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>loci</b> that may be com-plementary in their association with the disease. Namely, we identify population covering locus sets (PoCos), i. e., <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>loci</b> that harbor at least one susceptibility allele in samples with the phenotype of interest. Then we compute represen-tative genotypes for PoCos, and assess the significance of the interactions between pairs of PoCos. We use the results of this assessment to prioritize pairs <b>of</b> <b>loci</b> to be tested for epistasis. We test the proposed method on two indepen-dent GWAS data <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> Type 2 Diabetes (T 2 D). Our ex-perimental results show that the proposed method reduces the number of hypotheses to be tested drastically, enabling efficient identification <b>of</b> more epistatic <b>loci</b> that are statis-tically significant.

At the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Russell's initial goal was to determine the rate of inheritable gene mutations in the germ line induced by radiations. Thus he decided to use T-stock mice in order to define how often a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>loci</b> could be mutated with radiations. Since the mutations in the T-stock mouse were recessive, the progeny would have a wild type phenotype (as a result of crossing a mutant mutant male to a wild type female +/+).

This approach, the specific locus test (SLT) allowed Russell to study a wide range of specific mutations and to calculate the mutation rates induced by radiations.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{genome-wide}} {{links between}} genotype and phenotype {{has generally been}} difficult due to both the complexity of phenotypes, and until recently, inaccessibility to large numbers of genes that might underlie a trait. To address this issue, we establish the association between particular RNAi phenotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans and sequence characteristics of the corresponding proteins and DNA. We find that genes showing RNAi phenotypes are long and highly expressed with little noncoding DNA and high rates of synonymous site substitution (KS). In addition, genes conferring RNAi phenotypes have significantly lower rates of nonsynonymous site substitution (KA). Collectively, these sequence features explain nearly 20 % {{of the difference between}} the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>loci</b> that display or lack a RNAi-mediated effect, and reflect aspects both of the RNAi mechanism and the biological function of the genes.
