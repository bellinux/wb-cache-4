40|$|Public {{transport}} use and <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> {{have always}} influenced each other. During {{the last decade}} governments {{are more and more}} trying to get grip onto this process via different types of policy tools. One of these tools is Transit Oriented Development (TOD). In TOD the use of existing and new public transport network is stimulated by building new residential areas close to these networks. Since there are other influence factors as well, Transit Oriented Development is not always a success. This study identifies these factors and quantifies them using the Dutch transportation model NRM (Nederlands Regionaal Model. Different <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> and public transport network adjustments for the Randstad south wing (called StedenbaanPlus) are combined and per influence factor molded into different NRM scenario's. The results are as expected; the largest influences found on public transport use are indeed the <b>spatial</b> <b>developments,</b> the economic situation {{and the quality of the}} transit system itself. Other effects are relatively small, but not negligible. Final conclusion is that StedenbaanPlus is feasible for some projects and the overall effect is that TOD can lead to an additional demand for public transport of up to 20 %.

40|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>developments</b> are {{becoming}} more and more non-linear, dynamic and complex with a wide range of possible actors. The awareness of uncertainty in spatial planning is growing and therefore, projects need to integrate a high level of flexibility. But at the same time, a growing demand for taking more informed and well-argued decisions is noticeable. Predictions out of the ‘best estimated model’ are no longer credible and no longer accepted, because they are too fragile and uncertain. How can we keep these long-lasting, multi-actor projects in permanent transition on the right track? This article presents an evaluation methodology that goes beyond the traditional, rational evaluation attitudes with a low level of flexibility being too linear to match the current <b>spatial</b> <b>developments.</b> There is a need for more interrelated, alert and flexible means of evaluation, co-evolving with the processes and current dynamics in spatial planning. Therefore, different evaluation approaches are introduced, depending on the specific interdependencies of the object of evaluation and its context. Subsequently, the theoretical framework is translated towards a more practical level. A case study conducted in Flanders illustrates the current <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> and a possible evaluation approach, incorporated from the beginning of the process, to guide this kind of projects...|$|R
40|$|Dutch spatial {{planning}} {{policy and practice}} are moving towards a more balanced and – even more than before – comprehensive approach of <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> (Ministry of VROM et al., 2004). Together with trends such as the public cuts in housing and agricultural budgets, new partnerships {{between public and private}} stakeholders in {{spatial planning}}, a call for more quality of space (public space in particular), this has led to a search for new creative financing constructions (De Jong and Spaans, 2009). In this context new concepts and mechanisms to approach <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> are developed. Red-for-green is such a new mechanism which is increasingly used in Dutch <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> (Ministries of LNV & VROM, 2009). The revenues from urban developments such as housing, offices and industrial estates, are partly used to finance investments in the rural landscape. Often it concerns complex, long-term projects at the supra local level in which several land-uses have to be realised. In this paper we elaborate on the Dutch concept of red-for-green. We relate this concept to international literature and national spatial planning policy documents. We then propose a typology of the many different projects which are undertaken under this umbrella and analyse the different types of problems which this type of projects encounters. We conclude with some propositions to overcome these problems (De Wolff et al., 2009) ...|$|R

40|$|At the {{northern}} part of Rotterdam, the City Region Rotterdam and the province of South Holland are creating possibilities to strengthen the economic structure of the South Wing of Randstad Holland. With the launch of the Spatial Plan Region Rotterdam 2020, efforts towards a comprehensive development of this part of the city are made. The area-oriented programme North Axis embodies these efforts and consists of both <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> and infrastructural developments. Rotterdam Noordrand is positioned on the interconnection of these infrastructural developments and has adopted the characteristics of a multimodal location: a location that is connected to both a road network and a public transport network. However, the <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> in Rotterdam Noordrand are being realised on an individual basis, avoiding the comprehensive character of the Spatial Plan Region Rotterdam 2020. A central place within the area is necessary to establish a connection between the segmented sub developments. The research that is outlined in this thesis concerns three possible central places. It identifies how these locations are influenced by the scheduled infrastructural developments. Linear Programming is used as a modelling technique to structure the complex process of urban area development and conducts a strategy for these central locations. The model is optimised for market quality, spatial quality, means and organisation, referring to the four key elements of an optimal strategy. Subsequently, the strategy is translated into programmatic elements. Due to the infrastructural influences, the optimal strategy provides the area with two central places: one in the subarea Rotterdam Airport Business Park and one in the subarea Hoog-Zestienhoven. The comprehensive development of Rotterdam Noordrand is scheduled from 2005 – 2044 and ensures synergy regarding the <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> and infrastructural projects.

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing Africa today is to upgrade sustainable development in areas where poverty and other economic problems are pronounced. The issue of environmental development needs to be enforced, especially as the world is today speaking the environmental language. It might be surprising to note that, only a few countries in Africa have concrete <b>spatial</b> <b>development</b> plans, most of them situated in the extreme South and North of the continent. Good examples are seen in the Republic of South Africa where there is a development plan at the national level called <b>Spatial</b> <b>Development</b> Initiative (SDI), presently known as, the National <b>Spatial</b> <b>Development</b> Perspective (NSDP). The main aim of these plans is to encourage integrated development within a given space defined by its economic potential rather than by political boundaries. Most of the present day <b>spatial</b> <b>development</b> policies in African countries are linked to their colonial history. That is, development plans mainly in the form of transport and infrastructure were focused along the coast and other sources of raw materials in the hinterlands. This {{is one of the reasons}} for spatial inequality in most African countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new approaches of <b>spatial</b> <b>development</b> to obtain equity in enhancement.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{government}} in the spatial domain has changed significantly in recent decades. Developments in society and in the spatial sector {{have led to the}} traditional domains {{of government}}, market and citizens becoming increasingly interwoven. The view which until recently has predominated - of a government that centrally, and in a top-down way, sets the standards for <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> - is no longer applicable. Today, the need for cooperation between governments and other actors in the field in order to find solutions for contemporary spatial issues is increasingly emphasised. Public administration and planning literature pay much attention to the growing interdependencies and the inter-organisational setting in which <b>spatial</b> <b>developments</b> take place. However, little research has been done on the impact of these new arrangements in terms of safeguarding the public interest. In the wider debate on this subject, it is pointed out that conflicting interests and blurred boundaries can undermine the ability to safeguard the public interest. However, it is rarely clear what exactly the public interest is, and whether or not this interest is safeguarded. This research contributes to filling this knowledge gap. This is achieved through developing a conceptual framework - based on theoretical insights - that can serve to evaluate the public interest in specific spatial projects, and an empirical analysis {{of the relationship between the}} design of planning processes and the safeguarding of the public interest.
