30|$|Spatial {{scale is}} of vital {{importance}} for geoscience disciplines {{and must be}} taken into account when considering VFGs (Jones, McCaffrey, Clegg, Wilson, Holliman, et al., 2009). The scale of virtual field guides often differ depending on their purpose and their aims (Ramasundaram, Grunwald, Mangeot, Comerford, & Bliss, 2005). Spatial scale in VFGs can be small scale providing large overviews of topographical data such as mountain ranges (Stott, Nuttall, & McCloskey, 2009; Eusden, Duvall, & Bryant, 2012) and national parks (McMorrow, 2005). Small spatial scale VFG’s can provide a student with a deeper understanding and situational awareness of the topic or location that they are studying (Jacobson et al., 2009). Often students do not maximise their time on fieldwork due to lacking the bigger conceptual picture (Falk, Martin, & Balling, 1978). Providing a large overview of a field location helps a student to formulate ideas and apply knowledge to how that field site sits within the wider world. Small scale VFGs however lack finer details, for example in the VFG designed by Arrowsmith, Counihan, and McGreevy (2005) students anecdotally mentioned that they misinterpreted the distances between sites and that <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> <b>gradients</b> were vastly under estimated.|$|E
40|$|Plankton pump {{samples and}} {{plankton}} tows (size fractions between 0. 04 mm and 1. 01 mm) {{from the eastern}} North Atlantic Ocean contain the following shell- and skeleton-producing planktonic and nektonic organisms, which can be fossilized in the sediments: diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifers, pteropods, heteropods, larvae of benthic gastropods and bivalves, ostracods, and fish. The abundance of these components has been mapped quantitatively in the eastern North Atlantic surface waters in October - December 1971. More ash (after ignition of the organic matter, consisting mostly of these components) per cubic meter of water is found close to land masses (continents and islands) and above shallow submarine elevations than in the open ocean. Preferred biotops of planktonic diatoms in the region described are temperate shallow water and tropical coastal upwelling areas. Radiolarians rarely occur close to the continent, but are abundant in pelagic warm water masses, even near islands. Foraminifers {{are similar to the}} radiolarians, rarer in the coastal water mass of the continent than in the open ocean or off oceanic islands. Their abundance is highest outside the upwelling area off NW Africa. Molluscs generally outnumber planktonic foraminifers, implying that the carbonate cycle of the ocean might be influenced considerably by these animals. The molluscs include heteropods, pteropods, and larvae of benthic bivalves and gastropods. Larvae of benthic molluscs occur more frequently close to continental and island margins and above submarine shoals (in this case mostly guyots) than in the open ocean. Their size increases, but they decrease in number with increasing distance from their area of origin. Ostracods and fish have only been found in small numbers concentrated off NW Africa. All of the above-mentioned components occur in higher abundances in the surface water than in subsurface waters. They are closely related to the hydrography of the sampled water masses (here defined through temperature measurements). Relatively warm water masses of the southeastern branches of the Gulf Stream system transport subtropical and southern temperate species to the Bay of Biscay, relatively cool water masses of the Portugal and Canary Currents carry transitional faunal elements along the NW African coast southwards to tropical regions. These mix in the northwest African upwelling area with tropical faunal elements which are generally assumed to live in the subsurface water masses and which probably have been transported northwards to this area by a subsurface counter current. The faunas typical for tropical surface water masses are not only reduced due to the tongue of cool water extending southwards along the coast, but they are also removed from the coastal zone by the upwelling subsurface water masses carrying their own shell and skeleton assemblages. Tropical water masses contain much more shelland skeleton-producing plankters than subtropical and temperate ones. The climatic conditions found at different latitudes control the development and intensity of a separate continental coastal water mass with its own plankton assemblages. Extent of this water mass and <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> <b>gradients</b> between the pelagic and coastal environment limit the occurrence of pelagic plankton close to the continental coast.

HEK 293 cells expressing the H 30 sensor were subjected to repeated stimulation with either 10 μM PGE 1 or 10 μM isoproterenol in a perfusion chamber. Between each stimulus, the drug was washed away by perfusing with a saline solution (see Materials and methods). Fig. S 1 reports the kinetics of the normalized FRET changes recorded as described in Materials and methods and in the aforementioned conditions. It clearly shows that although the β-adrenergic receptors undergo a robust and rapid desensitization (the FRET change is reduced by ∙ 75 % at 12 min after {{the application of the}} first stimulus) as expected, the prostaglandin receptor does not show any desensitization at 12 min (second application of PGE 1), and, even after repeated stimulations and at ∙ 40 min after the first application of the stimulus, the cAMP response is only marginally reduced (by ∙ 25 %). Fig. S 2 shows {{the evaluation of}} the dose-response relationship between PKA overexpression and <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the cAMP <b>gradient.</b> One <b>of</b> the findings in this study is that PKA has a major role in regulating the <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the cAMP <b>gradient</b> via modulation <b>of</b> PDEs activity.

30|$|We have {{investigated}} a linear mode conversion process among UHR-mode, Z-mode, and LO-mode waves {{by a computer}} simulation solving Maxwell’s equations and the motion of a cold electron fluid. The characteristics of the wave coupling process occurring in the cold magnetized plasma were examined in detail for {{the case of an}} inhomogeneity of plasma density lying perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field. The dependence of the conversion efficiency on the incident wave normal angle, wave frequency, background plasma frequency, and <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> density <b>gradient</b> was studied. The results show that an efficient mode conversion occurred in the conversion process from Z-mode to LO-mode waves rather than from the coupling between UHR-mode to LO-mode waves. They also show that the highest conversion efficiency was obtained under the specific condition of the wave normal angle for the incident waves. In the specific case of such critical wave normal angles, we found that perpendicular components of refractive indexes became zero at the site of mode conversion, which is consistent with previously published results. We also show that the range of the critical normal angle varied depending on both the plasma frequency and the wave frequency. The simulation results also reveal that, when the <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the density <b>gradient</b> was taken into consideration, efficient mode conversion could be expected even {{in the case of the}} mismatch of the refractive indexes preventing the close coupling of plasma waves.|$|R

Furthermore, we distinguish between four aspects of expectancy (probability, difficulty, sufficiency, necessity) and two types of value (value related to high level construal, value related to low level construal), each of which has a unique distance-related dynamics. It is proposed that motivational gradients are determined by the effect that distance has on each of these components. Our study demonstrated <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> motivation, sufficiency and necessity, but not difficulty. We discuss whether avoidance gradients would be necessarily steeper than approach gradients, as is postulated by Miller’s (1944) conflict models.

The model uses portocentral <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> signal molecules as input, while the output depends on two gene-specific variables, viz., the affinity of the gene for its regulatory factors and the degree of cooperativity that determines the response in the signal-transduction pathways. As a preliminary validity test for its performance, the model was tested on control and hormonally induced expression patterns of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK), carbamoylphosphate synthetase I (CPS), and glutamine synthetase (GS).

40|$|Introduction. Health inequalities reflect multidimensional {{inequality}} (income, education, {{and other}} indicators of socioeconomic position) and vary across countries and welfare regimes. To which extent there is intergenerational transmission of health via parental socioeconomic status {{has rarely been}} investigated in comparative perspective. The study sought to explore if different measures of stratification produce the same health gradient and to which extent health <b>gradients</b> <b>of</b> income and of social origins vary with level of living and income inequality. Method. A total of 299, 770 observations were available from 18 countries assessed in EU-SILC 2005 and 2011 data, which contain information on social origins. Income inequality (Gini) and level of living were calculated from EU-SILC. Logit rank transformation provided normalized inequalities and distributions of income and social origins up to the extremes of the distribution and was used to investigate net comparable health gradients in detail. Multilevel random-slope models were run to post-estimate best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) and related standard deviations of residual intercepts (median health) and slopes (income-health gradients) per country and survey year. Results. Health gradients varied across different measures of stratification, with origins and income producing significant slopes after controls. Income inequality was associated with worse average health, but income inequality and <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the health <b>gradient</b> were only marginally associated. Discussion. Linear health gradients suggest gains in health per rank of income and of origins even at the very extremes of the distribution. Intergenerational transmission of status gains in importance in countries with higher income inequality. Countries differ in the association of income inequality and income-related health gradient, and low income inequality may mask health problems of vulnerable individuals with low status. Not only income inequality, but other country characteristics such as familial orientation play a considerable role in explaining <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the health <b>gradient...</b>|$|R

In the event studied (1973 August 9), the electron density was relatively high (5 x 10 to the eleventh to 1 x 10 to the twelfth) and radiation was evidently an important energy-loss and cooling mechanism. The light curves of ultraviolet lines formed at temperatures between 10 to the fifth to 10 to the seventh K indicate a time-varying emission measure gradient, and hence temperature gradient, during the flare. Radiative instability evidently played an important role in determining the <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> these <b>gradients</b> during the rise and fall phases, and caused strong downward motions of material during the cooling phase.

The patterns consist of hydrophobic fluorinated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on oxidized silicon substrates. The design comprises a central hydrophobic circle of unpatterned SAMs surrounded by annular regions of radially oriented stripes of alternating wettability, i. e., hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Variation in the relative width of the stripes allows control over the macroscopic wettability. When a droplet is deposited in the middle, it will start to move over to the radially defined wettability gradient, away from the center because of the increasing relative surface area of hydrophilic matter for larger radii in the pattern.

40|$|AbstractNaturally {{occurring}} gradients often extend over relatively {{long distances}} such that their steepness {{is too small}} for bacteria to detect. We studied the bacterial behavior in such thermal gradients. We find that bacteria migrate along shallow thermal gradients due {{to a change in}} their swimming speed resulting from the effect of temperature on the intracellular pH, which also depends on the chemical environment. When nutrients are scarce in the environment the bacteria's intracellular pH decreases with temperature. As a result, the swimming speed of the bacteria decreases with temperature, which causes them to slowly drift toward the warm end <b>of</b> the thermal <b>gradient.</b> However, when serine is added to the medium at concentrations > 300 μM, the intracellular pH increases causing the swimming speed to increase continuously with temperature, and the bacteria to drift toward the cold end <b>of</b> the temperature <b>gradient.</b> This directional migration is not a result of bacterial thermotaxis in the classical sense, because the <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gradients</b> applied is below the sensing threshold of bacteria. Nevertheless, our results show that the directional switch requires the presence of the bacterial sensing receptors.

40|$|Reversed-phase {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (RP-HPLC) is an important tool in the purification of radiolabeled peptides and proteins for immunoassay. However, for some proteins and peptides {{it is difficult to}} achieve reproducible behavior in RP-HPLC because of the low recovery of these compounds. Factors that can be varied to improve recovery include the strength or pH of the mobile phase, the chain length and spacing of groups on the reversed-phase support, and the flow rate or <b>steepness</b> <b>of</b> the elution <b>gradient</b> (1 - 5). [...] . In summary, we obtained better recovery and more reproducible chromatographic behavior for labeled 1 - 34 PTHrP with an albumin-pretreated reversed-phase column than with a new, untreated reversed-phase column. This treatment is simple and inexpensive and should be generally applicable for use in the purification of other radiolabeled peptides and proteins...|$|R
