5|$|Following the P90's introduction, FN {{revised the}} 5.7×28mm ammunition. The new variation, {{designated}} the SS190, used a projectile 2.7mm (0.11in) shorter in length {{than that of}} the SS90. This allowed it to be used more conveniently in the 5.7×28mm FN Five-seven pistol, which was under development at that time. The SS190 projectile had a greater weight, and a more conventional construction with an aluminium and <b>steel</b> <b>core.</b> The first prototypes of the SS190 were created in 1992, and the design was finalized in 1993, replacing the SS90. A modified version of the P90, with a magazine adapted to use the shortened ammunition, was then introduced in the same year. Several special cartridge variations were developed, such as the L191 tracer round and the SB193 subsonic round for use with a sound-suppressed P90.|$|E

40|$|Although filter {{inductor}} {{designers have}} routinely tended to specify molypermalloy powder cores {{for use in}} high frequency power converters and pulse-width modulated switching regulators, there are sigificant advantages in specifying C cores and cut toroids fabricated from grain oriented silicon steels which should not be overlooked. Such <b>steel</b> <b>cores</b> can develop flux densities of 1. 6 tesla, with useful linearity to 1. 2 tesla, whereas molypermalloy cores carrying d. c. current have useful flux density capabilities only to about 0. 3 tesla. The use of silicon <b>steel</b> <b>cores</b> thus {{makes it possible to}} design more compact cores, and therefore inductors of reduced volume, or conversely to provide greater load capacity in inductors of a given volume. Information is available which makes it possible to obtain quick and close approximations of significant parameters such as size, weight and temperature rise for silicon <b>steel</b> <b>cores</b> for breadboarding. Graphs, nomographs and tables are presented for this purpose, but more complete mathematical derivations of some of the important parameters are also included for a more rigorous treatment...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a design method for the {{compressive}} capacity of sandwich panels comprised of steel face sheets and foamed <b>steel</b> <b>cores</b> is derived and verified. Foamed steel, literally steel with internal voids, provides {{the potential to}} mitigate many local stability issues through increasing the effective width-to-thickness of the component {{for the same amount}} of material. Winter's classical effective width expression was generalized to the case of steel foam sandwich panels. The provided analytical expressions are verified with finite element simulations employing brick elements that explicitly model the steel face sheets and <b>steel</b> foam <b>cores.</b> The closed-form design expressions are employed to conduct parametric studies of steel foam sandwich panels with various face sheet and <b>steel</b> foamed <b>core</b> configurations.

25|$|The tube frame design, using <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> and {{perimeter}} columns protected with sprayed-on {{fire resistant}} material, created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more {{in response to}} the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{presented}} some considerations about {{the performance of}} single wire earth return amorphous alloy core transformers in comparison with conventional silicon <b>steel</b> sheets <b>cores</b> transformers used in rural electric energy distribution network. It has been recognized that amorphous metal core transformers improve electrical power distribution efficiency by reducing transformer core losses. This reduction is due to some electromagnetic properties of the amorphous alloys such as: high magnetic permeability, high resistivity, and low coercivity. Experimental results obtained with some single-phase, 60 Hz, 5 kVA amorphous core transformers installed {{in a rural area}} electric distribution system in Northern Brazil have been confirming their superior performance in comparison to identical nominal rated transformers built with conventional silicon <b>steel</b> <b>cores,</b> particularly with regard to the excitation power and to the no-load losses...|$|R

2500|$|This {{particular}} plating process uses a <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> that is electro-magnetically plated with a {{thin layer}} of nickel, then a layer of copper and finally another layer of nickel. As a smaller quantity of copper and nickel is required, this process has reduced circulation coin production costs. The composition of plated coins is more durable, thereby reducing the number of damaged coins in circulation and increasing their overall efficiency. [...] By varying the thicknesses of the alternating layers of nickel and copper, the Mint can also create coins with unique electromagnetic signatures, preventing fraud and producing the most secure circulation coins on the market.|$|E
2500|$|When {{played as}} a folk instrument, the violin is usually {{referred}} to in English as a fiddle (although the term fiddle can be used informally {{no matter what the}} genre of music.) A fiddle is essentially the same as a classical violin. Many old-time pieces call for cross-tuning the instrument out of standard GDAE tuning. Some players of American styles of folk fiddling (such as bluegrass or old-time) have their bridge's top edge cut to a slightly flatter curve, making techniques such as a [...] "double shuffle" [...] less taxing on the bow arm. A flatter bridge top reduces the range of motion needed for alternating between double stops on different string pairs. Fiddle players who use solid <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> strings may prefer to use a tailpiece with fine tuners on all four strings, instead of the single fine tuner on the E string used by many classical players.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Failure {{analysis}} on a strain clamp cracking on 220 kV transmission line {{was carried out}} based on results of macro-observation, mechanical property examination and EDAX analysis. It is concluded that the main reason of the clamp failure lies in incomplete surface cleaning during wire crimping that cause large current flowing through <b>steel</b> <b>cores,</b> heating them and reduced their strength. In addition, oxidation due to residue water for insufficient baking also contributes to the failure. Finally suggestions were put forward...|$|R

2500|$|During production, {{the type}} was {{gradually}} improved, which caused further delays. [...] From the 245th vehicle onwards an automatic starter was installed, engaged by a handle, {{as the original}} manual system did not allow for a sufficiently quick response to a changing battlefield situation. [...] Also it was decided the design was too poorly protected. [...] In response to the first use of British Mark I tanks on 15 September 1916, the Germans had begun to introduce anti-tank weapons and tactics. One of the measures taken by them was the issuing of the Kerngeschoss or [...] "K-bullet", a hardened <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> round capable of piercing the thin armour of tanks. To defeat it, from the 210th vehicle onwards the Schneider tank was fitted with extra 5.4mm thick armour plates on the sides and front with a space of four centimetres between the main armour and these appliqué plates. Even without the spaced armour, the front plates would have been immune against K-bullet fire {{from a distance of}} two hundred metres, because they were angled at 60°, providing an effective line-of-sight thickness of [...] During the spring of 1917 existing vehicles were uparmoured (creating a surblindé version) by the army workshop at Champlieu. Some of these, such as a vehicle with series number 61213, were fitted with additional armour plates on the vertical front surfaces, including an extra rectangular shield around the gun barrel. On 1 April 1917 of the 208 tanks available only about a hundred had been retrofitted. None of the older tanks had at this point yet received the new starter engine, this part of the improvement process would take {{until the end of the}} summer.|$|E

50|$|A <b>steel</b> <b>core's</b> {{remanence}} {{means that}} it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until {{the effect of the}} remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform. Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass. On transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.|$|R
