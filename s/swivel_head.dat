40|$|Abstract. <b>Swivel</b> spindle <b>head</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} used in five-axis machine tool of high performance and is of great importance in application and design. Nowadays, more and more components are manufactured by high performance multi-axis CNC machine tools, such as components of spaceflight, renewable energy and automobile, etc. Therefore, high performance machine tools of multiple axes {{are more and more}} urgently demanded, while <b>Swivel</b> spindle <b>head</b> {{is one of the most}} important components for a multi-axis machine tool. Hence, <b>Swivel</b> spindle <b>head</b> is one of the key to developers multi-axis machine tool. The study explores the highly responsive direct-driving motor able to drive the spindle head to rotate with multi-driving rotary technology. The dual-driving motor rotates via multi-driving units, generates torsion that magnifies and eliminates its clearance, and then drives the spindle head to rotate. Results of the test show that the completed machine tool can meet the standards of dual axis rotary head with high preformation in, no matter, speed, distance, positional accuracy, repeated accuracy or maximum torque, etc...|$|R

50|$|Canon's {{external}} flashes with model {{numbers in}} the 400 range tend to be their mid-range external flashes. They all tend {{to have the ability}} to adjust the direction of the flash via a <b>swivel</b> <b>head,</b> which allows the photographer to bounce the flash off walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing the light that hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash. The 400 series differs from the higher end 500 series mostly by lacking a remote controller.|$|E

50|$|Barclay was {{the chief}} Jabba {{puppeteer}} who planned all the movements and guided all the other performers; Philpott controlled Jabba's left arm, with which he controlled many of Jabba's more active motions, including eating frogs, smoking the Hookah pipe and assaulting Bib Fortuna and C-3PO. Philpott also used his right hand to control Jabba's tongue and animate his head, and controlled the body by swiveling his seat with his leg braces. Cable controls allowed Philpott to <b>swivel</b> the <b>head</b> and snarl Jabba's Mouth.|$|R
50|$|Canon's {{external}} flashes with model {{numbers in}} the 500 and 600 ranges tend to be their high end external flashes. All three products so far have included a controller that enables wireless control of other flashes. Another common feature {{is the ability to}} adjust the direction of the flash via a <b>swivel</b> <b>head.</b> The swivel properties allow the photographer to bounce the flash off walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing the light that hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash.|$|E
5000|$|Brinelling can {{be caused}} by a heavy load resting on a {{stationary}} bearing for an extended length of time. The result is a permanent dent or [...] "brinell mark". The brinell marks will often appear in evenly spaced patterns along the bearing races, resembling the primary elements of the bearing, such as rows of indented lines for needle or roller bearings or rounded indentations in ball bearings. It is a common cause of roller bearing failures, and loss of preload in bolted joints when a hardened washer is not used. For example, brinelling occurs in casters when the ball bearings within the <b>swivel</b> <b>head</b> produce grooves in the hard cap, thus degrading performance by increasing the required swivel force.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical {{power for}} the tramway was {{supplied}} by a generating station located near the London Road depot, and {{it was decided to}} transport coal from the coal pier on the seafront to the generating station along the tramway. The Corporation owned a small loading pier on the sea front, near to the gas works, and this was rebuilt in 1914, incorporating a spur to enable trams to run onto it. Three 4-wheel coal trams, numbered 1A to 3A, were built by Grenshaw & Piers of Bolton, with cabs at both ends, and two large [...] "V"-skips between them. They were painted grey, and worked from 1915 until the early 1930s, when the steam engines were replaced by diesel generators. The original generating sets produced 200 kilowatts each, and were driven by vertical compound Corliss steam engines. The cylinders were 31 in in diameter with a 14 in stroke, and drove the generators at 110 rpm. All of the tramcars used <b>swivel</b> <b>head</b> trolleys, to pick up the power from the overhead wires. These had the advantage that the wires {{did not need to be}} above the centre line of the track, and presented a less cluttered appearance in the streets, particularly when there was double track.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Dick scrounges up a job as a physics professor at nearby Pendelton State University and the aliens rent a loft apartment from Mrs. Mamie Dubcek, who remains their landlady {{for the rest of the}} series. At work, Dick becomes smitten with Dr. Mary Albright, an anthropology professor with whom he shares an office.|$|R
50|$|The first {{thoracic}} {{segment is}} the prothorax, bearing the front pair of legs. The joint between head and prothorax is slender and flexible, which enables the damselfly to <b>swivel</b> its <b>head</b> and to manoeuvre more freely when flying. The remaining thoracic segments are the fused mesothorax and metathorax (together termed the synthorax), {{each with a}} pair of wings and a pair of legs. A dark stripe known as the humeral stripe runs {{from the base of the}} front wings to the second pair of legs, and just in front of this is the pale-coloured, antehumeral stripe.|$|R
40|$|Internal {{ribosome}} entry sites (IRESs) mediate cap-independent {{translation of}} viral mRNAs. Using electron cryo-microscopy {{of a single}} specimen, we present five ribosome structures formed with the Taura syndrome virus IRES and translocase eEF 2 *GTP bound with sordarin. The structures suggest a trajectory of IRES translocation, required for translation initiation, and provide an unprecedented view of eEF 2 dynamics. The IRES rearranges from extended to bent to extended conformations. This inchworm-like movement is coupled with ribosomal inter-subunit rotation and 40 S <b>head</b> <b>swivel.</b> eEF 2, attached to the 60 S subunit, slides along the rotating 40 S subunit to enter the A site. Its diphthamide-bearing tip at domain IV separates the tRNA-mRNA-like pseudoknot I (PKI) of the IRES from the decoding center. This unlocks 40 S domains, facilitating <b>head</b> <b>swivel</b> and biasing IRES translocation via hitherto-elusive intermediates with PKI captured between the A and P sites. The structures suggest missing links {{in our understanding of}} tRNA translocation...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} Deployment and Retraction hinge Mechanism (DARM) in {{the frame}} of a technological program is examined. The mechanism includes two restraint/release devices, which enable it to be stable in its stowed or deployed position while sustaining all associated loads, and to carry its payload by remote command. The main characteristics of the DARM are as follows: deployment and retraction movements are spring actuated; the available amount of functional sequences is almost unlimited; and no use of electrical motors is made. These features were accomplished by: the application of a special kinematic scheme to the mechanical connection between the spring motor and the <b>swivel</b> <b>head</b> arm; and the use of shape memory alloys (SMA) actuators for both release and spring recharge functions. DARM is thus a mechanism which can find many applications in the general space scenario of in-orbit maintenance and servicing. In such a frame, the DARM typical concept, which has a design close to very simple one-shot deployment mechanisms, has a good chance to replace existing analog machines. Potential items that could be moved by DARM are: booms for satellite instruments; antenna reflector tips; entire antenna reflectors; and solar panels...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -In {{view of the}} {{possibility}} of trimming some swept-wing aircraft at incidences above the stall, there has been a desire to visualise the whole pattern of vortex sheets and separated flow starting from the stalling wing, and to follow it back beyond the tailplane. To supplement other methods, a <b>swivelling</b> <b>head</b> has been used, giving the velocity, pitch and yaw, and results are given in this report for a 48 -deg delta (Javelin) and a 40 -deg swept-wing aircraft (Swift without fences). The tests showed that at incidences beyond the stall there is a large bubble of separated flow behind the wing. For the delta at 35 deg this bubble had not closed at the station of the tailplane and extended over the whole of the region behind the wing. The velocity and pressure field found in the separated flow resembles that behind a square plate at 90 deg. The vorticity pattern, measured in a plane cutting the bubble of separated flow from the stalled wings, is complicated by rotating masses of air inside the bubbles, between the strong inner vortex sheets, and the weaker tip vortices. The results have been analysed to show the effect of change of tail height. 1. Introduction. -In view of {{the possibility}} of trimming some swept-wing aircraft at incidences above the stall, there has been a desire to visualise the whole pattern of vortex sheets and separated flow starting from the stalling wing, and to follow it back beyond the tailplane...|$|R

5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he <b>swivelled</b> his <b>head</b> about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|R
50|$|Eyesight is a {{particular}} characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture. Owls {{are part of a}} small group of birds that live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in low-light situations. Owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skulls. An apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. This shape is found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes. Since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes, they are unable to move the eyes in any direction. Instead of moving their eyes, owls <b>swivel</b> their <b>heads</b> to view their surroundings. Owls' heads are capable of swiveling through an angle of roughly 270°, easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso. This ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum, thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey. Owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups, which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision. However, owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimeters of their eyes. While owls are commonly believed to have great nocturnal vision due to their large (thus very light-gathering) eyes and pupils and/or extremely sensitive rod receptors, the true cause for their ability to see in the night is due to neural mechanisms which mediate the extraction of spatial information gathered from the retinal image throughout the nocturnal luminance range. These mechanisms are only able to function due to the large-sized retinal image. Thus, the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance; retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions. These attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey..|$|R
40|$|Anxiety {{and fear}} are often confounded {{in discussions of}} human emotions. However, studies of rodent {{defensive}} reactions under naturalistic conditions suggest anxiety is functionally distinct from fear. Unambiguous threats, such as predators, elicit flight from rodents (if an escape-route is available), whereas ambiguous threats (e. g., the odor of a predator) elicit risk assessment behavior, which is associated with anxiety as it is preferentially modulated by anti-anxiety drugs. However, without human evidence, it would be premature to assume that rodent-based psychological models are valid for humans. We tested the human validity of the risk assessment explanation for anxiety by presenting 8 volunteers with emotive scenarios and asking them to pose facial expressions. Photographs and videos of these expressions were shown to 40 participants who matched them to the scenarios and labeled each expression. Scenarios describing ambiguous threats were preferentially matched to the facial expression posed {{in response to the}} same scenario type. This expression consisted of two plausible environmental-scanning behaviors (eye darts and <b>head</b> <b>swivels)</b> and was labeled as anxiety, not fear. The facial expression elicited by unambiguous threat scenarios was labeled as fear. The emotion labels generated were then presented to another 18 participants who matched them back to photographs of the facial expressions. This back-matching of labels to faces also linked anxiety to the environmental-scanning face rather than fear face. Results therefore suggest that anxiety produces a distinct facial expression and that it has adaptive value in situations that are ambiguously threatening, supporting a functional, risk-assessing explanation for human anxiet...|$|R
