In a 2010 interview, Yoshio Sakamoto was asked about a Kid Icarus game for the Wii, to which he replied that he was not aware of any plans to revive the franchise. A new <b>series</b> <b>entry</b> for the Nintendo 3DS, , was eventually revealed at the E3 2010 trade show and was released in 2012.

A preview disc was released with Sakura Wars Online, featuring promotional images and trailers released up to that point. Running up to the game's release, Sakura Wars 3 and the Dreamcast ports of the first two Sakura Wars games were reissued at reduced prices by Sega. The game was released on March 21, 2002. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). It was released for Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows XP on March 3, 2005. This version required multiple CD-ROMs due to the game's size. A DVD-ROM version for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista on January 25, 2007. Wider localization efforts for the series were prevented due to Sega's uncertainly as to whether the game's blend of genres would find a profitable audience outside Japan.|$|E

500|$|After the 1996 Killer Instinct Gold did {{not sell}} {{as well as}} the Super NES version of the original, the series went dormant. IGN {{reported}} in 2010 that Killer Instinct Gold had upset series fans by changing the combo move sets and omitting [...] "fan favorite" [...] characters from the original. The website added that Rare knew that between all its franchises, Killer Instinct had the most fan interest in a new <b>series</b> <b>entry.</b> Microsoft purchased Rare in 2002, ending the acquisition's prominent alliance with Nintendo. Microsoft and Rare revived the series for the Xbox One platform in 2013. In 2014, GamesRadar retrospectively ranked Gold the 35th best game on the Nintendo 64 console.|$|E

500|$|The Fire Emblem {{series has}} been {{described}} by its developers as an [...] "RPG simulation", combining tactical simulation gameplay with the plot and character development of a role-playing game, creating a sense of connection with characters in the field not present in previous tactical games. Battles in the Fire Emblem series play out on a grid-based map, with the player controlling a set number of characters across maps tied to both the game's story and optional side stories. Each character has a specific character class, giving them set abilities and affecting how far they can move across the field. Some character classes have innate skills unique to them, and each character has its own class and stats. Depending on the <b>series</b> <b>entry,</b> a character's class can be changed or upgraded with or without special items. During battle, each character gains experience points by performing actions, such as attacking an enemy, healing an ally, and slaying a foe (which typically offers the most experience points). When a certain level is reached, the character levels up, and new skill points are awarded randomly to a character's attributes, be they the character's maximum health, agility or strength. The more a character is used in battle, the more experience that character gains.|$|E

The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews. Reviewers greatly praised its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.|$|E
2500|$|Chester's {{character}} had no surname until Baer ad libbed [...] "Proudfoot" [...] {{during an}} early rehearsal. Initial Gunsmoke scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by [...] "Townsman". Again, Conrad's {{sense of what}} the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as [...] "W" [...] in the June 15, 1958 episode [...] "Old Flame", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958 episode [...] "Marshal Proudfoot", it is revealed that his middle name, as are his 10 siblings, is Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's [...] "assistant", but in the December 13, 1952, episode [...] "Post Martin", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode [...] "Hank Prine" [...] (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his [...] "deputy" [...] stating [...] "Chester is not my deputy", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies ("Never Pester Chester"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust. The TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver who went on to star in the NBC Mystery Movie rotating TV <b>series</b> <b>entry</b> of a police drama with a comedic touch - McCloud in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7", this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season 2, episode 25 tells us that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War. Not long ago but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{reactions}} to the gameplay changes from previous <b>series</b> <b>entries.</b> Regarding the new item system, a critic from Game Revolution noted that it prevents the need to return to item boxes to empty inventory. However, he also noted a drawback, in that it introduces more backtracking to pick up an item that was dropped. Contrary to this, Mark MacDonald of 1UP.com praised it for eliminating the backtracking that slowed down previous <b>series</b> <b>entries.</b> Varanini from GameSpot gave credit to Capcom for attempting a new item system, but it is ultimately not too useful since it is easiest to drop all the items in a save location anyway. Casamassina of IGN called the system [...] "perfect" [...] and {{much better than the}} item boxes in previous titles. Regarding the partner system, Varanini said that it works well, although he found the puzzles too simple and the companion's AI was lacking at times. Bedigian of GameZone praised the companion system for adding a new dimension to the Resident Evil series and it left him excited for future titles. Steinberg of GameSpy liked the puzzles which required both characters working together, but he was not keen to fighting alongside them, feeling like he was [...] "babysitting" [...] the other character due to weak AI.|$|R
