500|$|The season {{started on}} January 4 with the {{formation}} of Tropical Depression 01W to the west of Yap, with the first tropical storm developing a few months later on April 1, and ended {{near the end of the}} year when Tropical Storm Bobbie dissipated in the open Pacific on December 25. During the season, 25 systems either threatened land or made landfall, killing over 2,400people. The strongest storm of the season was Super Typhoon Doug, which affected Taiwan, South Korea and mainland China, while the deadliest storm was Super Typhoon Fred, which killed over 1,000people in China. Earlier in the season, the combined effects of two tropical storms—Russ and Sharon—caused flooding in China that killed over 1,400. The season also saw two storms, Li and John, cross into the Western North Pacific from the east, while one storm, Tropical Storm Yuri, formed from a precursor low that had similarly crossed the International Date Line. [...] This season, PAGASA named 25 systems and had to use an auxiliary list to name some of them after running out of names from their <b>standard</b> <b>list.</b> Of the 25, three systems were not tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
500|$|Blige's {{seasoned}} soul {{coupled with}} Bey's creamy delivery is a mood to behold." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that Beyoncé [...] "act as a Greek chorus" [...] to the song. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle noted that [...] "Love a Woman" [...] is a soulful, old-school ballad [...] "that {{brings out the}} best in both singers". Writing that Blige is [...] "particularly heavy" [...] on the R vibes of the song, Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine further commented that [...] "without a doubt, it's sure to gain some stream whenever radio DJs catch wind of it. Why? Because 'Love a Woman' features silky production, strong harmonies, and guest vocals from Beyoncé. Yeah, there's no stopping this one." [...] Katie Hasty of HitFix commented that [...] "It's actually a pretty <b>standard</b> <b>list</b> of grievances and explanations, but the real guts of the thing is when the two light up, to bring out the best vocal performances in each other, shooting you straight back to the 1990s." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now gave a mixed review for the song saying that it aims [...] "for posterity rather than chemistry". Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly described the duet as [...] "snoozy".|$|E

2500|$|There {{had been}} {{simplification}} initiatives aimed at eradicating characters entirely and establishing the Hanyu Pinyin romanization {{as the official}} written system of the PRC, but the reform never gained quite as much popularity as the leftists had hoped. After the retraction of {{the second round of}} simplification, the PRC stated that it wished to keep Chinese orthography stable. Years later in 2009, the Chinese government released a major revision list which included 8,300 characters. No new simplifications were introduced. However, six characters previously listed as [...] "traditional" [...] characters that have been simplified, as well as 51 other [...] "variant" [...] characters, were restored to the <b>standard</b> <b>list.</b> In addition, orthographies (e.g., stroke shape) for 44 characters were proposed to be modified slightly to fit traditional calligraphic rules. [...] Also, the practice of unrestricted simplification of rare and archaic characters by analogy using simplified radicals or components is now discouraged. A State Language Commission official cited [...] "oversimplification" [...] as the reason for restoring some characters. The language authority declared an open comment period until August 31, 2009 for feedback from the public. [...] The proposed orthographic changes to 44 characters were not implemented due to overwhelmingly negative public opinion.|$|E
