5|$|Sociological {{investigation}} {{indicates that}} certain <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> {{are more likely}} to engage in New Age practices than others. The majority of participants are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society. Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.|$|E
5|$|From the Early Preclassic, Maya {{society was}} sharply {{divided between the}} elite and commoners. As {{population}} increased over time, various <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> became increasingly specialized, and political organization became increasingly complex. By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied. A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking priests and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves. According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or clans. Such clans held that the land was {{the property of the}} clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows {{only one}} reelection. Many of her {{supporters}} proposed {{an amendment to}} the Constitution to allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either. The proposal was not taken to the Congress, as the FPV still lacked the required two-thirds majority to approve an amendment bill. It was rejected by many <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> The first big demonstration (a cacerolazo) took place in September 2012. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using social networks. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both the government and the opposition. People also protested the 2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster, the conflict between Kirchnerism and the media, rising crime rates, and the tight currency controls. Kirchner dismissed the demonstration, and said that she would continue working as before. Most of the Kirchner loyalists, however, preferred simply to ignore the protest.|$|E

50|$|The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) was {{struggling}} hard in collecting the funds. The richest <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> {{was not prepared}} to pay even a single ruppee to the young organisation. Although they were paying to the Congress and Swaraj Party with open hands. Then Thakur Roshan Singh suggested Ram Prasad Bismil to steal money from the richer <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> through armed terror. Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil gave it a new term as an Action. It was a code word of the party.|$|R

5|$|Other <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> were {{negatively}} affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed, and by 2008 only 20% of {{children were in}} schooling. The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009. The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%. In 2007, the World Health Organisation declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997. The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, {{and there was a}} rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem; he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.|$|E
25|$|Secret {{cells of}} the Revolutionary Committee were {{established}} in Puerto Rico by Mathias Brugman, Mariana Bracetti and Manuel Rojas bringing together members from all <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> including landowners, merchants, professionals, peasants, and slaves.

25|$|The {{social unrest}} that {{resulted}} from this economic decline increased during the last weeks before the 1952 National Revolution, when a hunger march through La Paz attracted most <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> The military was severely demoralized, and the high command called unsuccessfully for unity in the armed forces; many officers assigned themselves abroad, charged each other with coup attempts, or deserted.|$|E
25|$|In {{an op-ed}} in Haaretz, Jamie Levin {{suggests}} {{that the success of}} the Iron Dome system will likely increase demands to field additional systems across Israel. Budget shortfalls mean that Israel will be forced to weigh spending on missile defenses against other expenditures. Such funds, he argues, will likely come from programs intended to help the most vulnerable <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> such as social welfare.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous communities, peoples, {{and nations}} are those that, having a {{historical}} continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from {{other sectors of}} the societies now prevailing in those territories, or parts of them.

25|$|The first post-independence census {{conducted}} in Buenos Aires {{took place in}} 1855; it showed that there were 26,149 European inhabitants in the city. Among the nationals there is no distinction of race, but it does distinguish literates from illiterates; at that time formal education was a privilege almost exclusive for the upper <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> who were predominantly of European descent. Including European residents and the 21,253 Argentine literates, around 47,402 people of mainly European descent resided in Buenos Aires in 1855; they would have comprised about 51.6% of a total population of 91,895 inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Melgarejo {{started a}} {{formidable}} assault on Indian communal land, ostensibly {{in order to}} improve agricultural production. He decreed that Indians cold become owners of their parcels if they paid a large fee within sixty days. If they failed to do so, their land would be auctioned off. The resulting land sales increased the size of the haciendas, and massive Indian uprisings against his rule became more violent. Opposition against Melgarejo mounted in all <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> as the term melgarejismo came to signify amoral militarism; in 1871 he was overthrown and later murdered in Lima.|$|E

25|$|A voter {{may also}} elect a party-list organization. The voter {{votes for the}} party, not for the candidate, and the voter is {{restricted}} to one vote. All votes are tallied in an at-large basis, and parties with at least 2% of the vote wins at least one seat in the House. A further two more seats will be granted if there are still spare seats (the party-list representatives comprise 20% of the House), {{and if there are}} still unfilled seats, the parties with less than 2% of the vote will get one seat each in descending order until all seats are filled. A party-list organization is limited to representing marginalized <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> such as youth, laborers, women, and the like.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} {{powerful}} factor which works against {{the chance of}} any kind of peaceful reconstruction and which is equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which the regime has placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation {{from the rest of the}} world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their place in it. Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable.|$|E
25|$|This {{attempted}} secession lasted {{five years}} amid great {{political and military}} instability due to opposition from many <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society,</b> {{as well as the}} party of Sancho's widow Maria de Molina, supported by the Castilian nobility, and the high Galician clergy. Faced with this resistance, King Dom Denis of Portugal proposed to Queen Maria de Molina that John should held for him and for his heirs the Kingdom of Galicia, where he counted with the strong support of Fernando Ruiz de Castro and other noblemen, thus granting him the title of King. In 1301, after losing the support of the King of Portugal, John was forced to abandon his claim to sovereignty in exchange for a number of minor titles, thus confirming the unity of the Crown of Castile.|$|E

25|$|Following the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution, Lechín {{was chosen}} as Minister of Mines and Petroleum. He also led the {{founding}} congress of the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB), an umbrella federation of labor unions, and was elected its Executive Secretary. Since he had played {{a vital role in}} the Revolution, and had advocated the permanent extension of weapons to the workers' militias to guarantee regime stability against the possibility of an oligarchic/military backlash, he became extremely popular with the poorer <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> Indeed, he was the most charismatic and popular MNR leader other than Paz Estenssoro. In addition, he was of far more radical political persuasion (Marxist-inspired) {{than the rest of the}} government leadership. This inevitably led to growing intra-party tensions and disagreements over labor issues and personal ambitions.|$|E
25|$|Under the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education, {{primary schools}} {{were to be}} tuition-free and {{reasonably}} located {{for the convenience of}} children attending them; students would attend primary schools in their neighborhoods or villages. Parents paid a small fee per term for books and other expenses such as transportation, food, and heating. Previously, fees were not considered a deterrent to attendance. Under the education reform, students from poor families received stipends, and state enterprises, institutions, and other <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society</b> were encouraged to establish their own schools. A major concern was that scarce resources be conserved without causing enrollment to fall and without weakening of the better schools. In particular, local governments were told not to pursue middle-school education blindly while primary school education was still developing, or to wrest money, teaching staff, and materials from primary schools.|$|E
25|$|Perón {{created a}} {{political}} movement known as Peronism. He nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt and achieved nearly full employment. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, Eva Perón, played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947, and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>society.</b> However, her declining health did not allow her {{to run for the}} vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Perón was reelected in 1951, even surpassing his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called Liberating Revolution coup, he resigned and went into exile in Spain.|$|E
