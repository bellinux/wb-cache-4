5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Front won a {{landslide}} victory, winning every <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 50 constituencies which had predominantly European voters. At the Rhodesian Front Congress of August 1965, party members strongly attacked {{the press for}} failing to support the government. A demand {{for it to be}} made compulsory for all political articles to be signed by the author met with Van der Byl's approval.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, the {{information}} in the granule cell population activity state is the same as {{the information in the}} mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as every <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost {{a third of the}} crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who had a piece of human skull lodged in his arm. The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had been far more severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{previous}} factors, {{one of the biggest}} difficulties with offshore wind farms is the ability to predict loads. Analysis must account for the dynamic coupling between translational (surge, sway, and heave) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw) platform motions and turbine motions, as well as the dynamic characterization of mooring lines for floating systems. Foundations and substructures make up a large fraction of offshore wind systems, and must take into account every <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these factors. Load transfer in the grout between tower and foundation may stress the grout, and elastomeric bearings are used in several British sea turbines.|$|E
25|$|The future General Paul Huard, {{who served}} under de Gaulle at this time, {{recorded}} {{how he would}} often stand {{on a piece of}} high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards’ distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and taking all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the “hunter’s eye” of the great battlefield commander, and that not a <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.|$|E

Justice O'Connor sarcastically stated that, under the way the FBI declared the confidentiality of documents, the FBI would expect that every <b>single</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its documents can be withheld or redacted and that it can use Exemption 7(D) for all of its documents.|$|E
