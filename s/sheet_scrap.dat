40|$|Various {{solid state}} or ‘meltless’ {{recycling}} techniques {{have recently been}} developed for light metal scrap in form of chips. Main objective of all approaches is to bypass the need for remelting {{in order to reduce}} the overall required energy, and to avoid the material losses that occur during this step. Within this paper, the use of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is proposed as a novel solid state recycling/welding technique for sheet metal scrap. Aluminium 5182 alloy scrap, derived from sheet metal, was successfully consolidated into a fully dense billet via SPS. The use of pulsed electric current heating, in temperatures well below the alloy melting point, combined with mechanical pressure, enchased the densification process resulting into a void-less material. The recycled SPS sample was fully densified and microstructural investigation has been performed in order to confirm effective oxide film breakage. The results illustrate the effectiveness of SPS in aluminium scrap consolidation, also in form of <b>sheet</b> <b>scrap,</b> providing additional means in solid state recycling. The involved mechanisms that contribute to oxide film fracture and scrap consolidation in SPS are being discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Recycling mixed {{aluminum}} scrap {{usually requires}} adding primary aluminum to the scrap stream as a diluent {{to reduce the}} concentration of non-aluminum constituents used in aluminum alloys. Since primary aluminum production requires approximately 10 times more energy than melting scrap, {{the bulk of the}} energy and carbon dioxide emissions for recycling are associated with using primary aluminum as a diluent. Eliminating the need for using primary aluminum as a diluent would dramatically reduce energy requirements, decrease carbon dioxide emissions, and increase scrap utilization in recycling. Electrorefining can be used to extract pure aluminum from mixed scrap. Some example applications include producing primary grade aluminum from specific scrap streams such as consumer packaging and mixed alloy saw chips, and recycling multi-alloy products such as brazing sheet. Electrorefining {{can also be used to}} extract valuable alloying elements such as Li from Al-Li mixed scrap. This project was aimed at developing an electrorefining process for purifying aluminum to reduce energy consumption and emissions by 75 % compared to conventional technology. An electrolytic molten aluminum purification process, utilizing a horizontal membrane cell anode, was designed, constructed, operated and validated. The electrorefining technology could also be used to produce ultra-high purity aluminum for advanced materials applications. The technical objectives for this project were to: - Validate the membrane cell concept with a lab-scale electrorefining cell; - Determine if previously identified voltage increase issue for chloride electrolytes holds for a fluoride-based electrolyte system; - Assess the probability that voltage change issues can be solved; and - Conduct a market and economic analysis to assess commercial feasibility. The process was tested using three different binary alloy compositions (Al- 2. 0 wt. % Cu, Al- 4. 7 wt. % Si, Al- 0. 6 wt. % Fe) and a brazing <b>sheet</b> <b>scrap</b> composition (Al- 2. 8 wt. % Si- 0. 7 wt. % Fe- 0. 8 wt. % Mn),. Purification factors (defined as the initial impurity concentration divided by the final impurity concentration) of greater than 20 were achieved for silicon, iron, copper, and manganese. Cell performance was measured using its current and voltage characteristics and composition analysis of the anode, cathode, and electrolytes. The various cells were autopsied as part of the study. Three electrolyte systems tested were: LiCl- 10 wt. % AlCl 3, LiCl- 10 wt. % AlCl 3 - 5 wt. % AlF 3 and LiF- 10 wt. % AlF 3. An extended four-day run with the LiCl- 10 wt. % AlCl 3 - 5 wt. % AlF 3 electrolyte system was stable for the entire duration of the experiment, running at energy requirements about one third of the Hoopes and the conventional Hall-Heroult process. Three different anode membranes were investigated with respect to their purification performance and survivability: a woven graphite cloth with 0. 05 cm nominal thickness & > 90 % porosity, a drilled rigid membrane with nominal porosity of 33 %, and another drilled rigid graphite membrane with increased thickness. The latter rigid drilled graphite was selected as the most promising membrane design. The economic viability of the membrane cell to purify scrap is sensitive to primary & scrap aluminum prices, and the cost of electricity. In particular, it is sensitive to the differential between scrap and primary aluminum price which is highly variable and dependent on the scrap source. In order to be economically viable, any scrap post-processing technology in the U. S. market must have a total operating cost well below the scrap price differential of $ 0. 20 -$ 0. 40 per lb to the London Metal Exchange (LME), a margin of 65 %- 85 % of the LME price. The cost to operate the membrane cell is estimated to be < $ 0. 24 /lb of purified aluminum. The energy cost is estimated to be $ 0. 05 /lb of purified aluminum with the remaining costs being repair and maintenance, electrolyte, labor, taxes and depreciation. The bench-scale work on membrane purification cell process has demonstrated technological advantages and substantial energy and investment savings against other electrolytic processes. However, in order to realize commercial reality, the following items need to be fully investigated: 1. Further evaluation of a pure fluoride electrolyte. 2. Investigate alternative non conductive, more mechanically robust and chemically inert membrane candidates. 3. Optimized membrane cell design to understand contribution of fluid flow patterns and the mass transfer conditions. 4. Improve current efficiency and total metallic aluminum recovery from the cell.

40|$|Little {{work has}} been done on {{quantifying}} the environmental impacts and costs of sheet metal stamping. In this work we present models {{that can be used to}} predict the energy requirements, global warming potential, human health impacts, and costs of making drawn parts using zinc (kirksite) die-sets and hydraulic or mechanical presses. The methodology presented can also be used to produce models of stamping using other die materials, such as iron, for which casting data already exists. An unprecedented study on the environmental impacts and costs of zinc die-set production was conducted at a leading Michigan die-maker. This analysis was used in conjunction with electrical energy measurements on forming presses to complete cradle-to-gate impact and cost analyses on producing small batch size hood and tailgate parts. These case studies were used to inform a generalized model that allows engineers to predict the impacts and costs of forming based on as little information as the final part material, surface area, thickness and batch size (number of units produced). The case studies show that press electricity is an insignificant contributor to the overall impacts and costs. The generalized models highlight that while costs for small batch production are dominated by the die-set, the environmental impacts are often dominated by the sheet metal. These findings explain the motivation behind research into die-less forming processes such as incremental sheet forming, and emphasize the need to minimize <b>sheet</b> metal <b>scrap</b> generation in order to reduce environmental impacts.

For his early schooling, his parents sent him to cheder (Hebrew: חדר, meaning “room”), a {{traditional}} elementary school that taught the basics of Judaism and the Hebrew language. During his religious studies, Malnovitzer began to paint, using old bed <b>sheets</b> and <b>scraps</b> of wood to create his first “oil on canvas” work. Young Zvi’s talents were soon recognized by his neighbor in Bnei Brak and accomplished Israeli artist, Yehuda Wallersteiner, who agreed to be his teacher at age 13. Wallensteiner taught the young artist the fundamentals of painting {{in the heart of}} the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, a society that observes Jewish law so strictly that art is rare. “I would return to Wallensteiner until I felt that I made paintings that were up to his caliber,” Malnvoitzer said. Other artists began to notice the boy's talent. For instance, the sculptor Ellul Kussov gave him a recommendation, expressing enthusiasm for his gift for painting. The tragic history of his family and of the Jewish people cast a shadow over his entire life and career. Since his childhood, it was his noble mission to struggle with memories of the Holocaust and of exile through painting. At age 12, Malnotivzer sketched a black ink drawing of figures emerging from a cave, with Nazi soldiers perched on a balcony above. He wrote the word “Galut,” meaning “exile,” at the edge of the drawing. He was thinking of his family who perished in the Holocaust and the injustice that his grandfather endured by the Nazis, including an attempt to set fire to his beard. For young Zvi, born the year that World War II ended, exile became both a traumatic memory and an artistic inspiration.|$|R

This is named ‘Tailor Blank Casting’. The equipment is described and the first experimental trials are presented, with one edge of the melt constrained by a moving electro-magnetic dam in order to achieve a controlled variation in sheet width. The trials demonstrated successful containment of the liquid prior to solidification, and a sheet with close to step changes in width was cast. From analysis of the results of these trials, the mechanisms of width change are proposed and the effect of the moving dam on product properties is studied.

Skemer usefully distinguishes them from talismans, which he defines as being more expensive, elite items, typically engraved jewelry, gems, or metal disks that often bore decidedly learned astrological symbols and images, rather than holy names or snippets of sacred texts.

40|$|Starting from {{existing}} challenges and limitations in light metal recycling (in particular aluminium and magnesium alloys), this PhD thesis aims {{to address these}} and explore new opportunities by sustainable metal management and solid-state recycling (SSR) methods. This PhD also quantifies the potential environmental benefits of the explored strategies and SSR techniques by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). More specifically: During pyro-metallurgical recycling of aluminium alloys, the refining/melt purification options of aluminium alloys, restricted by thermodynamic barriers, are very limited compared to other base metals such as steels. As the removal from the melt of most elements is problematic, {{it is crucial to}} control their concentration in the scrap streams prior to remelting. Thus, scrap sorting is important to avoid additional (eventually impossible) refining, quality degradation (down-cycling), and dilution of the residual elements with primary aluminium addition. It is therefore described that establishing of well-optimised, harmonised recycling loops is of prime importance from an environmental perspective. Based on these arguments, Chapter 2 addresses this issue by developing a decision support model that aids in the direction of environmental conscious metal clustering. It aims: i) to express and quantify in a LCA framework, dilution and quality losses that occur during open loop recycling, and ii) to determine the optimal material input for the recycling process based on the input/output metal composition. By compositionally closing the recycling loops, it is feasible to minimise primary resource addition (primary aluminium and alloying elements) by maximising the scrap utilisation. A multi-objective optimisation approach (goal programming) is selected as the most appropriate method to prioritise the optimisation goals. After performing the environmental modelling of the secondary aluminium production as a reference route, Chapter 3 moves on to ‘meltless’ or ‘solid state recycling’ techniques for high grade aluminium production scrap. This approach is studied to achieve a significant material and energy savings by omitting/bypassing the conventional recycling step. Annually more than 40 % of liquid aluminium is scrapped during the initial production-fabrication-manufacturing steps. Especially for fine form scrap from material removal processes, their very high surface-to-mass ratio results in significant unrecoverable oxidation losses during remelting. In this context, this work investigates the applicability of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) as an alternative SSR technique for aluminium alloy chips (Chapter 3). This allows the direct fabrication of bulk, near-net shape and semi-finished products directly from machining chips. The improved consolidation achieved via SPS is associated with the combined action of plastic deformation and the electric field during SPS processing. Microstructural investigations as well as the mechanical behaviour of the SPS blanks confirm successful solid state chips welding. Furthermore, this work also investigates applications of SPS in scrap consolidation and binding. Chapter 4 examines the use of atomised aluminium powder as a binding material/matrix for the machining chips. Chapter 5 describes the consolidation via SPS of larger <b>scrap</b> types (<b>sheet</b> metal <b>scrap).</b> After developing a reliable SPS route for SSR of aluminium alloy scrap, Chapter 6 analyses the environmental performance of the SPS route along with major SSR routes for aluminium alloys (recycling via hot extrusion and via screw extrusion). For this reason a LCA study was conducted where the examined SSR routes are compared with their corresponding remelting routes as reference. Mg alloys confront similar challenges in recycling as aluminium alloys. Taking also into account the wide range of magnesium applications and their higher scrap value compared to aluminium scraps; Chapter 7 focuses on broadening the material palette of SSR via SPS into Mg alloys. In this respect, this work studies the consolidation of machining chips for two Mg systems (i. e., pure Mg and AZ 31 Mg alloy). This includes the microstructural evolution in different metal recycling steps (initial ingot, chips, SPSed samples) as well as the mechanical behaviour of the recycled samples versus their parent material. Finally, the conclusions, the contributions to {{the state of the art}} as well as proposed future research topics are discussed in Chapter 8. nrpages: 180 status: publishe...|$|R

The door giving admittance to them is the very last in the gallery; and the rooms, three in number, are, I should judge, over the Loggia de' Lanzi, looking on the Grand Ducal Piazza.

The sketches on the walls are changed, from time to time, so as to exhibit all the most interesting ones in turn. Their whole charm is artistic, imaginative, and intellectual, and in no degree of the upholstery kind; their outward presentment being, in general, a design hastily shadowed out, by means of colored crayons, on tinted paper, or perhaps scratched rudely in pen and ink; or drawn in pencil or charcoal, and half rubbed out; very rough things, indeed, in many instances, and the more interesting on that account, because it seems as if the artist had bestirred himself to catch the first glimpse of an image that did but reveal itself and vanish. The <b>sheets,</b> or sometimes <b>scraps</b> of paper, on which they are drawn, are discolored with age, creased, soiled; but yet you are magnetized by the hand of Raphael, Michael Angelo, Leonardo, or whoever may have jotted down those rough-looking master-touches. They certainly possess a charm that is lost in the finished picture; and I was more sensible of forecasting thought, skill, and prophetic design, in these sketches than in the most consummate works that have been elaborated from them. There is something more divine in these; for I suppose the first idea of a picture is real inspiration, and all the subsequent elaboration of the master serves but to cover up the celestial germ with something that belongs to himself. At any rate, the first sketch is the more suggestive, and sets the spectator's imagination at work; whereas the picture, if a good one, leaves him nothing to do; if bad, it confuses, stupefies, disenchants, and disheartens him. First thoughts have an aroma and fragrance in them, that they do not lose in three hundred years; for so old, and a good deal more, are some of these sketches.|$|R
