40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present the new {{legislation}} in force regarding <b>statutory</b> <b>charges</b> levied on silver and copper, and to conduct a brief evaluation of the new regulations. The article comprises two elements: the description of the existing fi scal burdens levied on copper and silver on the basis of the Law on Geological Exploration and Mining of 9 June 2011, and the description of the new, parallel <b>statutory</b> <b>charges</b> introduced by the Law on taxation of extraction of certain minerals of 2 March 2012. The author of the article assesses the introduction of the new tax as a step in the right direction for several reasons. Firstly, the state has fi nally started collecting substantial resource rent. Secondly, constructing the tax as an output-based royalty appears to be rational and transparent. Lastly, the construction of a new tax takes into consideration both economic upturns and downturns. As a result, the new tax together with the previous fi scal burdens form a coherent system that «taxes» every aspect of mining business activity regarding copper and silver (corporate income tax, the tax on the extraction of certain minerals and royalty for the mineral exploited) ...|$|R

50|$|To finance {{environmental}} retrofits, {{which is}} the key challenge in these initiatives, the City of Melbourne developed an innovative finance mechanism. It required {{an amendment to the}} City of Melbourne Act 2001 by the state Government of Victoria, enabling Melbourne to levy a new form of <b>statutory</b> <b>charge,</b> the Environmental Upgrade Finance. This new type of finance allows the City of Melbourne, in partnership with Australian financial institutions, to enter into voluntary environmental upgrade agreements with non-residential building owners to finance retrofitting of the buildings.|$|E
50|$|Historically, a {{mortgagor}} (the borrower) and a mortgagee (the lender) {{executed a}} conveyance of legal {{title to the}} property in favour of the mortgagee as security for the loan. If the loan was repaid, then the mortgagee would return the property; if the loan was not repaid, then the mortgagee would keep the property in satisfaction of the debt. The equity of redemption was the right to petition the courts of equity to compel the mortgagee to transfer the property back to the mortgagor once the secured obligation had been performed. Today, most mortgages are granted by <b>statutory</b> <b>charge</b> rather than by a formal conveyance, although theoretically there is usually nothing to stop two parties from executing a mortgage in the more traditional manner.|$|E

5000|$|The judge {{presiding}} over the case, Laurence Silberman, offered {{an explanation for the}} court's decision, stating that the FCC based its case on preventing workplace discrimination and promoting diversity of programming. However, the court found that the FCC does not have the authority to declare regulations using an anti-discrimination rationale. This is because the purpose of the FCC is to safeguard the public interest. The court had previously stated that agencies can impose anti-discrimination regulations only when they specifically relate to that agency's <b>statutory</b> <b>charge.</b> Therefore, it holds that the instances in which the FCC has the authority to pass anti-discriminatory measures would be one in which the discrimination in question related to [...] "communication services" [...] - which, in this case, means programming. Another explanation offered by Silberman is that the phrase [...] "diversity of programming" [...] is incredibly vague and any further attempts to identify what that means would put it in conflict with the First Amendment. Therefore, such a concept is not meaningful.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. On the one hand it aims at {{extending}} King-Fullerton methodology to a larger scope of liabilities and primarily, in the empirical section of the paper, to statutory charges associated to labour costs, basically employers' contributions to social security. Thus it proposes substituting MESC or Marginal Effective <b>Statutory</b> <b>Charge,</b> for King-Fullerton METR, and enlarging the p-statistics to requirements in terms of labour cost coverage, then reinterpreting it in terms of marginal value added. A further extension to environmental levies as well as a generalisation to any market failure inefficiency loss are also presented. On the other hand the paper intends to emphasize the key role of factor supply elasticities or relative mobility and market rigidities in determining the impact of the - or part of the - MESC statistics on the location decision of an MNE, a Multinational Enterprise. Indeed, in a setting where no rigidities are at work on the market for the immobile factor, like labour, levies on the compensation of that factor don't matter for MNE decision. Unlike that, in a setting where such rigidities are present, they do matter since they refrain the possibility to pass the burden of the tax on the holder of the rather immobile factor. The ultimate goal of the paper is, through the topics mentioned above, to cope with issues especially relevant for interjurisdictional behaviour of multinational entreprises without the framework of a nex Federation like the European Union...|$|E

The main objective is to provide empirical estimates of water demand and supply, and to note the differences between <b>statutory</b> <b>charges</b> and market price, under different weather conditions in the Border Rivers Region of Queensland. The paper demonstrates, using a linear programming approach, that the equilibrium price for water typically is greater than the price charged by the supplying authority. The equilibrium price is also shown to sometimes be less than the price at which water is supplied. Irrigation; Rivers; Water...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth in}} a number of {{tourists}} and, consequently, a larger income obtained from tourism by the state led to the situation when the previously marginalized tributes imposed on tourists by local governments have assumed greater significance. Additional revenues to local units’ budgets, gained from the above-mentioned tributes, are often allotted for better infrastructure and tourist promotion, thereby contributing to the increased tourist competitiveness. The present paper discusses the construction of levies imposed on tourists by local governments in various European states. Besides, the issues of how local governments can influence the construction of the tax within the frames of the granted tax autonomy are examined. Due to the fact that in many European countries burdens imposed on tourists by local units can be called taxes, fees or other levies, the term „tribute”, as a broader one including all <b>statutory</b> <b>charges,</b> is intentionally used in the present paper...|$|R
