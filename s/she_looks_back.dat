500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, in The Black and White Media Show Book, {{edited by}} John Twitchin of BBC TV's Continuing Education Department (published in 1988), EastEnders is praised for portraying black people on {{mainstream}} television, and for giving them [...] "respectable, fleshed-out parts which {{allow them to}} be the most difficult of things â€” 'normal people'." [...] Additionally, actress Judith Jacob has said that <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on her three years in EastEnders only with [...] "delight". She has also said that she disagrees with the criticism EastEnders gets for paying [...] "token lip service to blacks and minorities, who are usually depicted stereotypically." [...] In 2006, she commented to the Walford Gazette, [...] "EastEnders was the only show to [...] black actors. [...] Coronation Street just recently started bringing in black characters. There has always been a good flow of people in EastEnders." ...|$|E

Until she gave me her gage I had {{scarcely}} noticed her. I have, as you know, no experience of women, and had so much on my mind at the time, what with the fuss they were making about us, {{and the question of}} getting the prizes here, that in truth I paid but slight attention to the fair faces of the dames of Genoa. But the gracious and earnest way in which, though scarce more than a child, she gave me her gage, and vowed that no other knight should possess one so long as I lived, struck me so greatly that I own I gave the matter much more thought than was right or becoming in one of our Order. The incident was much more gratifying to me than all the honour paid me by the Republic, and during the long months of my captivity it has recurred to me so frequently that I have in vain endeavoured to chase it from my thoughts, as sinful thus to allow myself constantly to think of any woman. Do not mistake me, Sir Fabricius. I am speaking to you as to a confessor, and just as I have kept her amulet hidden from all, so is the thought of her a secret I would not part with for my life. I do not for a moment deceive myself with the thought that, beyond the fact that her gift has made her feel an interest in me and my fate, she has any sentiment in the matter: probably, indeed, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> upon the gift as a foolish act of girlish enthusiasm that led her into making a promise that she now cannot but find unpleasantly binding; for it is but natural that among the young nobles of her own rank and country there must be some whom she would see with pleasure wearing her colours." ...|$|E
