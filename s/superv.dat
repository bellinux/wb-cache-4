40|$|Çamlıbel, Kanat (Dogus Author) This paper {{studies the}} {{open-loop}} stabilization problem for bimodal systems with continuous vector field. It {{is based on}} the earlier work of the authors on the controllability problem for the same class of systems. A full characterization of stabilizability is established by presenting algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions. It turns out that this system class inherits the relationship between controllability and stabilizability of linear systems.

40|$|Using an {{ensemble}} of classifiers {{instead of a}} single classifier has been demonstrated to improve generalization performance in many difficult problems. However, for this improvement to take place {{it is necessary to}} make the classifiers in {{an ensemble}} more complementary. In this paper, we highlight the need to reduce the correlation among the component classifiers and investigate one method for correlation reduction: input decimation. We elaborate on input decimation, a method that uses the discriminating features of the inputs to decouple classifiers. By presenting different parts of the feature set to each individual classifier, input decimation generates a diverse pool of classifiers. Experimental results confirm that input decimation combining improves generalization performance. I. Introduction A classification learning task involves constructing a mapping from input instances (normally described by several features) to the (most likely) class to which the instances belong. <b>Superv</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In 2005, Belluno Health Authority’s Resuscitation Unit {{took part}} in a {{regional}} project coordinated by Veneto Regional Health and Social Services to test an incident re p o rting system. The main aims were to experiment an electronic incident rep o rting sheet and the relative computerised procedure for data e n t ry and analysis with the aim of developing an incident rep o rting system. The Australian Incident Monitoring System (AIMS) was designed to obtain information about the event, the context and concomitant causes. We observed 58 anonymous incident reports over a six-month period. The main incidents include issues relating to the management of medication, the a i rways, catheters and equipment. Most incidents had modest consequences or led to temporary disability and they often caused longer hospitalisation or further treatment and investigations. Communication problems, inadequate <b>superv</b> i s i o n, poor teamwork and difficulties in applying procedures and protocols were the contributory factors most frequently identified as the concomitant causes of the incidents. The report sheet and experience as a whole were evaluated favourably by the operators involved. This reporting system does not provide the real frequency of the adverse events, but it does provide useful information for improving patient safety...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} our new {{database}} on bank regulation and supervision in 107 countries to assess different governmental approaches to bank regulation and supervision and {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of specific regulatory and supervisory policies. First, we assess two broad and competing theories of government regulation: the helping-hand approach, according to which governments regulate to correct market failures, and the grabbing-hand approach, according to which governments regulate to support political constituencies. The grabbing-hand theory predicts that countries with powerful official supervisors, limits on bank activities, high levels of government ownership of banks, and restrictions on entry will tend to {{have higher levels of}} corruption without a corresponding improvement in bank performance or stability. This view therefore predicts that governments focusing more on empowering private-sector control of bank behavior are more likely to promote bank performance and stability than governments taking a more intrusive approach to regulation and supervision. Second, this paper uses the extensive cross-country database to assess the implications for banking-sector development and fragility of: regulations on bank activities and the mixing of banking and commerce; regulations on domestic and foreign bank entry; regulations on capital adequacy; deposit insurance system design features; supervisory power, independence, resources, loan classification stringency, provisioning standards, diversification guidelines, and prompt corrective action powers; regulations on information disclosure and fostering privatesector monitoring of banks; and government ownership of banks. The findings, generally more consistent with the grabbing-hand view, suggest that regulatory and <b>superv</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Supervision plays a {{key role}} in the {{provision}} of health and human services. An extensive literature exists on supervision as an element of profession al support and development in what are commonly referred to as the ‘helping professions’. This study provides an overview of supervision in Fam ily Resource Centres (FRCs) in the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme (FRC Programme) in the Western Region. Administered by Tusla, the newly established Child and Family Agency, FRCs provide a range of community - based family supports and services. They are defined by their community development approach which informs the values and methods underpinning their work. A strategic framework for family support was adopted by the FRC Programme in 2011. The importance of ensuring that workers who are responsible for implementing the family support strategy have structured supervision and guidance, so that they have the tools and competencies to engage successfully with families and the broader community is widely recognised. The level of <b>superv</b> ision that is available for FRC workers is examined in this study and current challenges are identified. Ways of ensuring more effective supervision are considered. The research calls for the development of a supervision strategy which promotes a common un derstanding of its purpose and value within FRCs. Research Participants also identified the need for clear guidelines and standards for supervision practice as well as appropriate training to support the delivery of more effective supervision in FRCs in th e Western Region...|$|E
