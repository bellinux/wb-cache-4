5|$|According to Alfonso Archi, Hidar was {{succeeded by}} Isqi-Mari whose royal seal was {{discovered}} and it depicts battle scenes, causing Archi to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was responsible for}} the destruction of Ebla while still a general. Just a decade after Ebla's destruction (c. 2300 BC middle chronology), Mari itself was destroyed and burned by Sargon of Akkad, Michael Astour give the date as c. 2265 BC (short chronology).|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of epigrammatic expression, <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.|$|E
5|$|From 1499 to 1508 {{a number}} of other expeditions were {{launched}} from Bristol to the 'New found land', the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot's son, Sebastian Cabot, explored down the coast of North America until he was ‘almost in the latitude of Gibraltar’ and ‘almost the longitude of Cuba’. This would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> reached as far as the Chesapeake, close to what is now Washington D.C.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Brunner (26 November 1706 - 19 November 1827), born in Trappstadt {{and died}} in Altenstein. It has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the oldest {{man in the world}} but new {{information}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have been born in 1739 ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "present subjunctive" [...] (morphologically {{identical}} with the bare infinitive) is regularly used in AmE in mandative clauses (as in They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{apply for the}} job). In BrE, this usage declined in the 20th century in favour of constructions such as They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should apply for the job (or even, more ambiguously, They <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> applied for the job). However, the mandative subjunctive has always been used in BrE, especially in formal writing.|$|R
50|$|Stakeknife {{had his own}} {{dedicated}} handlers {{and agents}} and it was <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was important enough that MI5 set up an office dedicated solely to him. Rumours <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being paid at least £80,000 a year and had a bank account in Gibraltar.|$|R
5|$|Hairan II: {{his image}} {{appear on a}} seal {{impression}} along with his older brother Vaballathus; his identity is much debated. Potter <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is the same as}} Herodianus who was crowned in 263 and that Hairan I mentioned in 251 died before the birth of Hairan II.|$|E
5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|In Israel, CS gas was {{reported}} to be the cause of death of Jawaher Abu Rahmah on 31 December 2010; other reports <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was killed by the impact of a high-velocity CS gas canister to the chest. In Egypt, CS gas {{was reported}} to be the cause of death of several protesters in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir square during the November 2011 protests.|$|E
60|$|He stood {{listening}} in amazement, {{but the sound}} was not repeated. Ordinary prudence {{and a sense of}} the fitness of things <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should go home; inclination <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should seat himself in the deck-chair {{at the foot of the}} crow’s-nest and await events.

5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club. His lack of form and infrequent game time, which totaled 358 minutes, prompted manager Unai Emery to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be leaving the club during the January transfer window in order to rediscover his form.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1759, Washington married wealthy widow Martha Dandridge Custis, then 28 years old. Surviving letters <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{may have}} been in love at the time with Sally Fairfax, the wife of a friend. Nevertheless, George and Martha made a {{compatible}} marriage, because Martha was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate.|$|E
5|$|Áed, Constantine's father, succeeded Constantine's {{uncle and}} namesake ConstantineI in 876 but {{was killed in}} 878. Áed's short reign is glossed as being of no {{importance}} by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, ConstantineII cannot have been born any later than the year after his father's death, that is 879. His name may <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born rather earlier, {{during the reign of}} his uncle ConstantineI.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Fothergill played occasionally for the MCC, and three further times for Somerset, but with little merit. He made his final appearance for Somerset in 1889, against Staffordshire; he took 157 wickets {{for the county}} in total, of which 57 came in first-class matches. His last match for the MCC was three years later, against Llandudno Cricket Club. In his obituary, Wisden <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> returned to Tyneside {{at the end of}} his professional cricket career. He died in Sunderland on 1 August 1932.|$|E
5|$|Dejan {{was one of}} the {{prominent}} figures of Dušan's reign and during the subsequent fall of the Serbian Empire, after Dušan's death. Under Emperor Dušan, despot Jovan Oliver, with his brother Bogdan and sevastokrator Dejan, ruled over all of eastern Macedonia. Dejan is not mentioned much in Dušan's military endeavors, although his reputation and that of his successors <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was involved in most of Dušan's successes. His prominence beyond Serbia is also evident from the fact that Pope Innocent VI addressed Dejan in 1355, asking him to support the creation of the union between the Catholic Church and the Serbian Orthodox Church (such letters were sent to the highest nobility and the church).|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach's hold on Dublin was {{short-lived}} as the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach records that Ímar replaced him as King of Dublin in 1038. This annal-entry {{has been interpreted}} to indicate that Ímar drove Echmarcach from the kingship. There is reason to suspect that Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065) extended his presence into the Isles and the Irish Sea region at about this period. The evidence of Þórfinnr's power in the Isles could <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship. In fact, Þórfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region {{may have contributed to}} Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} three men looked at him, as also the two women. His {{appearance}} no more <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a seaman than the appearance of Mr. Harberry <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was what the village of Riprock believed him to be. [...] "I should not have taken you for a sailor," [...] said the blacksmith.|$|R

5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was a suspect in the murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, {{provided}} by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records seem to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was sent by Darius to Ionia at around {{about the time of}} Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently {{head of the}} school's mathematics department). He had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary. On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. While there were no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more proactive recruitment of students.|$|E

50|$|Research using oxygen isotope {{analysis}} in the Archer's tooth enamel has <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have originated from an alpine region of central Europe. An eroded hole in his jaw showed <b>that</b> in life <b>he</b> had suffered from an abscess, and his missing left kneecap <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had an injury that {{left him with a}} painful lingering bone infection.|$|R

5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> most likely did {{it as part of}} a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further expanded his works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, Parker {{declared}} for the 2014 NBA {{draft in}} an exclusive autobiographical story in Sports Illustrated. According to Bleacher Report, he signed with sports agent Rich Paul, who is LeBron James's agent, but other sources, such as SLAM Magazine, <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> signed with BJ Armstrong, who is Derrick Rose's agent. Parker (along with other top prospects Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid) decided to decline the invitation {{to participate in the}} NBA Draft Combine. On June 26, Parker was selected no. 2 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. Just prior to the draft, Parker became the second member of the 2014 draft class to sign a shoe contract when he signed an endorsement deal with the Jordan Brand.|$|E

5000|$|A legal {{document}} dated 20 Feb 1860 describes Woods as [...] "William Woods late of Swan Lane, Hampton Wick, Mddx., now of Surbiton Park South, Kingston, gent". This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had moved}} {{into one of his}} new houses, and the inclusion of the word South <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> made a distinction between the park proper and the more southerly development.|$|R
