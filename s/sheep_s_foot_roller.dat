40|$|Key words: {{continuous}} casting; round bloom; minimum mould exit {{shell thickness}}; <b>foot</b> <b>roller</b> designing Abstract: The minimum mould exit shell thickness (MEST) {{is one of}} key factors to consider for continuous casting machine design. Based on the shell strength at elevated temperatures, a concept of shell integral average strength, from its very top surface to the solidus frontier, has been introduced to judge its bulging tendency under ferrostatic pressure. Considering the contribution for the <b>foot</b> <b>roller</b> designing, a mathematic model for {{the determination of the}} minimum MEST has been brought forward. It is shown that, when the minimal foot roll pitch is fixed, the minimum MEST is steady. But at the same time, when the MEST does not exceed the minimum value, the round bloom off-round would happen, it is worse for the round bloom than the bulging for the normal strand. And there is the cross point with the curve of the minimum MEST by the minimum roll pitch and the minimum MEST by the fluting include angle of the support roller and the lateral support roller against the cross section...|$|R

A [...] "toe loop" [...] on ice {{is often referred to as}} a Mapes in roller skating, taking its name from the inventor of the jump.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of Metsuke on judo {{throwing}} techniques. Metsuke is a term in Budo, which means how to pay attention to the opponent. Two kinds of Metsuke were employed in the experiments. One of the Metsuke was to pay attention to the whole of the opponent putting the center of the view to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s chest, and the other was to pay close attention to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> Speed and sense of the throwing techniques were analyzed between the two Metsuke.

Participants felt stronger and smoother throwing when they used Metsuke paying attention to the whole of the opponent than to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> The findings imply that Metsuke instruction influences skill improvement of throwing techniques...|$|R

A proportion of sheep, domestic goats, and cattle grazing in mulga paddocks, with either feral goats or camels, had detectable populations of S. caprinus. Pure cultures of S. caprinus grown in vitro were successfully placed in the rumen of sheep; however, nitrogen digestion was unaffected by rumen inoculation.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that a bipedal model consisting of a point mass supported by spring limbs can be tuned to simulate periodic human walking. In this study, we incorporated <b>roller</b> <b>feet</b> into the spring-mass model and evaluated the effect of roller radius, impact angle, and limb stiffness on spatiotemporal gait characteristics, ground reactions, and center-of-pressure excursions. We also evaluated {{the potential of the}} improved model to predict speed-dependent changes in ground reaction forces and centerof-pressure excursions observed during normal human walking. We were able to find limit cycles that exhibited gait-like motion across a wide spectrum of model parameters. Incorporation of the <b>roller</b> <b>foot</b> �R� 0. 3 m � reduced the magnitude of peak ground reaction forces and allowed for forward center-of-pressure progression, making the model more consistent with human walking. At a fixed walking speed, increasing the limb impact angle reduced the cadence and prolonged stance duration. Increases in either limb stiffness or impact angle tended to result in more oscillatory vertical ground reactions. Simultaneous modulation of the limb impact angle and limb stiffness was needed to induce speed-related changes in ground reactions that were consistent with those measured during normal human walking, with better quantitative agreement achieved at slower speeds. We conclude that a simple mass-spring model with <b>roller</b> <b>feet</b> can well describe ground reaction forces, and hence center of mass motion, observed during normal human walking. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3005147...|$|R
