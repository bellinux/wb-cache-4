40|$|The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) {{mission is}} an {{international}} partnership between NASA and JAXA whose Core spacecraft performs cutting-edge measurements of rainfall and snowfall worldwide and unifies data gathered by a network of precipitation measurement satellites. The Core spacecraft's propulsion system is a blowdown monopropellant system with an initial hydrazine load of 545 kg in a single composite overwrapped propellant tank. At launch, the propulsion system contained propellant in the tank and manifold tubes upstream of the latch valves, with low-pressure helium gas in the manifold tubes downstream of the latch valves. The system had a relatively high beginning-of- life pressure and long downstream manifold lines; these factors created conditions that were conducive to high surge pressures. This paper discusses the GPM project's approach to surge mitigation in the propulsion system design. The paper describes the <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> program and results, with discussions of specific difficulties encountered. Based {{on the results of}} <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> and pressure drop analyses, a unique configuration of cavitating venturis was chosen to mitigate surge while minimizing pressure losses during thruster maneuvers.

Testing requires not only spike-surge generators with a suitable range of open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current waveshapes, but also appropriate means, termed couplers, for connecting test surges to the equipment under test. Key among coupler design considerations is minimization of fail positives resulting from reduction in delivered surge energy {{due to the}} coupler. Back-filters and the lines on which they are necessary, are considered as well as ground-fault and ground potential rise.

40|$|The {{development}} of an online method for the early detection of a stator turn insulation deterioration is {{the objective of the}} research at hand. A high percentage of motor breakdowns is related to the failure of the stator insulation system. Since most of the stator insulation failures originate in the breakdown of the turn-to-turn insulation, the research in this realm is of great significance. Despite the progress that has been made in the field of stator turn fault detection methods, the most popular and the best known ones are still limited to the detection of solid turn faults. The time span between a solid turn fault and the breakdown of the primary insulation system can be as short as a few seconds. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method capable of detecting the deterioration of the turn insulation as early as possible and prior to the {{development of}} a solid turn fault. The different stresses that cause the aging of the insulation and eventually lead to failure are described as well as the various patterns of an insulation failure. A comprehensive literature survey shows the methods presently used for the monitoring of the turn insulation. Up to now no well-tested and reliable online method that can find the deterioration of the turn insulation is available. The most commonly used turn insulation test is the surge test, which, however, is performed only when the motor is out of service and disconnected from the supply. So far no research at all has been conducted on the application of an online surge test. The research at hand examines the applicability of the surge test to an operating machine. Various topologies of online <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> are examined with regard to their practicability and their limitations. The most practical configuration is chosen for further analysis, implementation and development. Moreover, practical challenges are presented by the non-idealities of the induction machine like the eccentricity of the rotor and the rotor slotting, and have to be taken into account. Two solutions to eliminate the influence of the rotor position on the surge waveform are presented. Even though the basic concepts of online <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> can be validated experimentally by a machine with a solid turn fault, it is preferable to use a machine with a deteriorated turn insulation. Therefore, a method, which does not require complex and expensive hardware, to experimentally emulate the turn insulation breakdown is implemented. The concepts at any stage of the work are supported by simulations and experimental results. In addition, the theory of <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> is further developed by giving new definitions of the test's sensitivity, i. e., the frequency sensitivity and the error area ratio (EAR) sensitivity.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site {{processes}} high-level {{radioactive waste}} from the processing of nuclear materials that contains dissolved and precipitated metals and radionuclides. Vitrification of this waste into borosilicate glass for ultimate disposal at a geologic repository involves chemically modifying the waste to make {{it compatible with the}} glass melter system. Pretreatment steps include removal of excess aluminum by dissolution and washing, and processing with formic and nitric acids to: 1) adjust the reduction-oxidation (redox) potential in the glass melter to reduce radionuclide volatility and improve melt rate; 2) adjust feed rheology; and 3) reduce by steam stripping the amount of mercury that must be processed in the melter. Elimination of formic acid in pretreatment has been studied to eliminate the production of hydrogen in the pretreatment systems, which requires nuclear grade monitoring equipment. An alternative reductant, glycolic acid, has been studied as a substitute for formic acid. However, in the melter, the potential for greater formation of flammable gases exists with glycolic acid. Melter flammability is difficult to control because flammable mixtures can be formed during surges in offgases that both increase the amount of flammable species and decrease the temperature in the vapor space of the melter. A flammable surge can exceed the 60 % of the LFL with no way to mitigate it. Therefore, careful control of the melter feed composition based on scaled melter <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> is required.

During times of <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> or enhanced pandemic surveillance, public health laboratories (PHLs) may experience overwhelming demand for testing, even while the prevalence of positive specimens remains low. To improve laboratory capacity and testing efficiency during surges, we evaluated whether nasopharyngeal (NP) /throat swab specimens can be pooled and tested for the presence of the 2009 H 1 N 1 in-fluenza virus without a reduction in sensitivity. Pools of 10 specimens were extracted and concentrated upon elution on the MagNA Pure LC instrument, and real-time PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast platform, using the CDC swine influenza virus real-time RT-PCR detection panel (rRT-PCR swine flu panel). Specimens in positive pools were singly re-extracted and retested by PCR to identify individual positive samples. Initial studies showed that spiking a pool of nine negative specimens (100 l each) or 900 l of virus transport mediumwith 100 l of a positive clinical specimen caused no loss of sensi-tivity by rRT-PCR testing. Pools containing either multiple positive specimens or specimens positive for other respiratory vi-ruses also showed no negative effect on crossing threshold (CT) values. To test the robustness of the pooling protocol, a panel of 50 blinded samples was sent to three PHLs and tested in five pools of 10. All PHLs correctly identified the positive specimens.

40|$|Power-on failure {{has been}} the {{prevalent}} failure mechanism for solid tantalum capacitors in decoupling applications. A surge step stress test (SSST) has been previously applied to identify the critical stress level of a capacitor batch to give some predictability to the power-on failure mechanism [1]. But SSST can also {{be viewed as an}} electrically destructive test under a time-varying stress (voltage). It consists of rapidly charging the capacitor with incremental voltage increases, through a low resistance in series, until the capacitor under test is electrically shorted. When the reliability of capacitors is evaluated, a highly accelerated life test (HALT) is usually adopted since it is a time-efficient method of determining the failure mechanism; however, a destructive test under a time-varying stress such as SSST is even more time efficient. It usually takes days or weeks to complete a HALT test, but it only takes minutes for a time-varying stress test to produce failures. The advantage of incorporating a specific time-varying stress profile into a statistical model is significant in providing an alternative life test method for quickly revealing the failure mechanism in capacitors. In this paper, a time-varying stress that mimics a typical SSST has been incorporated into the Weibull model to characterize the failure mechanism in different types of capacitors. The SSST circuit and transient conditions for correctly <b>surge</b> <b>testing</b> capacitors are discussed. Finally, the SSST was applied for testing Ta capacitors, polymer aluminum capacitors (PA capacitors), and multi-layer ceramic (MLC) capacitors with both precious metal electrodes (PME) and base metal electrodes (BME). The test results are found to be directly associated with the dielectric layer breakdown in Ta and PA capacitors and are independent of the capacitor values, the way the capacitors were built, and the capacitors manufacturers. The test results also show that MLC capacitors exhibit surge breakdown voltages much higher than the rated voltage and that the breakdown field is inversely proportional to the dielectric layer thickness. The SSST data {{can also be used to}} comparatively evaluate the voltage robustness of capacitors for decoupling applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend toward}} ever-expanding {{variable}} speed induction motor applications {{results in the}} need for reliable condition monitoring and detection schemes for closed-loop motor-drive systems. This research focuses on the detection of air gap eccentricity in induction motors supplied by a vector-controlled drive. The majority of existing eccentricity detection techniques is based on monitoring fault harmonics in the stator current. This research analyzes {{the distribution of the}} eccentricity-related fault harmonics between the stator voltage and current, and points out that monitoring only the stator current is insufficient. When the motor is supplied by a vector-controlled drive, both voltage and current become modulated signals and contain fault harmonics. Either stator voltage or current can contain larger fault harmonics due to the influence of the drive controllers and the mechanical load. Therefore, a combination of monitoring both variables is necessary to ensure good detection reliability. Furthermore, with an AC drive, the motor speed and load will change widely, which changes fault harmonics too. A new detection scheme using an artificial neural network is proposed to incorporate the influence of changing operating conditions into the fault detection. This detection scheme is more reliable and cost efficient.

At first, reproductivity of the past storm <b>surges</b> was <b>tested</b> in a hydraulic model ofthe main rivers in Osaka City, which was proved to be successful. After this test,the effect of the storm surge gates on piling-up of water by storm surges was investigatedby the model...|$|R
