25|$|The flag design {{shortlist}} was {{met with}} negative response from {{some members of the}} public, professional designers and vexillologists. The selection was lambasted as unappealing, clichéd, dull and too logo-like. There were complaints that the four designs were far too similar to each other, as only one does not feature a large silver fern dividing the field, and two are identical except for a colour choice. The two Lockwood proposals were likened to the design of a beach towel, at least until Lockwood pointed out that most national flags were made into beach towels. Some commentators also felt that the Flag Consideration Panel was never qualified to make an adequate design selection, since none of its members had any credentials or experience in the fields of graphic design, art or vexillology. The panel stated that it consulted vexillologists and designers to ensure that the flags chosen were workable and had no impediments. According to journalist Grant McLachlan, the panel consulted a Nike <b>shoe</b> <b>designer</b> and not any vexillologists.|$|E

2500|$|Cinderella's Eyes is {{the debut}} studio album by English {{recording}} artist Nicola Roberts. A {{member of the}} British girl group Girls Aloud, Roberts drew inspiration from her time with the group. Her experience with Girls Aloud's formation found her being labelled [...] "ugly" [...] by the media, and the constant negative attention and subsequent personal problems resulted in her struggling with her confidence. She started recording for the album in 2010 and co-wrote all of the original tracks on the album, working closely with producers Dimitri Tikovoi, Maya von Doll (from electro group Sohodolls) and Diplo on the album, as well as Canadian electropop band Dragonette. The concept of the album derived from fairy tales, focusing mostly upon Cinderella after titling the album Cinderella's Eyes. The album artwork features Roberts next to a collection of vintage artefacts wearing a modern interpretation of the Cinderella glass slipper, co-produced by <b>shoe</b> <b>designer</b> Atalanta Weller.|$|E

2500|$|The album artwork premiered on 22 August 2011, and {{features}} Roberts {{next to a}} collection of vintage artefacts wearing a modern interpretation of Cinderella's glass slippers. The album artwork was shot at Master Shipwright's House in London, which Roberts described as [...] "run-down reality {{with a hint of}} fairytale". The concept of the artwork was to relate to the different sounds of the album, which Roberts described as [...] "red" [...] and [...] "blue" [...] tracks, claiming she wanted [...] "to be on parallel with the art and clothes". The emerging detailing in electro music, as Roberts described it was something she wanted present in the artwork, whilst talking to Rolling Stone she said [...] "I wanted that rhythm to be present in the imagery, the way I pictured it. There's a lot going on with the sounds on this record; it was important to me that the visual side was equally eclectic, so that it came full circle. This is a full package. For the album photograph shoot, Roberts worked alongside <b>shoe</b> <b>designer</b> Atalanta Weller to produce the shoes for the album. The [...] "21st century" [...] Cinderella style glass slippers were produced for the album campaign, Roberts explained about the shoes and fashion in relation to the record saying; [...] "that will play a big part in the campaign for the record [...] the crystals represent a massive part in the theme of the album". The shoe, a wedge, is in Webber's signature style and whilst talking to Vogue Webber called her intrigue at working with Roberts due to them being an unlikely pairing. Webber called Roberts' style [...] "incredible" [...] and [...] "extremely distinctive, luxurious and original": ...|$|E
