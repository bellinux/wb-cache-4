40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of <b>swirl</b> ratio on knock limits in spark ignition engines. Initially it was attempted to find a correlation between <b>swirl</b> ratio and Knock Limited Spark Advance (KLSA) for a selection of commercially available engines. A comparison of measured <b>swirl</b> ratios and KLSA indicated that no such correlation could be found. This was put down to the fact that other factors such as combustion chamber shape and spark plug location play a more dominant role in affecting knock limits than <b>swirl</b> level. Following from this, a single engine with a relatively poor <b>swirl</b> ratio was selected and the <b>swirl</b> level was altered. A novel method of increasing and decreasing the <b>swirl</b> level, with the same pressure drop in each case was developed, and this development is described. This method made it possible to perform dynamometer tests, measuring the KLSA timing for the cases of low and high <b>swirl,</b> while keeping all other parameters such as pressure, temperature, spark plug location and combustion chamber shape constant. All these factors are known to {{have an effect on the}} occurrence of knock. In this manner it was possible to determine whether <b>swirl</b> alone has any effect on knock limits. It was found that the high <b>swirl</b> case exhibited higher values of knock limited spark advance above the low <b>swirl</b> case although there was no significant change in torque. A comparison of rubber castings of the inlet ports of numerous engines was made, and is presented in a photographic form. This was done in order to assess how inlet port geometry affects <b>swirl</b> ratios. It was found that a helically shaped inlet port produced the greatest <b>swirl</b> ratio, non directed ports have average values and multiple inlet valve ports have very low <b>swirl</b> ratios. Furthermore, a comparison of <b>swirl</b> ratios of an inlet port with and without deposits, demonstrates that deposits have a significant effect on <b>swirl</b> ratios and volumetric efficiency. However, although the volumetric efficiency was reduced, the deposits enhanced the <b>swirl</b> ratios for this particular case.

40|$|Effects of <b>swirl</b> on the {{development}} of an axisymmetric turbulent mixing layer have been studied. The development of the zero <b>swirl</b> case is found to be consistent with that of a single-stream mixing layer developing from a tripped boundary layer.

The shear stresses are found to be affected significantly more than the normal stresses. The stress increases are partly explained by considering extra production terms in the transport equations that are activated by the presense of the <b>swirl.</b> The thickness and growth rate for the lower <b>swirl</b> rate are found to be comparable to the zero <b>swirl</b> case, while those for the higher <b>swirl</b> rate are increased significantly, in line with the increased Reynolds stresses...|$|R

Three separate simulations with relatively high mesh resolutions and different <b>swirl</b> numbers have been carried out using a finite volume method on a Cartesian non-uniform structured grid. A localised dynamic Smagorinsky model is used to parameterize the subgrid scale turbulence. The snapshots of the axial and <b>swirl</b> velocities and velocity vector fields show the complex flow patterns developing with increased <b>swirl</b> number and the rapid decay of axial momentum. Precessing vortex cores (PVC) were identified for all three cases and the mean axial velocity plots indicate that the upstream extremity of the vortex breakdown bubble shifts towards the inlet as the <b>swirl</b> number increases. The calculated power spectra indicate the distinct precession frequency for high <b>swirl</b> number. Probability density functions of axial velocity showed the changes of their distributions from approximately Gaussian to non-Gaussian with increased <b>swirl</b> number. The <b>swirl</b> has a large effect on the rate of decay of the axial velocity throughout the domain, whereas only has a significant effect on the decay of <b>swirl</b> velocity in the near field close to the jet inlet.

40|$|It {{is known}} that a helical port is more {{effective}} than a tangential port to attain the required <b>swirl</b> ratio with minimum sacrifice in the volumetric efficiency. The <b>swirl</b> port is designed for lesser <b>swirl</b> ratio to reduce emissions at higher speeds. But this condition increases the air fuel mixing time and particulate smoke emissions at lower speeds. Optimum <b>swirl</b> ratio is necessary according to the engine operating condition for optimum combustion and emission reduction. Hence the engine needs variable <b>swirl</b> to enhance the combustion in the cylinder according to its operating conditions, for example at partial load or low speed condition it requires stronger <b>swirl,</b> while the air quantity {{is more important than the}} <b>swirl</b> under very high speed or full load and maximum torque conditions. The <b>swirl</b> and charging quantity can easily trade off and can be controlled by the opening of the valve. Hence in this study the steady flow rig experiment is used to evaluate the <b>swirl</b> of a helical intake port design for different operating conditions. The variable <b>swirl</b> plate set up of the W 06 DTIE 2 engine is used to experimentally study the <b>swirl</b> variation for different openings of the valve.
