25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day she could not see her father anymore after he got angry with her as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at the dinner table, but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E

Seeing Amahl's defense {{of his mother and}} understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom ("Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold"). The mother <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch ("Oh, No, Wait"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed ("I Walk, Mother"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.|$|E
25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks.

Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
