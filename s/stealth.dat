5|$|A <b>stealth</b> {{game is a}} type {{of video}} game that tasks the player with using <b>stealth</b> to avoid or {{overcome}} antagonists. Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, using disguises or avoiding noise. Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but mostly rewarding the player for greater levels of <b>stealth.</b> The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, spies, thieves, ninjas, and assassins. Some games have also combined <b>stealth</b> elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and even platformers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stealth</b> {{technology}} aims to make aircraft almost undetectable by radar {{or other}} sensors, whether infrared, visible, or acoustic. This is effectively multi-spectral camouflage. Work began on <b>stealth</b> technology in America in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The main {{features}} of the class are its <b>stealth</b> characteristics and land-attack capability. The ships incorporate structural, thermal and acoustic <b>stealth</b> features. The vessels use 10 gigabit LAN for their network.|$|E
5|$|Choice is a {{significant}} aspect of the game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began {{with a list of}} factors such as Disciplines, <b>stealth</b> and feats. Each area had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with <b>stealth</b> options and option combinations. Level design began with a focus on <b>stealth,</b> taking into consideration the positioning of guards and the character's potential <b>stealth</b> capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The amusement arcade area was to feature playable versions of Activision arcade games such as Pitfall!, though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|INS Shivalik (F47) is {{the lead}} ship of her class of <b>stealth</b> {{multi-role}} frigates built for the Indian Navy. She is the first <b>stealth</b> warship built by India. She was built at the Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) located in Mumbai. Construction of the vessel began in 2001 and was completed by 2009. She underwent sea trials from thereon before being commissioned on 29 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, radar made painted {{camouflage}} less effective, though inshore craft {{continue to}} use camouflage schemes alongside anti-radar <b>stealth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Five {{ships of}} the French Navy were named {{in honour of}} Surcouf: a steam aviso (sloop); an {{armoured}} cruiser; a submarine cruiser, {{which at the time}} of her launch was the largest submarine in the world, joined the Free French Naval Forces during the Second World War, and disappeared mysteriously after liberating Saint-Pierre and Miquelon; a large fleet escort destroyer, which was heavily damaged in a collision with a Soviet ship; and the present-day <b>stealth</b> frigate, one of the first <b>stealth</b> combat ships.|$|E
5|$|Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, {{released}} in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized <b>stealth</b> elements within an action-adventure framework, {{and was the}} first mainstream <b>stealth</b> game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on <b>stealth</b> than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use his fists to fight enemies.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a game to include <b>stealth</b> gameplay, the {{knowledge}} of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world. The AI in <b>stealth</b> games takes into specific consideration the enemies' reactions to the effects of the player's actions, such as turning off the lights, as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, <b>stealth</b> games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI's movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries. Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in <b>stealth</b> games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. <b>Stealth</b> games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player. Examples of hybrid stealth/horror games include , Outlast, and the Penumbra video game series.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not come}} into {{operational}} usage and was considered obsolete with postwar advances in radar. With more recent improvements in <b>stealth</b> technology, Yehudi lights have again attracted interest.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a successor to the s, the Shivalik-class frigates feature improved <b>stealth</b> features and land attacking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Shivalik {{features}} improved <b>stealth</b> {{and land}} attacking features over the preceding s. She {{is also the}} first Indian navy ship to use the CODOG (COmbined Diesel Or Gas) propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in <b>stealth</b> aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, <b>stealth,</b> and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|The Visakhapatnam class (Project 15B) is a {{class of}} <b>stealth</b> guided missile destroyers under construction. An {{improved}} version of the Kolkata class and ordered in 2011, the first Visakhapatnam-class ship {{is expected to be}} completed in 2018. The class will have enhanced <b>stealth</b> characteristics and state-of-the-art weaponry and sensors, including the long-range Barak 8 surface-to-air missile. The first ship's keel was laid in October 2013. The Visakhapatnam class will be armed with a 127mm main gun and an AK-630 close-in anti-missile gun system.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the <b>stealth</b> characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's <b>stealth</b> contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a <b>stealth</b> aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylum {{features}} {{a series of}} challenge maps separate from the game's story mode that are unlocked while playing, and others are available as optional downloadable content (DLC). The maps focus on the completion of specific goals, such as eliminating successive waves of enemies in combat, and subduing patrolling enemies while using <b>stealth.</b> The methods and variety of abilities used to achieve these goals earn an overall performance score that is ranked online against other players. On the PlayStation 3, the Joker is a playable character in the combat and <b>stealth</b> challenge maps via optional DLC; he must confront the asylum guards and police commissioner James Gordon. The Joker has his own combat abilities and weapons, such as a handgun, exploding chattering teeth, and x-ray glasses which allow him to see opponents through walls.|$|E
5|$|Australia is {{currently}} {{a partner in the}} development of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II <b>stealth</b> fighter, with plans for the country to procure up to 100 examples to replace the F-111 as well as the F/A-18 Hornet.|$|E
5|$|Bob Muglia is {{currently}} the Chief Executive Officer of Snowflake Computing, a cloud-based data-warehousing startup. He joined the company in June 2014, a couple {{years after it was}} founded in 2012. Snowflake Computing came out of <b>stealth</b> mode that October.|$|E
5|$|Castle Wolfenstein, {{originally}} {{available on}} the Apple II in 1981, also employed <b>stealth</b> elements as a focus of the gameplay. Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein, stealing secret plans and escaping. Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected. Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, released in 1984, included some additions to its predecessor, such as a dagger for close-range kills and {{a greater emphasis on}} disguising in enemy uniform. id Software's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original's <b>stealth</b> gameplay, such as body hiding, but this was cut to make the game faster paced. This Wolfenstein game would ironically pave the way for quite a few later 3D action games, specifically first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|Detective Mode, {{allowing}} {{the investigation of}} crimes, was not considered an improvement by Kotaku and GameSpot; while they considered it a good idea, its execution was minimal since a player simply looks for the next highlighted piece of evidence rather than solving a puzzle. Game Informer liked it, {{saying that they were}} complicated and showed how Batman analyzes a crime scene. The combat system received mixed reviews. The shock gloves were criticized as overpowered and making fights too easy, allowing Batman unblockable attacks (instantly disabling most opponents) and removing the need for tactics. Reviewers said that changes to combat punished more than challenged; greater enemy numbers and variety made sustaining an attack difficult, and (combined with an array of gadgets which hindered—rather than damaged—enemies) made encounters long and repetitive. Joystiq noted that the game emphasized combat over <b>stealth.</b> Kotaku called the combat rating system distracting screen clutter which broke the player's concentration, but GameFront said that the system was positive reinforcement for successful fights. The <b>stealth</b> sections were considered of similar quality to previous installments; their unchanged function left the methods of obtaining victory the same, making for a rote experience. The Remote Claw was criticized for making <b>stealth</b> sections too easy, allowing multiple enemies to be disabled without moving from the player's starting position.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure <b>stealth</b> {{video game}} {{developed}} by Arkane Studios {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. The sequel to 2012's Dishonored, the game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 11 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Dishonoreds <b>stealth</b> {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain <b>stealth</b> players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova {{must use}} <b>stealth</b> and darkness to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a cloaking device {{that allows for}} temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities. Nova is also equipped with thermal imaging goggles and a special EMP device for disabling electronic devices and vehicles. In addition to the focus on <b>stealth</b> elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova can engage in hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will hunt for the player, set up traps, and fire blindly to nullify Nova's cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. <b>Stealth</b> technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. <b>Stealth</b> may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sega {{released}} an arcade game called 005 {{in which the}} player's mission {{is to take a}} briefcase of secret documents to a waiting helicopter while avoiding enemy flashlights and use boxes as hiding spots. 005 held the Guinness World Record for being the first <b>stealth</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine is a <b>stealth</b> action {{video game}} {{released}} in 2013 for the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The PC versions of Monaco were developed {{and published by}} Pocketwatch Games while the Xbox Live Arcade version was published by Majesco Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Paxata {{was founded}} in January 2012. It {{initially}} raised $2 million in venture capital. The company came out of <b>stealth</b> mode in October 2013. Simultaneously with its public release, Paxata announced an $8 million funding round led by Accel Partners. Adoption of the software grew quickly. In March 2014, In-Q-Tel acquired {{an interest in the}} startup.|$|E
5|$|The Kolkata class (Project 15A) is a {{class of}} guided missile destroyers with <b>stealth</b> technology. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had {{redesigned}} the follow-on Kolkata class to improve technology (including modern <b>stealth</b> characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was framed by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL). It consists of three ships (Kolkata, Kochi and Chennai), built by Mazagon Dock Limited, which are the navy's largest destroyers. Due to construction delays and a problem discovered during sea trials, the first ship's commission was postponed from 2010 to 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use <b>stealth</b> technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of <b>stealth</b> aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
5|$|The Military Museum {{houses a}} wide range of more than 25,000 {{military}} exhibits dating as far back as to the Roman period, as well as parts of a F-117 <b>stealth</b> aircraft shot down by the Serbian army.|$|E
5|$|The Operative: No One Lives Forever is a first-person shooter {{video game}} with <b>stealth</b> {{gameplay}} elements, developed by Monolith Productions {{and published by}} Fox Interactive, released for Microsoft Windows in 2000. The game was ported later to the PlayStation 2 and Mac OS X.|$|E
5|$|The Raptor's {{aerodynamic}} performance, sensor fusion, and <b>stealth</b> {{work together}} for increased effectiveness. Altitude, speed, and advanced active and passive sensors allow the aircraft to spot targets at considerable ranges and increase weapons range; altitude and speed also complement stealth's ability to increase the aircraft's survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Shivalik {{class or}} Project 17 class is {{a class of}} {{multi-role}} frigates in service with the Indian Navy. They are the first <b>stealth</b> warships built in India. A total of three ships were built between 2000 and 2010, and all three were in commission by 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Swarm {{is located}} on a {{reclaimed}} island adjacent to the <b>Stealth</b> roller coaster, with parts of the ride being built over water. A bridge links the core of Thorpe Park to an island which hosts the roller coaster station, merchandise outlet, a games zone and toilet buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} founded in January 2012 and {{operated}} in <b>stealth</b> mode until October 2013. It {{has received more than}} $10 million in venture funding. Analysts have praised Paxata for creating software that is user-friendly for non-technical business users, but caution that they are in a noisy marketplace.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on stealth-based tactics, which require one to silently take out enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks. However, most {{of the game is}} action-orientated, which involves Logan navigating through levels whilst loudly shooting at enemies with no consequence to the mission. The game takes place {{in a wide variety of}} locations, including narrow interior streets of Washington D.C. to wide open plains of Kazakhstan. In some <b>stealth</b> based missions, the game will involve various puzzles. Some locations feature low light ambience, which force the player to use their torch despite its drawbacks imposed during <b>stealth</b> missions.|$|E
