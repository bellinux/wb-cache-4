5|$|As {{the pair}} leave separately, Mařenka's parents, Ludmila and Krušina, enter with the {{marriage}} broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces {{that he has}} found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing.

In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>has</b> a chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.|$|E

25|$|A Polish {{marriage}} certificate lists three fields, the surnames for the husband, wife, and children. The partners {{may choose to}} retain their surnames, or both adopt the surname of either partner, {{or a combination of}} both; the children must receive either the joint surname or the surname of one of the partners. However, a married woman usually adopts her husband's name and the children usually bear the surname of the father. The wife may keep her maiden name (nazwisko panieńskie) or add her husband's surname to hers, thus creating a double-barrelled name (nazwisko złożone). However, if <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>has</b> a double-barrelled name, she must leave one of the parts out—it is illegal to use a triple- or more-barrelled name. It is also possible, though rare, for the husband to adopt his wife's surname or to add his wife's surname to his family name (an example is businessman Zygmunt Solorz-Żak, who did both, taking his wife's name on his first marriage, and later appending his second wife's name to it).|$|E
