This required the navigation system to position the code and frequency of the receiver tracking loops where the receiver switches satellites.

40|$|Besides {{atmospheric}} turbulence and pointing errors which cause the signal intensity fluctuation, background radiation also impairs the free-space optical intensity-modulation / direct-detection link performance by introducing a noisy photocurrent {{component in the}} receiver. Methods such as adopting some specific optics systems, using pilot symbols or line codes to estimate the background information and cancel it accordingly, and pulse-position modulation (PPM), can be adopted to mitigate the impact of background radiation. However, purely depending on the optics system, the background radiation can only be reduced, but not completely cancelled; {{and the use of}} any of pilot symbols, line codes and PPM reduces the system spectral efficiency drastically. In this paper, based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) principle, we develop a Viterbi-type trellis-search <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver</b> (the GLRT <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver)</b> that can estimate the unknown channel gain and the background radiation simultaneously, and detect the data <b>sequence</b> accordingly. This <b>receiver</b> requires very few pilot symbols, and therefore, does not significantly reduce the bandwidth efficiency. Its error performance can approach that of detection with perfect information of the channel state and the background radiation, as the observation window length used for forming the decision metric increases. Since a Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm is adopted, the search complexity is very low and is independent of the observation window size. However, the search complexity of the GLRT <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver</b> grows exponentially with the modulation order. To further simplify the implementation, we derive a more efficient decision-feedback symbol-by-symbol receiver which retains the same error performance as that of the GLRT <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver.</b> Comment: need to be further improved and revise...|$|R
40|$|Since {{atmospheric}} turbulence and pointing errors cause signal intensity fluctuations and the background radiation surrounding the free-space optical (FSO) receiver contributes an undesired noisy component, the receiver requires accurate channel state information (CSI) and background information {{to adjust the}} detection threshold. In most previous studies, for CSI acquisition, pilot symbols were employed, {{which leads to a}} reduction of spectral and energy efficiency; and an impractical assumption that the background radiation component is perfectly known was made. In this paper, we develop an efficient and robust <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver,</b> which acquires the CSI and the background information implicitly and requires no knowledge about the channel model information. It is robust since it can automatically estimate the CSI and background component and detect the data sequence accordingly. Its decision metric has a simple form and involves no integrals, and thus can be easily evaluated. A Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm is adopted to improve the search efficiency, and a selective-store strategy is adopted to overcome a potential error floor problem as well as to increase the memory efficiency. To further simplify the receiver, a decision-feedback symbol-by-symbol receiver is proposed as an approximation of the <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver.</b> By simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that the performance of both the <b>sequence</b> <b>receiver</b> and the symbol-by-symbol receiver, approach that of detection with perfect knowledge of the CSI and background radiation, as the length of the window for forming the decision metric increases.

40|$|In this paper, two array-based {{schemes for}} intracell and {{intercell}} interference suppression are proposed. In both cases, the {{spatial and temporal}} characteristics of the propagation are jointly exploited by placing a narrowband beamformer prior to the corresponding data detection stage. In the rst approach, Filtered Training <b>Sequence</b> Joint Detection <b>Receiver</b> (FTS-JDR), the beamformer is devoted to exclusively cancel out intercell interference.

The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) offers the potential to revolutionize range instrumentation. In high dynamic environments, an integrated system composed of a GPS receiver and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) can overcome the effects of vehicle acceleration and signal blockage by vehicle structures. The GPS Receiver uses the INS velocity measurements to aid satellite reacquisition following signal losses and to aid sequential reacquisition in <b>sequencing</b> <b>receivers.</b> The INS also permits navigation during signal outages due to antenna masking {{and can be used}} to maintain high-quality, high-rate navigation solutions between GPS updates. The longterm accuracy of GPS is used to remove the effects of INS instrument errors, such as gyro drift, making it possible to acheive a high level of combined system performance using a low cost INS, which would have relatively poor long-term autonomous performance. The complexity of the GPS receiver required for a specific level of system performance is also reduced with the presence of INS aiding.
