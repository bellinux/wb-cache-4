5000|$|PPI {{displays}} {{are actually}} {{quite similar to}} A-scopes in operation, and appeared fairly quickly after the introduction of radar. As with most 2D radar displays, {{the output of the}} radio receiver was attached to the intensity channel to produce a bright dot indicating returns. In the A-scope a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> generator attached to the X-axis moves the spot across the screen, whereas in the PPI the output of two such generators is used to rotate the line around the screen. Some early systems were mechanical, physically spinning the deflection magnets, but the electronics needed to do this in a [...] "solid-state" [...] fashion were not particularly complex, and were in use in the early 1940s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary input}} to the A-scope was the amplified return signal {{received}} from the radar, which was sent into the Y-axis of the display. Returns caused the spot to be deflected downward (or upward on some models), drawing vertical lines on the tube. These lines were known as a [...] "blip" [...] (or [...] "pip"). The X-axis input was connected to a <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> generator known as a time base generator that swept the spot across the display, timed to match the pulse repetition frequency of the radar. This spread out the vertical traces across the display according to {{the time they were}} received. Since the return time of the signal corresponds to twice the distance to the target divided by the speed of light, the distance along the axis directly indicates the range to any target. This was usually measured against a scale above the display.|$|E
40|$|A {{temperature}} control system, {{which includes a}} modified wheatstone bridge with a resistive-capacitive (RC) circuit in one leg of the bridge, is disclosed. The RC circuit includes a resistor which provides an effective resistance {{as a function of}} its absolute resistance and the on-time to off-time ratio of pulses supplied to a switch connected across it. A <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> is produced across the RC circuit. The voltage is compared with the voltage across a temperature sensor with heat being applied during each pulse period portion when the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> exceeds the voltage across the temperature sensor...|$|E
50|$|A flyback {{transformer}} (FBT), also called a line output transformer (LOPT), {{is a special}} type of electrical transformer. It was initially designed to generate high <b>voltage</b> <b>sawtooth</b> signals at a relatively high frequency. In modern applications, it is used extensively in switched-mode power supplies for both low (3 V) and high voltage (over 10 kV) supplies.|$|R
50|$|Another {{use of the}} {{thyratron}} was in relaxation oscillators. Since {{the plate}} turn-on voltage {{is much higher than}} the turn-off voltage the tube has hysteresis and with a capacitor across it could function as a <b>sawtooth</b> oscillator. The <b>voltage</b> on the grid controlled the breakdown voltage and thus the period of oscillation. Thyratron relaxation oscillators were used in power inverters and oscilloscope sweep circuits.|$|R
40|$|In {{sodium channel}} (Nav) -rich axon initial {{segments}} and nodes of Ranvier, mechanical, ischemic and inflammatory injuries render these voltage-gated channels dangerously leaky. Extrapolating from recombinant Nav 1. 6 behavior (Wang et al 2009 Am J Physiol 297 :C 823), we postulate that the structural degradation of axolemmal bilayer, a common feature of neuoropathologic conditions, fosters ENa dissipation by favoring left-shifted Nav channel operation. This sick excitable cell Nav-leak would encompass left-shifted Itransient and Ipersistent components (fast-mode Iwindow, slow-mode Ipersistent). Ideally, bilayer damage-induced malfunction of Nav channels could be studied in Nav-rich myelinated axon nodes, exploiting the INa(v,t) hysteresis of <b>sawtooth</b> ramp <b>voltage</b> clamp. We hypothesize that protective lipophilic Nav antagonists (e. g., ranolazine, riluzole) partition more avidly into disorderly bilayers of traumatically (ischemically, etc) damaged axons than into well-packed undamaged bilayers. Whereas inhibitors using aqueous routes would access all Navs equally, differential partitioning into sick bilayer would co-localize lipophilic antagonists with sick Nav channels, allowing for more specific targeting of impaired cells. Molecular fine-tuning effective antagonists for maximal partitioning into damaged-membrane milieus (thereby avoiding healthy cells) {{could help reduce}} Nav antagonist side-effects. In potentially salvageable neurons of traumatic and/or ischemic penumbra, in inflammatory neuropathies, in muscular dystrophy, in myocytes of cardiac infarct borders, Nav-leak driven excitotoxicity too easily overwhelms cellular repair mechanisms. Precision-tuned Nav antagonist variants that preferred mildly, as opposed to severely, damaged Nav-rich axolemma or sarcolemma might be suitable for the prolonged continuous administration needed to allow for excitable cell remodeling and hence for improved functional recovery...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{hexagonal}} boron nitride (h-BN) were grown by a plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} (PECVD) technique. The quality of the films was assessed by infrared spectroscopy, microRaman spectroscopy {{as a function of}} annealing temperature and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The films proved to be thermally stable up to 1370 K. Current-voltage measurements were performed, as a function of humidity, using metal-insulator-semiconductor and metal-insulator-metal structures. Typical resistivities were found in the range 1013 - 1014 O cm in dry air and exhibit high sensitivity against humidity. The influence of the mean orientation of the c-axis of the BN films was considered. <b>Sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> pulse trains were also applied. Threshold switching phenomena were observed, but only in atmosphere containing humidity. The values of the switching voltages depend strongly on the relative humidity (RH), on the characteristics of the applied <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> pulse trains, {{as well as on the}} nature of the metallic electrode...|$|E
40|$|A new {{feedforward}} control circuit suitable for {{applications in the}} de-de pulsewidth modulated (PWM) boost converter operated in the continuous conduction mode (CCM) is proposed, Its principle of operation is described, analyzed for steady state, and experimentally verified, The peak value of the <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> at the noninverting input of a PWM modulator is held constant and the voltage at the inverting input of the PWM modulator varies {{in proportion to the}} converter de input voltage, As a result, the complement of the on-duty cycle (1 - D) is proportional to the de converter input voltage, yielding the converter output voltage theoretically independent of the converter input voltage, The circuit is very simple and significantly improves line regulation of the output voltage, The measured open-loop line regulation at fixed loads was less than 5 % for the converter de input voltage change by 400 %. The load regulation was also good even without a negative feedback loop...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{the paper}} a new testing method for {{spectral}} analysis of DACs is presented. The method requires low resolution high speed ADC {{to acquire the}} resulting signal obtained by adding to the output voltage of the DAC under test the periodic voltage with sawtooth shape. The zero crossing time sequence detected in the quantized signal is used to infer {{the value of the}} <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> and, consequently, that of the output voltage of the DAC. Because the sampled signal is characterised by non-uniform sampling time, the spectral analysis is performed {{on the basis of a}} procedure pointed out to overcome the problem concerning the frequency ambiguities in the spectral analysis of non-uniform sampled signal. This procedure permits the reconstruction of the uniformly sampled spectrum by starting from the non-uniformly sampled one. The results of numerical test on 14 -bit DAC by using 6 bit ADC were shown. Finally, the advantages of the method respect to another presented in literature, based on low resolution ADC and dithering, are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{measurements were}} done on aqueous gelatin gels submerged in dodecane. Use of home-built AFM instrumentation coupled with dedicated {{analysis of the}} recorded force-displacement curves, allowed the a posteriori extraction of both surface topography and elastic properties of these soft samples. Hertz theory was used to obtain (apparent) relative Young moduli (E*) from the force-indentation curves. For indentations smaller than 100 nm, scattered values of E* were found. This is partially attributed to the structural inhomogeneity of the polymer network at these length scales. At larger indentations, the relative Young moduli {{were found to be}} "compression-rate"-independent but to decrease with the indentation depth (). This independence of the compression rate indicates quasi equilibrium elastic behavior (i. e., the absence of stress relaxation by the gelatin), confirmed also by additional experiments, in which a truncated <b>sawtooth</b> driving <b>voltage</b> was used. In these latter AFM recordings, the compression regime is combined with a stationary piezo state when the AFM tip is in contact with the gel. The measured cantilever deflection due to gel relaxation was always below 10 % from the indentation depth. Additional features were observed in the 3 D recordings and associated with stiff fibrils lying on top of the soft gelatin network. Depending on aging time and location along the sample surface, mobile single fibrils as well as tough, compact, immobile fibril bundles were observed. A comparison was made between the relative Young moduli measured with AFM and the elastic (storage) moduli as measured in a conventional rheometer. Taking as variable the sample's "age", the microscopic and the macroscopic moduli turned out to be in good agreement in the limit of high (polymer) concentrated gels. Gel syneresis, with water exudation from the 10 % gelatin network, was found to drastically increase the E* values found with AFM (at = 250 nm). The fact that this was not found with conventional rheometry might suggest a different syneresis behavior in dodecan...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} support the {{development}} of comprehensive performance and life models for future deep space missions that will utilize ion thrusters, we have undertaken {{a study of the}} plasma structure in hollow cathodes using an new pneumatic scanning probe diagnostic. This device is designed to insert a miniature probe directly into the hollow cathode orifice from either the upstream insert region in the interior of the hollow cathode, or from the downstream keeper-plasma region at the exit of the hollow cathode, to provide complete axial profiles of the discharge plasma parameters. Previous attempts to diagnose this region with probes was Limited by the melting of small probes in the intense discharge near the orifice, or caused significant perturbation of the plasma by probes large enough to survive. Our new probe is extremely compact, and when configured as a single Langmuir probe, the ceramic tube insulator is only 0. 5 mm in diameter and the current collecting conductor has a total area of 0. 002 cm 2. A series of current-voltage characteristics are obtained by applying a rapid <b>sawtooth</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform to the probe as it is scanned by the pneumatic actuator {{into and out of the}} plasma region, The bellow-sealed pneumatic drive scans the probe 4 cm in the cathode insert region and 10 cm in the anode/keeper plasmas region at average speeds of about 1 mm/msec, and the residence time at the end of the insertion stroke in the densest part of the plasma near the orifice is measured to be only 10 msec. Since the voltage sweep time is fast compared to the motion of the probe, axial profiles of the plasma density, temperature and potential with reasonable spatial resolution are obtained. Measurements of the internal cathode pressures and the axial plasma-parameter profiles for a hollow cathode operating at discharge currents of up to 35 A in xenon will be presented...|$|E
