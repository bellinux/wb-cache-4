500|$|Both {{episodes of}} [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly described them as [...] "nearly perfect", calling them {{the two best}} episodes of the season so far: [...] " [...] nailed the characterizations, the interactions, the tossed-off one-liners, the weird-yet-realistic scenarios...I wonder how much it helps that she's out on the acting floor every day, getting attuned to her costars' rhythms?" [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] episode was his favorite episode of the fifth season so far, which he said provided several laugh-out-loud moments and a poignancy with Michael's decision to find Holly. McAuliffe described the second episode as a [...] "satisfying wrap-up" [...] and said Michael's outburst during the lecture was [...] "one of the most painful Michael meltdown moments in the show's history". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> episode perfectly balanced drama and comedy. He particularly complimented the chemistry between both Carell and Fischer and between Krasinski and Wilson, {{and said he was}} particularly pleased to receive closure over the Karen character. But Sepinwall said the second episode felt padded with [...] "material I would have been fine seeing as deleted scenes". Although he said Carell's reaction to the news that Holly still has feelings for him as a [...] "wonderful performance", Sepinwall also said the subplot involving Angela's cat was particularly unfunny and that subplot with Jim and Dwight, [...] "so brilliant last week, ran out of steam quickly here." ...|$|E

In his review for The Guardian, Alexis Petridis was ambivalent towards the album's 1980s influence and argued that, despite well written songs, it is not very consequential. Time magazine's Claire Suddath said the songs lack lyrical substance, {{even though they are}} performed well. Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, called 4 inconsistent, short, and unfinished.
