50|$|Social <b>structure</b> {{can also}} be divided into {{microstructure}} and macrostructure. Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social <b>structure</b> of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social <b>structure,</b> or a <b>structure</b> of organizations as a pattern of relations between social positions or social roles, where those positions and roles have no <b>structure</b> by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' <b>structure,</b> a pattern of relations between objects that have their own <b>structure</b> (for example, a political social <b>structure</b> between political parties, as political parties have their own social <b>structure).</b> Some types of social <b>structures</b> that modern sociologist differentiate are relation <b>structures</b> (in family or larger family-like clan <b>structures),</b> communication <b>structures</b> (how information is passed in organizations) and sociometric <b>structures</b> (<b>structures</b> of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by Jacob L. Moreno).|$|R
