5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sand</b> <b>filters</b> are a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. <b>Sand</b> <b>filters</b> are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|E

25|$|Pump {{and treat}} {{involves}} pumping out contaminated groundwater {{with the use}} of a submersible or vacuum pump, and allowing the extracted groundwater to be purified by slowly proceeding through a series of vessels that contain materials designed to adsorb the contaminants from the groundwater. For petroleum-contaminated sites this material is usually activated carbon in granular form. Chemical reagents such as flocculants followed by <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> may also be used to decrease the contamination of groundwater.

25|$|Water {{purification}} is {{the process}} of removing undesirable chemicals, biological contaminants, suspended solids and gases from water. The goal is to produce water fit for a specific purpose. Most water is disinfected for human consumption (drinking water), but water purification may also be designed for a variety of other purposes, including fulfilling the requirements of medical, pharmacological, chemical and industrial applications. The methods used include physical processes such as filtration, sedimentation, and distillation; biological processes such as slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> or biologically active carbon; chemical processes such as flocculation and chlorination and the use of electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|The first {{documented}} use of <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> {{to purify}} {{the water supply}} dates to 1804, when {{the owner of a}} bleachery in Paisley, Scotland, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer James Simpson for the Chelsea Waterworks Company in London in 1829. This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the United Kingdom in the ensuing decades.|$|E

In theatre, they would escort infantry patrols, perform aerial reconnaissance, provide fire support and act as airborne communications hubs.

2500|$|Slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> {{may be used}} {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, {{at the bottom and}} finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, {{on the surface of the}} filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow <b>sand</b> <b>filters</b> are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by biological growth.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Small {{particles}} {{typical of}} liquid swine manure often clog <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> beds and fine filters. We evaluated the effec-tiveness of polymer flocculants to improve drainage and filtration performance of <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> beds {{by increasing the}} particle size of manure. A pilot separation unit was evaluated at the Swine Unit of the NCSU Lake Wheeler Road Laboratory in Ra-leigh, North Carolina, in 40 consecutive cycles during a 20 -month period. The unit consisted of a homogenization tank that mixed the flushed swine manure, an in-line polymer mixer, and two <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> beds (29. 7 m 2) designed to receive 30. 5 cm (1 ft) depth of the polymer-treated effluent. Flocculation treatment using polyacrylamide (PAM) polymer improved drainage characteristics of the <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> by preventing clogging and surface sealing. The combination of flocculation and filtration treatment removed 97 % of total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS), 85 % of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), and 83 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the flushed manure. Along with the solids, treatment resulted in capture of 61 % total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and 72 % total phosphorus (TP). Most of the nutrients removed in the solids were organic forms. Drying time to produce removable cakes varied significantly with the loading rate of solids applied to the <b>sand</b> <b>filter</b> bed. A load of < 2 kg TSS m− 2 per drying cycle allowed completion of the drying cycle in about 8 days, which is desirable to reduce potential fly problems.
