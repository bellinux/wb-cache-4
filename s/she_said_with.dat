25|$|Tracy Chapman {{was later}} {{added to the}} name of people she wanted to work with. Beyoncé Knowles and Stevie Wonder both {{said they wanted to}} work with Sandé. However, she said that they assume that she is {{currently}} busy and will not work with them. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> knowing Wonder would like to work with her was a dream come true. She said she will continue to collaborate with Alicia Keys on her upcoming album, and she would be flattered to work with Knowles as her voice is unparalleled. Nicki Minaj was also someone who she would like to collaborate with on the album, but did not get the chance. Her vocal ability is often compared to Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Beyoncé Knowles, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera and Annie Lennox.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2016 {{interview}} with The Guardian, Han Kang said, [...] "As a teenager I suffered typical questions: why pain, why death? I thought that books held the answers, but curiously I realized they contain only questions. Their writers were weak and vulnerable {{just like we}} were." [...] Writing the book was a difficult task, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> the main cause being her joint problems which started in her mid-30s. She wrote the entire novella in longhand. Kang received help from a video artist and a psychiatric hospital when researching the book. The {{second part of the}} book is primarily inspired by Kang's experiences with the aforementioned artist whose body of work was extensively studied.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> a choking voice, [...] "For me, {{this is not just}} a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> this <b>with</b> {{such great}} {{significance}} that Ada and I glanced at one another, foreseeing something more.|$|R

2500|$|... "Ruth the Moabitess": In {{modern style}} one would not, in referring, {{at this stage}} of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree {{necessary}} or advantageous to repeat the designation [...] "the Moabitess." [...] The repetition is antique, and calls to mind the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - [...] "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." [...] She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see Leviticus 19:9; Leviticus 23:22: Deuteronomy 24:19). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather than to get. But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves in their little handmill or quern. <b>She</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> beautiful courtesy. [...] "Let me go I, pray, thee;" [...] or, [...] "I wish to go, if you will please to allow me." [...] Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom.|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, 2016, Brownback issued {{executive}} orders barring state agencies from facilitating refugee resettlement from Syria and other majority Muslim countries, {{in concert with}} the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). He maintained they presented security risks. His decision entirely removed the state from the program. The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement served notice that it would instead work directly with local refugee resettlement organizations. Mark Greenberg of the federal Administration for Children and Families said, “If the state were to cease participating in the refugee resettlement program, it would have no effect on the placement of refugees by the State Department in Kansas, or the ORR-funded benefits they can receive." [...] Although states are legally entitled to withdraw from the program, the initial withdrawal for claimed security reasons, is the first in the nation. Micah Kubic, the Kansas ACLU's executive director said Brownback’s policy removed the state from the process of protecting those seeking safety jeopardized by their religious beliefs, despite such refugees receiving thorough screenings: “It’s very sad and very unfortunate that the governor is allowing fear {{to get in the way}} of hospitality and traditional Kansas values.” Earlier in 2016, Brownback directed state agencies to use the State Department’s list of state-sponsors of terrorism to exclude refugees whose presence might constitute security risks. Refugees who were fleeing danger in Iran, Sudan and Syria were signaled out for exclusion. Thanks to Brownback's initiative, Kansas would lose about $2.2 million annually that had been provided to support resettlement agencies. The state had been working with three such agencies, among them Catholic Charities of Northeast Kansas, to in making appropriate placements. In the seven months preceding his order, 354 refugees from all countries have been resettled in Kansas, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> thirteen Syrians placed in the Wichita or Kansas City areas of the state in prior sixteen months. Democratic Representative Jim Ward, from Wichita, characterized Brownback’s announcement as [...] "a distraction," [...] intended solely for political purposes, [...] as Kansas faced a $290 million budget deficit.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> a travel-tired smile - [...] Who shall {{lift the}} years O! - [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> a travel-tired smile, [...] Half scared by scene so strange; [...] She said, outworn by mile on mile, [...] The blurred lamps wanning her face the while, [...] "O Love, I am here; I am with you!"

6000|$|At first, Gwendolen {{remained}} silent, paling with anger--justifiable anger, in her opinion. Then <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> haughtiness-- ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> it <b>with</b> an ineffable tone of contempt, {{just like}} the {{original}} Nuttie, {{who seemed to be}} recalled by association with Annaple.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> doggedly, <b>with</b> {{a fierce}} glance at Mr. Foss, [...] "it'll come true. If, after my death, my 'usband {{is going to}} marry a young woman with--with----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>with</b> a {{contented}} {{sigh and}} an entire flattening of her tone, [...] "I {{laid it on}} pretty thick that time....

[...] "I mean to have that money," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>with</b> bright determination and round eyes....|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, I've known {{nothing about}} that!" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it <b>with</b> a braver assurance--clutching, with comfort, at {{something}} that was apparently new to her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>said</b> this <b>with</b> such deep pathos, while tears {{filled her}} eyes, that I {{could not have}} uttered a word of comfort to save my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I'd like to," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> hastily <b>with</b> an effort, striving {{after that}} sympathy which weakens the strongest men and draws {{their heads to}} women's breasts.|$|R
