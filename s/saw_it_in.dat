As a result, gold miners {{eventually}} reached the area in the 1870s-1890s, searching for resources and rich land.

5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> about 1790.|$|E
5|$|The 1863 Salon des Refusés was {{the same}} {{exhibition}} where Édouard Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe caused a scandal, yet the attention given to Whistler's White Girl was even greater. The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel L'Œuvre (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. It was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.|$|E

5|$|The {{deployment}} {{plan for}} 2nd Army Group saw the 1st Army in the Bačka region between the Danube and the Tisza, with formations centred around {{the towns of}} Sombor, Bačka Topola and Senta, with the 3rd Cavalry Division held in depth, south of the Danube in the Fruška Gora region. The 2nd Army deployment plan <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Baranya and Slavonia regions between Slatina and the Danube, with its formations positioned south of the Drava from just east of Slatina to Valpovo, and around the towns of Osijek and Vinkovci. Of the formations of the 2nd Army Group, two infantry divisions of the 2nd Army were partly mobilised, while the remaining two infantry divisions, the 3rd Cavalry Division, and the two brigade-strength infantry detachments had only commenced mobilisation. To {{the right of the}} 1st Army Group was the 6th Army, an independent formation that was responsible for the defence of the Yugoslav Banat region east of the Tisza. The boundary with the 6th Army ran just to the east of the Tisza to the confluence with the Danube, then south across the Sava through Obrenovac. On the left flank of the 2nd Army Group was the 1st Army Group, which was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia, along the Yugoslav–Hungarian west of Slatina, Yugoslav–Reich and Yugoslav–Italian borders. The army group boundary ran from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka.|$|E

25|$|Tjalie Robinson {{developed}} a life philosophy that evolves around {{the nature of}} the Hunt, regularly writing about the practice of hunting as a parable for 'real' and 'truthful' living as he <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> his stories the Hunt often returns as a theme to intellectually explore 'dangerous' and 'courageous' life and particularly to depict the life and culture of Indos.

25|$|The Cisco Kid is {{a half-hour}} American Western {{television}} series starring Duncan Renaldo {{in the title}} role, The Cisco Kid, and Leo Carrillo as the jovial sidekick, Pancho. Cisco and Pancho were technically desperados, wanted for unspecified crimes, but instead viewed by the poor as Robin Hood figures who assisted the downtrodden when law enforcement officers proved corrupt or unwilling to help. It {{was also the first}} television series to be filmed in color, although few viewers <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> color until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Werner Heisenberg {{considered}} the question further. He saw the duality as present for all quantic entities, {{but not quite}} in the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr. He <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> what is called second quantization, which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space-time, causality still being visualizable. Classical field values (e.g. the electric and magnetic field strengths of Maxwell) are replaced by an entirely new kind of field value, as considered in quantum field theory. Turning the reasoning around, ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized consequence of quantum field theory.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} at Glemham, Crabbe {{composed}} several novels, none of which were published. After Glemham, Crabbe moved {{to the village of}} Rendham in Suffolk, where he stayed until 1805. His poem The Parish Register was all but completed while at Rendham, and The Borough was also begun. 1805 was the last year of Crabbe's stay in Suffolk, and it was made memorable in literature by the appearance of the Lay of the Last Minstrel by Walter Scott. Crabbe first <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a bookseller's shop in Ipswich, read it nearly through while standing at the counter, and pronounced that a new and great poet had appeared. In October 1805, Crabbe returned {{with his wife and two}} sons to the parsonage at Muston. He had been absent for nearly 13 years, of which four had been spent at Parham, five at Great Glemham, and four at Rendham.|$|E
25|$|Rusk first climbed Mount Stuart in 1920. When {{he first}} <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1894, Rusk desired to climb it; however, other matters, {{including}} the McKinley expedition, {{prevented him from}} climbing it. That same year, 1920, the Cascadians mountaineering club was formed and with Rusk as a leading member, they decided that a record box {{should be taken to}} the summit. Rusk climbed Stuart with Rolfe Morse Whitnall in July and although Whitnall was unable to make the summit, Rusk was successful and placed the record box on the summit. Their success inspired the club to send another party later that year on Labor Day. This party consisted of Clarence Truitt, Harold Carey, Vern Mason, Joseph R. Vincent, Rolland Whitmore, Wayne E. and Fern Richardson, Rolfe and Alice Whitnall, and Rusk. The whole party made the summit, even though they had some close calls and were forced to bivouac part of the way down the mountain. Rusk climbed Stuart again the next year with Wayne Richardson, Truitt, Rolfe Whitnall, Max Hiscock, and Jimmie Frisque. That year, they climbed earlier in the season, the 29th of May, than any party before and many thought that there was still too much snow to climb at that time in the season. All but Whitnall made the summit. Rusk led another much larger party up Stuart on May 29, 1922.|$|E
