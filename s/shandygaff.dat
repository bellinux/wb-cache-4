60|$|There {{would always}} be weighty {{enquiries}} {{as to what they}} could have, and it would work out always at cold beef and pickles, or fried ham and eggs and <b>shandygaff,</b> two pints of beer and two bottles of ginger beer foaming in a huge round-bellied jug.|$|E
60|$|Miss Blossom, almost unbecomingly {{brilliant}} in her complexion, {{did as she}} was asked. Batsy had cold chicken, new potatoes, green peas, and two helpings of apricot tart. Tommy devoted {{himself to}} cutlets. A very mild <b>shandygaff</b> was compounded for him in an old Oriel pewter. Both children made love to Miss Blossom with their eyes. It {{was not at all}} what Merton felt inclined to do; the lady had entangled him in a labyrinth of puzzledom.|$|E
60|$|In the market-place at Santa Fé, in Mexico, peasant {{women from}} the {{neighbouring}} villages bring in for sale trayfuls of living ants, each about as big and round as a large white currant, and each entirely filled with honey or grape sugar, much appreciated by the ingenuous Mexican youth as an excellent substitute for Everton toffee. The method of eating them would hardly command the approbation of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It is simple and primitive, but decidedly not humane. Ingenuous youth holds the ant by its head and shoulders, sucks out the honey with which the back part is absurdly distended, and throws away the empty body as a thing with which it has now no further sympathy. Maturer age buys the ants by the quart, presses out the honey through a muslin strainer, and manufactures it into a very sweet intoxicating drink, something like <b>shandygaff,</b> as I am credibly informed by bold persons who have ventured to experiment upon it, taken internally.|$|E
60|$|Another {{class of}} modern painter {{is even more}} disappointing. He is {{extremely}} neat and smooth in his appearance, and dresses in {{the height of the}} most quiet fashion. His voice is low and soft, and he never (like the artist of fiction) employs that English word whereby the Royalist sailor was recognized when, attired as a Portuguee, he tried to blow up one of the ships of Admiral Blake. This new kind of artist avoids studio slang as much as he does long hair and red waistcoats. He might be a young barrister, only he is more polished; or a young doctor, only he is more urbane. No doubt there exist men of the ancient species--rough-and- ready men as strong as bargees, given to much tobacco, amateurs of porter or <b>shandygaff,</b> great hunters of the picturesque, such wild folk as Thackeray knew and Mr. Charles Keene occasionally caricatures. These are the artists whom young ladies want to see, but they are not in great force on Show Sunday. They rather look on that festival as a day of national mourning and humiliation and woe. They do not care to have all Belgravia or South Kensington let loose in their places. They do not wish the public to gaze and simper at pieces which will probably be enskied or rejected, or hung at a dangerous corner next a popular picture.|$|E
6000|$|The answer of {{the specialists}} {{is the one}} already alluded to: that the attack on {{marriage}} is an attack on property; so that Shelley was something more hateful to a husband than a horse thief: to wit, a wife thief, and something more hateful to a wife than a burglar: namely, one who would steal her husband's house from over her head, and leave her destitute and nameless on the streets. Now, no doubt this accounts for {{a good deal of}} anti-Shelleyan prejudice: a prejudice so deeply rooted in our habits that, as I have shewn in my play, men who are bolder freethinkers than Shelley himself can no more bring themselves to commit adultery than to commit any common theft, whilst women who loathe sex slavery more fiercely than Mary Wollstonecraft are unable to face the insecurity and discredit of the vagabondage which is the masterless woman's only alternative to celibacy. But in spite of all this there is a revolt against marriage which has spread so rapidly within my recollection that though we all still assume the existence of a huge and dangerous majority which regards the least hint of scepticism as to the beauty and holiness of marriage as infamous and abhorrent, I sometimes wonder why it is so difficult to find an authentic living member of this dreaded army of convention outside the ranks of the people who never think about public questions at all, and who, for all their numerical weight and apparently invincible prejudices, accept social changes to-day as tamely as their forefathers accepted the Reformation under Henry and Edward, the Restoration under Mary, and, after Mary's death, the <b>shandygaff</b> which Elizabeth compounded from both doctrines and called the Articles of the Church of England. If matters were left to these simple folk, there would never be any changes at all; and society would perish like a snake that could not cast its skins. Nevertheless the snake does change its skin in spite of them; and there are signs that our marriage-law skin is causing discomfort to thoughtful people and will presently be cast whether the others are satisfied with it or not. The question therefore arises: What is there in marriage that makes the thoughtful people so uncomfortable? ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>shandygaff</b> is {{an older}} British name for beer mixed with ginger beer or ginger ale; the {{earliest}} written {{record of the}} word dates back to 1853. [...] In H. G. Wells’ comic novel The History of Mr. Polly, Wells refers to <b>shandygaff</b> as [...] "two bottles of beer mixed with ginger beer in a round-bellied jug".|$|E

5000|$|In his reminiscences {{interviews}} Mr. Justice Harding revealed {{several other}} pastimes that he enjoyed besides writing and boxing. [...] "A {{great source of}} amusement during my spare hours was archery. He {{was a member of}} the Royal Toxophilite Society, which had grounds in Regent Park in London (tennis courts occupy the site today). Harding and his friends wore traditional cut, green coats, white waistcoats, green caps and brass buttons with the motto [...] "Centurm Pete."(Aim at a certain end). The losers paid for the brew of <b>shandygaff</b> that they drank throughout the game.|$|E
