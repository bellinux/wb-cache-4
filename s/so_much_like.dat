25|$|Before his death, Ralph Quarles {{arranged}} for his Quaker friend William Gooch {{to be made}} guardian of his children. As requested by Quarles, after the parents both died in 1833 when John Langston was four, Gooch moved with the boys and their half-brother William Langston to Chillicothe, Ohio, in a free state. Their father had left his natural sons substantial inheritances that provided for their education and, as adults, enabled them to work for political reform. The oldest brother, Gideon Quarles, looked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> his father that at age 21 he took the Quarles surname.|$|E
25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|One Christmas was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> another, {{in those}} years, around the sea-town corner now, {{and out of}} all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E

500|$|Wales {{has many}} waterfalls, {{including}} some of the most striking in the United Kingdom. One such is the [...] Pistyll Rhaeadr near the village of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. It is formed as a mountain stream drops over a cliff and changes character to a lowland river, the Afon Rhaeadr. The site has been designated by the Countryside Council for Wales as the 1000th Site of Special Scientific Interest in Wales, because of its importance to an understanding of Welsh geomorphology. The 19th-century English author George Borrow remarked of the waterfall, [...] "I never saw water falling so gracefully, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> thin, beautiful threads, as here." ...|$|E
500|$|Bikinis can {{and have}} been made out of almost every {{possible}} clothing material, and the fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are {{an essential element of}} their design. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey. DuPont's introduction of Lycra (spandex) in the 1960s completely changed how bikinis were designed and worn, as according to Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of The Bikini Book, [...] "the advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini...it didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> lingerie anymore." [...] Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Schan is {{the only}} artist named by Gessner; he painted most of the bird {{illustrations}} for his bird volume, together by Gessner's account with some descriptive text. The illustrations (not all by Schan) were <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>liked</b> that they were brought out in a volume of their own in 1560, Icones Animalium. Authors such as Ilaria Mazzoleni state without evidence that Schan made most of the illustrations of animals throughout the Historia. Springer and Kinzelbach provide a slightly different quote from Gessner praising Schan: ...|$|R
500|$|... "Move" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Allmusic reviewer Jared Johnson {{called the}} song [...] "as relevant as anything MercyMe have ever done". Roger Gelwicks of Jesus Freak Hideout described [...] "Move" [...] as [...] "an upbeat rocker complete with an infectious handclap beat". Andy Argyrakis of Today's Christian Music described the song as [...] "foot stomping", and Kevin Davis of Christian Music Review {{commented that the}} song [...] "has a fantastic rock-dance arrangement like 'This Love' by Maroon 5". Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger was more negative in his review, commenting that the song [...] "sounds <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> Maroon 5 that it’s almost embarrassing", and that [...] "in a music industry governed by sanity, the two songwriters [...] would sing shoulder to shoulder and reach a common audience".|$|E
500|$|Stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras complemented the {{adolescent}} boutique fashions of the 1960s, allowing those to be minimal. DuPont introduced lycra (DuPont's name for spandex) {{in the same}} decade. [...] Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits {{could be made to}} fit like a second skin without heavy linings. [...] "The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini," [...] wrote Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of The Bikini Book, [...] "It didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> lingerie anymore." [...] Increased reliance on stretch fabric led to simplified construction. It allowed designers to create the string bikini, and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini. Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early '70s.|$|E
500|$|... "At My Most Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} as a [...] "gift" [...] from Stipe to his bandmates, to indulge their fondness of Pet Sounds. Commenting on the song's musical {{similarities}} {{to the work}} of the Beach Boys in his book Inside Classic Rock Tracks, Rikki Rooksby wrote that [...] "At My Most Beautiful" [...] was [...] "a tribute to that sound, at once conveying something of R.E.M. and Brian Wilson. In other words, it's not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> The Beach Boys that it's a pastiche, but sufficiently like them to be a musical homage." [...] He states that the song's use of an F chord with an A bass note in the verse follows the example of Brian Wilson's use of inversions on his band's Pet Sounds album, and that the cellos at the end heightens the section's resemblance to the Beach Boys' [...] "Good Vibrations".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I've {{heard on}} it," [...] cried Dick; [...] "Miss Durant--Katie, they calls her--she's agoin' to be spliced {{to the young}} doctor that was wrecked in the Wellington.

5000|$|Initially, {{he was one}} of {{a number}} of experts {{answering}} viewers' questions, but his manner, both magisterial and welcoming, was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>liked</b> he was given his own spot on About the Home in 1956, showing Joan Gilbert how to put up shelves or make a tool box. A generation of women who had worked in wartime factories or served in the forces appreciated Bucknell's humorous and uncondescending manner over jobs that, before the war, were regarded as [...] "not for women". Male viewers learned how to save face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you know," [...] {{observed}} Gildart in a {{burst of}} reckless humour, [...] "we could not get on very well, Miss Stuart, without some sorts of details.

500|$|Fiennes {{was cast}} as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his {{performances}} in [...] and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that [...] "I saw sexual evil. It {{is all about}} subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold." [...] Fiennes put on [...] to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said [...] "I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to." [...] Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth's character in the film as a classic psychopath. Fiennes looked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg (a survivor of the events) met him, she trembled with fear.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew felt that the costume and make-up artists {{did a good job}} with Albert Welling, as he looked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> Hitler it was a [...] "surreal" [...] experience. Ella Kenion, who plays Harriet in this episode, later {{appeared}} in the Fourth Doctor audio drama The Wrath of the Iceni where she played Boudica. Darvill was pleased that his character, Rory, was more of an [...] "action hero" [...] in the episode. Before broadcast, Smith stated that it was [...] "maybe [...] favorite episode to date...it just rockets along". Smith's Doctor debuted his secondary jacket, a long dark-green military overcoat, {{for the first time in}} this episode. In an interview for the previous series concerning the Eleventh Doctor's costume, executive producer Piers Wenger said, [...] "I think he'd really like to evolve it next series. He's really keen to have a coat." [...] Smith explained that he wanted a coat because of the cold weather.|$|E
500|$|Darabont wrote a 60-page pilot {{script for}} [...] "Days Gone Bye". His initial script for the episode was split {{in half and}} embellished. Darabont {{explained}} that he did this to [...] "slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation." [...] Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene. Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation. It's extremely faithful. There {{are things that are}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> the comic, I can't really remember the nuance of what's different and what's not from the comic. He's definitely being more faithful than I expected, and everything that he's changing is brilliant. I couldn't be happier. I think the fans of the book are going to just love it." [...] The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in April 1996 to positive reviews. Mark Deming of Allmusic called it a [...] "superb debut" [...] and wrote, [...] "Welch's debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family." [...] Bill Friskics-Warren of No Depression praised the album as [...] "breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture". The Arlington Heights, Illinois Daily Heralds Mark Guarino observed that Revival was [...] "cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> that era." [...] He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals. Ann Powers of Rolling Stone gave Revival a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and [...] "manufacturing emotion." [...] Robert Christgau echoed Powers: Welch [...] "just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off." [...] Revival was nominated for the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, but lost to Bruce Springsteen's The Ghost of Tom Joad.|$|E
500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, [...] " [...] rather aggravating to watch at times, but {{seems to have no}} problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{received}} his breakthrough role in 1998 {{when he was}} cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. [...] "At {{the end of the}} audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just to let you know, you never have to be more gay than that.'" [...] He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6million American viewers. Will & Grace quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will's best friend Grace Adler) worked [...] "nicely" [...] together. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". For this performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} of the New Zealand Wars, the British Army used Congreve rockets to attack Māori fortifications - along with cannon fire - and found that simple trench-warfare {{practices}} were sufficient to blunt their effectiveness <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that, <b>like</b> cannon, they were virtually useless.|$|R

5000|$|This body {{of water}} bore the Ojibwe name Gaa-zaasaagijiwegamaag (recorded as [...] "kazazeekeege waigamag") meaning [...] "the high lake that is always overflowing", but a Scotsman of the North West Company thought it <b>so</b> <b>much</b> looked <b>like</b> the {{original}} Loch Lomond that he named it as such.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] was generally positive with many journalists comparing the song {{to the work}} of other groups. Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as [...] "Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension" [...] and went on to ask [...] "who said there was anything wrong with that?" [...] in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the [...] "Status Quo-ish title track". Q described the track as [...] "excellent" [...] while PopMatters claimed the song [...] "sounds <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album" [...] and the Dallas Observer stated that [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] is a [...] "Beach Boys/Beatles/ELO homage as fine as the '70s heyday of Roy Wood's Wizzard or very early Cheap Trick".Pitchfork Media stated that the song [...] "takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details" [...] while Uncut described the track as [...] "tooled up rock 'n' roll modelled on [...] "Surfin' USA". The Guardian claimed the song's lyrics tackle environmental issues with a [...] "sharp wit" [...] while Drowned in Sound saw them as evidence that chief songwriter Gruff Rhys was [...] "taking his lyrics a little bit more seriously". The song was placed at number 21 in the 2001 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] appeared on the soundtrack to the 2001 film Me Without You.|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not {{have a problem with it}} and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have. We can show the audience part of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{critical}} response towards Aurora {{was generally}} unfavorable. During the 1950s, Disney received [...] "harsh criticism" [...] for depicting both Cinderella and Aurora as [...] "naïve and malleable" [...] characters, {{and failing to}} acknowledge {{the ways in which}} women's roles in society had evolved since Snow White's debut in 1937. Critics agree that Aurora represents [...] "the classic damsel in distress" [...] by being depicted as a beautiful young woman who is rescued by a stranger. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the character was too similar to Snow White, writing, [...] "The princess looks <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> Snow White they could be a couple of Miss Rheingolds separated by three or four years." [...] Time Out dismissed Aurora as a [...] "delicate" [...] and [...] "vapid" [...] character. Bustle's Mary Grace Garis wrote that the character [...] "suffers from having very little definable personality and ... serious Damsel-in-Distress syndrome". Sonia Saraiya of Jezebel echoed this sentiment, criticizing Aurora for lacking [...] "interesting qualities"; Saraiya also ranked Aurora Disney's least feminist princess. Similarly, Bustle also ranked Aurora the least feminist Disney Princess, with author Chelsea Mize expounding, [...] "Aurora literally sleeps for like three quarters of the movie ... Aurora just straight-up has no agency, and really isn't doing {{much in the way of}} feminine progress." [...] Dismissing the character as [...] "barely more than a cipher", Leigh Butler of Tor.com panned Aurora as [...] "a Barbie doll knockoff who does nothing the whole film but sing wistfully about Finding Her Man, before becoming the ultimate passive Damsel in Distress". However, Butler went on to defend the character somewhat, writing, [...] "Aurora’s cipher-ness in Sleeping Beauty would be infuriating if she were the only female character in it, but the presence of the Fairies and Maleficent allow her to be what she is without it being a subconscious statement on what all women are." [...] Similarly, Refinery29 ranked Aurora the fourth most feminist Disney Princess because [...] "Her aunts have essentially raised her in a place where women run the game." ...|$|E
