5|$|NIST {{found that}} the {{fireproofing}} on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing. A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have <b>softened</b> <b>and</b> weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E

After more than a year in prison, the public mood had <b>softened,</b> <b>and</b> he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was <b>softened</b> <b>and</b> loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} including pipe corrosion, scaling and microbial growth, which severely threat safe op-eration of circulating cooling water system, this paper proposes ion exchange <b>softening</b> <b>and</b> alkalization process {{to solve the}}se problems and carries out a series of studies to study the feasibility of ion exchange <b>softening</b> <b>and</b> alkaliza-tion process in the simulation process of circulating cooling water system. The studies include product water quality of ion exchange <b>softening</b> <b>and</b> alkalization process, effect on the performance of carbon steel and brass, and the inhibition that suppresses microbial growth. The results indicate that ion exchange <b>softening</b> <b>and</b> alkalization process is feasible to prevent the circulating cooling water system from scaling, pipe corrosion, and microbial growth without any other chemicals. Thus circulating cooling water system can achieve zerodischarge of wastewater...|$|R

25|$|In the 1830s rolled T-shaped (or single-flanged T {{parallel}} rail) and I-shaped (or double-flanged T parallel or bullhead) rails were introduced; both required cast-iron {{chairs to}} support them. Originally, iron keys {{were used to}} wedge the rail into the vertical parallel jaws of the chair; these were superseded by entirely wooden keys. The wooden keys were formed from oak, steam <b>softened</b> <b>and</b> then compressed with hydraulic presses and stored in a drying house. When inserted into the chair, exposure to the wet atmosphere caused the key to expand, firmly holding the rail. The wedge {{may be on the}} inside or outside of the rail. In Britain they were usually on the outside.|$|E

The character gradually <b>softened,</b> <b>and</b> Akingbola portrays him as being fundamentally good-hearted. Malick is gay; he develops a rivalry with orthopaedic surgeon Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill), who later kisses him during a fight. His alpha male characterisation has attracted critical praise, while his pairing with Dan received a more mixed response, including viewer complaints about the kiss.|$|E
25|$|The first {{physical}} sign {{of puberty}} in girls {{is usually a}} firm, tender lump under {{the center of the}} areola of one or both breasts, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age. This is referred to as thelarche. By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within six to 12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, <b>softened,</b> <b>and</b> can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and nipples forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.|$|E

25|$|In the mid 19th century Brympton d'Evercy was {{the home}} of Lady Georgiana Fane, a single lady of modest means who had no need of a large and lavish household. Thus the house was not given the Victorian wings given so {{carelessly}} to so many of Britain's historic houses. Lady Georgiana confined herself to improvements in the gardens and grounds. She added a balustrade to the walls enclosing the forecourt {{in front of the}} west facade; the walls, topped by balustrading, link the priest house, churchyard on the south side, and clock-tower and stables on the north. The effect was to create what in a grander house than Brympton d'Evercy would be known as a cour d'honneur. Entered through great gate piers crowned by urns (see illustration top of page) the cour d'honneur effect is <b>softened,</b> <b>and</b> de-formalised by lawns and some very English style flower beds. The broad gravel terrace along {{the full extent of the}} south front was also created at this time, along with the large pond which reflects it. Other than necessary restoration work, and installation of modern plumbing and electricity, little has been added to the house since the 19th century. It is now recognised by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E
25|$|MacMahon, who was {{a fellow}} Foreign Legion Officer and had served in many campaigns {{alongside}} Bazaine, was visibly disgusted when he received {{the news of the}} Court's decision and was incensed by their attempt to pass responsibility to him. The government wanted to banish Bazaine for life; MacMahon first proposed life imprisonment, though he <b>softened</b> <b>and</b> commuted the punishment of death to twenty years' imprisonment and remitted the disgrace of the formalities of a military degradation. Bazaine wrote to thank his fellow legionnaire, though he added, tongue in cheek, that he might have let his feelings run away with him. It was an academic concession for a man nearing sixty-three. Bazaine was incarcerated on the Île Sainte-Marguerite and treated rather as an exile than as a convict. During the night of 10 August 1874, using parcel rope supplied by Angelo Hayter, (son of the Court Painter Sir George Hayter) and baggage straps which he knotted into a rope, the 63-year-old Marshal attached one end to his body and tied the other end to a gargoyle and climbed down the 300 foot cliffs to a boat which his wife had brought out from Cannes. They sailed to Genoa in Italy, and from there Bazaine came to London with his young family where he stayed for a time with his Hayter relations.|$|E
500|$|Forty years later, {{when the}} centenary of Lincoln's birth was celebrated in 1909, a border state {{official}} reflected on Booth's assassination of Lincoln. [...] "Confederate veterans held public services and gave public expression to the sentiment, that 'had Lincoln lived' {{the days of}} reconstruction might have been <b>softened</b> <b>and</b> the era of good feeling ushered in earlier". The majority of Northerners viewed Booth as a madman or monster who murdered the savior of the Union, while in the South, many cursed Booth for bringing upon them the harsh revenge of an incensed North instead of the reconciliation promised by Lincoln. A century later, Goodrich concluded in 2005, [...] "For millions of people, particularly in the South, it would be decades before {{the impact of the}} Lincoln assassination began to release its terrible hold on their lives".|$|E

500|$|With rehearsals due {{to begin}} in October 1873, Bizet began {{composing}} in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more. At that point, according to Bizet's biographer Winton Dean, [...] "some hitch at the Opéra-Comique intervened", and the project was suspended for a while. One reason for the delay {{may have been the}} difficulties in finding a singer for the title role. Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre, Camille du Locle and Adolphe de Leuven, over the advisability of staging the work. De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqué a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure that audiences would be frightened away. He was assured by Halévy that the story would be toned down, that Carmen's character would be <b>softened,</b> <b>and</b> offset by Micaëla, described by Halévy as [...] "a very innocent, very chaste young girl". Furthermore, the gypsies would be presented as comic characters, and Carmen's death would be overshadowed at the end by [...] "triumphal processions, ballets and joyous fanfares". De Leuven reluctantly agreed, but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 21 cases {{diagnosed}} as "cerebral embolism" at autopsy (<b>softening</b> 9 <b>and</b> hemorrhage 12 cases, having endocarditis or sepsis) were studied {{in detail in}} an attempt to clarify the mechanism of <b>softening</b> <b>and</b> hemorrhage. According to the result obtained, mechanical obstruction of an artery by an embolus is not always the cause of "embolic softening", and the "embolic hemorrhage" is not diapedetic, but principally rhexis-bleeding. In both <b>softening</b> <b>and</b> hemorrhage, the chief role is played by some inflammatory agents carried from the heart to the meningeal and/or intracerebral artery and inciding a localized arteritis. When the arteritis undergoes a proliferative or thrombus-forming process, stenosis or obstruction of the vessel <b>and</b> <b>softening</b> occurs, whereas when it undergoes a exsudative or destructive process, rupture and hemorrhage occurs...|$|R
