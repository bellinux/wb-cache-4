50|$|OMA DRM version 1.0 {{was first}} drafted in November 2002, and {{approved}} in June 2004. It provides basic Digital Rights Management, without strong protection. The standard specifies three main methods: Forward Lock, Combined Delivery (combined rights object / media object), and <b>Separate</b> <b>Delivery</b> (separated rights object + encrypted media object). Forward Lock prevents the user from forwarding content such as ringtones and wallpapers on their phone.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1904, eight short open tram trailer cars {{were added to the}} fleet. They rapidly came to enjoy great popularity. Unexpectedly, damage to the chassis frame {{occurred}} on two of the motor tramcars used to haul the open trailers, which operated mostly on line I. The damage was obviously caused by the Demerbe rails used on that line, and the SSB was forced to replace the two tramcars much earlier than planned. At the end of 1905 came the first six axle enclosed tram trailer. Between 1906 and 1914, 29 two-axle motor tramcars were commissioned in a number of <b>separate</b> <b>deliveries.</b> These new tramcars were stronger than their predecessors and were also no longer asymmetrical.|$|R
50|$|On March 23, 1940, Parks and Carney {{sold the}} American and the Times Record to 33-year-old Donald W. Reynolds, {{owner of the}} Okmulgee (Okla.) Daily Times. His {{purchase}} of the Times Record and American marked {{the start of the}} Donrey Media Group. In 1969, Donrey halted <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of the afternoon Times Record and morning American, merging the papers into a single seven-day morning paper under the Southwest Times Record name. It has published daily under that moniker since.|$|E
5000|$|The name Link {{refers to}} the {{environmental}} claims made by Denby over {{the advantages of the}} vehicle over standard lorries. According to Denby Transport, the Eco-Link Trailer would [...] "reduce road accidents and result in less road deaths", [...] "reduce all emissions", and [...] "needs no highway investment". Further, it asserts that two Eco-Links would replace three standard articulated lorries. In 2007 figures, the Eco-Link costs £85,000 to build. In logistics terms, unlike a drawbar lorry combination, a B-Double arrangement allows the <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of either trailer by the tractor to a destination.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, {{following}} {{purchase of}} the site, Patrick Corbett and his son Michael erect their new masonry premises. Architect RS (Robin) Dods (1868-1920) {{was to make the}} most of the sloping corner site. Although single storied, the height of the parapet and the simple bold enrichment of red brickwork relieved with bands of white brickwork (now obscured by paint) and cement dressings enabled the building to robustly address Brunswick and Jane Streets, as well as its nearby more substantial neighbours. The main entrance of the new shop was from the corner, a secondary door from Brunswick Street provided access to the basement level via an internal staircase. The shopfront was constructed to provide a generous display area as well as ventilation and light to the lower floor (via the setback of the floor). A <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> entrance to the upper floor was located on Robertson Street via sliding timber doors.|$|E

40|$|Student {{engagement}} in their courses {{has been demonstrated}} {{to be related to}} positive leaming outcomes. Engaging students is particularly important in entrepreneurship education because of the complexity of entrepreneurship as an activity and field of study. Team-Based Leaming has been identified as an effective teaching method for engaging students with course content in a range of fields of study. This paper describes the application of concept mapping as a research method to identify what undergraduate students understand to be engagement with the Team-Based Learning method in an entrepreneurship foundation course. This research identified themes of engagement across tlu·ee <b>separate</b> <b>deliveries</b> of this course that were largely cognitive, and were generally in accordance with the dimensions of engagement employed in questionnaires used to measure engagement at the institutional and classroom level. The results have value in helping educators to fmiher refine the effectiveness of this pmticular teaching method. The results also suggest areas for further research. ...|$|R

5000|$|The News {{was founded}} in 1866 as a morning newspaper, while The Daily Advance {{was founded in}} 1880 as an evening newspaper. In 1888, future U. S. Senator Carter Glass bought The News. In 1893, he bought The Daily Advance and merged its {{business}} operations with The News, with news and opinion operations remaining separate. The Glass family continued to publish both papers (The News, every morning; The Daily Advance, weekday afternoons) until 1979, when the papers were purchased by Worrell Newspapers Inc., which began publishing a merged edition, The News & Daily Advance, on weekends and holidays, with separate volume and edition numbers. In 1986, <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of the News and Daily Advance was ended, replaced by a seven-day morning paper, The News & Daily Advance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new, ¨hybrid deposit ¨model for low overhead communication wherein the sender directly deposits messages into the destination user-level memory. The destination address {{is a function}} of both sender state and destination state. The motivation is to increase the sender´s role in communication in order to simplify the destination´s role and thus enable fast, low-cost communication interfaces. The model <b>separates</b> data <b>delivery</b> from synchronization so as to enable the optimization of simple data delivery while leaving more difficult synchronization to other mechanisms. With hardware support, the hybrid deposit model looks promising for applications in parallel, distributed, and real-time computing...|$|R
50|$|A {{large part}} of {{speaking}} correct Latin is, for Crassus, dependent on pronunciation. He chooses {{to make a point}} that this is <b>separate</b> from <b>delivery,</b> which occurs later in the book, and is actually an integral aspect of language. He uses Lucius Cotta as an example of someone with an affected accent, while he suggests that Catulus’ is more natural, due in part that he is from Rome. The Roman accent is one that has “nothing unpleasant, nothing to provoke criticism, and nothing to sound or smell of foreignness.” On clarity, Crassus’ advice revolves around the idea of simplicity, and of not trying to obscure the truth through unnecessary complexities: i.e. ambiguity, excessive length, and confusion of order.|$|R

40|$|Clonal {{expansion}} of naive CD 4 T cells {{is a necessary}} step in most adaptive immune responses. Two distinct signals are required for clonal expansion to occur, ligation of T-cell receptors by an antigenic peptide bound to self major histocompatibility complex-encoded class II molecules (signal 1) and a costimulatory signal derived from an antigen-presenting cell (signal 2). To study whether these two signals need to be delivered by a single cell in order to induce clonal {{expansion of}} normal CD 4 T cells, we have used anti-CD 3 bound to Fc receptors as a ligand for the T-cell receptor to deliver signal 1 to all CD 4 T cells, and we have inactivated signal 2 with a newly generated monoclonal antibody or by using Fc receptor-positive cells that lack the costimulator. Costimulation was delivered by cells whose Fc receptors were blocked with anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody. Our results indicate that delivery of ligand and costimulator on one cell is at least 30 -fold more efficient than <b>separate</b> <b>delivery.</b> No significant clonal expansion was observed when signals 1 and 2 were delivered by different cells. We have also carried out experiments using fibroblast transfectants that can deliver either or both of these two signals. These studies show that <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of these two signals is at least 80 -fold less efficient than their combined delivery by one cell. These findings may explain why tissues can express autoantigens and contain active antigen-presenting cells without inducing autoimmunity...|$|E
40|$|Internet {{is broken}} {{and there are}} several {{approaches}} to fix it. In order to validate the different attempts, they need to be evaluated within large-scale environments involving numerous heterogeneous resources. As a result, several testbeds have been established along with a number of competitive mechanisms to federate them. Since most of these protocols try to address similar issues, combining and unifying them is subject of current research. This leads to a complex environment for testbed owners and developers. Furthermore, it is foreseeable that even more federation approaches in different application domains will emerge in the future. Therefore, we propose an extensible architecture that allows to be federation protocol agnostic. The fundamental idea is to allow interoperability on the level of a semantic information model and to <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> mechanism specific implementations from a common core. The requirements for such an architecture have been extracted from latest European Future Internet research projects and its practicability is being evaluated by an initial implementation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicrobial {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (HSPs) have {{been implicated in}} the induction of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. We now show that human dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with peptide-loaded mycobacterial HSP 70 complexes generate potent antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses, which are dependent on an HSP 70 -stimulated calcium signaling cascade. From the calculated peptide binding affinity of mycobacterial HSP 70 (KD = 14 μM) we show that 120 pM HSP 70 bound peptide is sufficient to generate a peptide-specific CTL response that is up to four orders of magnitude more efficient than peptide alone. The minimal 136 amino acid, mycobacterial HSP 70 peptide binding domain can generate CTL responses, and a single amino acid mutant HSP 70 designed to prevent peptide binding but retain stimulatory capacity has allowed us to <b>separate</b> antigen <b>delivery</b> from DC immunostimulation...|$|R
40|$|Cooperating proxy caches are {{groups of}} HTTP proxy servers that {{organize}} to share cached objects. This paper develops analytical models for proxy cooperation based on speedup in user response time. Speedup expressions are derived for the cooperation upper bound, a proxy mesh, and a three-level proxy hierarchy. The equations allow comparisons of fundamental design choices by <b>separating</b> the <b>delivery</b> organization from the discovery mechanism. For the mesh and hierarchy models, the discovery mechanisms include ideal discovery, ICP query, and distributed metadata directories. Equations are evaluated using parameter estimates from experiments and cache trace analysis. Results indicate that proxy cooperation is marginally viable {{from the standpoint}} of average user response time, and that the miss penalty for the hierarchy renders it less viable than the mesh. Proxy cooperation can, however, reduce the variability in user response time and the number of long delays. A trace-driven simulation shows that caching constraints have little effect on cooperation performance due to request filtering by lower level caches...|$|R
40|$|The CIHRs have {{a mandate}} to support &quot;cooperative, {{collaborative}} research ventures involving researchers working in different fields and {{in different parts of}} the country, &quot; and hope to transform health research from an enterprise dispersed across individuals and disciplines, <b>separated</b> from <b>delivery,</b> and characterized by multiple agendas into an enterprise integrated across geographical, institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We believe that this mandate would be properly met, in part, by the formation of a transdisciplinary group devoted to Consciousness, Health and Well-Being. We therefore address the following five fundamental issues in this proposal: 1. Why should human consciousness (HC) be given priority as a primary focus of investigation? 2. How are consciousness, health and well-being related? 3. Why is it appropriate to consider consciousness and its relationship to health and well-being from a transdisciplinary perspective? 4. Why do we need a specific organized network to foster and publicize these investigations? 5. How should this network be structured to meet its stated ends...|$|R
40|$|Mobile TV {{services}} {{are available in}} {{an increasing number of}} countries. For cost reasons, most of these services offer material directly recoded for mobile consumption (i. e. without additional editing). This paper reports the findings of a study on the influence of text legibility and quality on the perceived video quality of mobile TV content. The study, with 64 participants, examined responses to news footage presented at four image resolutions and seven video encoding bitrates. The results showed that a simulated <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of a news ticker and other textual information significantly increased the perceived video quality of the entire screen for native speakers. In addition, some automatable changes to the layout of news content resulted in substantial increases in perceived video quality. The results can be used to quantify the perceived quality gains when considering text delivery separately from the video stream and in the development of more accurate multimedia quality models...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance and}} economic sustainability of alternative intensified cow-calf production systems, two trials were conducted and a simulation model was built. In experiment 1, a limit-fed total mixed ration (80 % of NRC predicted NEm requirements, 52. 88 mg/kg EBW^ 0. 75) was separated into a roughage and concentrate component where concentrate was fed at - 2, 0, 2 or 12 h after forage delivery to determine effects on nutrient utilization and solid passage rate. Experiment 2 was conducted to compare BW and BCS changes over 112 d of limit-fed production systems, fed either as a total mixed ration (TMR) or as roughage and concentrate components fed separately (SEP), to a conventional hay (HAY) fed system. A simulation model based on a cow-calf enterprise budget was constructed to determine economic viability of the three production systems. Four levels of intake (70, 85, 100, and 115 % of NRC predicted NEm requirements) were compared for the two limit-fed systems, TMR and SEP. Stochastic variables in the model included weaning weights, prices of weaned steers and heifers, and feed ingredient prices. Time of concentrate delivery relative to roughage did not affect DM or OM digestion (P ? 0. 88). Nadir of pH was consistently observed 4 to 8 h after concentrate was delivered, but mean ruminal pH was similar among treatments (P = 0. 22) ranging from 6. 44 to 6. 55 for 2 S and 12 S, respectively. Treatment did not affect final BW (1143 lb; P = 0. 72) or BCS (5. 6; P = 0. 67), but tended to affect final RE (P = 0. 06) with RE of 137. 1, 98. 9 and - 14. 6 Mcal for TMR, SEP, and HAY, respectively. Probability of negative net returns was 0. 35 for HAY, which was slightly less than the probability observed in the TMR at 115 % (0. 37). All other probabilities for negative returns ranged from 0. 13 (SEP 70 %) to 0. 30 (TMR 115 %). Limit-feeding of TMR or <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of forage and concentrate rations sustained cow performance compared to ad libitum hay consumption. Economic analysis suggests limit-feeding cattle is preferred to hay feeding, and that <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of forage and concentrate would be most profitable and least risky...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a low level}} protocol and network interface architecture for low overhead communication in a distributed memory computing environment — such as workstations and PCs connected via a high speed LAN. We use both sender information and destination informa-tion to demultiplex messages directly to where they are needed. The network interface filters incoming messages, <b>separating</b> data <b>delivery</b> from synchronization so as to enable the optimiza-tion of simple data delivery while leaving more difficult synchronization to the host processor. To perform this filtering the interface has a small set of simple operations and {{a small amount of}} state. We have designed an interface architecture called DART which specializes these ideas to ATM networks. We have built an in-kernel software implementation of this interface with stock workstation and ATM interface cards. This implementation currently achieves a best case application to application latency of 24. 5 usec. With a hardware version of DART, we expect to achieve latencies of under 10 usec for a 155 Mbps ATM LAN and under 3 usec for a 622 Mbps ATM LAN in the workstation LAN environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of silica nanoparticles into drug delivery vehicles, and other nanotech platforms, has experienced rapid and significant {{growth over the}} past decade. However, as these nanoparticle-based systems {{become more and more}} complex, the methods used to analyze these systems have evolved at a comparatively much slower pace, resulting in the need for researchers to expand their toolbox and devise new strategies to characterize these materials. This article describes how X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were recently employed in the analysis of two <b>separate</b> drug <b>delivery</b> systems which contain organic compounds covalently attached to the surfaces of silica nanoparticles. These techniques provided a deluge of qualitative and quantitative information about these drug delivery systems, and have several clear advantages over more common characterization procedures such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). Thus, XPS and ToF-SIMS should be an integral component of the standard characterization protocol for any nanoparticle-based assemblies particularly silica-based drug delivery systems-as this field of research continues to develop...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a deeper {{understanding}} of midwives' lived experience of caring during childbirth in a Swedish context. MethodsTen midwives were recruited from one university hospital with two <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> units in western Sweden. Data were collected by both written narratives and interviews. With an inductive approach using a descriptive phenomenological method, the answers to the question: “Can you describe a situation in which you felt that your caring was of importance for the woman and her partner?” were analysed. ResultsA general structure of the phenomenon of caring in midwifery during childbirth, including five key constituents: sharing the responsibility, being intentionally and authentically present, creating an atmosphere of calm serenity in a mutual relationship, possessing the embodied knowledge, and balancing on the borders in transition to parenthood. ConclusionsThis study emphasises how the midwives shared the responsibility and their possessed embodied knowledge of childbirth and how new unique knowledge was constructed together with the woman, child and her partner. The study has the potential to increase knowledge and understanding of midwives' lived experience of caring during childbirth and therefore has implications for practice, education, and research...|$|E
40|$|Large {{epidemiological}} {{studies in the}} last two decades have shown that many people in the community experience mental health and substance use problems in their lifetime and, and they commonly co-occur. Although co-existing mental health and substance use problems are very common, psychological treatments for these problems have traditionally been delivered separately in different services. Consequently, many people with co-existing disorders do not receive adequate treatment, resulting in worse treatment outcomes, including increased rates of relapse, medication use and health care costs. In the longer term, mental health problems (e. g., depression) and substance use problems (e. g., smoking) are themselves associated with increased rates of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancer. There is a life expectancy gap of around 20 years between people living with mental health and substance use problems versus those not experiencing such problems. The first National Mental Health Report Card in Australia in 2012 called the physical health status of people living with a mental health condition a ‘national disgrace’. The report called upon researchers and clinicians to better address the physical health of people with mental health and substance use problems. Despite burgeoning research linking these comorbidities, treatment services remain siloed into <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> systems for mental ill health, substance misuse and physical ill health, and for young people versus adults...|$|E
40|$|Like the cyst {{walls of}} other protists, the spore coat of Dictyostelium discoideum is formed de novo {{to protect the}} {{enclosed}} dormant cell from stress. Spore coat assembly is initiated by exocytosis of protein and polysaccharide precursors at the cell surface, followed by the infusion of nascent cellulose fibrils, resulting in an asymmetrical trilaminar sandwich with cellulose filling the middle layer. A molecular complex consisting of cellulose and two proteins, SP 85 and SP 65, {{is associated with the}} inner and middle layers and is required for proper organization of distinct proteins in the outer layer. Here we show that, unlike SP 85 and other protein precursors, which are stored in prespore vesicles, SP 65 is, like cellulose, synthesized just in time. By tagging the SP 65 locus with green fluorescent protein, we find that SP 65 is delivered to the cell surface via largely distinct vesicles, suggesting that <b>separate</b> <b>delivery</b> of components of the cellulose-SP 85 -SP 65 complex regulates its formation at the cell surface. In support of previous in vivo studies, recombinant SP 65 and SP 85 are shown to interact directly. In addition, truncation of SP 65 causes a defect of the outer layer permeability barrier as seen previously for SP 85 mutants. These observations suggest that assembly of the cellulose-SP 85 -SP 65 triad at the cell surface is biosynthetically regulated both temporally and spatially and that the complex contributes an essential function to outer layer architecture and function...|$|E
