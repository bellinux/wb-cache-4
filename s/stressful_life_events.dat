25|$|Psychological factors, <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events,</b> life transitions, and {{environment}} {{as well as}} often thinking {{in a way that}} exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are also believed {{to play a role in}} the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, major stress, or certain medications. People who tend to take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients also show a much higher rate of panic disorder than the general population.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists have {{examined}} coping {{skills in the}} elderly. Various factors, such as social support, religion and spirituality, active engagement with life and having an {{internal locus of control}} have been proposed as being beneficial in helping people to cope with <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> in later life. Social support and personal control are possibly the two most important factors that predict well-being, morbidity and mortality in adults. Other factors that may link to well-being and quality of life in the elderly include social relationships (possibly relationships with pets as well as humans), and health.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} NDPH is unknown, {{and it may}} have more than one etiology.

25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think {{the way they do}} because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events,</b> and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reported}} that treatment in childhood and in adulthood, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, {{domestic violence and}} bullying, {{has been linked to}} the development of mental disorders, through a complex interaction of societal, family, psychological and biological factors. Negative or <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> more generally have been implicated {{in the development of a}} range of disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders. The main risks appear to be from a cumulative combination of such experiences over time, although exposure to a single major trauma can sometimes lead to psychopathology, including PTSD. Resilience to such experiences varies, and a person may be resistant to some forms of experience but susceptible to others. Features associated with variations in resilience include genetic vulnerability, temperamental characteristics, cognitive set, coping patterns, and other experiences.|$|E

2500|$|The supersensitivity theory {{proposes that}} certain {{individuals}} who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental life events. [...] These interact with <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance abuse may increase it, causing the individual to {{be more likely to}} experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances. [...] These individuals, therefore, are [...] "supersensitive" [...] to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.|$|E
50|$|A third {{example of}} a {{mediating}} variable is an increase of externalizing symptoms. King and Chassin (2008) conducted research examining the relationship between <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> and drug dependence in young adulthood. Their findings identified problematic externalizing behavior on subsequent substance dependency. In other words, <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> are associated with externalizing symptoms, such as aggression or hostility, {{which can lead to}} peer alienation or acceptance by socially deviant peers, which could lead to increased drug use. The relationship between <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> and subsequent drug dependence however exists via the presence of the mediation effects of externalizing behaviors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although {{traditional}} initiation forms {{a pivotal}} part of Xhosa culture, {{it may be}} a <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>event</b> for the individual. In this study, 75 Xhosa males diagnosed with schizophrenia were interviewed to examine their perceptions of the role of initiation in the onset and course of their illness. In all, eight patients (10. 7 %) perceived the initiation rites as a stress-ful event that had triggered the onset of a psychotic episode, and six (8 %) felt it precipitated a relapse. Our findings suggest that initiation rituals may be perceived as a <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>event</b> influencing the onset and course of schizophrenia. This underlines the importance of understanding the cultural background of patients. Key words initiation • onset • psychosis • relapse • schizophrenia • Xhosa Background Initiation rites among the Xhosa people, {{as is the case in}} many cultures, help to establish a link between the initiate and his or her community. This connection between the individual and the broader population is especially important in Xhosa culture, as disconnectedness is feared t...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} migration and residential mobility on union dissolution among married and cohabiting couples.

The nature of union dissolution means {{that at least one}} partner will almost certainly move after the event (Asher and Bloom 1982; Flowerdew and Al-Hamad 2004; Grundy 1985; Sullivan 1986). To date, however, we can fi nd no studies that have mod-eled the infl uence of internal (that is, within-nation) migration and residential mobility on subsequent union dissolution. This lack of previous studies is surprising because there are several reasons to expect that such an infl uence might exist.

50|$|Next {{to genetic}} exposures, {{a wide variety}} of {{environmental}} exposures are being studied as well, such as nutrition,, urbanicity, <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events,</b> and bullying. In contrast to genetic studies, the investigation of environmental exposures of psychiatric problems face the question of reverse causality. E.g., experiencing social stress might cause depression, however, being depressed might also worsen relationships with others and thus cause social stress. Finding an association between the occurrence of an environmental exposure and a disorder could be the result of either or both situations.Multiple strategies exist in psychiatric epidemiology to assess the direction of causality. One possibility is measuring the exposure and outcome multiple times. Researchers can then analyze how much a change in psychiatric symptoms {{can be attributed to the}} exposure at a previous time point, but also whether changes in the exposure can be predicted by previous symptom levels (cross-lagged model). Such a model was e.g. applied to the study of internalizing and externalizing psychological problems and <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events.</b> Both, psychiatric problems as well as life events, were measured multiple times during grade 7,8,9,10 and 12. The researchers observed that <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events</b> precede both internalizing and externalizing psychological problems, but appear to be also the result of experiencing such symptoms. An alternative approach is the use of twin studies, because discordance between monozygotic twins suggests environmental effects.|$|E
5000|$|Psychological {{resilience}} - Individuals {{who have}} {{high levels of}} positive affectivity have lower levels of the stress hormones (such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol), thus physiology gives one explanation in favor of psychological resilience that provides positive resources to confront <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>events.</b> On the other hand, the broaden-and-build theory provides a different explanation from the physiological one, and claim that individuals who {{have high levels of}} positive affectivity and experience positive events in the present, create a spiral or [...] "snow ball" [...] effect, that may lead to higher probability to experience positive events in the future as well.

40|$|Introduction. Childbirth is both joyful and <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>event.</b> This <b>stressful</b> <b>life</b> <b>event</b> {{results in}} {{different}} emotions occurring with different strength among new mothers, {{one of them}} is postpartum depression. However, postnatal depression received the predominance of research attention in recent years, and several authors have pointed attention to the importance of distinguishing between postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety. Aim. The primary purpose of the presented research was to assess the level of anxiety and depression among women who were hospitalised after delivery. The second purpose was to determine if some additional factors influence the level of anxiety and depression. Material. The study was conducted on the sample of 46 women who had delivered infants in the Gynecology – Obstetrics Clinical Hospital UM in Poznań, Poland in 2010. Method. Polish adaptations of standard questionnaires were used to measure variables such as anxiety (STAI), depression (BDI), styles of coping (CISS) and temperament (PTS). Additional data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the authors. Results. Statistical analysis assessed the level and frequency of anxiety (as a state and as a trait) and depression and associations between these factors as well as associations with additional variables (including: mode of delivery, styles of coping with stress and temperament). Conclusions. The score in BDI in mothers after delivery was associated positively with emotion – oriented style of coping and anxiety as a state and as a trait and negatively with strength of inhibition processes.
