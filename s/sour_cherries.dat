5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, <b>sour</b> <b>cherries,</b> and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E

40|$|The {{processed}} juice (or nectar) of the <b>sour</b> <b>cherry,</b> Prunus cerasus L., {{is widely}} {{consumed in the}} Balkan region and Turkey. <b>Sour</b> <b>cherry</b> {{is known to be}} rich in polyphenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins and procyanidins. In this work, the effects of processing of <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> fruit to nectar on polyphenolic compounds was studied. From a Turkish industrial nectar production factory, five fruit batches were sampled during the processing from fruit to nectar, and for each batch 22 sampling points in the process were investigated. Untargeted LC–MS analysis revealed 193 compounds in <b>sour</b> <b>cherry,</b> of which 38 could be putatively identified. Only seven compounds were affected by the process from fruit to nectar, among which were five phenolic compounds. Waste residues such as press cake contained hardly any anthocyanins, while 87 % of the major fruit anthocyanin, cyanidin- 3 -(2 G-glucosylrutinoside), was found in the final nectar. In contrast, procyanidins showed a lower recovery (62 %), and were still well represented in the discarded press cake.

40|$|Tetraploid <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus cerasus L.) {{exhibits}} gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) {{whereby the}} specificity of self-pollen rejection is controlled by alleles of the stylar and pollen specificity genes, S-RNase and SFB (S haplotype-specific F-box protein gene), respectively. As <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> selections can be either self-compatible (SC) or self-incompatible (SI), polyploidy per se does not result in SC. Instead the genotype-dependent loss of SI in <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> {{is due to the}} accumulation of non-functional S-haplotypes. The presence of two or more non-functional S-haplotypes within <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> 2 x pollen renders that pollen SC. Two new S-haplotypes from <b>sour</b> <b>cherry,</b> S 33 and S 34, that are presumed to be contributed by the P. fruticosa species parent, the complete S-RNase and SFB sequences of a third S-haplotype, S 35, plus the presence of two previously identified sweet cherry S-haplotypes, S 14 and S 16 are described here. Genetic segregation data demonstrated that the S 16 -, S 33 -, S 34 -, and S 35 -haplotypes present in <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> are fully functional. This result is consistent with our previous finding that ‘hetero-allelic’ pollen is incompatible in <b>sour</b> <b>cherry.</b> Phylogenetic analyses of the SFB and S-RNase sequences from available Prunus species reveal that the relationships among S-haplotypes show no correspondence to known organismal relationships at any taxonomic level within Prunus, indicating that polymorphisms at the S-locus have been maintained throughout the evolution of the genus. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships among SFB sequences are generally incongruent with those among S-RNase sequences for the same S-haplotypes. Hypotheses compatible with these results are discussed...|$|R
