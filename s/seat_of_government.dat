50|$|In {{judicial}} affairs, {{the three}} districts and their <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> retained their historic influence.

5|$|The {{result of}} these changes {{has been a long}} and complex road to {{responsible}} government. Effectively providing services and representation for the population has been a particular challenge for the Territories' government, a task often complicated by the region's vast and changing geographic area. A small number of communities in Northwest Territories have unsuccessfully tried to become the capital over the years. The territory has had the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> outside of its territorial boundaries twice in its history. The only other political division in Canada without a <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> inside its own boundaries was the defunct District of Keewatin that existed from 1876 until 1905.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{incorporation}} of Bellevue as a city on March 31, 1953, the government chose to lease {{the second floor of}} the Veterans of Foreign Wars office as its first <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> The building, located at Main Street and 100th Avenue, was originally opened in 1893 as the city's first schoolhouse and later served as the city's first library.|$|E
5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E

5|$|Legislative {{sessions}} held in Ottawa {{were conducted}} in an office building on Sparks Street. The Northwest Territories government continues to hold an office in Ottawa on Sparks Street to this day. In 1965, a federal government commission {{was set up to}} determine a new home for the government {{and the future of the}} territory. The <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> was moved back inside the territories to Yellowknife, after it was selected capital in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{had voted}} {{to move the}} <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> {{permanently}} to Quebec City. Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. Macdonald proposed that Queen Victoria decide which city should be Canada's capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital. Macdonald privately asked the Colonial Office {{to ensure that the}} Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election. In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, {{with the passage of}} the <b>Seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>Government</b> Act 1904, it appeared that the matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
5|$|The <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> for {{the state}} was {{originally}} in Philadelphia, then was relocated to Lancaster in 1799 and finally to Harrisburg in 1812.

The first, the Hills Capitol, was destroyed in 1897 by a fire and the second, the Cobb Capitol, was left unfinished when funding was discontinued in 1899.|$|E

5|$|The victory, {{achieved}} at relatively little cost, cleared the Lado Enclave of Mahdist rebels and secured Rejaf as a Belgian base for future {{operations in the}} surrounding territories and along the Nile. Rejaf became the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> within the Lado Enclave, and remained thus when the British eventually reclaimed the territory in 1910.|$|E
5|$|As the {{northern}} tribal lands gradually opened to white settlement, Indiana's population rapidly increased {{and the center}} of population shifted continually northward. Indianapolis was selected to be the site of the new state capital in 1820 because of its central position within the state. The city founders assumed the White River would serve as a major transportation artery; however, the waterway was too sandy for navigation. In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second state capital building.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Cumaná {{experienced}} an increase in population. The areas around the castles and the Manzanares River became densely populated. New buildings were constructed that were attached to the castle walls, completely closing off the perimeter and making direct access impossible. Another earthquake in 1929 left the structure in ruins and rendered it unusable. The offices of the <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> for the Province of Cumaná were moved elsewhere and the building was abandoned. The castle was declared a Cultural and Municipal Asset in May 2005 by the state Cultural Assets Institute.|$|E
