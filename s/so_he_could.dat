50|$|It {{is hard to}} {{reconstruct}} Peregrinus' own motivations for the events of his life, because Lucian, for general and personal reasons, presents a hostile view of Peregrinus.

5|$|In 1920 keen {{supporters}} of the Port Adelaide Football Club, headed by Mr. Swain, collectively raised £77.13.8 and bought Harold a Rover 3.5hp motor-cycle <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make his commute of over 200km to and from Berri where he eventually settled on his own property as a fruit grower during the 1920 season.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy.
