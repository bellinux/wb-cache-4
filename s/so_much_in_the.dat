5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes {{had not yet been}} extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E

25|$|A {{stricken}} MCC team {{arrived in}} Perth, Western Australia after the First Test. John Edrich and Dennis Amiss had had their hands broken from the battering {{they received from}} Lillee and Thomson. David Lloyd was recovering from a broken finger that had {{kept him out of}} the Test. Keith Fletcher had a bruised arm from the Test, which seemed fine until it was hit by a medium paced delivery in the nets from the assistant-manager Alan Smith and went numb so that he could not bat even though {{it was too late to}} change the XI. Smith was a wicketkeeper who had rarely bowled, but had swung the ball <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nets at Lords in 1972 that Geoff Boycott asked him to stop before he destroyed the confidence of the batsman who had to face Bob Massie. Bob Willis was nursing a groin strain and Peter Lever strained a side muscle and had to pull out of the state match. As a result, the team facing the Sheffield Shield champions Western Australia was chosen because only 11 players were fit, and as a result included both wicket-keepers Alan Knott and Bob Taylor, with the latter behind the stumps. The 41-year-old batsman Colin Cowdrey joined the party in Perth, but too late to play in the state game.|$|E

25|$|The gloom {{increased}} during tea {{and play}} was delayed {{regardless of the}} vocal protests of the 32,000 strong crowd, with some being arrested {{as they tried to}} invade the ground. When play resumed Amiss and Cowdrey – his 114th and final Test – came out to open. They stayed out long enough for Amiss to be out lbw to a Lillee swinger for his third successive duck and stumps were drawn at 15/1. In the morning Walker had Cowdrey caught behind off a ball that bounced surprisingly, but Lillee pulled up with a trapped nerve in his foot and was unable to play {{for the rest of the}} Test. With their two strike bowlers removed and the damp spot drying out Australia struggled and Denness and Edrich took full advantage, taking the score from 18/2 to 167/3 with a third wicket stand of 149 and overtaking the home side's total with ease. There were some difficult chances off the England captain, but it was the otherwise impeccable Edrich who was out for 70 edging Walker to Ian Chappell at first slip. The vice-captain was replaced by Keith Fletcher who had suffered <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series with Denness, but now proved that they were attractive batsmen when not faced by blistering pace and England were 273/3 by the end of the day. Walker bowled manfully and Mallett tried to stop the flow of runs, but when Walters and Chappell were brought on for long spells the game was up. Denness was almost run out on 94 and bought up his hundred with a leg-glance that just missed Marsh's gloves, but rode his luck well. He was only the fourth England captain to make a Test hundred in Australia after Andrew Stoddart's 173 in 1894–95, Archie MacLaren's 116 in 1901–02 and Peter May's 113 in 1958–59. When Walker finally had him out caught and bowled the next day he had made 188 in 492 minutes with 17 fours, still the highest Test century by an England captain in Australia. Denness and Fletcher had added 192 for the fourth wicket took take the score to 359/4, the first time England had passed 300 in the series. Fletcher made his first Ashes century in 333 minutes with only seven fours, though he and Greig added 100 runs in 71 minutes as the big South African started thumping the tired bowlers around the deserted ground. By tea the third new ball had been seen off and England were 496/4, a lead of 344. Discussion of when Denness would declare were rendered null and void when the bullish Walker ran through the England batting as the tourists lost 6 wickets for 33 runs after tea. The tall Tasmanian had already taken 3/131, but produced a spell of 5/12 as Greig was caught off a mistimed drive for 89 off 94 balls, followed later in the over by Fletcher for 146. Old was bowled by a shooter from Dymock, who bowled just as long and as well, but with no luck. Alan Knott and Geoff Arnold were caught behind glancing the ball and Underwood was bowled to dismiss England for 529, only their second score over 500 in Australia since Bodyline in 1932–33. Walker returned to the pavilion with figures of 8/143 off 42.2 overs, his best analysis in Tests.|$|E

[...] Steiner told Rosenbaum that [...] "in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, in a way that is perhaps a little bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in a most unusual way". Hitler's genius lay [...] "not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written word, but the embodied voice", which Steiner described as [...] "mesmeric".

Sam Strachan has gone through <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past year with his cancer – it seemed like the perfect time to make the break." [...] Several episodes before the character's departure, his estranged son Kieron played by Misha Crosby, was introduced to Holby City. Father and son both developed romantic feelings for nurse Maria Kendall, leading to Sam asking her to accompany them both to New York, where Kieron was a famous violinist. After being shown her future should she accept, Maria declined Sam's offer, and he and Keiron departed together.|$|E

500|$|The {{strategic}} situation after Lepanto was graphically {{summed up}} {{later by the}} Ottoman Grand Vizier to the Venetian bailo: [...] "The Christians have singed my beard , but I have lopped off an arm. My beard will grow back. The arm , will not". Despite the Grand Vizier's bold statement, however, the damage suffered by the Ottoman fleet was crippling—not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of ships lost, but in the almost total loss of the fleet's experienced officers, sailors, technicians and marines. Well aware of how hard {{it would be to}} replace such men, in the next year the Venetians and the Spanish executed those experts they had taken captive. In addition, despite the limited strategic impact of the allied victory, an Ottoman victory at Lepanto would have had far more important repercussions: it would have meant the effective disappearance of the Christian naval cadres and allowed the Ottoman fleet to roam the Mediterranean at will, with dire consequences for Malta, Crete and possibly even the Balearics or Venice itself. In the event Lepanto, along with the Ottoman failure at Malta six years earlier, confirmed the de facto division of the Mediterranean, with the eastern half under firm Ottoman control and the western under the Habsburgs and their Italian allies.|$|E
