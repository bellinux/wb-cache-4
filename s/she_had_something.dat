25|$|Once in New York, Tallchief {{looked up}} Serge Denham. A {{secretary}} {{told her that}} the company did not need any more dancers and she left crying. A few days later, she was told there was a place for her after all. Denham did not actually remember her, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> he needed– a passport. Many of his dancers were Russian émigrés who lacked passports and the troupe had a Canadian tour coming up. Based on a combination of her talent and her passport, Tallchief was taken on as an apprentice. Her first performance was in Gaîté Parisienne. After the Canadian tour, one of the dancers left the troupe due to pregnancy and Tallchief was offered the woman's place and a $40 per week salary.|$|E
500|$|The casting of Griet was Webber's {{first major}} step, {{and led to}} {{interviews}} with 150 girls before Webber chose the 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johansson. He felt that she [...] "... just stood out. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> distinctive about her." [...] Johansson seemed very modern to Webber, but he believed this was a positive attribute, realising [...] "... that what would work was to take this intelligent, zippy girl and repress all that." [...] The actress finished filming Lost in Translation immediately before arriving on set in Luxembourg, and consequently prepared little for the role. She considered the script [...] "beautifully written" [...] and the character [...] "very touching", but did not read the book because {{she thought it would}} be better to approach the story with a [...] "clean slate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Duff gained fame {{through her}} {{starring}} role in the Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuire. She became interested in pursuing a music career after attending a Radio Disney concert in 2001. [...] "There were all these pop acts backstage at the concert," [...] Duff explained. [...] "They were all getting ready backstage and warming up, and I was like, 'I {{want to do this}} so bad.'" [...] One day, Duff met Andre Recke, who would soon become her manager. She told him of her interest in becoming a singer and briefly performed for him. This prompted him to tell her, [...] "I want to work with you." [...] Recke said of his encounter with Duff, [...] "When I met Hilary, I knew <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> special. Sometimes you just have that feeling, that, 'Wow, she's a star.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after, Martin {{learned that}} her studio had been burnt down {{by a man who}} thought dancing a sin. [...] She began to express her unhappiness. Her father gave her advice saying that she was too young to be married. Martin left {{everything}} behind including her young son, Larry, and went to Hollywood while her father handled the divorce for her. In Hollywood, Martin plunged herself into auditions—so many that she became known as [...] "Audition Mary". Her first professional audition and job was on a national radio network. [...] Among Martin's first auditions in Hollywood, she sang, [...] "Indian Love Call". After her singing the song, [...] "a tall, craggly man who looked like a mountain" [...] told Martin that he thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> special. It was Oscar Hammerstein II (pp.58–59). This marked the start of her career.|$|E
2500|$|Michelle Remembers chronicles Pazder's {{therapy in}} the late 1970s with his long-time patient Smith. In 1973 Pazder first started {{treating}} Smith at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided she felt that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> important to tell him, but could not remember what it was. Shortly thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking {{in the voice of}} a five-year-old. Over the next 14 months Pazder spent over 600 hours using hypnosis to help Smith recover alleged memories of Satanic ritual abuse that occurred when she was five in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a [...] "Satanic cult" [...] in Victoria.|$|E

2500|$|Garner rose to fame in 2001 {{when she}} was cast as {{the star of the}} ABC spy drama Alias. The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: [...] "I always thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> in her {{personality}} that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that." [...] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role. Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: [...] "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross." [...] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought [...] "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" [...] to the role. Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end. During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.|$|E
