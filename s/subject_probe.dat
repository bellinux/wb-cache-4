40|$|ABSTRACT What is {{it inside}} the colorfully wrapped present? You pick it up to ear level and listen, shake it, and then listen again. To you, the basic {{principle}} of active sensing is quite clear—first absorb, then, {{if there is no}} movement or sound, shake it, and then reabsorb. We propose an extremely basic hypothesis for the active sensing of haptic interaction with dynamical systems. Our hypothesis asserts that in order to improve the efficiency of extracting information from a probed system, the sensor should act according to the following basic principle: if the probed system is passive, the sensor should be active; conversely, when the probed system is active, the sensor should be passive. We proved the proposed principle for interaction with a second-order mechanical system with the goal to enhance classification performance between two possible sine power sources. We showed that the addition of an active power source to a passive testing sensor leads to decreased sensitivity in the amplitude and frequency of the tested power source. Further, an extension of this principle is provided, presenting the conditions for reduced sensitivity to spring and damper parameters. To test its applicability for a linear system in a noisy environment, a computer simulation was performed demonstrating that classification performance improved by following the proposed principle. At last, ten <b>subjects</b> <b>probed</b> an active virtual system under either active or passive conditions. A comparison of the mean just-noticeable difference of both conditions indicated significantly better sensitivity was obtained by following the principle.

40|$|Abstract. Person re-identification is {{becoming}} a hot research for devel-oping both machine learning algorithms and video surveillance applica-tions. The task of person re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same identity to a probe image. This task basically as-sumes that the <b>subject</b> of the <b>probe</b> image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person. However, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this assumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person re-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and identification. The detection sub-task {{is to determine the}} presence of the <b>probe</b> <b>subject</b> in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine which person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We present a database col-lected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras, with 200 persons and 7, 413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop a bench-mark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person re-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for person re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the base-line performance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is still largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed...|$|R

Recently, Cai et al. found that the synthesized M-HFn containing Fe 2 O 3 cores with a mean grain size of 2.2  nm has a high longitudinal relaxivity value of 0.94  mM− 1  s− 1 and they proposed it as a potential positive contrast agent for magnetic resonance angiography (Cai et al. 2018). Efficiency of hyperthermia using ultrafine-grained iron oxides is also related to grain size of magnetic minerals (Banobre-Lopez et al. 2013; Deatsch and Evans 2014). Therefore, grain size effects of SP magnetites on mineral magnetism and related applications for biomedical detection and therapy need investigations.|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} {{is limited by}} the validity of the distribution q which is the model for all possible faces. While this research provides good insight into quality assessment, the algorithm is not practical to implement, since it requires a statistically valid number of samples for each <b>subject</b> and <b>probe</b> <b>subject</b> to estimate the distribution of subject’s features. Klare and Jain[77] propose a perceived uniqueness measure of a given face sample and match scores from any face matcher. The measure computes the distance of a match score to a set of imposter scores, thus indicating face uniqueness. Gao et al.[70] proposed the use of asymmetry in LBP features[71] as a measure of the quality of face biometric. However, this {{approach is}} limited in applicability as the face image must first be normalized to scale for the measurement to be accurate. The authors attempt a laborious solution of training a model for each possible scale. Zhang and Wang[72] improve on this intuition using scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features[78]. It is suggested that illumination variation primarily affects face recognition systems. The assessment of quality {{is based on the assumption}} that given a normalized frontal face image, the location of SIFT-based feature points will be symmetric with a vertical axis. Based on this observation, quality is estimated as the ratio of the number of available points on each side of the axis. The work does not discuss any guarantee that the SIFT features are symmetric over any axis in good quality images. Further, any natural asymmetry in face, any symmetric illumination, or other noise can lead to incorrect estimation.|$|R
40|$|Adults, {{infants and}} {{non-human}} primates {{are thought to}} possess similar non-verbal numerical systems, but there is considerable debate regarding whether all vertebrates share the same numerical abilities. Despite an abundance of studies, cross-species comparison remains difficult because the methodology employed and the context of species examination vary considerably across studies. To fill this gap, we used the same procedure, stimuli and numerical contrasts to compare quantity abilities of five teleost fish: redtail splitfin, guppies, zebrafish, Siamese fighting fish, and angelfish. Subjects were trained to discriminate between two sets of geometrical figures using a food reward. Fish initially were trained on an easy numerical ratio (5 vs. 10 and 6 vs. 12). Once they reached the learning criterion, they were <b>subjected</b> to non-reinforced <b>probe</b> trials in which the set size was constant but numerical ratios varied (8 vs. 12 and 9 vs. 12). They also were <b>subjected</b> to <b>probe</b> trials in which the ratio was constant, but the total set size was increased (25 vs. 50) or decreased (2 vs. 4). Overall, fish generalized to numerosities with a 0. 67 ratio, but failed with a 0. 75 ratio; they generalized to a smaller set size, but not to a larger one. Only minor differences were observed among the five species. However, in one species, zebrafish, the proportion of individuals reaching the learning criterion was much smaller than in the others. In a control experiment, zebrafish showed a similar lower performance in shape discrimination, suggesting that the observed difference resulted from the zebrafish’s difficulty in learning this procedure rather than from a cross-species variation in the numerical domain...|$|R
