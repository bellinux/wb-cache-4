25|$|On 17 May 1985, a fire {{swept through}} the then fifty-year-old main stand 'The Grandstand'. This {{happened}} just six days after a fire at Vally Parade stadium in Bradford, in which sadly over fifty people lost their lives. Fortunately this incident occurred {{in the early hours}} of the morning, and <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> was injured. After initially suspecting that this could have been a copycat arson of the Bradford City stadium fire, eventual cause was attributed to an electrical fault.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican Congress {{was also}} taken by legislators of the Broad Progressive Front (FAP), the PRD, Labor and Convergence parties, on April 10, 2008 {{because of their}} {{disagreement}} with the Mexican Government regarding energy policy discussions, claiming they violated the Constitution. López Obrador's followers took both Houses of the Congress and had them chained <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> could enter, thus avoiding the approval of secondary laws which modified the legal framework of the Mexican national oil company, Pemex. Chairs and tables were used as barricades. López Obrador requested a 4-month long debate on energy policies and not a 50-day debate presented by the PAN, PRI, Green Party and New Alliance.|$|E

25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no wonder that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E

500|$|On the Sgt. Pepper album, {{the start}} of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] is {{cross-faded}} with the applause {{at the end of}} the previous track [...] "Sgt.

Pepper cross-fade, but on [...] and the CD version of 1967–1970, the song starts cleanly, without any fade or cross-fade. Also, the [...] "1967–1970" [...] CD does not have the sped up ending, and instead it just ends after the E Major chord has faded enough <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> could hear it.|$|E

500|$|On [...] April 18–20, 1946, Teller {{participated in}} a conference at Los Alamos to review the wartime work on the Super. The {{properties}} of thermonuclear fuels such as deuterium and the possible design of a hydrogen bomb were discussed. It was concluded that Teller's assessment of a hydrogen bomb had been too favourable, and that both the quantity of deuterium needed, {{as well as the}} radiation losses during deuterium burning, would shed doubt on its workability. Addition of expensive tritium to the thermonuclear mixture would likely lower its ignition temperature, but even <b>so,</b> <b>nobody</b> knew at that time how much tritium would be needed, and whether even tritium addition would encourage heat propagation.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm With Cupid" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on Valentine's Day, 1999. Because they knew it would air on Valentine's Day, Fox asked the Simpsons staff to produce an episode related to the holiday. The episode's ending credits were also painted red {{in honor of the}} holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Greaney, who also wrote the episode's first draft. The episode's title was pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge, who based it on the popular T-shirt slogan I'm with stupid. However, Hauge later found out that the title had already been used before for an episode of another television series. However, he did not believe that copyright issues would arise: [...] "It's a very innocent mistake," [...] Hauge said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It {{is one of those things}} that, in the course of a career, you're gonna be on both sides of that, <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> ever sues on it." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from Alabama, Hutson did not plan on playing professionally, since the NFL was not highly regarded in the South compared to college football. But Green Bay Packers head coach Curly Lambeau saw Hutson as the perfect receiver for his passing attack, {{which at the time}} was headed by quarterback Arnie Herber and end John [...] "Blood" [...] McNally. Before the draft existed, college players could sign with any team they wanted, and while Hutson did sign a contract with Green Bay, he had also signed a contract with the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers. Both contracts came to the NFL office at the same time, and NFL president Joseph Carr declared that Hutson would go to Green Bay, as the Green Bay contract had an earlier date of signing. Hutson later stated he chose the Packers because they offered the most money—$300 a game. [...] "That was far and above what they had ever paid a player," [...] said Hutson. [...] "Each week they'd give me a check for $150 from one bank and $150 from another <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> would know how much I was getting paid." ...|$|E

500|$|While out fishing, Homer is {{abducted}} {{by the two}} aliens, Kang and Kodos. When they demand that Homer point them towards Earth's leader, Homer informs them of the upcoming presidential election and says the winner could be either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole. Kang and Kodos kidnap both Dole and Clinton, placing them in suspended animation tubes and assuming their forms through [...] "bio-duplication" [...] to ensure {{that one of them}} will become the next leader. Before returning Homer to Earth, the aliens soak him in rum, <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> will believe him. As the election nears, the impostor candidates are seen to be acting strangely, holding hands in public and making bizarre declarations in unhumanlike monotone. Later on, Homer stumbles upon the badly hidden spaceship and tries to save Dole and Clinton, with both candidates agreeing they should join forces to defeat the aliens; however, Homer accidentally ejects them into space. On the day before the election, Homer crashes the spaceship into the Capitol and reveals the candidates' real identities. However, despite being exposed, Kang and Kodos declare to the people that they still have to choose one of them because it is too late to get new candidates. Kang is subsequently elected president and enslaves all of humanity.|$|E

He subsequently joined a graduate program in speech pathology at Iowa, where he and other graduate students tried to develop [...] "practical techniques" [...] of a treatment for stuttering. These attempts proved successful, and after several years in Iowa, Charles received his Ph.D. in speech pathology.|$|E

2500|$|The Faroese ting is {{mentioned}} for, {{the first time}} in the Færeyinga saga, as [...] "the assembly", where the chieftains Sigmundur Brestisson and Tróndur í Gøtu met. In 999, Sigmundur introduced Christianity at the ting, which was located on Tinganes, a peninsula, which is now the old part of Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroes. In the Viking Age it was a tradition to hold the ting at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> had an advantage of the location. In fact, there was no settlement at Tinganes to that time, but it was the most central place of the islands.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the days}} before May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann {{prepared}} rice cereal snacks and juice boxes poisoned with the diluted arsenic she had stolen in Madison. She mailed them to a former female friend, ex-babysitting clients, her psychiatrist, Russell Dann, and others. In the early morning of May 20, she personally delivered snacks and juice [...] "samples" [...] to other friends, acquaintances, and families for whom she had babysat, {{some of whom had}} not seen her for years. Other snacks were delivered to Alpha Tau Omega, Psi Upsilon, and Kappa Sigma fraternity houses and Leverone Hall at Northwestern University in Evanston. Notes were attached to some of the deliveries. The drinks were often leaking and the squares unpleasant tasting, so few were actually consumed. In addition, the arsenic was highly diluted <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> became seriously ill.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Marvel is a droll tramp unwillingly {{recruited}} {{to assist the}} Invisible Man as his first visible partner. He carries the Invisible Man's scientific notebooks and stolen money. Eventually Marvel grows afraid of his unseen partner and flees to Port Burdock, taking both the notebooks and the money with him, where he seeks police protection. Although the Invisible Man is furious and vows revenge, he becomes preoccupied with hiding from the law and retaliating against Dr. Kemp, and Marvel is spared. Marvel eventually uses the stolen money to open his own inn, which he calls the Invisible Man, and prospers. The novel ends with him secretly [...] "marvelling" [...] at Griffin's notes (though not comprehending them). It turns out Marvel kept the notes and only views them when there is nobody around, <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> can know Griffin's secrets — or that Marvel has them.|$|E

2500|$|Schlessinger was {{estranged from}} her sister for years, and many {{thought she was}} an only child. She had not spoken to her mother for 18 to 20 years before her mother's death in 2002 from heart disease. Her mother's remains were found in her Beverly Hills condo {{approximately}} two months after she died, and lay unclaimed for {{some time in the}} Los Angeles morgue before Schlessinger had them picked up for burial. Concerning the day that she heard about her mother’s death, she said: “Apparently she had no friends and none of her neighbors were close, <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> even noticed! How sad.” In 2006, Schlessinger wrote that she had been attacked in a [...] "vulgar, inhumane manner by media types" [...] because of the circumstances surrounding her mother's death, and that false allegations had been made that she was unfit to dispense advice based on family values. She said that she had not mourned the deaths of either of her parents because she had no emotional bond to them.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of legal {{proceedings}} the Federal District Court ordered the Little Rock School District to proceed with its integration plans when school opened on September 4, 1957.

[...] The governor initially ordered to state duty the State Headquarters Detachment, the Base Detachment at Adams Field and any other units the Adjutant General felt necessary to [...] "accomplish the mission of maintaining or restoring law and order and to preserve the peace, health, safety and security of the citizens of Pulaski County, Arkansas." [...] On September 4, Elizabeth Eckford was the only student to enter the school due to lack of communication. It is commonly mistaken that she was taking this stand on her own but rather it was because she was the only student who didn't have a phone <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> could contact her to let her know the integration wasn't happening until the next day.|$|E
2500|$|The Gimme Shelter DVD {{contains}} extensive {{excerpts from}} that broadcast.

[...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if I could sit on the edge of the stage <b>so</b> <b>nobody</b> could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E
