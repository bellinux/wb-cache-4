5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known as}} the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. <b>Surplus</b> <b>food</b> is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E
50|$|All civilizations have {{depended}} on agriculture for subsistence. Grain farms {{can result in}} accumulated storage and a <b>surplus</b> of <b>food,</b> particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare. Grain surpluses have been especially important {{because they can be}} stored for a long time. A <b>surplus</b> of <b>food</b> permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A <b>surplus</b> of <b>food</b> results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to <b>food</b> <b>surpluses,</b> such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture. It is possible that <b>food</b> <b>surpluses</b> and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.|$|R

5|$|In {{some places}} they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion {{as well as}} the {{associated}} maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.|$|E

Therefore, <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> in the <b>food</b> chain both at the production level and at household consumption could become a resource.

These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as irrigation and deforestation which allowed the production of <b>surplus</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gillespie County is {{something}} of an aberration in that it is a historically Republican county in a state that was overwhelmingly Democratic up until recent decades.

25|$|Agriculture is {{dominated}} by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as cassava, peanuts, maize, sorghum, millet, sesame, and plantain. The annual real GDP growth rate is just above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported cash crops is indicated {{by the fact that the}} total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes a year, while the production of cotton, the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.

25|$|Agriculture {{had a major}} impact; humans {{began to}} affect the {{environment}} as never before. <b>Surplus</b> <b>food</b> allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans {{no longer had to}} spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.|$|E

40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{scale of}} food waste in global food supply chains is attracting increasing attention {{due to its}} environmental, social and economic impacts. Drawing on interviews with food waste specialists, this study construes the boundaries between <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and <b>food</b> waste, avoidable and unavoidable food waste, and between waste prevention and waste management. This study suggests that the first step towards a more sustainable resolution of the food waste issue is to adopt a sustainable production and consumption approach and tackle <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and waste throughout the global food supply chain. The authors examine the factors {{that give rise to}} food waste throughout the food supply chain, and propose a framework to identify and prioritize the most appropriate options for prevention and management of food waste. The proposed framework interprets and applies the waste hierarchy in the context of food waste. It considers the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social), offering a more holistic approach in addressing food waste. Additionally, it considers the materiality and temporality of food. The food waste hierarchy posits that prevention, through minimization of <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> and avoidable <b>food</b> waste, is the most attractive option. The second most attractive option involves the distribution of <b>food</b> <b>surplus</b> to groups affected by food poverty, followed by the option of converting food waste to animal feed. Although the proposed food waste hierarchy requires a fundamental re-think of the current practices and systems in place, {{it has the potential to}} deliver substantial environmental, social and economic benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Virtually all Amazonian Indians, for example, were agricultural, but in aboriginal times they did not produce a <b>food</b> <b>surplus.</b> That it was technically feasible for them to produce such a surplus is shown by the fact that, under the stimulus of European settlers' desire for food, a number of tribes did raise manioc in amounts well above their own needs, for the purpose of trading.

In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed <b>surplus</b> <b>food</b> to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps.
