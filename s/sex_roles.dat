5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on <b>sex</b> <b>roles,</b> lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{positive}} and negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities of 412 employees from organisations in South Africa were compared with regards to conflict management styles and psychological wellbeing. Three self- report questionnaires were administered to employees to measure the variables of {{positive and}} negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities, conflict management styles and psychological wellbeing. The self- report questionnaires included the 57 - Item Revised Extended Personality Attributes Questionnaire (EPAQ-R), the Thomas- Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, and the Warwick- Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated overall significant differences among <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities and conflict management styles, <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities and psychological wellbeing, as well as conflict management styles and psychological wellbeing. In particular, the results were consistent with the proposed hypotheses in relation to <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities and conflict management styles. The results specified that the positively androgynous individual favoured the compromising conflict management style, the negatively androgynous individual preferred to avoid, the positively feminine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity favoured the accommodating conflict management style, whereas the negatively feminine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity preferred to avoid, and both the positively and negatively masculine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities favoured the competing conflict management style. In relation to conflict management styles and psychological wellbeing, significant differences were found between compromising and accommodating, collaborating and accommodating, and avoiding and accommodating conflict management styles. In terms of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity and psychological wellbeing, significant differences occurred between all the positive <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities and negative femininity, as well as between positive androgyny and the negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. Unexpected findings relating to <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities and psychological wellbeing pertains to the significant difference between negative androgyny and negative femininity, as well as the undifferentiated <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity and negative femininity. Therefore, these results have provided support for the Differentiated Androgynous Model indicating that positive <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities are more socially equipped in terms of psychological adjustment in relation to the negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities.

The primary concern of this investigation, therefore, was the development and validation of a new <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity instrument - the SRI Reptest. The SRI Reptest is based on Kelly 2 ̆ 7 s Personal Construct theory, and recent advances in <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> development models. In particular, this instrument incorporates the notion of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> salience, and makes it possible to characterise an individual as masculine, feminine, androgynous, or <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> transcendent. With this instrument <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity, as well as the relationship of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity to self-esteem and ego development, was examined from a cross-cultural perspective. 216 Australian and 115 Indian university students completed a test battery which consisted of the SRI Reptest, the Same-Sex Ideal Form, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Loevinger 2 ̆ 7 s Sentence Completion Test. In addition, interviews conducted with a select sample of subjects from the two countries enabled the testing of the tenability of two basic assumptions underlying recent <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> development models.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates age, race, and sex {{differences}} in how individuals endorse <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> traits over time, and how the structure (network size, average age of network members, proportion of family in social network, and proportion of females in social network) and quality (positive and negative) of social relations are associated with <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> endorsements. Utilizing the two waves the Survey of Social Relations and Health Study (Antonucci & Akiyama, 1992, 2005), changes in Bem <b>Sex</b> <b>Role</b> Inventory (BSRI; 1974) responses across a 12 year time period were analyzed, using both categorical conceptualizations of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> trait endorsements (masculine, feminine, androgynous, and undifferentiated) and continuous measures of trait endorsements (mean of masculine and feminine trait endorsements, respectively). Results indicate that over the 12 years, roughly 50 % of adults remained consistent in their categorical <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> classification, while others changed to new classifications, indicating that there were both increases and decreases in masculine and feminine trait endorsements over time. Likewise, change in continuous measures of masculine and feminine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> trait endorsements was observed, with significant increases in masculine trait endorsements and decreases in feminine trait endorsements over time, when controlling for level of education. Further, when investigating age, race, and sex interactions with <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> trait endorsements, significant interactions were observed between masculine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> trait endorsement and age, race, and sex respectively, and feminine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> trait endorsement and age.

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to examine <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> {{dependent}} and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> independent teacher behaviour in sex integrated primary school physical education lessons, utilising a systematic behaviour observation instrument. <b>Sex</b> <b>role</b> dependent behaviour accepts or expects <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stereotypic behaviour in males and females or discourages male and female behaviour that is non-stereotypic. <b>Sex</b> <b>role</b> independent behaviour encourages, accepts or expects female and male behaviour that is independent of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stereotypes. The study will allow the analysis of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stereotypic patterns of teacher behaviour to determine the extent to which equality of participation and interaction in those classes observed is being achieved. The expectations of teachers of physical education may favour and reinforce the participation and achievement of boys over girls, if sex stereotypic patterns of behaviour are present. Additionally the study will evaluate the modifications to the <b>Sex</b> <b>Role</b> Dependent/Independent Teacher Behavior Observation Instrument (Griffin, 1980), as recommended by Griffin (. 1980) and Rate (1987) in order to determine if the modified instrument provides an effective means of obtaining descriptive information about teacher behaviour related to <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> dependence or independence. These modifications require a reduction in the number of categories, and the combination of these categories into more simplified categories in order to generate greater recorded frequencies in the specified categories, thus improving the observation instrument as a measure of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> dependent/independent behaviour. The final outcome of the study may be to provide an improved descriptive observation instrument which will provide information for teachers about sex equity in their lessons.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{two major}} {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to test the assumption that the IT Scale for Children (standard-ITSC) {{can be used as a}} measure of both appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference with preschool aged children, and (2) to extend previous studies in these areas by analyzing the relationship between <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and preference, and a variety of variables shown to be important in understanding <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> development in, young children. These variables included such characteristics as sex, age, IQ,' preschool program involvement and sibling status. In attempting to test the assumption regarding the adequacy of the standard-ITSC as a measure of both appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> perference, all subjects were administered the ITSC three times; once using the standard-ITSC with the sex of the IT figure not designated, once using a modified-ITSC with the IT figure replaced by a clear drawing of a little boy, and once using a modified- ITSC with the IT figure replaced by a clear drawing of a little girl. The subjects of the present study were 38 children attending two preschool programs established by the Department of Family Life at Oregon State University. Essentially, subjects in these two preschool programs represented matched pairs based on the variables of age, sex, ordinal position, age of parents, length of parents' marriage, number of children in the family, religion and socioeconomic status of the family. The instruments used to collect the data for the present study included the standard-ITSC and a modified-ITSC which was specifically designed for this study. The standard -'ITSC was used as a measure of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference, while the modified-ITSC was used as a measure of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was used to estimate the subjects' IQ scores. The analysis of variance approach was used to test three null hypotheses concerning the subjects' own <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination, opposite <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores. The paired-difference test was used to test two additional null hypotheses related to comparisons of the subjects' <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores. The test of Hypothesis I, dealing with own <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination scores, revealed. a significant interaction effect for sex X preschool program, and indicated that subjects with same-sex teachers were slightly better than subjects with opposite-sex teachers, in their ability to make own <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discriminations. The findings associated with the tests of opposite <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination scores indicated that: (1) whether the subjects were grouped by sex or sex x age, girls were significantly better than boys in their ability to make opposite <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discriminations, (2) while older girls were better than younger girls in their opposite <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination scores, the reverse was true for boys, and (3) older and younger girls differed in their ability to make opposite <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discriminations to a greater degree than did older and younger boys. The test of Hypothesis III, dealing with <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores, was perhaps the most productive of those in this group, in that three of the four main effects yielded significance, as did three of the sex interaction effects. Tests of the main effects indicated that boys, older subjects, and subjects with male teachers had significantly more appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores than did their opposite in these groupings. In addition, the significant interaction terms suggest the following: (1) whether the subjects were grouped by sex X age, IQ or preschool program, boys tended to have more appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores than girls, (2) while older boys tended to have more appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores than younger boys, this was not noticeable for girls, (3) while average girls tended to have more appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores than rapid girls, there was only a minor difference between rapid and average boys, and (4) while boys with same-sex teachers had more appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> preference scores than boys with opposite-sex teachers, girls with same- or opposite-sex teachers did not differ appreciably from each other. Results of the paired-difference test as applied to the two additional hypotheses in this study indicated that whether the subjects were grouped by sex, age, IQ, preschool program or sibling status: (1) replacing the IT figure with a clear drawing of a boy in testing, resulted in significantly higher, more masculine mean scores, and (2) replacing the IT figure with a clear drawing of a girl in testing, resulted in significantly lower, more feminine mean scores. It was concluded that collectively these findings did little to resolve the controversy concerning the use of the standard-ITSC as a measure of both <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and preference with preschool aged children. It appears that the findings could be used with equal facility to support and to question this assumption. Attempts were made to relate all specific findings to both theoretical positions and existing research findings in the area of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> discrimination and preference in preschool aged children. Because of the complexity of the data and the analysis, definitive conclusions regarding the implications of the findings were not possible. In general, however, the results support the multi-dimensional nature of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> development in young children and strongly document the need for future researchers to include additional child and environmental variables in their studies. Possible interpretations of the findings and trends in the data were discussed, and sections dealing with limitations of the study and suggestions for future research were presented...|$|R

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to {{gender-related}} characteristics that is congruous with the person’s biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed the perks of androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about <b>sex</b> <b>roles.</b> Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests.

Parental attitudes toward child-rearing and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> behavior were assessed with the Parent Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) and the Parent-Child Interaction Survey (PCIS). Children's <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> acquisition was assessed with the <b>Sex</b> <b>Role</b> Learning Index (SERLI) and the It Scale for Children (ITSC). Multiple regression analyses were used to identify variables which contributed to children's <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> knowledge and preference. SERLI {{results indicated that the}} less fathers approved of feminine behavior, the more stereotypic their sons' knowledge of the feminine role. Moreover, the less maternal warmth and paternal approval of feminine behavior, and the more maternal approval of feminine behavior, the more stereotypic sons' knowledge of the masculine role.

40|$|Orientation: There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} examining both positive and negative sex-based traits and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. Previous research has predominantly focused on positive <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities and their relationship to various outcome variables. Findings for such research have not always been consistent. It has been argued that research that only examines positive identities is methodologically flawed and that the inconsistent findings in such research may be attributable {{to the fact that the}} research conducted has not examined the extent to which individuals may have adopted negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. Motivation for the study: With few exceptions, <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identity (SRI) has been measured exclusively in terms of positive characteristics only. There is a dearth {{of research}} investigating both positive and negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities, particularly within the South African context. Research purpose: The purpose of this research was to explore the extent to which individuals adopt both positive and negative sex-based traits and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. A theoretical argument is made for examining positive and negative gender attributes followed by a discussion of seven empirical studies, which demonstrate that significant proportions of samples are adopting negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. Research design, approach and method: This research was conducted using a cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method across seven different samples. A total of 3462 employees participated in this research. A revised version of the Extended Personal Attribute Questionnaire (EPAQ-R) and a demographic survey were used to collect the data. Main findings: Across all seven samples, a significant proportion of the respondents adopted negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. These findings suggest that there is a need to measure both positive and negative identities in research on SRI. The proportion of respondents across the seven samples that adopted negative identities ranged from 44 % to 49 % whilst 46 % to 54 % indicated the adoption of positive identities. Practical/managerial implications: This research is important as it highlights that investigations of SRI must assess both positive and negative <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. Negative SRIs may have implications for critical individual and organisational outcomes. Furthermore, measures that assess both positive and negative identities may have implications for organisational processes, such as recruitment, selection and training, learning and development. Contribution/value-add: The findings of this research contribute to the South African body of literature investigating <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> identities. The present study’s finding of a high proportion of individuals endorsing negative identities has implications for future research. Future research needs to explore the relationship between both positive and negative identities and a wide variety of individual and organisational well-being indicators.

Participants were predominately single, young adult, low income, highly educated, African-American females who live in an urban area. Participants were heavily recruited through online social networks which included Craigslist, the root. com, BlackPlanet. com, and amightyriver. com. Also, participants were recruited at a private university in South Florida through posters sharing a link to the survey. Dr. Martha Burt 2 ̆ 7 s Rape Myth Scale was used and demographic information was obtained. Results showed that gender significantly impacted rape myth acceptance, adversarial sexual beliefs, and acceptance of interpersonal violence. When gender was held constant, race was significant with Blacks endorsing higher <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> satisfaction, <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stereotypes, and sexual conservatism compared to Hispanics. Blacks had greater <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> satisfaction and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stereotyping compared to Multi-Racial individuals. Lastly, Blacks had greater <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stereotyping and sexual conservatism when compared to White individuals. Additionally, Hispanic individuals endorsed higher <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> satisfaction when compared to Whites and sexual conservatism when compared to Multi-Racial individuals. These results could impact rape prevention programs and clinical work that targets rape myths...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 47) The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the relationship between perceived group cohesion and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> attitudes in a small group setting with the contention that the overt reason for the group's existence would have no significant effect on the relationships being tested. The requisites for the groups to be studied were: 1. That they be on-going (i. e., of at least three months' duration with regular meetings); and 2. That group membership involve moderate to high inter- group communication. Responses from. nine groups of varied composition were examined for the following: 1. The association of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> attitudes to perceived group cohesion; 2, The association of <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> attitudes to group members' popularity within their group; and 3. The extent to which persons with like <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> attitudes tended to nominate others with similar attitudes. The study was able to reject the Null Hypothesis (x 2 = 0) at the. 05 level for the first two hypotheses. Results showed a significant measure of association between <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> attitudes and perceived group cohesion (0 =. 28). Data from the third investigation were not proper for determination of statistical significance, but showed that individuals who scored high on the <b>Sex</b> <b>Role</b> Inventory tended to choose other high-scoring individuals. In addition. individuals who scored low on the <b>Sex</b> <b>Role</b> Inventory also tended to choose high-scoring individuals...|$|R
500|$|After filming for The Seven Year Itch {{wrapped in}} November, Monroe began a new battle for control over her career and left Hollywood for the East Coast, {{where she and}} {{photographer}} Milton Greene founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)– an action that has later been called [...] "instrumental" [...] {{in the collapse of}} the studio system. Announcing its foundation in a press conference in January 1955, Monroe stated that she was [...] "tired of the same old <b>sex</b> <b>roles.</b> I want to do better things. People have scope, you know." [...] She asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, as the studio had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised bonus for The Seven Year Itch. This began a year-long legal battle between her and the studio. The press largely ridiculed Monroe for her actions and she was parodied in The Seven Year Itch writer George Axelrod's Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955), in which her lookalike Jayne Mansfield played a dumb actress who starts her own production company.|$|E
500|$|Jeanne Marecek gave Sexual Preference a {{negative}} review in <b>Sex</b> <b>Roles,</b> writing {{that it was}} tedious and succeeded well neither as a popular book nor as a scientific treatment of its topic. She maintained that it lacked [...] "methodological detail", and that its true focus was homosexuality rather than sexual preference generally. She believed {{that there were many}} problems with [...] "the premises and the execution" [...] of Bell et al.′s study, writing that they neither broke [...] "new theoretical ground" [...] nor offered [...] "a critical reading of old theories" [...] and ignored questions such as [...] "how and why adults change their sexual preference, what meanings individuals ascribe to their sexuality, and how social context contributes to stability or change in sexual preference". In her view, other problems included Bell et al.′s failure to critically examine [...] "the accuracy of the retrospective memories" [...] of their respondents and willingness to take their answers to questions at face value. Marecek concluded that they must have been disappointed by the results of their path analyses since, [...] "Very few of the respondents' reported early experiences were related to the emergence of homosexuality." [...] She disagreed with Bell et al.′s focus on theories relating homosexuality to childhood experience and their conclusion that [...] "sexual preference is dictated by developmental experiences", and wrote that they seemed politically conservative despite presenting themselves as liberals.|$|E

40|$|Sixty mature women seeking {{continuing}} education counseling were given measures of self-esteem, <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> orientation, and spouse support (SS) {{for a return}} to school or work. Emotional SS was measured in terms of the frequency of the praise, encouragement and accomodation by the spouse. Instrumental SS was defined as the spouse’s contribution to the total family output in the areas of housework, childcare, and social responsibilities. Women who were low on self-esteem or non-traditional in <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> orientation projected significantly greater in-strumental SS upon their return to school than did women who were high on self-esteem or traditional in <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> orientation. Self-esteem and <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> orientation, however, were unrelated to the actual instrumental SS that the subjects reported receiving from their husbands...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{differences}} in mental disorder {{rates have been}} examined from two opposing perspectives. One of these suggests that women have higher rates due to <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> related stress [1. Am. J. Sociol. 78, 812, 1972; 2. Gender and Disordered Behavior, p. 23. Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1979]. The other holds that women do not have generally higher rates than men but rather that they manifest different types of psychiatric disorders [3. A. Rev. Psychiat. 25, 417, 1974; 4. Am. J. Sociol. 81, 1447, 1976]. This paper develops a theoretical paradigm to clarify and extend the latter position thereby facilitating an empirical test of the two opposing positions. Psychiatric disorder rates are examined for women living in two communities with contrasting <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> norms, the traditional Orthodox Jewish community with traditional <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> norms and the modern Orthodox Jewish community with changing <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> norms. The <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> stress perspective and the theoretical paradigm developed here lead to different predictions regarding the comparative disorder rates among these women. The observed rates of disorder are {{not consistent with the}} role stress theory. gender depression mental illness...|$|R

The correlation of age. education and experience with <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> self concept and role conﬂict was examined. This was a descriptive survey with a purposive probability sample of 126 subjects from three mid-Atlantic states. A mail survey resulted in a useful return of 88 questionnaires, including 81 females. The Bem <b>Sex</b> <b>Role</b> Inventory was utilized to measure <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> self concept; masculinity and femininity are viewed as two independent dimensions present in every individual. Role conﬂict was measured by an investigator developed tool designed to examine internal role conﬂict associated with socialization as a female and nurse while occupying an administrative position. Masculine self concept, not feminine, had a significant relationship to role conﬂict. Education was significantly correlated with <b>sex</b> <b>role</b> self concept and role conflict, while age and experience were not. Education had a positive relationship with masculine self concept which was inversely related to role conﬂict. Size of hospital had a significant inverse relationship with role conﬂict...|$|R
