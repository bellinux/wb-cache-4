40|$|The {{balancing}} {{of complex}} rotating systems is a challenging task {{as it may}} require repetitive (dis) assembly to enable mass adjustments; thus, developing methods for in-situ dynamic balancing of rotatives {{is regarded as a}} key technology enabler. In this context laser balancing with its high flexibility in adjusting its firing frequency (to match that of the rotating part) and pulse energy (to vary the material removal) could offer significant advantages from both precision and cost point of view. In this paper, a laser balancing system is developed to continuously remove material from a target part in a controlled and automated manner. The amount of material ablated can be controlled by an influence coefficient, which is related to the change in vibration amplitude for a predefined amount of pulses at a given operational balancing speed, material, and geometry of the rotative part. The proposed system features a three-layered case-driven programmatic approach to optimize <b>single-plane</b> <b>balancing</b> process duration in a fully automated system. This enables the use of prioritization to avoid misfire and therefore, structural damage to the targeted part. Furthermore, the application allows the component to be balanced to all common balancing grades as specified in the ISO 1940 / 1 standard. Thus, validation trials involved balancing an Inconel 718 rotative to a preliminarily specified balancing grade by extracting the acceleration signals using an IIR peak filter. A computer simulation encompassing the rotor bearing state space system, a model of the laser and the adapted peak detection algorithm, has been developed and used to validate the trials conducted. Henceforth, a maximum deviation from the desired correction position of less than 1 mm has been recorded. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} the detection and correction of imbalances can be reliably achieved by reducing the vibration level of a rotor from G 22. 5 to G 19. 5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper puts forward an {{intelligent}} <b>single-plane</b> biaxial <b>balance</b> monitor system, {{which is used}} in ultra-precision grinding. It adopts the method of <b>single-plane</b> <b>balance</b> correction for the vibration of wheel and workpiece. And this system {{can also be used}} for integral balance. For ultra-precision grinding, caused by the mutual influence of the vibration of wheel and workpiece, there will be a ripple on the workpiece surface, which is mainly influenced by the frequency ratio of wheel to workpiece, the feed rate and the vibration of wheel and workpiece. This system can improve the machining accuracy, reduce the surface error of workpiece and appraise the integrated machining result, by analyzing the vibration data of wheel and workpiece and adjusting machining parameters...|$|R
