40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} flexible carbon {{papers were}} prepared, based on hydroxyl functionalized few layer graphene (G-OH). G-OH {{was obtained from}} the reaction of KOH with nanosized graphite with a very high surface area (HSAG), greater than 300 m 2 g- 1, and with high shape anisotropy, with the help of mechanical and thermal energy. Wide angle X-ray and Raman analyses showed that the core of G-OH had the structure of infinite and ideal graphene layers and that the interlayer distance between the few stacked graphene layers was the same as in pristine HSAG. Hydroxyl groups were thus essentially located in peripheral positions. High resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of graphene aggregates made by a number of layers as low as 6.

In response to a background flow, these cells distribute themselves non-uniformly throughout the vessel. As a result, material properties that are well defined in homogeneous fluids, such as viscosity, are no longer so, and depend upon the flow geometry along with the particle properties. Using a simple model that accounts for the steady-state particle distribution in vessel flow, we derive an expression for the effective viscosity of blood and the suspension flow velocity field in a pressure-driven tube flow. We derive the steady-state particle distribution from a conservation equation with con-vective flux arising from particle deformation in the flow. We then relate the particle microstructure to the overall flow through a generalized Newtonian stress-tensor, with th...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{attributed}} {{one possibility}} of the rolling of 2 D graphene oxide sheets to the rapid formation of ice crystals, which caused by shock cooling with liquid nitrogen. As water starts to form ice crystals in this experimental procedure, GO sheets in the suspension were rejected from the moving solidification front [19] and forced to roll over by the ice crystals along {{the direction of the}} crystallization. This frozen casting method has been widely used for the production of porous structures that were made of nanoparticles [20, 21]. In a latest study, Li et al. had adopted the technique to form a cellular monolith with high concentration of partially reduced GO and some fibrous structures with low concentration [22]. In our experiment, when the <b>suspension</b> contained <b>flexible</b> GO nanosheets, the frozen casting in liquid nitrogen can result in the formation of a rolling 1 D nanostructure around a reel due to the anisotropic crystallization of ice. In this case, the graphene oxide sheets in this 1 D rolling configuration were dominated by the formation of ice crystals.

Also in the 1930s, prototypes of the first Volkswagen Beetle incorporated torsion bars—especially their transverse mounting style. Ledwinka's concept had been copied by Ferdinand Porsche, whose successors later had to acknowledge the influence of Ledwinka's sophisticated Tatra models on the Porsche-designed Kdf-Wagen of 1938 (later renamed the Beetle), a post-war lawsuit resulting in a DM3,000,000 settlement paid by Volkswagen to Ringhoffer-Tatra in 1961.|$|R
