40|$|There {{has been}} much {{disagreement}} over which potential computer mediated communication has to create meaningful relational bonds. Early theories of computer mediated communication thought this form of communication would be impersonal to those using it. Contrary to this belief we see today that mediated text based communication is a common way to communicate between friends and strangers. Self-disclosure is explored as an important relational variable that may give meaning to an otherwise impoverished communication setting. Studies show consistently that people disclose more frequent and more intimate within mediated communication. Models of computer mediated communication is contrasted <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>these</b> findings, and answers are sought as to what role self-disclosure plays in this form of communication...|$|R

40|$|In his {{analysis}} of the affluent society, Galbraith argued that advertising and the sales promotion activities of firms create wants for people, which makes them consume more without making them better off, because their wants were artificially created. Thus, in the affluent society, ever-increasing levels of production (and consumption) do not increase welfare. This paper considers three criticisms of Galbraith's analysis: first, firms cannot 'create' wants for consumers without their consent, because consumers are not mere pawns in their hands; second, even if people's wants are created, they may be better off by consuming more; and third, that expansion of consumption can make people better off by expanding aggregate demand. It draws on the recent literature on consumption, income and happiness, and develops a simple model of growth and distribution, to argue that Galbraith's analysis holds <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>these</b> criticisms. ...|$|R

60|$|To this {{remarkable}} metamorphosis in Mr. Peter Pett several causes had contributed.

40|$|Patriarchal {{discourse}} has {{lead to the}} marginalisation of women, {{children and}} teenagers. The aims of this research were to deconstruct patriarchal discourse; to empower teenagers to speak out for themselves; to facilitate teenagers' identifying, questioning and 'interviewing' of important problems in their lives, and to let teenagers' voices be heard by adults. Post-modern social construction discourse, post-modern and feminist theologies were used to challenge patriarchal discourse. A narrative, pastoral approach was used to assist teenagers to accomplish these aims. Using externalisation, three problems (Depression; Drugs and Alcohol; Verbal, Physical and Sexual Abuse) were exposed for what they really are, and how they influence many teenagers' lives. Alternative stories of how teenagers stand <b>up</b> <b>against</b> <b>these</b> problems were told. The teenagers decided to inform parents and teachers of their lived experiences in three letters.
