500|$|Despite being {{relieved}} that war was over, Alice was {{appalled by the}} behaviour of Prussian troops in Hesse; Berlin took the grand duchy's railways and telegraph systems, and assessed Hesse for three million florins in indemnity. Alice wrote to her mother, who in turn wrote to Princess Victoria, who responded {{that there was nothing}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> relieve the [...] "painful and distressing position darling Alice was in", as it was [...] "one of the unavoidable results of this dreadful war". Influence came from the Emperor of Russia, who urged the Prussian King to allow the Grand Duke to keep his throne. The facts that the Emperor's mother was the Grand Duke's aunt, and Alice's sister being also the Prussian Crown Princess are likely to have influenced Prussia's generosity. However, Alice was angered by an untactful visit by Princess Victoria to the conquered region of Homburg, originally part of Hesse, shortly after it became Prussian territory.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Bother" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira and Leisha Hailey and American pop music {{production}} trio The Matrix, which is composed of Lauren Christy, Graham Edwards, and Scott Spock. Shakira also produced the song. Similar to her seventh studio album Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, (2005), [...] "Don't Bother" [...] musically shifts to a more rock styled composition as compared to Shakira's previous releases. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is published in the key of E minor (Relative key G major is in the chorus) and has a moderate rock tempo of 130 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from the key of E3 to E5. Through the lyrics of the song, Shakira urges her former lover not to [...] "bother" [...] feeling sorry for her after he chose another woman over her. She assures him that he [...] "won’t ever see me [...] cry" [...] and that she will move on in her life without him. The song contains a spoken bridge in which Shakira lists {{a number of things}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make him stay with her, such as [...] "move(ing) to a communist country", but admits that they would not have an effect on him. Pam Avoledo from Blogcritics found the theme of the song similar to the one in Shakira's 2002 single [...] "Objection (Tango)". Shakira described the song as a feminist anthem, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after her}} arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that [...] "a little birdie" [...] {{had told him}} that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. [...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Rodham was a {{favorite}} student of her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge. She participated in sports such as swimming and baseball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She has often told a story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program."After receiving more information from the National Air and Space Museum, specifically a [...] with a similar tone and message as the [...] and Clinton's account, we decided the claim met the [...] "reasonable person" [...] standard. We award Clinton the rare Geppetto Checkmark [...]"Full report: (Neither Clinton nor NASA has produced {{a copy of the}} actual response that she states she had received.) She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society. She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that [...] "you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president". For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed". She graduated in her class's top five percent in 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Vera {{asked if}} there was {{anything}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help with family matters. Inayat Khan said that, should she go missing, she would like Vera to avoid worrying her mother as far as possible. The normal procedure, as Inayat Khan knew, was that when an agent went to the field, Vera would send out a periodic [...] "good news" [...] letters to the family, letting them know the person concerned was well. If the agent went missing, the family would be told so. What Inayat Khan was suggesting was that bad news should be broken to her mother only if it was beyond any doubt that she was dead. Vera said she would agree to this arrangement if it was what she wanted. With this assurance Inayat Khan seemed content and confident once more. Any doubts in Vera's mind were also now settled.|$|E

60|$|Tess, meanwhile, {{as the one}} who {{had dragged}} her parents into this quagmire, was silently {{wondering}} what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme.|$|E

60|$|It {{made the}} little bride quite sad <b>to</b> think <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> show {{her love for}} the old man's heart. She used {{to think about it}} as she sat all alone during the long days, for her husband was almost always out.|$|R
60|$|The terrible Zog has surely {{been very}} clever {{in this last}} attempt to destroy them. Trot thought it all over, and she decided that inasmuch as the queen was unable to wave her fairy wand, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing <b>to</b> release herself or her friends.|$|R
60|$|Tearing off {{the blank}} side {{of one of}} her newly copied pages, Jo drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> add a little to the sum for her father.|$|R

60|$|Reuben had {{summed up}} the points against himself in a broken voice, and now broke into a passion of tears.

60|$|After breakfast was over, a {{procession}} was formed, {{headed by the}} Boolooroo, and they marched the prisoner through the palace until {{they came to the}} Room of the Great Knife.

60|$|He {{came to her}} {{and took}} her hand and set it to his lips, and all that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> was <b>to</b> gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom she had heard so many talk; the {{favorite}} of the Emperor; the wise young Otto of the Silver Hand.|$|R
60|$|The {{hotel was}} not far away, {{and in a few}} minutes my wife {{returned}} with a fishing-pole.
