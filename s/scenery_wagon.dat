25|$|A <b>scenery</b> <b>wagon,</b> {{also known}} as a stage wagon, is a mobile {{platform}} that is used to support and transport movable, three-dimensional theatrical scenery on a theater stage. In most cases, the scenery is constructed on top of the wagon such that the wagon, and the scenery it supports, forms a single, integrated structure. Heavy duty casters are mounted to the underside of the platform so that the entire assembly can be quickly moved onstage or offstage, so as to facilitate rapid scenery changes during live productions. Scenery wagons are built {{in a wide range of}} sizes, ranging from less than one square foot up to the size of the playing area of the stage.|$|E
2500|$|A lift jack is {{fundamentally}} a lever that {{attaches to the}} <b>scenery</b> <b>wagon</b> platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of the}} lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, the caster serves as a [...] to lift the wagon slightly above the stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.|$|E

5000|$|Stagehand: A {{technician}} {{responsible for}} moving scenery {{at the stage}} level, by manually carrying or rolling set pieces (e.g., <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons)</b> between the stage and the wings. This can include carrying on and off furniture, props, or scenery.|$|R

2500|$|To {{effect a}} <b>scenery</b> change, a <b>wagon</b> is simply rolled offstage {{to remove it}} from the set or rolled onstage to its {{designated}} position to {{add it to the}} set. In the latter case, the wagon must be immobilized after it has been positioned on the stage so that actors can safely interact with it (e.g., walk, stand, or jump on it) without causing the wagon to move. A number of methods and mechanisms are commonly used to immobilize, or [...] "lock" [...] <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons</b> in place: ...|$|R
50|$|In theatre, a {{platform}} (also {{referred to as}} a riser or rostrum) is a stationary, standard flat walking surface for actors to perform on. Typically, they are built to be assembled modularly. They are often used to provide varying levels, to make a show more visually interesting. They are also used to separate areas on stage, and as seating bleachers. This is in contrast to <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons,</b> which are mobile platforms that are supported by casters instead of feet.|$|R
25|$|Various caster {{types are}} used on <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons.</b> The choice of caster type for any {{particular}} wagon {{depends on a}} number of factors, including platform size and shape, scenery weight, production aesthetics and budget. Typically, casters are mounted so that the bottom of the platform is elevated approximately one-half to three-quarters of an inch above the stage. The number of casters required for a wagon depends on caster type and load rating as well as the size, shape and weight of the <b>wagon</b> and <b>scenery.</b>|$|R
50|$|A scenery shop or scene shop is a {{specialized}} workshop {{found in many}} medium or large theaters, {{as well as many}} educational theatre settings. The primary function of a scene shop is to fabricate and assemble the flats, platforms, <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons,</b> and other scenic (set) pieces required for a performance. Commonly, a scene shop is also the location where most of the set painting is done, and is sometimes used to make props. Generally, the individuals who work in a scene shop are carpenters, although, in bigger shops, it is common for metalworkers to be employed for steel-construction set pieces which require welding and other machining. It is common for the individuals working in a scene shop to be knowledgeable {{in a wide variety of}} technical skills, developed over time as required for specific construction needs.|$|R
50|$|Set {{construction}} {{is the process}} undertaken by a construction manager to build full-scale scenery, as specified by a production designer or art director working {{in collaboration with the}} director of a production to create a set for a theatrical, film or television production. The set designer produces a scale model, scale drawings, paint elevations (a scale painting supplied to the scenic painter of each element that requires painting), and research about props, textures, and so on. Scale drawings typically include a groundplan, elevation, and section of the complete set, as well as more detailed drawings of individual scenic elements which, in theatrical productions, may be static, flown, or built onto <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons.</b> Models and paint elevations are frequently hand-produced, though in recent years, many Production Designers and most commercial theatres have begun producing scale drawings with the aid of computer drafting programs such as AutoCAD or Vectorworks.|$|R
5000|$|During a {{theatrical}} technical rehearsal {{one of the}} Stage management team {{will be ready to}} mark positions as required. To enable spike placement to be done quickly, staff may pre-cut small strips of tape either by scoring tape still on the roll or by cutting strips of tape and placing them onto a small piece of wood or clipboard called a spike board. When spiking a position for a performer, a small cross is typically used. For furniture pieces and <b>scenery</b> <b>wagons,</b> the marks are usually two pieces of tape laid in an [...] "L" [...] shape at two points or corners of the item. Usually this will be the up-stage side to minimize the visual impact for the audience. In larger productions the Stage Manager will typically use different coloured spikes to differentiate the positions of various items and performers. Depending on the performance, writing will be placed on the spike to indicate what items are being marked, and in which Act and Scene the spike is used.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{success that}} night {{was so great that}} it {{appeared}} a pity not to permit other towns to witness our performance, hence we boldly organized a [...] "tour." [...] We booked a circuit which included St. Ansgar and Mitchell, two villages, one four, the other ten miles to the north. Audacious as this may seem, it was deliberately decided upon, and one pleasant day Mitchell and George and I loaded all our <b>scenery</b> into a <b>wagon</b> and drove away across the prairie to our first [...] "stand" [...] very much as Molière did in his youth, leaving the ladies to follow (in the grandeur of hired buggies) later in the day.|$|R
