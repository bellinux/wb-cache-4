5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, {{and because they}} had a new head coach, the Bears were given a two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach.

On the third week, {{a voluntary}} minicamp was held, and all coaches were permitted to work. From April 16–18, the Bears held two-hour non-contact drills, and held ten organized team activities (OTAs) during May 13 – June 6, followed by a mandatory minicamp from June 11–13.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium–uranium–titanium and plutonium–uranium–zirconium were {{investigated}} {{for use as}} nuclear fuels. The addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance, reduces flammability, and improves ductility, fabricability, <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> thermal expansion. Plutonium–uranium–molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance, forming a protective film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{an inventory of}} the <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses of small firms in a dynamic context. To do this it considers verbal accounts of the processes of innovation and diffusion, as well as quantitative studies testing cause-effect relations. ft consider both economic and noneconomic factors, concerning issues of motivation, perception and knowledge. First an overall summary is given {{of the characteristics of}} small business compared with large business, as a basis for an assessment of <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses. Perhaps the most important characteristic of small business is its diversity, and the article gives the conditions and sources of it. Other core characteristics are small scale, personality and independence of the small firm. From these, derived characteristics, <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses and core strategies can be inferred. From the perspective of the firm, <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses are subsequently analysed for the successive stages of innovation: invention, development, tooling/production, introduction to practice/market. <b>Strengths</b> <b>and</b> weaknesses in diffusion are analysed for the successive stages in the adoption process, as proposed by Rogers. Reference is made to theory and to empirical studies from the literature and from research by the present author...|$|R
40|$|New Lagrangians, {{depending}} on the field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> the electric and magnetic sources are found, which lead to the Maxwell equations. One new feature is that the equations of motion are obtained by varying the Lagrangian with respect to both the field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> the sources. In this way, conserved currents can be found for the field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> the electric or magnetic sources. Furthermore, using the equations of motion, the electric or magnetic sources can be eliminated, leading to conserved currents for the field strengths only (in the presence of electric and magnetic sources). Another new feature is {{the construction of a}} Lagrangian invariant under the duality transformation for both field <b>strengths</b> <b>and</b> electric and magnetic sources. The conserved current, after the elimination of electric and magnetic sources, depends on the field strengths only. The conserved quantity is related to the total helicity of the electromagnetic field. Comment: 27 page...|$|R
