25|$|The soft <b>spile</b> in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the <b>spile.</b> The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the <b>spile</b> clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft <b>spile</b> with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E

A keg has a single opening in the centre of the top to which a flow pipe is attached. Kegs are artificially pressurised after fermentation with carbon dioxide or a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas.|$|E

50|$|When {{used for}} making a new plank for a boat a piece of timber the same length as the desired plank but both thinner and {{narrower}} is cut. This is called the <b>spiling</b> batten. This is then temporarily attached to the boat {{in the place of}} the plank required. The shape of the plank required can then be traced onto the <b>spiling</b> batten using a compass, or a dummy stick. The <b>spiling</b> batten can then be lifted out and placed on the new stock, and moved around to find the optimum use of the stock material, then using the same compass or dummy stick, the exact shape required can be traced off the <b>spiling</b> batten onto the new stock, ready to be cut out.|$|R
500|$|Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are {{unfiltered}} and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed [...] "real ale" [...] by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask {{arrives in}} a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a [...] "stillage" [...] {{which is designed}} to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between [...] ), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard <b>spile</b> or other implement is used to open a hole {{in the side of the}} cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to [...] "drop" [...] (clear) again, as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being [...] "gravity-fed" [...] directly into the glass.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{landlord}} feels the beer has settled, {{and they are}} ready to serve it, they will knock a soft <b>spile</b> into the shive {{on the side of the}} cask. The major difference in appearance between a keg and a cask is the shive. A keg does not have a shive on the side. The majority of casks these days are metal, and look similar to a keg, but with the rounded traditional barrel shape (kegs are often straight-sided). Even though there are still some wooden casks around, these are rare; in fact there are more plastic casks around than wooden ones. Plastic casks are increasing in popularity because they are cheaper to buy and lighter to carry. Though they don't last as long, they are also less likely to be stolen as they have no melt-down value. Beer casks come in a number of sizes, but by far the most common in the pub trade are those of 9 gallons (72 pints or roughly 41 litres) which is known as a Firkin and 18 gallons (144 pints or roughly 83 litres) known as a Kilderkin. (N.B.These are imperial gallons, equal to 1.201 US gallons each.) ...|$|E
