5|$|The Harrietstown–Gabriels highway {{became a}} signed route {{once again in}} the early 1950s when it became NY192A. Both NY192 and NY192A {{remained}} unchanged through the late 1970s. On January7, 1980, NY192A was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> a realigned NY192. Maintenance of NY192's former routing between Gabriels and Bloomingdale was transferred to the counties it ran through—namely Franklin and Essex—in stages. The Franklin County portion was given to the county on April1, 1980, while the section in Essex County was transferred to county control on April1, 1985, as part of highway maintenance swaps between the state of New York and Franklin and Essex counties. On March28, 1989, NY192 was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> a realigned NY86.|$|E
5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of tantalum.|$|E
5|$|In August 1919, Hounslow Heath Aerodrome, in London, England was {{the first}} airport to operate {{scheduled}} international commercial services. It was closed and <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> Croydon Airport in March 1920. In the United States, Douglas Municipal Airport in Arizona became the first international airport of the Americas in 1928.|$|E

5|$|The Marcellus {{iron ore}} was {{actively}} mined in south Central Pennsylvania from its discovery {{in the late}} 18th century, until it was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> the rich ore beds of the Iron Range of Minnesota in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The first NY32A was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the segment of modern NY32 between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville in Saratoga County. At the time, NY32 was routed on what is now US4 between the two locations. The route was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> a realigned NY32 in the early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} written between 50 and 70 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek {{physician}} in the Roman army. It was widely read {{for more than}} 1,500 years until <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> revised herbals in the Renaissance, {{making it one of}} the longest-lasting of all natural history books.|$|E
6000|$|... 11. Resolved, That we {{approve the}} {{position}} {{taken by the}} Government {{that the people of}} the United States can never regard with indifference the attempt of any European power to overthrow by force or to <b>supplant</b> <b>by</b> fraud the institutions of any republican government on the Western Continent, and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as menacing to the peace and independence of their own country, the efforts of any such power to obtain new footholds for monarchical governments, sustained by foreign military force, in near proximity to the United States.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of computer-aided design (CAD), the use of drafting machines, especially in the professional sector, has drastically declined, <b>supplanted</b> first <b>by</b> pen plotters, and then by large-format inkjet printers.|$|R
25|$|By {{the late}} 2000s, CRT display {{technology}} was largely <b>supplanted</b> worldwide <b>by</b> flat-panel displays such as LCD. Flat-panel television, especially LCD, {{has become the}} dominant form of television since the early 2010s.|$|R
5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel he was already disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly {{with the implementation of}} Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{indication}} of a naming error, Engelmann's binomial was {{used to describe the}} plant until 1893, when F.A. Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description was lacking and possibly referred to as many as a dozen species, his binomial was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> Haage's.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E

50|$|The {{city was}} founded before {{the fourteenth century}} and {{gradually}} became the most important Tuareg city, <b>supplanting</b> Assodé, <b>by</b> growing around trans-Saharan trade. The city still sees the arrival of caravans, bringing salt from Bilma.|$|R
50|$|With {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, {{resources}} to build and maintain these complex machines became very scarce, so the ballista was <b>supplanted</b> initially <b>by</b> the simpler and cheaper onager and the more efficient springald.|$|R
5|$|From 1927 to {{the late}} 1930s, modern NY15 was part of NY2. As a result, all {{of what is now}} NY15A was {{originally}} designated as New York State Route2A as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Two parts of the route were sub-standard at the time; however, those sections were rebuilt in the early and mid-1930s. NY2 was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> an extended US15 in April1939, at which time NY2A was renumbered to NY15A to match its parent's new designation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even after}} being <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> its successor, Brood War {{competition}} remained popular {{for part of}} an audience and streaming channels of retired professional gamers kept popularity. Outside governance of Korean eSports Professional Association, amateur competitions started to gain popularity, and in 2014, few higher profile tournaments were announced - with prize pool matching competitions from the peak of popularity and one even returning to the television channel - OGN.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the first}} version of M-85 ran from then M-66 east to M-43 at Stanton in Montcalm County. This highway was later {{extended}} in 1929 from Stanton north to Edmore. By the end of 1930, this designation was removed when M-57 was extended through the area. A new M-85 was then designated between Mayville and Caro. This second designation was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> an extended and rerouted M-24 in late 1941 or early 1942.|$|E

50|$|The {{collection}} of books originated in Mrs. Bliss’s aim to preserve illustrated books from being broken up for individual plates. There are volumes of views which are especially valuable {{for the study of}} gardens since few of the sites survive as originally created. For example, Giovanni Battista Falda’s 17th-century plates showing the gardens of Rome; views of Versailles and other royal gardens in Louis XIV’s France by Perelle and Sylvestre; and Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff’s early-18th-century bird’s-eye views of English country estates. The latter works yield almost the only evidence of the appearance of these geometrical or regular designs before their <b>supplanting</b> <b>by</b> the irregular or “picturesque” taste.|$|R

5|$|Initially, the {{baseband}} pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International Telecommunication Union {{set a standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Jurisprudence {{was taught}} in Latin, {{even in the}} law schools of the East, but {{toward the end of}} the fourth and the {{beginning}} of the 5th century, Latin was <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> Greek at Beirut, which was the long-established lingua franca of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire. A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.|$|E
5|$|NY36A was an {{alternate}} route of NY36 between Dansville and Mount Morris. The route began at NY36 in Dansville and passed through Groveland {{on its way}} to the vicinity of Mount Morris, where it ended at a junction with NY63 northeast of the village. NY36A was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> a realigned NY63 in December1940.|$|E
2500|$|The series's main mobile suit (1st form) first {{appeared}} on [...] the PlayStation Vita game Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Force through the first Blu-ray volume serial code. The mobile suit (4th form) also appeared in the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita game Gundam Breaker 3 and the arcade Game Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs. Maxi Boost ON. Later, Gundam Barbatos 6th form, Gundam Barbatos Lupus, Gundam Gusion and Gusion Rebake, Gundam Kimaris and Gundam Astaroth was released as DLC units for Gundam Breaker 3.

5000|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, CRT [...] "picture tube" [...] display {{technology}} was almost entirely <b>supplanted</b> worldwide <b>by</b> flat panel displays. By the early 2010s, LCD TVs, which increasingly used LED-backlit LCDs, accounted for the overwhelming majority of television sets being manufactured.|$|R
25|$|Since {{utilities}} supply high-voltage AC, DC railways use converter {{stations to}} produce relatively low-voltage DC (usually 3000 volts or less). Originally they used rotary converters, {{a few of}} which are even still in operation, but most were <b>supplanted</b> first <b>by</b> mercury arc rectifiers and then by semiconductor rectifiers.|$|R
5|$|Recent evidence,shows that bloomeries {{were used}} in China, {{migrating}} in from the west as early as 800 BC, before being <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> the locally developed blast furnace. Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today).|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} barefoot hordes pushing heavily-loaded bicycles, driving oxcarts, or acting as human pack animals, moving {{hundreds}} {{of tons of}} supplies in this manner was quickly <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> trucks (especially Soviet, Chinese, or Eastern Bloc models), which quickly became the main method of supply transportation. As early as December 1961, the 3rd Truck Transportation Group of PAVN's General Rear Services Department had become the first motor transport unit fielded by North Vietnamese to work the trail {{and the use of}} motor transport escalated.|$|E
5|$|With the 1834 {{constitutional}} amendment {{known as the}} Additional Act, Provincial General Councils were <b>supplanted</b> <b>by</b> the Assembleias Legislativas Provinciais (Provincial Legislative Assemblies). The new Assemblies enjoyed much greater autonomy from the national government. A Provincial Assembly was composed of 36, 28 or 20 elected deputies, the number {{depending on the size}} of the province's population. The election of provincial deputies followed the same procedure as used to elect general deputies to the national Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
