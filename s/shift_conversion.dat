30|$|The water gas shift {{reaction}} {{is an essential}} step in modern ammonia plants. Efficient and reliable <b>shift</b> <b>conversion</b> is required {{to ensure that the}} highest yield of hydrogen can be obtained from the reformed hydrocarbons. Hence, good performance of the shift catalyst and attainment of equilibrium CO slip from the catalyst system is critical for the efficient and economic operation of the plant to maximize the hydrogen production from the plant. In most ammonia plants, the <b>shift</b> <b>conversion</b> is carried out in two stages. Usually, a high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst is used as the first stage and typically converts over 80 % of the CO. A low temperature shift catalyst (LTS) then converts the majority of the remaining CO [1]. As well as maximizing the hydrogen production, the water gas {{shift reaction}} also maximizes the CO 2 production from an ammonia plant. In addition, carbon oxides, both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (COx), are a poison to the ammonia synthesis catalyst and, therefore, must be removed. CO is converted into CO 2 for easier removal in the CO 2 removal system. CO 2 is an essential component for the Urea plant [1].|$|E
