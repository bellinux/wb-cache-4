On 1September, he destroyed a Bf109 and damaged two others during the Battle of Alam el Halfa, east of El Alamein. He claimed No.3 Squadron's 200th victim, a Bf109F, during the Battle of El Alamein on 28October. [...] Air Marshal Sir Peter Drummond, Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East, sent him a <b>signal</b> <b>reading</b> [...] "Heartiest congratulations to you and all ranks in the squadron on the achievement of your double century—not out". Around this time Gibbes also managed to fly Bf109F and G fighters captured from the Germans, and came away impressed. He was credited with another Bf109 on 17 November. On 21December, he landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain near Hun, Libya, to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down. Gibbes threw out his own parachute to make room in the cockpit for his passenger and lost part of his undercarriage taking off, necessitating a one-wheeled landing back at base. Recommended for the Victoria Cross for this action, he was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Order, which was promulgated on 15January 1943 and cited his [...] "outstanding qualities of leadership and enthusiasm". Gibbes himself crash landed behind enemy lines on 14January 1943, walking [...] in the desert before being {{picked up by a}} British Army patrol. He was awarded a bar to his DFC for this feat, and for his [...] "exceptional leadership, skill and courage, contributing in a large measure {{to the success of the}} squadron he commands".

50|$|Bed {{of nails}} {{fixtures}} require a mechanical assembly {{to hold the}} PCB in place. Fixtures can hold the PCB with either a vacuum or pressing {{down from the top}} of the PCB. Vacuum fixtures give better <b>signal</b> <b>reading</b> versus the press-down type. On the other hand, vacuum fixtures are expensive because of their high manufacturing complexity. Moreover, vacuum fixtures cannot be used on bed-of-nails systems that are used in automated production lines, where the board is automatically loaded to the tester by a handling mechanism.The bed of nails or fixture, as generally termed, is used together with an in-circuit tester. Fixtures with a grid of 0.8 mm for small nails and test point diameter 0.6 mm are theoretically possible without using special constructions. But in mass production, test point diameters of 1.0 mm or higher are normally used to minimise contact failures leading to lower remachining costs.|$|E

40|$|Replacing old {{buildings}} with new structures {{is an expensive}} proposition, but the service life of existing buildings can be extended by improving facilities maintenance. In particular, effective use of information technology can improve facilities maintenance and reduce maintenance costs. In recent years, some scholars have begun to apply Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to facilities maintenance. The present study examines the effective reading range for RFID applications {{within the context of}} facilities maintenance, where such applications can provide advantages including automatic reading and encoding of equipment, rapid reading and encoding of tag information, and tag-based data storage. However, the reading range of RFID tags can be limited by the presence of water vapor, electrical appliances, and metal surfaces. Through practical onsite testing, the study examines how effective reading range is impacted by dust, water, metal surfaces and electrical equipment, along with various reading and writing angles. Experimental results show that the presence of dust and water both have insignificant impacts on RFID <b>signal</b> <b>reading.</b> However, metal surfaces were found to have a significant negative effect on <b>signal</b> <b>reading</b> and RFID tags should be kept an appropriate distance from such materials. The results of this study can be taken as reference for the use of RFID in facilities maintenance and management...|$|E

In initial magnetization and over saturation region, amplitude and pulse width of isolated <b>read</b> <b>signal</b> are both determined by the sum of I_w and I_b; whereas in over-bias demagnetization region, <b>read</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude follows I_w/I_b ratio.

30|$|The unique {{capability}} of nanoscale sensors to detect {{biological and chemical}} substances is complicated by their extreme sensitivity to the sizes, placements, and energetics of the active species, {{as well as those}} of cross-reactions. Studying the effects of these factors requires deep physical modelling of these sensors. Mean-field finite-element modelling has been used to quantify the signal variations due to several common phenomena in biosensors. It is shown that poor level of control during fabrication is very likely to result in significant errors in <b>signal</b> <b>reading.</b> This model can also be integrated with molecular dynamics models or Monte Carlo simulations to assist in the study of noise in biosensors. Proper physical simulation will allow the identification of fabrication targets that allow commercial, low-cost fabrication of such sensors with high accuracy and reliability.|$|E

40|$|Two {{different}} approaches for the automatic compensation of pressure effects on thermal flow sensors are investigated. One approach operates in the analog domain {{and it is}} based on a closed-loop circuit that uses a pressure dependent signal to keep the sensor output constant.

This system can monitor and characterize {{up to three}} TEGs simultaneously and is comprised of two main electronic circuits: {{the first one is}} composed of 12 input channels being three for reading voltage, three for reading current by making use of instrumentation amplifiers (ACS 712), and six thermocouples for <b>signal</b> <b>reading</b> (< 400 ∘C). The second electronic circuit consists of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with two pulse width modulation (PWM) input channels for controlling the heat (thermoresistance) and cooling (controlled cooler) sources, respectively, following a predefined temperature gradient. The TEG measured data for the voltage, current, and temperature can be acquired in real-time with an application written on Delphi language and displayed both through a numeric and graphical display. In order to validate the precision and accuracy two commercial TEG modules (inbC 1 - 127. 08 HTS) compatible with temperatures up to 200 ∘C without signal degradation were used in series.
