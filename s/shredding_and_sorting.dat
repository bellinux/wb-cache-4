40|$|For some years, massive {{spreading}} of technically {{complex products}} {{as well as}} reduction of product life cycles {{has led to a}} constantly rising return flow of discarded technical devices. The situation of the cycle ecnomomy can be improved by two different approaches. First, available <b>shredding</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b> technologies can be developed further, second, disassembling processes can be improved. With increasing importance of remanufacturing problems of disassembly in general and disassembly planning in particular have to be investigated. The main problems of disassembly planning are uncertainty and complexity. The target of this approach consists of identifying problems with disassembly planning and of presenting proposed solutions on the basis of an adapted conventional PPC-system (MRP II-concept). Therefore already established elements (i. e. disturbance management, variant management, co-production, multiple bill-of-materials) have to be checked for their application potentials within the area of disassembly. Apart from adjustments, which take place within conventional PPC-systems, an independent prognosis concept (to be implemented in, or attached to PPC-systems) will also be introduced. (orig.)

40|$|Virtually {{all of the}} {{material}} in today's automobiles can technically be recycled. The challenge facing engineers is making this recycling process economical, especially for materials in such components as seats and instrument panels. Recycling these components requires the different materials to be separated so that each can be recycled individually. This separation can be accomplished either manually, where workers disassembly <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> the vehicle components by hand, or mechanically, where the vehicle is <b>shredded</b> <b>and</b> {{the material}}s <b>sorted</b> by properties such as conductivity and density. In this paper, the usefulness of including likely separation techniques in DFR guidelines is discussed. Three vehicles were dismantled at the VRDC {{as part of an}} effort to establish a baseline of current vehicle recyclability. Concurrently, this allowed examination of the effectiveness of the early design for recycling (DFR) efforts. The applicability of common design guidelines to the two types of separation is discussed, and a simple method for determining the appropriate separation process in the early stages of design is presented...|$|R
50|$|Appliance {{recycling}} {{consists of}} dismantling waste home appliances and scrapping their parts for reuse. Recycling appliances for their original or other purposes, involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components {{and destruction of}} the end-of-life equipment to recover materials, generally by <b>shredding,</b> <b>sorting</b> <b>and</b> grading. The rate at which appliances are discarded has increased with technological advancement. This correlation directly leads {{to the question of}} appropriate disposal. The main types of appliances that are recycled are televisions, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. When appliances are recycled, they can be looked upon as valuable resources. If disposed of improperly, appliances can become environmentally harmful and poison ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|Issue: Rubber {{is a good}} heat {{insulator}} and contains {{a significant amount of}} volatile organic material. Under proper conditions (heat and oxygen), it may burn. Best Practice: This best practice describes various steps and precautions for minimizing/eliminating recycled rubber combustion and flammability. All automotive rubber products such as hose, mats, and belts must meet FMVSS 302 standards. Other specifications that rubbery material must meet are UL 94, ASTM D 470, C 542 and C 864. The release of volatiles upon burning rubber is of concern. ASTM D 4205 - 93 describes test methods for determining flammability and combustion properties of rubbery materials. A copy is attached. Implementation: Process and store materials at ambient temperatures. Avoid build-up of static electricity which may cause combustion. All processing and storage areas should be strictly “non-smoking. ” Recycled rubber handlers need to have information on volatility of the material from MSDSs. A copy of a MSDS, as an example, is attached in the Material Storage Best Practice. It is best to avoid static build-up during <b>shredding,</b> grinding, <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b> steps. This is achieved by properly grounding processing equipment. Appendix I lists comparative Btu valves of TCF (tire-chip fuel) and TDF (tire-derived fuel) to give an idea regarding the extent of heat generated during the burning of these materials. Benefits: The major benefit is the reduction of fires in manufacturing, the storage of recycled rubber, and in the use of recycled rubber. Also, special care should be taken to remove hot wire during processing to help eliminate any fire...|$|R

40|$|The peoples {{demand of}} {{functions}} {{and services in}} cities is the driver for energy and material flows. Most {{people in the world}} are now living in urban areas. In order to achieve a sustainable development of cities, both resource use and environmental impact have to be reduced. For construction activities, an important aspect is to increase the reuse of construction materials. From a resource perspective, the urban demand for construction of buildings, infrastructure and other facilities results in materials accumulated in constructions but also in other applications and in landfills. The materials can be described as the urban material stock where some materials are used and others are not used, i. e. wasted. There are many cases where material stocks are used for construction purposes. For example, used concrete and bricks, excavated soil and rock from construction projects and other wasted materials such as rubber from tires can be crushed, <b>shredded</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorted</b> to granules <b>and</b> used in many different construction applications. Different perspectives can be applied when assessing the environmental impacts of using stocked material in construction. The overall aim of this thesis is to study the environmental impacts of using granular soil, rock and rubber in construction. For soil and rock, the aim is to study the environmental impact of material management in urban areas. For granular rubber, the aim is to study the environmental impact of artificial turf from a life cycle perspective and from different infill materials of recycled and new rubber and plastics.   The literature of excavated soil and rock was reviewed in order to identify and quantify the material flows and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the management of soil and rock materials. For artificial turf and the different infill materials, a life cycle approach was used to quantify the energy use and GHG emissions. A chemical analysis of potential chemical leaching from the different infill materials to water was conducted in order to compare potential local emissions to water.   Based on the results, it was concluded that the knowledge about the urban flows of excavated soil and rock is lacking in terms of patterns, quantities, qualities and its environmental performance. A resource perspective is missing in the literature. However, the recycling of soil and rock can reduce resource use and GHG emissions. It was suggested that models are developed that take into account future material demand and availability to soils and rock. From such information it would be able to assess sustainable management practices and the possibilities of sharing materials between urban construction projects in order to reduce resource use and environmental impact.   It was concluded that for the life cycle of artificial turf, the production of construction materials contributes largely to energy use and GHG emissions. Differences in terms of energy use and GHG emissions for the production of infill materials are large. The production of new material required more energy and resulted in more GHG emissions than using recycled rubber. The potential release of substances from infill materials to water were shown to be possible for all infill materials analyzed. Previous assessments of local environmental impacts of using infills generally concludes that the impacts are small. These assessments are primarily focused on infill of recycled tires. It is therefore concluded that environmental assessments of local impact should include all infill types.   Environmental assessments of using stocked materials in construction should take into consideration the material applications´ significance for the environmental impacts at a higher system level. Broader system boundaries in environmental assessments will reduce the risk for sub-optimizations when taking decisions on how materials should be used in construction. ...|$|R
