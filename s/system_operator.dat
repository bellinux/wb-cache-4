5|$|One MiG-9 (izdeliye FK) was {{modified}} in 1949 {{to serve as}} a testbed for the Raduga KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance <b>system</b> <b>operator.</b> The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing {{at the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.|$|E

25|$|There is {{therefore}} a physical requirement for a controlling agency, the transmission <b>system</b> <b>operator,</b> to coordinate the dispatch of generating units to meet the expected demand of the system across the transmission grid. If there is a mismatch between supply and demand the generators speed up or slow down causing the system frequency (either 50 or 60 hertz) to increase or decrease. If the frequency falls outside a predetermined range the <b>system</b> <b>operator</b> will act to add or remove either generation or load.|$|E

30|$|Advanced {{metering}} infrastructure (AMI) [23] is {{an excellent}} example of how IoT technologies could lead to a win–win situation between <b>system</b> <b>operators</b> and customers. AMI employs smart meters to measure, transmit, and store high-fidelity demand-side information (e.g., active power consumption, voltage magnitude). Smart meters are by nature sophisticated IoT devices that support automated demand response for customers while facilitating voltage and outage management for power <b>system</b> <b>operators.</b> Smart meters are remotely accessible by power <b>system</b> <b>operators</b> which allow operators to get a more accurate information on energy usage and load patterns across ADN and locate outages at customer sites without the necessity of reporting by customers. Meanwhile, smart meters offer power <b>system</b> <b>operators</b> an ideal tool to track and guide customer participation in demand response. More specifically, when power <b>system</b> <b>operators</b> implement dynamic pricing initiatives based on AMI, customers are motivated to reduce or shift their power demand based on the pricing information provided by smart meters without significantly impacting customer comfort or convenience [24, 25].|$|R

25|$|According to the {{subsequent}} Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's investigation and report, numerous energy trading companies, many based in Texas, such as Enron Corporation, illegally restricted their {{supply to the}} point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts. Rolling blackouts affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000 and San Diego Gas & Electric Company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in August 2000. On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the California Independent <b>System</b> <b>Operator</b> (CAISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.|$|E
25|$|Hydro-Québec's {{expertise}} {{at building}} and operating {{a very high}} voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the electrical industry.

TransÉnergie manages the flow of energy on the Quebec network and ensures non-discriminatory access to all participants involved in the wholesale market. The non-discriminatory access policy allows a company such as Nalcor to sell some of its share of power from Churchill Falls on the open market in the State of New York using TransÉnergie's network, upon payment of a transmission fee.|$|E
25|$|As closely {{neighboring}} countries, Israel and Cyprus {{have enjoyed}} greatly improving diplomatic relations since 2010. During the Mount Carmel Forest Fire, Cyprus dispatched two aviation assets to assist fire-fighting operations in Israel – {{the first time}} Cypriot Government aircraft were permitted to operate from Israeli airfields in a non-civil capacity. In addition, Israel and Cyprus have closely cooperated in maritime activities relating to Gaza, since 2010, and have reportedly begun an extensive sharing program of regional intelligence to support mutual security concerns. On 17 May 2012, it was widely reported that the Israeli Air Force had been granted unrestricted access to the Nicosia Flight Information Region of Cyprus, and that Israeli aviation assets may have operated over the island itself. Cyprus, as a former S-300 air-defense <b>system</b> <b>operator,</b> was speculated by Greek media to have assisted Israel in strategic planning to challenge such air-defense systems, alongside shorter-range SAM systems, although this remains unconfirmed.|$|E

25|$|The Movie Channel traces {{its history}} to the {{development}} of Gridtronics, a pay television service which delivered videotaped movies to cable systems throughout the United States. The concept was originally developed in the late 1960s by Alfred Stern and Gordon Fuqua, both executives at multiple <b>system</b> <b>operator</b> Television Communications Corporation (TVC) at the time, as part of a multi-channel service that was designed to include channels focusing on the arts, instructional programming and medical programs. The video-to-cable movie delivery concept was presented by Fuqua and Stern at the 1969 National Cable Television Association Convention. Over {{the course of the next}} several years, the two men subsequently discussed carriage agreements with other cable providers to distribute Gridtronics and engaged in discussions with various film studios to provide film content for the service. TVC was purchased by Warner Communications in 1972, and gave the service the financial funding and content that it needed to launch.|$|E
25|$|On October 21, the Harris Fire {{damaged and}} {{disabled}} the Southwest Power Link, a 500,000-volt power line from Arizona to San Diego. Power outages {{were reported in}} Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and other counties on October 22 to 333,500 Southern California Edison customers, most being restored within 24 hours. The power outage also affected the areas of Ojai, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, Thousand Oaks, Agoura Hills, Rialto, Fontana, San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga, Mira Loma, Hesperia, Corona, Bloomington, Irvine, Calimesa and Rubidoux. This outage also caused 230 people to be without power in Malibu. The California Independent <b>System</b> <b>Operator</b> Corp declared an energy transmission emergency in southern California on October 23, due to wildfires affecting the lines. 500,000-, 230,000- and 138,000-volt lines were disabled in San Diego, and some lines in other areas were also disabled. 24,992 people lost power, {{due to the lack}} of power from the power grid.

25|$|HBO {{pioneered the}} free preview concept – {{which has since}} become a {{standard}} in the pay television industry – in 1973, {{as part of a}} plan to increase subscribership of the channel. Cable providers were originally granted permission to carry HBO on a local origination channel in order for those who are not subscribers the ability to view the channel for a limited number of days; with the advent of digital cable and satellite, providers now unencrypt the designated slots of each HBO channel during preview periods. Until the mid-1990s, on-air promotions featured between programs were replaced (and later, merely interspersed) with interstitials featuring on-air hosts asking viewers to subscribe to the service. Although participation was voluntary, preview events are carried by most major and some smaller pay television providers (the number of providers and the providers that choose to offer the event varies depending on the given free preview period, and may not be carried on all systems owned by a multiple <b>system</b> <b>operator</b> unless at the provider's discretion); HBO currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers (which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series, and in the past, a high-profile special or feature film).|$|E
