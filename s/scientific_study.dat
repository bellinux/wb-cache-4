5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E

5|$|Conchology is the <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> of mollusc shells, but {{the term}} conchologist is also {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a collector of shells.

5|$|During his {{university}} {{studies at the}} École, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars, Charles Bernard Renouvier and Émile Boutroux.

5|$|Miller's career started {{during the}} reign of behaviorism in psychology. Behaviorists {{questioned}} whether mental thought processes were fit for <b>scientific</b> <b>study,</b> not being observable. They focused on working with responses to stimuli, particularly among other animals. Miller disagreed. He, Jerome Bruner, and Noam Chomsky are considered the founders of the field of Cognitive Psychology that replaced behaviorism as the framework for analyzing the mind.|$|E

5|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> {{of dinosaurs}} {{began in the}} 1820s of England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur, which under his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious {{scientist}} who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage {{in the perception of}} dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> of {{language}} is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy {{of language}}, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. The <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> of how insects, {{individually}} or as a community, {{interact with the}} surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most}} important roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a <b>scientific</b> <b>study</b> of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
