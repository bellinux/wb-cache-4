40|$|Uncertainties in {{residential}} property investment performance require that real estate assets are designed flexible {{in order to}} respond to impacts of market dynamics. Though estimating the cost of flexibility is straightforward, assessing the economic value of flexibility is not. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the potential practical application of real option analysis to determine the economic value of a <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> flexibility embedded in a residential property investment in Australia. The study involves the exploration of an optimal strategy for investment in a residential development through real option analysis and valuation of a mixed use investment. The real option valuation model developed by McDonald and Siegel (1986) is adopted for the evaluation because the <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> flexibility is likened to a perpetual American call option with dividend payouts. Through real option analysis, the economic value of <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> flexibility of the mixed use building was determined to be higher than the initial upfront costs. Moreover, a payoff of about 4 million was determined to be the value of the <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> flexibility, therefore justifying upfront investments in flexibility as an uncertainty and risk management tool. This application is an important demonstration of the practical use of options pricing techniques (real options analysis) and delivers further evidence needed to support the adoption of real option tools in practice. Flexibility can also enhance risks and uncertainty management {{in residential}} property investment better than the adjustment of discount rates. There is limited evidence on the use of real options techniques for the valuation of <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> flexibility in practice and this comes as an original application; both the case study and data are all initial applications of switching flexibility in the Australian property market...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved variable-band hysteresis current controller for a two-level three-phase {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI). The controller takes the average voltages of the phase-leg <b>switched</b> <b>outputs</b> as an approximation to the load back-EMF voltages, and uses these results to vary the hysteresis bands so as to maintain constant phase-leg switching frequencies. The switching frequency control process is then further refined by fine tuning the hysteresis band variations to synchronize the zero crossings of the phase-leg current errors with a fixed reference clock so as to achieve a nearest space vector switching sequence, which further ensures that the <b>switched</b> <b>output</b> spectrum has been optimized. Finally, a technique is proposed to replace the third phase-leg current regulator with a fixed-frequency open-loop pulse-width modulator, where its commanded reference is generated from the average <b>switched</b> <b>output</b> voltages {{of the other two}} phase legs. This avoids the hazard of the three independent hysteresis current regulators adversely interacting with each other in a conventional system, resulting from an overconstrained control problem with only two degrees of freedom. Additionally, this approach allows the linear modulation range to be increased by adding a common-mode third-harmonic component to the third phase-leg reference command signal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new hysteresis current regulation {{strategy for the}} neutral point clamped and flying capacitor (FC) three-level inverters. The strategy uses the measured average of the <b>switched</b> phase leg <b>output</b> voltage to adjust the controller hysteresis band as the load back EMF varies to maintain a near constant phase leg switching frequency. The phase leg switchings are then fine tuned to a fixed frequency clock to further improve frequency regulation.

The resulting controller achieves a line-to-line harmonic performance that is very close to open-loop phase disposition pulse width modulation, while retaining all of the dynamic benefits of hysteresis current regulation...|$|R

These designs {{are based on}} a delay-insensitive (DI) logic paradigm known as null convention logic (NCL), which supports useful properties for resisting SCAs including dual-rail encoding, clock-free operation, and monotonic transitions. Potential benefits include reduced and more uniform switching activities and reduced signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. A novel method to further augment NCL AES hardware with random voltage scaling technique is also presented for additional security. Thereby, the proposed components leak significantly less side-channel information than conventional clocked approaches.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{wireless}} devices has grown tremendously {{over the last}} decade. Great technology improvements and novel transceiver architectures and circuits have enabled an astonishingly expanding set of radio-frequency applications. CMOS technology {{played a key role}} in enabling a large-scale diffusion of wireless devices due to its unique advantages in cost and integration. Novel digital-intensive transceivers have taken full advantage of CMOS technology scaling predicted by Moore's law. Die-shrinking has enabled ubiquitous diffusion of low-cost, small form factor and low power wireless devices. However, Radio Frequency (RF) Power Amplifiers (PA) transceiver functionality is historically implemented in a module which is separated from the CMOS core of the transceiver. The PA is traditionally dictating power and battery life of the transceiver, thus justifying its implementation in a tailored technology. By contrast, a fully integrated CMOS transceiver with no external PA would hugely benefit in terms of reduced area and system complexity. In this work, a fully integrated prototype of a Switched-Capacitor Power Amplifier (SCPA) has been implemented in a 28 nm CMOS technology. The SCPA provides the functionalities of a PA and of a Radio-Frequency Digital-to-Analog Converter (RF-DAC) in a monolithic CMOS device. The <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> stage of the SCPA enables this circuital topology to reach high efficiencies and offers excellent power handling capabilities. In this work, the properties of the SCPA are analyzed in an extensive and detailed dissertation. Nowadays Wireless Communications operate in a very crowded spectrum, with strict coexistence requirements, thus demanding a strong linearity to the RF-DAC section of the SCPA. A great part of the work of designing a good SCPA is in fact designing a good RF-DAC. To enhance RF-DAC linearity, a precision of the timing of the elements up to the ps range is required. The use of a single core-supply voltage in the whole circuit including the CMOS inverter of the <b>switching</b> <b>output</b> stage enables the use of minimum size devices, improving accuracy and speed in the timing of the elements. The whole circuit operates therefore on low core-supply voltage. Throughout this work, a detailed analysis carefully describes the electromagnetic structures which maximize power and efficiency of low-voltage SCPAs. Due to layout issues subsequent to limited available voltages, however, there is a practical limitation in the maximum achievable power of low-voltage SCPAs. In this work, a Multi-Port Monolithic Power Combiner (PC) is introduced to overcome this limitation and further enhance total achieved system power. The PC sums the power of a collection of SCPAs to a single output, allowing higher output powers at a high efficiency. Benefits, drawbacks and design of SCPA PCs are discussed in this work. The implemented circuit features the combination of four differential SCPAs through a four-way monolithic PC and is simulated to obtain a maximum drain efficiency of 44...|$|E
