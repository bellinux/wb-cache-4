5|$|Maxwell {{was again}} {{selected}} for officer training, and on 5 July, he was posted to No. 6 Officers' Cadet Battalion. He {{was promoted to}} company sergeant major on 7 August, before rejoining the 18th Battalion on 11 September. Nine days later, he was engaged in action near Westhoek during the Third Battle of Ypres when he performed the deeds that earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal. In the battle, the commander of a platoon was killed; Maxwell took command and led it into attack. Noticing {{that one of the}} newly captured positions was under heavy fire, Maxwell dashed to it and led the men to a <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> tactically secure position, thus minimizing casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E

50|$|On 8 September 2008, the 24th MEU {{returned}} {{control of}} Garmsir to British forces, after having operated {{in the area}} for approximately 130 days. The town was deemed <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> stable.|$|R
5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E

25|$|A bike box or an {{advanced}} stop line is a designated area {{at the head of}} a traffic lane at a signalized intersection that provides bicyclists with a <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> visible way to get ahead of queuing traffic during the red signal phase.|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{alcohols}} like TAA {{cannot be}} oxidised to aldehyde or carboxylic acid metabolites, {{which are often}} toxic; this makes them safer drugs than primary alcohols. However, like other tertiary alcohol based anaesthetics (e.g. methylpentynol, ethchlorvynol) TAA was eventually superseded by <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> effective agents.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{reports in}} medical {{literature}} describe serious scarring and damage to normal skin by escharotic substances. Given these side-effects, {{its use in}} treatment is not warranted as there are much <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> effective alternatives, such as radiation therapy and Mohs surgery.|$|E
30|$|Overall, novel {{formulations}} of transdermal ibuprofen using diverse delivery {{methods have been}} demonstrated to be <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> efficacious than commercial preparations in studies using both animal models and the human epidermis. Optimum formulations using these techniques should be incorporated into clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of transdermal ibuprofen to traditional methods of delivery.|$|R

25|$|Mushing for {{utilitarian}} purposes includes {{anything from}} hauling wood or delivering milk or the mail to rural travel and equipment hauling.

25|$|The UR-700, Glushko said, {{could enable}} a direct-ascent {{trajectory}} to the Moon which he considered <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> reliable than the rendezvous-and-dock approach {{used by the}} Apollo program and Korolev's N-1 proposals.

25|$|Cricket's {{history in}} Pakistan predates the {{creation}} of the country in 1947. The first ever international cricket match in Karachi was held on 22 November 1935 between Sindh and Australian cricket teams. The match was seen by 5,000 Karachiites. Karachi is also the place that innovated tape ball, a <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> affordable alternative to cricket.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest public}} works {{projects}} in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a <b>safer</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted {{the construction of new}} projects.|$|E
50|$|Wire crates usually can be folded {{for storage}} or transport, {{although}} it might be difficult to do and they are fairly heavy for their size. They provide more airflow for the dog and provide people with a clearer view inside and they range in size. Such crates are often used in car travel, at veterinary hospitals, and at kennels. There {{are a variety of}} covers and pads available to make crates <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> comfortable.|$|R
60|$|While this {{plotting}} {{was going}} on, Roger {{and those with}} him were picking their way with care over the loose stones that covered the ridge of rocks where the great landslide had taken place. Here traveling was exceedingly dangerous and often they had to proceed on foot, for fear of going down into some hollow. None of the footing seemed to be <b>safe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> than once Tom Dillon shook his head doubtfully.|$|R
25|$|Since iPSCs {{can only}} be {{produced}} with high efficiency at this time using modifications, they are generally predicted to be less <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> tumorigenic than hESC. All the genes that {{have been shown to}} promote iPSC formation have also been linked to cancer in one way or another. Some of the genes are known oncogenes, including the members of the Myc family. While omitting Myc allows for IPSC formation, the efficiency is reduced up to 100 fold.|$|R
