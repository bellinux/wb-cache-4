It {{is part of the}} Kurgan-hypothesis/Revvised Steppe Theory. Historical linguistics provides the main basis for the theory, analysing the development and changes of languages, and establishing relations between the various Indo-European languages, and the time frame wherein these languages developed. It also provides information about shared words, and the corresponding area of the origin of Indo-European, and the <b>specific</b> <b>vocabulary</b> which is to be ascribed to specific regions. The linguistic analyses and data are supplemented with archaeological data and anthropological arguments, which together provide a coherent model that is widely accepted.|$|E

25|$|From {{the early}} 19th century the Authorized Version has {{remained}} almost completely unchanged – and since, due to advances in printing technology, it {{could now be}} produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant world. Academic debate through that century, however, increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars: (a) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible – {{both in terms of}} <b>specific</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text.|$|E

[...] Among horse aficionados, a common assessment is that [...] "... is only used by people with one horse or with two hundred."

2500|$|The {{grouping}} of Dacian, Illyrian and Thracian languages into a Thraco-Illyrian {{branch of the}} Indo-European language family, a widespread idea {{in the first half}} of the 20thcentury, has lost popularity because of the lack of convincing evidence. Similarly, the supposed close relationship between Dacian and Thracian remains unproven. There are around 100 Romanian words with a possible substratum origin, but the language from which they were transferred cannot be determined. Around 30% of these words represent the <b>specific</b> <b>vocabulary</b> of sheep- and goat-breeding. Moreover, about 70 possible substrate words, have Albanian cognates. István Schütz argues that the fact that [...] "the same Albanian phone is represented by multiple phones in Romanian, and the same Romanian phone may derive from different Albanian phones" [...] suggests an [...] "AlbanianRomanian symbiosis" [...] lasting more than one century. Alexandru Madgearu and other scholars refuse this idea, stating that [...] "the common elements are less significant than the differences" [...] between the two languages. Albanian, Romanian and other languages sharing some common morphological and syntactic characteristics form together a supposed [...] "Balkan linguistic union". These common features include the postposed definite articles and the merger of the dative case and possessive case. Whether they represent a common substrate language, or convergent development is still a matter of debate among linguists.|$|E

This formalized knowledge can be used for enriching interactive document browsing, for enabling multi-dimensional metadata queries over documents and collections, and for exporting Linked Data to the Semantic Web and thus enabling further reuse. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In many {{heritage}} institutes, {{objects are}} routinely described using terms from predefined vocabularies.

A domain lexicon contains substantial domain <b>specific</b> <b>vocabularies</b> with associated phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic/pragmatic information as well as links to general knowledge bases which are rich enough to support knowledge-intensive models for practical NLP systems.

In order to suit for both maximal reusability and deep analysis, our domain lexicon is designed with uniform knowledge representation and fine-grain feature encoding. We also address the issues of how to bridge the gaps between coarse-grain general lexicons and fine-grain domain lexicons. Keywords: Lexical database, Ontology, Finance domain lexico...|$|R

I discovered that students used vocabulary more frequently in their written explanations by providing definitions of vocabulary versus using the vocabulary in context. I found little to no evidence suggesting that my students’ mathematical achievement changed through more practice on written communication; however, I did find as my expectations for the quality of students’ written explanations increased, most of my students improved their written explanations of problems and my teaching became more deliberate and specific.

40|$|Abstract. Coupling of cross-organizational {{business}} processes in electronic markets {{is a difficult}} and time-consuming task. In practice {{business processes}} are geographically distributed which makes it particulary difficult for business partners to coordinate their supply chains and customer relationship management with business units. By using formal description languages such as Petri nets for modeling inter-organizational business processes, purely syntactic composition problems of distributed business environments can be solved. However, the missing semantic representation of Petri nets can hamper the interconnectivity of business processes. Usually, several business partners, even if they share similar demands, have their own <b>specific</b> <b>vocabularies.</b> By representing business processes with Petri nets {{in combination with the}} Web Ontology Language (OWL) our approach provides flexibility, ease of integration and a significant level of automation of loosely coupled business processes even if they do not share their respective vocabularies. ...|$|R
