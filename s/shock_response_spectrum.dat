40|$|Pyrotechnic release {{devices such}} as {{explosive}} bolts are prevalent for many applications due to their merits: high reliability, high power-to-weight ratio, reasonable cost, and more. However, pyroshock generated by an explosive event can cause failures in electric components. Although pyroshock propagations are relatively well understood through many numerical and experimental studies, the prediction of pyroshock generation {{is still a very}} difficult problem. This study proposes a numerical method for predicting the pyroshock of a ridge-cut explosive bolt using a commercial hydrocode (ANSYS AUTODYN). A numerical model is established by integrating fluid-structure interaction and complex material models for high explosives and metals, including high explosive detonation, shock wave transmission and propagation, and stress wave propagation. To verify the proposed numerical scheme, pyroshock measurement experiments of the ridge-cut explosive bolts with two types of surrounding structures are performed using laser Doppler vibrometers (LDVs). The numerical analysis results provide accurate prediction in both the time (acceleration) and frequency domains (maximax <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> <b>spectra).</b> In maximax <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> <b>spectra,</b> the peaks due to vibration modes of the structures are observed in both the experimental and numerical results.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} dynamical equations of tilted {{support spring}} packaging system with critical components were obtained under {{the action of}} half-sine pulse. To evaluate the shock characteristics of the critical components, a new concept of three-dimensional <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> <b>spectrum</b> was proposed. The ratio of the maximum shock response acceleration of the critical components to the peak pulse acceleration, the dimensionless pulse duration, and the frequency parameter ratio of system or the angle of tilted support spring system were three basic parameters of the three-dimensional <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Based on the numerical results, {{the effects of the}} peak pulse acceleration, the angle of the tilted support spring, the frequency parameter ratio, and the mass ratio on the <b>shock</b> <b>response</b> <b>spectrum</b> were discussed.

A concise means of bounding the time domain inputs would be of great benefit in reducing the variation in the resulting shock tests.

NASA Headquarters-Office of Chief Engineer requested Langley Research Center (LaRC) study pyrotechnic alternatives using non-explosive actuators (NEA's), and LARC participated with Lockheed Martin Missile and Space Co. (LMMSC) -Sunnyvale, CA in objectively evaluating applicability of some NEA mechanisms to reduce small spacecraft and booster separation event shock. Comparative tests were conducted on a structural simulator using five different separation nut mechanisms, consisting of three pyrotechnics from OEA-Aerospace and Hi-Shear Technology and two NEA's from G&H Technology and Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA) -Denver, CO. Multiple actuations were performed with preloads up to 7000 pounds, 7000 being the comparison standard.

Specifically, electronics have been incorporated into avionics com-ponents installed in aircraft. This equipment is exposed to dynamic loads such as vibration, shock, and acceleration. Especially, avionics components installed in a helicopter are subjected to simulta-neous sine and random base excitations. These are denoted as sine on random vibrations according to MIL-STD- 810 F, Method 514. 5. In the past, isolators have been applied to avionics components to reduce vibration and shock.

For shock events produced by pyrotechnic devices, SRS can have significant frequency content {{as high as}} 10 kHz. It is difficult to construct and analyze finite element models that can resolve dynamic behavior at such high frequencies. GEVS provides simple, empirically based methods for approximating the SRS {{for a wide variety}} of shock events. It begins with a base SRS according to the type of pyrotechnic device, and then provides attenuation relations to adjust this SRS according to distance from the shock source, the type of structural frame and the properties of any structural joints between the source and equipment. In our paper we extend GEVS to include more detailed information about the spacecraft structure. To retain the general framework of GEVS, we begin with a base SRS and adjust this SRS using attenuation relations. We use modal and traveling wave concepts to derive the attenuation relations for simple canonical structures. Then we show how these concepts can be used to analyze more complex structures using finite element mode shapes to explicitly calculate the attenuation factors. Since the low- to mid-frequency finite element modal information is extrapolated to obtain the low- to high-frequency attenuation relations, the resulting attenuated SRS is formulated as an upper bound rather than as mean predicted values.
