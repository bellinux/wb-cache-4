It takes a supplier perspective and studies products with more advanced features that compared to those currently used offer new opportunities for the customer. To capture the potential benefits the product needs to be adapted to the new use context. This raises different problems that must be solved in order to utilize the up-graded product. The analytical framework applied departs from the industrial network approach where firms are viewed as embedded in networks of relationships. Studies have shown that adaptations are often made {{in a number of}} areas, e. g. production, logistics and administration, in order to improve the exchange in supplier and customer relationships. Adaptations of products are essential in this study considering the need to fit a new product into a prevailing network structure of the customer. The adaptations are studied from the resource dimension in the industrial network approach, framing four resource entities: products, production facilities, business units and business relationships. A qualitative case study is used to empirically approach the research problem. It involves the steel producer SSAB, which aims to up-grade steel users to high-strength steels. The case includes two relationships illustrating the efforts made to utilize the benefits with high-strength steel by two new customers of SSAB. The first concerns the work with Johnson Controls, a large global subcontractor to the passenger car industry, while the second revolves around the <b>safety</b> <b>shoe</b> producer Goldenberg in France. The analysis shows the importance of accessing resources in order to adapt the product to the new use context. There is a mixture of adaptations carried out involving resources within the single supplier and customer firms, in relation to the supplier and customer relationship, and in relation to resources of other firms. The adaptations carried out are enabled through recombining resources and modifying resource features. This involves an interplay of the different resource entities, which in turn develops their features...|$|R

40|$|Authors: Sandeep Kumar Vashist ### Abstract We {{report a}} highly-sensitive chemiluminescent {{immunoassay}} (CIA) {{for the detection}} of human fetuin A (HFA), which is based on the leach-proof covalent crosslinking of anti-HFA capture antibodies on 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) -functionalized 96 -well chemiluminescent microtiter plates (CMTP) using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide. It has more than 3 -fold reduced overall assay duration than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, it has a wide detection range i. e. 0. 3 pg/mL- 20 ng/mL and 125 -fold better analytical sensitivity than the commercial ELISA kit. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored in 0. 1 M PBS without any significant loss of functional activity. The developed HFA CIA is multisubstrate-compatible and can be employed for immunoassays {{on a wide range of}} commercially-relevant substrates that are being used in various biosensors/point-of-care diagnostics. ### Introduction The development of a robust, rapid and highly-sensitive immunoassay format for the precise detection of HFA is an absolute requirement for clinical disease diagnosis. HFA is a highly specific biomarker for atherosclerosis (1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2), which is also involved in diabetes (3), cardiovascular diseases (4), arthritis, metabolism-associated syndrome (5), and malaria 6. It is a liver-derived protein that is secreted into the bloodstream in the concentration range of 450 - 600 µg/mL. The concentration of HFA changes significantly in various pathophysiological conditions (1, 7 - 9). Several immunoassay formats have been developed till date for HFA detection, which were mainly based on ELISA (10 - 11), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12), microarray (13), and electrochemical luminescence (6). However, ELISA is still the most widely used format and the accepted clinical standard for HFA detection. But in recent years, several highly-sensitive chemiluminescent substrates, having wide detection range and improved analytical sensitivity, have been developed (14). The developed CIA (15), being the most sensitive immunoassay format for HFA detection in comparison to ELISA and SPR, can have potential applications in clinical diagnostics. APTES has been widely used for the leach-proof immobilization of biomolecules (16 - 19) as it enables high immobilization density, long-term stability, high reproducibility, and less biofouling. It has been extensively employed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (20 - 22). In the present study, the covalent crosslinking of antibodies in a leach-proof manner on APTES-functionalized bioanalytical platform leads to higher functional antibody immobilization density that results in highly sensitive analyte detection. ### Reagents 1.

Luong ### Abstract A rapid {{one-step}} kinetics-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) procedure {{has been}} developed for highly-sensitive detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in less than 30 min. With minimal process steps, the procedure is highly simplified and cost-effective. The analysis only involves sequentially {{the formation of a}} sandwich immune complex on capture anti-CRP antibody (Ab) -bound Dynabeads, followed by two magnet-assisted washings and an enzymatic reaction. The developed immunoassay (IA) detected CRP in the dynamic range of 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1 with a limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0. 4 ng mL- 1 and 0. 7 ng mL- 1. Its analytical precision for analysis of CRP spiked in diluted human serum, whole blood, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples of patients was validated by conventional ELISA, unravelling its immense potential for in vitro diagnostics (IVD). ### Introduction As the gold standard for the detection of CRP in clinical diagnostics, ELISA exhibits high-throughput, excellent reproducibility, high precision and remarkable sensitivity. Last five decades have accumulated over 300, 000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA. In particular, the last decade has also witnessed considerable advances in diversified CRP assay formats (1 - 22), lateral flow (20), immunoturbidimetry (1, 11), surface plasmon resonance (14), piezoresistive cantilever-based IA (10), chemiluminescent IA (3), impedimetry (23), electrochemistry 17, reflectometric interference spectroscopy 19, microfluidics (7) and homogenous bead-based IA (24). In general, most of these assay formats are based on a complex procedure comprising of many process steps with a lengthy analysis time (25 - 28). Therefore, there is uttermost importance for the development of rapid and cost-effective IA procedures with high precision and minimal process steps to guide healthcare professionals to decide on the desired intervention at an early stage. CRP, a pentameric protein with a molecular weight of 118 kDa, is a member of a class of acute-phase reactants indicating activation of innate and adaptive immunity (13, 29, 30). It {{plays an important role in}} host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related microbial molecules. As an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions (31, 32), CRP is usually elevated in patients with neonatal sepsis (33 - 35), meningitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease and occult bacteremia. The significantly elevated serum CRP levels are associated with malignant diseases, bacterial infections and correlate with increased 30 -day mortality rates in hospitalized patients (36). The monomeric CRP binds to the surface of damaged cells and platelets, thereby activating the complement cascade that plays an important role in inflammation. The American Heart Association/Center for Disease Control has considered CRP as the best inflammatory marker for clinical diagnosis (37). The precise and rapid determination of human C-reactive protein (CRP) is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis (33 - 35, 38, 39), cardiovascular diseases (40 - 44), infectious/inflammatory conditions (31) and diabetes (45 - 47). The ability for repeated CRP measurements with high precision in an acute setting provides clinicians with the valuable information to assess disease diagnosis and circumvent any unnecessary administration of antibiotics. The normal CRP levels in human serum are usually below 10 µg mL- 1 30 but up to 350 - 400 µg mL- 1 in several disease states. The CRP levels in the ranges of 10 - 40 µg mL- 1, 40 - 200 µg mL- 1, and > 200 µg mL- 1 are the indicators of mild or chronic inflammation and viral infections; acute inflammation and bacterial infections; and severe bacterial infections and burns, respectively (30). The CRP levels beyond the cut-off point of 5 µg mL- 1 are indicative of neonatal sepsis, which is diagnosed based on the determination of two CRP concentration ranges normal (0. 2 - 480 µg mL- 1) and high sensitivity (0. 08 - 80 µg mL- 1) 30. The high sensitivity CRP assay is performed first, but the normal CRP assay is also performed if the CRP levels are > 80 µg mL- 1. The existing analytical techniques for the determination of CRP have limitations in terms of prolonged IA duration and lower analytical sensitivity, as reviewed recently by Algarra et al. (22). The clinical laboratory-based CRP assays, based on latex agglutination or nephelometry, and phosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine based immunoassays can detect CRP only in the detection range of µg mL- 1. On the other hand, the recently developed immunoassay formats, based on electrochemical techniques, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, chemiluminescence, total internal reflection and micromosiac immunoassays, have higher sensitivities in the range of ng mL- 1 to µg mL- 1. Similarly, the surface plasmon resonance based real-time and label-free immunoassay formats have sensitivity between ng mL- 1 to g mL- 1. Therefore, there is a critical need for a highly simplified, cost-effective, precise and highly sensitive IA format for the rapid detection of CRP. We have developed a rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure (48) (Figure 1) to detect CRP in human whole blood and serum in less than 30 min. It has critically reduced the IA duration by more than 12 -fold and the analysis cost by 2. 5 -fold in comparison to the conventional procedure. This novel ELISA format required also significantly reduced number of process steps and only two washing steps in comparison to the conventional counterpart (Table S 1). Moreover, the high analytical precision of the developed procedure implies its tremendous potential for rapid analyte detection in clinical and bioanalytical settings. ### Materials 1.

50|$|The first {{component}} of firefighting equipment is the uniform that a firefighter will wear around the station. Its {{purpose is to}} provide a comfortable clothing that they wear around the station, but will not become an obstruction when a firefighter is required to put on his/her turnout gear. Naturally, turnout gear is to be worn over the station garments during any call that a firefighter is called upon. Another aspect of the station uniform is the station <b>safety</b> <b>shoes,</b> commonly referred to as work boots. These shoes are required to be fitted with safety toes and puncture-resistant soles in most countries in case the firefighter goes out on a call that does not require his/her turnout gear.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} shoe-size systems used worldwide. While all of them use a number to indicate the length of the shoe, they differ in exactly what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Some systems also indicate the shoe width, sometimes also as a number, but in many cases by one or more letters. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g. men's, women's, children's, sport, and <b>safety</b> <b>shoes).</b> This article sets out several complexities in the definition of shoe sizes. In practice, shoes should be tried on for size and fit before they are purchased.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, CSA {{developed}} national Occupational Health and Safety Standards, creating {{standards for}} headgear and <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the CSA began {{to expand its}} involvement in consumer standards, including bicycles, credit cards, and child resistant packaging for drugs. In 1984, CSA established QMI, the Quality Management Institute for registration of ISO9000 and other standards. In 1999, CSA International was established to provide of international product testing and certification services while CSA shifted its primary focus to standards development and training. In 2001, these three divisions were joined under the name CSA Group. In 2004, OnSpeX was launched as the fourth division of CSA Group. In 2008, QMI was sold to SAI-Global for $40 million. In 2009, CSA purchased SIRA.|$|E
50|$|Bata {{promoted}} {{order and}} cleanliness. Thus, {{the houses in}} the village have flat roofs, as attics would only encourage people to store clutter. The workers {{were not allowed to}} wear clogs, as Bata produced suitable footwear. The emphasis on hygiene can be seen as paternalistic but resulted in a level of welfare that was far ahead of its time. The company also established sports clubs, a theatre, a brass band and a volunteer fire brigade.From the 1960s shoe production was moved to low-wage countries and Batadorp was sold to the municipality of Best. The network of shops - even the factory shop - had closed by 1996. The original buildings of Batadorp are now an industrial heritage site.However, production continues at a reduced level. It now belongs to the Bata Protective division which was created in 1970 and makes speciality shoes. In 2008 about 160 employees produced 900,000 pairs of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> and 1 million pairs of safety socks. The headquarters of the global division is located there.|$|E
5000|$|Coblentz has {{frequently}} drawn {{attention to the}} degree to which non-technological factors, ranging from cultural nuance to geopolitics, have contributed to these crises. He collaborated with ElBaradei on The Age of Deception: Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times, a behind-the-scenes account of these nuclear crises, published by Henry Holt in 2011. The most eye-opening revelations in The Age of Deception, according to Coblentz, highlight “{{the degree to which}} political considerations by various governments trumped real avenues for diplomatic solutions.” Coblentz has described touring a munitions factory near Baghdad in the lead-up to the Iraq War, during which he observed Iraqi engineers forging 80-millimeter rocket shells. “The operator was using gloves and tongs to handle red-hot metal, but had no safety goggles; he was wearing sandals instead of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> Throughout the plant the most sophisticated pieces of equipment, with labels from Siemens and other hi-tech manufacturers, were layered with dust.” The operators admitted that most of the equipment had not worked in years. There was no equipment maintenance program, nor were there spare parts. These engineering deficiencies were characteristic across Iraq. “The inference was clear: it was highly unlikely that Iraq had retained the necessary degree of engineering sophistication to build centrifuge cascades for uranium enrichment.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Working Khaki uniform {{was worn}} by Officers and Chief Petty Officers, {{primarily}} aboard ship or in selected working areas at bases ashore. Originally {{it was simply}} the Service Dress Khaki uniform worn without the coat and tie. Similar to, but less formal than, the Service Khaki, it consisted of a short or long-sleeve khaki uniform shirt, with warfare insignia and badges (i.e. command pins, nametags, etc., but no ribbons) worn {{on the top of}} the left pocket, and pin-on metal rank devices located on the collar. It also came with a set of khaki trousers, a khaki belt with a gold belt buckle, a command or [...] "U.S. Navy" [...] ballcap (garrison cap optional), and black or brown low quarter shoes, black or brown boots, or black leather <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> It was often referred to as the [...] "Wash Khaki" [...] uniform, because it was a 100% cotton uniform that could be laundered but required pressing, differentiating it from the Summer Khaki made of Certified Navy Twill (CNT) or a poly-wool blend that is considered acceptable for wear ashore and off base, but which requires dry-cleaning. At the beginning of January 2011, the working khakis were replaced by the Navy Working Uniform, although the Navy Junior ROTC still uses them.|$|E
40|$|Although {{physical}} strain {{has been}} reduced for many employees by improving workplace conditions, musculoskeletal disorders are still relevant in the working health system. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the effect of different <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> on the musculoskeletal system under real working conditions. This was accomplished by using measuring techniques to determine which construction characteristics of footwear could decrease physical strain on the worker. Three different types of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> were tested at workplace by a total of 40 workers from the automotive industry. Measurements included both subjective comfort ratings and objective posture and plantar pressure distribution measurements, which were taken with the CUELA system for a collective of 20 subjects. The CUELA measurements showed significant differences in posture as well as in plantar pressure distribution. Wearing a simple safety shoe without ergonomic features led to an increase in trunk inclination, hip flexion and plantar pressure in comparison to wearing <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> with ergonomic components (i. e. cushioning). The objective measurements were correlated with the subjective comfort ratings. Based on a lack of comfort the simple safety shoe without any ergonomic features was rated worst. Up to now, the main preventive aspect of <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> has been the avoidance of injury in case of an industrial accident. This study could demonstrate an effect not only on plantar pressure but also on the posture by wearing different <b>safety</b> <b>shoes.</b> Therefore, <b>safety</b> <b>shoes</b> may be assumed to be a long-term preventive instrument for maintaining the health of the musculoskeletal system...|$|E
