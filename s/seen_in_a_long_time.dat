[...] Arkoff noted that [...] "Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Vincent was more savage in the picture.

Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and told me that I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated.

Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum, who gave the film an A-, described it as [...] "one of the best American cop movies I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> [...] {{also one of the}} few I've seen that pay serious attention to what cop life feels like, both on and off duty". In a review for The Globe and Mail, however, Rick Groen opined that the focus on [...] "saintly" [...] police officers was less interesting than Ayer's [...] "trademark grit and authenticity".|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{praised the}} episode structure, writing [...] "The quick {{transitions}} and constant back-and-forth movement among subplots generated more energy that, {{when combined with}} several characters we either didn't know before or hadn't <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> made [...] "The Broken Man" [...] feel livelier." [...] Similarly, Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also praised the episode, noting, [...] "Once again {{there was a sense}} Game of Thrones was steeling itself for battles - and expensive set-pieces - chugging down the track. A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to enjoy what remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place.

500|$|The {{comparison}} of Vivah with Sooraj Bartjatya's previous films compelled it to receive generally mixed reviews.

I was more than happy that Roxanne [...] won it — and I guessed she might do anyway." [...] When Zoe's affair with Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) began, there was some controversy over the storyline, due to the age gap between the pair. However, Hirst stated: [...] "I think the controversy has subsided somewhat. It's not an illicit affair, it's known about now.

2500|$|As most {{episodes of}} Fargo, [...] "The Law of Non-Contradiction" [...] drew {{comparisons}} with {{the works of}} the Coen brothers, most notably in this occurrence with a sub-plot in the original film revolving around Mike Yanagita, which Fargo creator Noah Hawley had acknowledged in the past as one of the show's main influences; in the film, Marge Gunderson, while in Minneapolis, meets up with Mike, a former classmate from her hometown that she hasn't <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> There, he tells her that he married an old mutual friend of them who has since passed away, tearfully confesses his loneliness since her death, and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Marge is sympathetic towards Mike, but ultimately learns that everything he told her was a lie. With a new look at the human capacity to deceive, she immediately returns to question Jerry Lundegaard a second time, realizing that he may have lied to her. To Scott Tobias of The New York Times, the episode is [...] "basically an hourlong Mike Yanagita scene", as Gloria is [...] "learning about secrets and lies and then coming back to her own town with unlocked doors, bringing with her a keener sense of the possibilities." [...] Other reviewers also drew comparisons with the Yanagita subplot.|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of the series has received critical acclaim by reviewers. Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented [...] "The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, and while I can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to talk about everything that makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best." [...] Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it [...] "both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird" [...] and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said [...] "It’s still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it’s a good ride and I have more than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile." [...] Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its [...] "energy and joviality" [...] seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!. Similarly, Chapman wrote an article titled [...] "Three Reasons Why Blood Blockade Battlefront is the Best Show of the Spring" [...] commenting [...] "It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> easily the best new show of the Spring 2015." ...|$|E

60|$|About a post beyond Tubingen, a noble ruin of {{a castle}} {{of the middle}} ages {{appeared}} in the distance, crowning the summit of a high conical eminence. These were the finest remains we had <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and viewed from the road, they were a beautiful object, for half an hour. This was the castle of Hohenzollern, erected about the year 980, and the cradle of the House of Brandenburg. This family, some pretend, was derived from the ancient Dukes of Alsace, which, if true would give it the same origin as those of Austria and Baden; but it is usual, and probably much safer, to say that the Counts of Hohenzollern were its founders. We must all stop somewhere short of Adam.|$|E
