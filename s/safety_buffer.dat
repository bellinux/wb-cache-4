40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the management of}} time-critical operations and their dynamic interrelations in project environments. It {{is well known in}} theoretical literature that delayed operative tasks generate a cumulative effect, which delays the overall delivery time making efficient time management difficult. However, practising managers seem to be helpless with this phenomenon if judged by the often reported poor performance of project management. To control the use of time, managers tend to plan <b>safety</b> <b>buffers</b> in their operations, which bias the overall planning of projects. The result of all this is uncontrolled and unknown outcome of the whole operation and, even worse, it inherently makes development efforts very difficult to implement, as the true performance of the organization is hidden in the realization of airy plans. Based on case studies in various industrial environments, we propose that project schedules need to be managed by putting special emphasis on the time-use within individual tasks and by ensuring that work proceeds smoothly along the critical chain of tasks. To enable this, high transparency is needed on how time is used in project organizations...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{development}} of scheduling systems allows significantly improving currently realized tasks. Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) {{is one of}} the methods of project management basing on network planning. In this method is utilized the concept of a critical chain derived from the Theory of Constraints. This method allows avoiding losses considered project time and resources. It results in quicker project implementation (20 - 30 %), and in reducing the risk level considered with tasks realization. The projects are cheaper, and the risk of cost overruns is significantly reduced. Factors that distinguish CCPM method from traditional network planning methods are: the balance of resources and the introduction of buffers. Moreover in the CCPM method key elements are: times of tasks that are reduced from traditional estimates to realistic ones. Activities associated with the task start as late as possible in accordance with the ALAP principle (As Late As Possible).

40|$|Technology trends {{suggest that}} byte-addressable {{nonvolatile}} memory (NVM) will supplant many uses of DRAM {{over the coming}} decade, raising the prospect of inexpensive recovery from power failures and similar faults. Ensuring the consistency of persistent state remains nontrivial, however, {{in the presence of}} volatile caches; cached values can "leak" back to persistent memory in arbitrary order. To ensure consistency, existing persistent memory algorithms use expensive, explicit write-back instructions to force each value back to memory before performing a dependent write, thereby incurring significant run-time overhead. To reduce this overhead, we present a new design paradigm that we call periodic persistence. In a periodically persistent data structure, updates are made "in place," but can safely leak back to memory in any order, because only those updates that are known to be valid will be heeded during recovery. To guarantee forward progress, we periodically force a write-back of all dirty data in the cache, ensuring that all "sufficiently old" updates have indeed become persistent, at which point they become semantically visible to the recovery process. As an example of periodic persistence, we present a transactional hash map, Dalí, together with an informal proof of <b>safety</b> (<b>buffered</b> durable linearizability). Experiments with a prototype implementation suggest that periodic persistence can offer substantially better performance than either file-based or incrementally persistent (per-access write-back) alternatives...|$|R

50|$|Calculating the TMDL for {{any given}} body of water {{involves}} the combination of {{factors that contribute to}} the problem of nutrient concentrated runoff. Bodies of water are tested for contaminants based on their intended use. Each body of water is tested similarly but designated with a different TMDL. Drinking water reservoirs are designated differently from areas for public swimming and water bodies intended for fishing are designated differently from water located in wildlife conservation areas. The size of the water body also is taken into consideration when TMDL calculating is undertaken. The larger the body of water, the greater the amounts of contaminants can be present and still maintain a Margin of Safety. The Margin of Safety (MOS) is numeric estimate included in the TMDL calculation, sometimes 10% of the TMDL, intended to allow a <b>safety</b> <b>buffer</b> between the calculated TMDL and the actual load that will allow the water body to meet it's beneficial use (since the natural world is complex and several variables may alter future conditions). TMDL is the end product of all point and non-point source pollutants of a single contaminant.

Nonpoint source pollutants are also calculated into the TMDL equation with Load Allocation (LA).|$|E
40|$|A {{design study}} was {{completed}} {{to explore the}} theoretical physical capacity (TPC) of the John F. Kennedy International Airport (KJFK) runway system for a northflow configuration assuming impedance-free (to throughput) air traffic control functionality. Individual runways were modeled using an agent-based, airspace simulation tool, the Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES), with all runways conducting both departures and arrivals on a first-come first-served (FCFS) scheduling basis. A realistic future flight schedule was expanded to 3. 5 times the traffic level of a selected baseline day, September 26, 2006, to provide a steady overdemand state for KJFK runways. Rules constraining departure and arrival operations were defined to reflect physical limits beyond which safe operations {{could no longer be}} assumed. <b>Safety</b> <b>buffers</b> to account for all sources of operational variability {{were not included in the}} TPC estimate. Visual approaches were assumed for all arrivals to minimize inter-arrival spacing. Parallel runway operations were assumed to be independent based on lateral spacing distances. Resulting time intervals between successive airport operations were primarily constrained by same-runway and then by intersecting-runway spacing requirements. The resulting physical runway capacity approximates a theoretical limit that cannot be exceeded without modifying runway interaction assumptions. Comparison with current KJFK operational limits for a north-flow runway configuration indicates a substantial throughput gap of approximately 48 %. This gap may be further analyzed to determine which part may be feasibly bridged through the deployment of advanced systems and procedures, and which part cannot, because it is either impossible or not cost-effective to control. Advanced systems for bridging the throughput gap may be conceptualized and simulated using this same experimental setup to estimate the level of gap closure achieved...|$|R

The presence of foreign troops in the Grand Duchy {{in case of a}} Franco-German war once again became a probability. The other Western neighbour of Germany, Belgium, reacted by pulling out from the military agreement with France, and by adopting a [...] "policy of free hands". The Luxembourgish government also sought safety in a policy of neutrality. To consolidate the international position of Luxembourg, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joseph Bech, imagined a diplomatic operation: the signatory states to the Treaty of London of 1867 were to reaffirm the perpetual neutrality of Luxembourg by a common declaration. However, Belgium and the United Kingdom equivocated. In the absence of a multilateral agreement, Bech tried to obtain a simultaneous undertaking from France and Germany. While Germany had no problem in expressing towards Luxembourg all the promises that had been requested, France hesitated to commit itself. The French headquarters wanted to retain a right of passage across the Grand Duchy in case of German aggression. Thus, in spring 1939, with the spectre of war hovering over Europe, the government did not succeed in obtaining any formal guarantees.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} and banks are {{of great importance}} to the economy, which is why their stability must be ensured. In order to prevent bankruptcies in the financial sector, these companies are subject to strict regulations, which set standards for risk management {{and the amount of}} reserve capital required. Such capital reserves act as <b>safety</b> <b>buffers</b> to protect the customers from extraordinary events. In the insurance industry, the reserve capital {{is referred to as the}} solvency margin. Solvency II is new set of insurance regulations that aims to set a common standard regarding solvency capital and risk management for insurance companies within the European Union. The potential costs and benefits of the regulations are of importance not only to insurance companies but also to those firms that offer services and products to the insurance industry in the field of risk management. Solvency II is often compared to the Basel II accord for banks, which had a strong business case in the way that banks could significantly lower their reserve capital and use it for other purposes. The question is, however, whether insurance companies can expect similar benefits from Solvency II. The purpose of this study is therefore to explain how the Solvency II regulations will affect risk management in the Swedish non-life insurance industry, and whether these changes can result in opportunities for insurance companies. This is achieved by studying the new regulations and conducting a number of interviews with insurance company representatives as well as industry experts. Four potential effects of Solvency II have been investigated: capital levels, insurance pricing, credit ratings and reinsurance. The findings of the study indicate that no obvious benefits related to the potential effects above can be realised by complying with Solvency II. The future capital requirements will come close to those already enforced by supervisors today, resulting in a minor change that can go both ways. Neither credit ratings nor reinsurance covers seem to become notably affected by Solvency II. As for insurance pricing, an increasingly sophisticated risk-based allocation of the cost of solvency capital provides the most notable opportunity of Solvency II, but at present, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of such changes. On the other hand, Solvency II will put pressure on improving systems to ensure the quality and traceability of data. Thus, the actual changes in risk management practices are not expected to be substantial among Swedish non-life insurance companies, and it therefore seems unlikely that insurance companies would be willing to invest as heavily in reaching Solvency II compliance as banks have done in Basel II...|$|R
