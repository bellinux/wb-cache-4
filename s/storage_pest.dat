Although the progenitors of commercial maize are not known, a hybrid (called Tripsacorn) developed from a perennial teosinte, Zea diploperennis, and eastern gamagrass, Tripsacum dactyloides, resembles the earliest known samples of primitive domesticated maize. We tested resistance of whole Tripsacorn to the primary <b>storage</b> <b>pest</b> (primary storage pests can infest intact kernels) the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and resistance of ground Tripsacorn to the secondary <b>storage</b> <b>pest</b> (secondary pests usually cannot infest intact kernels) the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae). Tripsacorn was immune to attack by S. zeamais. The weevils were unable to lay eggs in the Tripsacorn, and we hypothesized that the hardness of the fruitcase was responsible for lack of weevil oviposition. Oryzaephilus surinamensis were able to complete immature development on ground Tripsacorn, but duration of development was longer and weight of emerged adults was less than for beetles developing on wheat.

Although a number of approaches have been advanced for control of <b>storage</b> <b>pests</b> of maize, uptake remains a challenge, with effectiveness of some approaches being questionable. We conducted a survey in western Kenya among 330 respondents using face to face interviews and focus group discussions to evaluate farmers' practices, knowledge and perceptions of <b>storage</b> <b>pests</b> of maize, and their current practices in managing such pests {{as a basis for}} development of efficient integrated pest management (IPM) approaches for the pests. Majority of the respondents stored maize in traditional granaries, with less than 10 % of them using modern improved facilities, mainly due to inability to afford these. Majority of the respondents also cited attack of their stored grains by a number of insect pests, causing about 40 % grain losses. The larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L) (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), and maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were perceived as the most common and damaging pests. Farmers' perceptions of pests were positively and significantly influenced by level of education and farming experience, indicating that education and experience build farmers' understanding of <b>storage</b> <b>pests.</b> Storing maize in unshelled form seemed to result in less pest attack, although majority of the respondents stored their maize in shelled form. Moreover, local maize varieties were perceived to be resistant to pests. The farmers applied various control methods, with sun-drying being the most popular practice. Usage of pesticides was minimal, mainly due to high costs, lack of information, and unavailability of appropriate and effective products. There were also other cultural methods applied, such as use of smoke and insecticidal plants. The respondents decried lack of training and extension services on <b>storage</b> <b>pests</b> and their management, underscoring the need to develop extension services. The underlying mechanisms of the perceived pest resistance in local varieties of maize and cultural pest management methods need to be established for exploitation in development of effective IPM approaches.

An assessment of post-harvest handling practices and food losses in a maize-based farming system in semi-arid areas of Central and Northern Tanzania was carried out in 2012. Seventeen crops were mostly cultivated by the farmers in the surveyed areas; maize (32 %), sunflower (16 %) and pigeon peas (12 %) were the most cultivated while maize was the most stored. There are at least 7 months between two harvest seasons of each crop; while farmers sold the crops soon after harvest to cater for household expenditure (54 %) and school fees (38 %), the market prices increased significantly (P 0. 05) within six months of storage. Most processing activities (winnowing, dehulling, drying, sorting and shelling) were carried out manually, almost entirely by women, but mechanized processing for maize, sunflower, millet, and sorghum were commonly practiced. Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur in the field (15 %); during processing (13 e 20 %), and during storage (15 e 25 %). The main <b>storage</b> <b>pests</b> responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), grain weevils (Sitophilus granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in weather (40 %), field damage (33 %), and <b>storage</b> <b>pests</b> (16 %) as the three most important factors causing poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmers‚Äô poor knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77 % of the surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41 % received food aid during the previous year. Increasing farmers‚Äô technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability, and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and improve poverty and household food security.

40|$|Females of many {{animal species}} are polyandrous, {{and there is}} {{evidence}} that they can control pre- and post-mating events. There has been a growing interest in consequences of polyandry for male and female reproductive success and offspring fitness, and its evolutionary significance. In several taxa, females exhibit mate choice both before and after mating and can influence the paternity of their offspring, enhancing offspring number and quality, but potentially countering male interests. Studying female mating biology and in particular post-copulatory female control mechanisms thus promises to yield insights into sexual selection and the potential of male-female coevolution. Here, we highlight the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), a <b>storage</b> <b>pest,</b> as a model system to study polyandry, and review studies addressing the effects of polyandry on male sperm competitive ability and female control of post-mating events. These studies show that the outcome of sperm competition in the red flour beetle is influenced by both male and female traits. Furthermore, recent advances suggest that sexual conflict may have shaped reproductive traits in this species...|$|E

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in stored cowpea seeds {{was evaluated}} {{in the laboratory}} by admixing leaf, stem bark and root powders of A. boonei with cowpea seeds at ambient temperature of 28 + 2 0 C and 70 + 5 % relative humidity. The powders were incorporated into 20 g of cowpea seeds, Vigna unguiculata at 0. 0 % (control) 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 12. 5 % and 25. 0 % (w/w) concentration. The ability of the plant powders to protect cowpea seeds was assessed in terms of mortality rates after 24 - 96 hours post treatment, oviposition and adult emergence, percentage weight loss and damage after the first filial generation (F 1). All the tested plant part powders significantly (P C. maculatus on treated cowpea seeds. From the study, the plant powders could be ranked in order of effectiveness thus; stem bark > leaf > root. Alstonia boonei {{can be used as}} biopesticide against C. maculatus and its incorporation into traditional <b>storage</b> <b>pest</b> management is strongly recommended. </p...|$|E
40|$|Phenolic esters have {{attracted}} considerable interest {{due to the}} potential they offer for peroxidase catalysed cross-linking of cell wall polysaccharides. Particularly, feruloyl residues undergo radical coupling reactions that result in cross-linking (intra- /intermolecular) between polysaccharides, between polysaccharides and lignin and, between polysaccharides and proteins. This review addresses {{for the first time}} different studies in which it is established that cross-linking by dehydrodiferulates contributes to maize‚Äôs defences to pests and diseases. Dehydrodiferulate cross-links are involved in maize defence mechanisms against insects such as the European, Mediterranean, and tropical corn borers and, <b>storage</b> <b>pest</b> as the maize weevil. In addition, cross-links are also discussed to be involved in genetic resistance of maize to fungus diseases as Gibberella ear and stalk rot. Resistance against insects and fungus attending dehydrodiferulates could go hand in hand. Quantitative trait loci mapping for these cell wall components could be a useful tool for enhancing resistance to pest and diseases in future breeding programs.
