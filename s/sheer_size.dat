5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences.

On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale mock-up of the new XB-52 and do preliminary engineering and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to express concern about the <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> of the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified design requirements. In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E

The <b>sheer</b> <b>sizes</b> of polygonal models and the limited Internet bandwidth put {{a threat to their}} visualization in a distributed environment. Streaming mesh, which consists of a simplified model and refinement patches, is used to overcome this problem. Simplification method and the data structures for refinement patches play crucial role in this approach. By employing distance measure and normal field deviation, we propose a new error measure to faithfully simplify polygonal models, and introduce more efficient data structures for refinement patches. We implement the streaming mesh using Java. Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods reveals that the proposed method results in better quality LODs in some cases, and the new data structures for refinement patches accelerate the refinement process...|$|R

In this work, we discuss the engineering of a parallel algorithm with linear work and logarithmic span for the construction of the compact representation of planar embeddings.

To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner Jason Lewis has drawn parallels to other, more tangible closed systems.

In both cases, he argues, exercising the precautionary principle is a key factor in survival.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{investment}} in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but {{in large part by}} the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges.

However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West. For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72's as the US deployed M1's.|$|E

The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued {{for the remainder of the}} Tang Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the <b>sheer</b> <b>size</b> of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E

40|$|Graph {{clustering}} is {{a fundamental}} problem that partitions vertices of a graph into clusters with an objective to opti-mize the intuitive notions of intra-cluster density and inter-cluster sparsity. In many real-world applications, however, the <b>sheer</b> <b>sizes</b> and inherent complexity of graphs may render existing graph clustering methods inefficient or incapable of yielding quality graph clusters. In this paper, we propose gSparsify, a graph sparsification method, to preferentially retain a small subset of edges from a graph which {{are more likely to}} be within clusters, while eliminating others with less or no structure correlation to clusters. The resultant simplified graph is succinct in size with core cluster struc-tures well preserved, thus enabling faster graph clustering without a compromise to clustering quality. We consider a quantitative approach to modeling the evidence that edges within densely knitted clusters are frequently involved in small-size graph motifs, which are adopted as prime features to differentiate edges with varied cluster significance. Path-based indexes and path-join algorithms are further designed to compute graph-motif based cluster significance of edges for graph sparsification. We perform experimental studies in real-world graphs, and results demonstrate that gSparsify can bring significant speedup to existing graph clustering methods with an improvement to graph clustering quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{blooming}} {{availability of}} traces for social, biological, and communication networks opens up unprecedented opportunities in analyzing diffusion processes in networks. However, the <b>sheer</b> <b>sizes</b> of the nowadays networks raise serious challenges in computational efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose a new hyper-graph sketching framework for inflence dynamics in networks. The central of our sketching framework, called SKIS, is an efficient importance sampling algorithm that returns only non-singular reverse cascades in the network. Comparing to previously developed sketches like RIS and SKIM, our sketch significantly enhances estimation quality while substantially reducing processing time and memory-footprint. Further, we present general strategies of using SKIS to enhance existing algorithms for influence estimation and influence maximization which {{are motivated by}} practical applications like viral marketing. Using SKIS, we design high-quality influence oracle for seed sets with average estimation error up to 10 x times smaller than those using RIS and 6 x times smaller than SKIM. In addition, our influence maximization using SKIS substantially improves the quality of solutions for greedy algorithms. It achieves up to 10 x times speed-up and 4 x memory reduction for the fastest RIS-based DSSA algorithm, while maintaining the same theoretical guarantees.
