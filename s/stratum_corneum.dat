5|$|Papulosquamous hyperkeratotic {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} those that present with papules and scales caused by a thickening of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous lipids make an {{important}} contribution in maintaining {{the integrity of the}} skin barrier, and express both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Sebum may act as a delivery system for antioxidants, antimicrobial lipids, pheromones, and hydration of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> The insoluble fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity. Additionally, sebaceous gland secretion provides vitamin E to the upper layers of facial skin.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Carotene: This pigment is {{yellow to}} orange in color. It {{is present in}} the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and fat cells of dermis and {{superficial}} fascia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of Mongoloid skin {{contains}} lots of keratin, African and Melanesian skin has low {{amounts of}} keratin, and European skin lacks keratin.|$|E
25|$|Older {{literature}} {{cites the}} fungus Malassezia furfur (previously known as Pityrosporum ovale) {{as the cause}} of dandruff. While this species does occur naturally on the skin surface of both healthy people and those with dandruff, in 2007 it was discovered that the responsible agent is a scalp specific fungus, Malassezia globosa, that metabolizes triglycerides present in sebum by the expression of lipase, resulting in a lipid byproduct oleic acid. During dandruff, the levels of Malassezia increase by 1.5 to 2 times its normal level. Oleic acid penetrates the top layer of the epidermis, the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> and evokes an inflammatory response in susceptible people which disturbs homeostasis and results in erratic cleavage of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cells.|$|E
25|$|Nanoparticles of {{different}} materials have shown skin’s permeability limitations. In many experiments, gold nanoparticles 40nm in diameter or smaller are used and have shown to penetrate to the epidermis. Titanium oxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver nanoparticles are ineffective in penetrating the skin past the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> Cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots {{have proven to}} penetrate very effectively when they have certain properties. Because CdSe is toxic to living organisms, the particle must be covered in a surface group. An experiment comparing the permeability of quantum dots coated in polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG-amine, and carboxylic acid concluded the PEG and PEG-amine surface groups allowed for the greatest penetration of particles. The carboxylic acid coated particles did not penetrate past the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Richard Gallo {{and colleagues}} noticed that {{patients}} with rosacea had high levels of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin and elevated levels of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzymes (SCTEs). Antibiotics {{have been used in}} the past to treat rosacea, but they may only work because they inhibit some SCTEs.|$|E
25|$|Nanoparticles 40nm in {{diameter}} and smaller {{have been successful in}} penetrating the skin. Research confirms that nanoparticles larger than 40nm do not penetrate the skin past the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> Most particles that do penetrate will diffuse through skin cells, but some will travel down hair follicles and reach the dermis layer.|$|E
25|$|The {{uppermost}} {{layer of}} skin, the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> becomes thinner and more translucent. Spider veins may appear or be more noticeable as a result. Collagen decreases, and tactile sensation increases. The skin becomes softer, {{more susceptible to}} tearing and irritation from scratching or shaving, and slightly lighter in color because of a slight decrease in melanin.|$|E
25|$|The {{photochemical}} {{properties of}} melanin {{make it an}} excellent photoprotectant. However, sunscreen chemicals cannot dissipate {{the energy of the}} excited state as efficiently as melanin and therefore, if sunscreen ingredients penetrate into the lower layers of the skin, the amount of reactive oxygen species may be increased. The amount of sunscreen that penetrates through the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> {{may or may not be}} large enough to cause damage.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{consists}} of two primary layers: the inner layer called the dermis, composed largely of connective tissue, and the outer, thinner epidermis. Thick epidermis in the soles and palms {{consists of}} five strata; from outer to inner, they are: the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Vitamin D is produced in the keratinocytes of two innermost strata, the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.|$|E
25|$|Epidermis {{is divided}} into several layers where cells are formed through mitosis at the {{innermost}} layers. They move up the strata changing shape and composition as they differentiate and become filled with keratin. They eventually reach the top layer called <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and are sloughed off, or desquamated. This process is called keratinization and takes place within weeks. The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells.|$|E
25|$|S. schenckii {{breaks down}} {{proteins}} by producing two separate proteases, a serine protease and an aspartic protease. These proteases {{appear to be}} essential for fungal growth. However, they have some functional overlap as the inactivation of either protein does not affect growth but inactivation of both inhibits the fungus. Protease activity {{has been shown to}} be important in in vivo infection of mice. Substrates for these proteases include the skin proteins type-I collagen, <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> and elastin.|$|E
25|$|Keratinocytes in the stratum basale proliferate through mitosis and the {{daughter}} cells move up the strata changing shape and composition as they undergo multiple stages of cell differentiation to eventually become anucleated. During that process, keratinocytes will become highly organized, forming cellular junctions (desmosomes) between each other and secreting keratin proteins and lipids which contribute {{to the formation of}} an extracellular matrix and provide mechanical strength to the skin. Keratinocytes from the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> are eventually shed from the surface (desquamation).|$|E
25|$|Dandruff {{scale is}} {{a cluster of}} corneocytes, which have {{retained}} a large degree of cohesion {{with one another and}} detach as such {{from the surface of the}} <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> A corneocyte is a protein complex that is made of tiny threads of keratin in an organised matrix. The size and abundance of scales are heterogeneous from one site to another and over time. Parakeratotic cells often make up part of dandruff. Their numbers are related to the severity of the clinical manifestations, which may also be influenced by seborrhea.|$|E
25|$|The {{permeability}} of skin {{relative to}} different shapes of nanoparticles {{has also been}} studied. Research has shown that spherical particles have a better ability to penetrate the skin compared to oblong (ellipsoidal) particles because spheres are symmetric in all three spatial dimensions. One study compared the two shapes and recorded data that showed spherical particles located deep in the epidermis and dermis whereas ellipsoidal particles were mainly found in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and epidermal layers. Nanorods are used in experiments because of their unique fluorescent properties but have shown mediocre penetration.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{consists}} of two primary layers: an inner layer, the dermis, comprising largely connective tissue, and an outer, thinner epidermis. The thickness of the epidermis ranges from 0.08mm to greater than 0.6mm (from 0.003 to 0.024 inches). The epidermis comprises five strata; from outer to inner, they are the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. The highest concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol {{are found in the}} epidermal layer of skin—specifically in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum. The production of pre-vitamin D3 is, therefore, greatest in these two layers.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{of birds}} and reptiles is closer to that of mammals, {{with a layer of}} dead keratin-filled cells at the surface, to help reduce water loss. A similar pattern is also seen in some of the more terrestrial amphibians such as toads. However, in all of these animals there is no clear differentiation of the epidermis into distinct layers, as occurs in humans, with the change in cell type being relatively gradual. The mammalian epidermis always possesses at least a stratum germinativum and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> but the other intermediate layers found in humans are not always distinguishable.|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the dermis, and (iii) the hypodermis. The epidermis is 50–100µm thick, and {{is composed of}} a <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The dermis is mostly collagen and elastin ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper dermis (“papillary dermis”) are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} mechanisms involved. Firstly, the UVA-radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidizes existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin, also known as IPD (immediate pigment darkening). Secondly, there {{is an increase in}} production of melanin known as melanogenesis. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning and first becomes visible about 72 hours after exposure. The tan that is created by an increased melanogenesis lasts much longer than the one that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin. Tanning involves not just the increased melanin production in response to UV radiation but the thickening of the top layer of the epidermis, the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Larval {{invasion}} of the skin (mostly in the Americas) can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption. The hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin, where they give rise to intense, local itching, usually on the foot or lower leg, known as ground itch. This infection is due to larvae from the A. Braziliense hookworm. The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of the skin, causing serpiginous vesicular lesions. With advancing movement of the larvae, the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty. The lesions are typically intensely itchy.|$|E
25|$|Plantar warts are benign {{epithelial}} tumors generally {{caused by}} infection by human papilloma virus types 1, 2, 4, 60, or 63, but {{have also been}} caused by types 57, 65, 66, and 156. These types are classified as clinical (visible symptoms). The virus attacks compromised skin through direct contact, entering through possibly tiny cuts and abrasions in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> (outermost layer of skin). After infection, warts may not become visible for several weeks or months. Because {{of pressure on the}} sole of the foot or finger, the wart is pushed inward and a layer of hard skin may form over the wart. A plantar wart can be painful if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the dermis, and (iii) the hypodermis. The epidermis is 50–100µm thick, and {{is composed of}} a <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The dermis is mostly collagen and elastin ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper dermis ("papillary dermis") are thinner than the fibers of the deep dermis, thus the skin envelope is 1–3mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part. The skin of the nipple and areola is further composed of a modified and specialized myoepthelium {{that is responsible for}} contraction in response to stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Human skin {{has a low}} permeability; that is, most foreign {{substances}} {{are unable}} to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> is an effective barrier to most inorganic nanosized particles. This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to {{come into contact with}} internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in nanomedicine and biology to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of active cell division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms (cancer cells). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{previously}} {{believed that}} the skin was an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors {{was believed to be}} the only way to increase its permeability. Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability. The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E
25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
500|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the most}} superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. [...] Nourishment is provided to these layers by diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. [...] The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. [...] This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> where cells are continually shed from the surface. [...] In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer {{to the top of}} the granular cell layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b>|$|E

2500|$|S. scabiei mites {{are under}} 0.5mm in size, but are {{sometimes}} visible as pinpoints of white. [...] Gravid females tunnel into the dead, outermost layer (<b>stratum</b> <b>corneum)</b> of a host's skin and deposit {{eggs in the}} shallow burrows. The eggs hatch into larvae in three to ten days. These young mites move about on the skin and molt into a [...] "nymphal" [...] stage, before maturing as adults, which live {{three to four weeks}} in the host's skin. Males roam on top of the skin, occasionally burrowing into the skin. In general, the total number of adult mites infesting a healthy hygienic person with noncrusted scabies is small, about 11 females in burrows, on average.|$|E
2500|$|Research by Nina Jablonski {{suggests}} that an estimated time of about 10,000 to 20,000 years {{is enough for}} human populations to achieve optimal skin pigmentation in a particular geographic area but that development of ideal skin coloration may happen faster if the evolutionary pressure is stronger, even {{in as little as}} 100 generations. The length of time is also affected by cultural practices such as food intake, clothing, body coverings, and shelter usage which can alter {{the ways in which the}} environment affects populations. [...] One of the most recently proposed drivers of the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans is based on research that shows a superior barrier function in darkly pigmented skin. Most protective functions of the skin, including the permeability barrier and the antimicrobial barrier, reside in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> (SC) and the researchers surmise that the SC has undergone the most genetic change since the loss of human body hair. Natural selection would have favored mutations that protect this essential barrier; one such protective adaptation is the pigmentation of interfollicular epidermis, because it improves barrier function as compared to non-pigmented skin. In lush rainforests, however, where UV-B radiation and xeric stress were not in excess, light pigmentation would not have been nearly as detrimental. This explains the side-by-side residence of lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented peoples.|$|E

6000|$|Section 58. The {{outer layer}} of the skin (the epidermis), the inmost lining of the {{alimentary}} canal, {{the lining of the}} body cavity, and the inner linings of blood-vessels, glands, and various ducts constitute our first division. The general name for such tissues is epithelium. When the cells are more or less flattened, they form squamous epithelium (Figure VI.) such as we find lining the inside of a man's cheek (from which the cells sq.ep. were taken) or covering the mesentery of various types-- sq.end. are from the mesentery (Section 16) of a frog. A short cylindroidal form of cell makes up columnar epithelium, seen typically in the cells covering the villi of the duodenum (Figure V.). This epithelium of the villi has the outer border curiously striated, and this is usually spoken of as leading towards [...] "ciliated" [...] epithelium, to be described immediately. The epithelium of the epididermis is stratified-- that is to say, has many thicknesses of cells; the deeper layers are alive and dividing (stratum mucosum), while the more superficial are increasingly flattened and drier as the surface is approached (<b>stratum</b> <b>corneum)</b> and are continually being rubbed off and replaced from below.|$|E
