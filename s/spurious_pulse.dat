40|$|Optical pulse shaping is an incisive tool {{of laser}} {{spectroscopy}} {{that allows the}} experimentalist extensive flexibility to manipulate the electric field of an excitation laser pulse. In this thesis, four applications of optical pulse shaping are examined. In Chapter 2, a partially non-collinear implementation of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy is demonstrated {{for the first time}} on rubidium vapor. The use of a pulse shaper in this context is advantageous as it significantly reduces the complexity of the experimental apparatus. Unfortunately, non-ideal pulse shaping due to pixelation effects in some pulse-shaping devices leads to <b>spurious</b> <b>pulse</b> generation when the spatial masks become highly modulated. To model the effects on recovered 2 D spectra, the optical Bloch model is numerically propagated with an explicit inclusion of the electric field modified by pixelation effects. Finally, steps necessary to minimize distortions are outlined. Chapter 3 describes a series of experiments designed to study the mechanism of multiple exciton generation in semiconductor quantum dots through open and closed loop coherent control schemes. The data collected with open loop control methods indicate that the initially formed exciton relaxes on an ultrafast time scale (3 ̆c 20 fs) revealing the reason for a lack of controllability in adaptive, closed-loop optimizations. Chapter 4 of this thesis examines the process of singlet fission in tetracene thin films employing coherent control and ultrafast pulse shaping. Singlet fission is a promising avenue to achieving highly efficient third generation photovoltaic devices, and in this work, closed-loop control suggests that low-frequency nuclear motions play a mechanistic role in tetracene singlet fission. Finally, Chapter 5 examines a specific class of pulse shaping, sinusoidal spectral phase modulation, which is widely employed in the coherent control community as a route toward an intuitive probe into molecular dynamics. This work seeks to build a bridge between the fields of nonlinear spectroscopy and coherent control by describing the light-matter interactions characteristic of this type of pulse shaping using the tools of time-dependent perturbation theory. This description allows experimentalists to predict and test theories of coherent control simply and with little ambiguity, furthering the usefulness of coherent control as a spectroscopic tool...|$|E
40|$|In the past, {{noise was}} {{not such a}} big issue in digital {{integrated}} circuits. However, the continuous progress in semiconductor technology put the noise issue among the major concerns of digital CMOS IC designers. This study concerns with the noise immunity of static CMOS low power digital design by investigating the noise immunity of the current low power static CMOS design schemes and presenting a fast and accurate methodology to evaluate the noise sensitivity of the different nodes in a design during the design phase. In addition, for the modeling/characterization of noise in digital circuits, techniques to measure the non-periodic noise and sensing the peak minimum/maximum fluctuation on-chip have been presented. The study is presented in five chapters in addition to conclusion. //　The first chapter includes a background about the power consumption and noise issues in current and future VLSI/ULSI digital design. It also includes {{the objectives of the}} study and thesis organization. //　In chapter two, we present the effect of noise on the performance of a selected group of low power as well as traditional digital design techniques. First, we present a model for the different noise sources in the digital circuits. Then we applied the model to a selected group of low power and traditional designs as testing circuits. The noise immunity of the tested schemes has been reported in terms of logic error and delay error. At the end of the chapter, we present a methodology for leakage power saving {{and at the same time}} has high noise immunity. One of the ways to increase the noise immunity of a digital circuit is to give special strengthen considerations to the soft (weak) parts (nodes) against noise. Since it is time consuming to analyze the noise-sensitivity of different nodes in a big design using transistor level simulators, an analytical (fast and accurate) method is required. //　In chapter three, we present a methodology to evaluate the noise-induced logic error probability in a given CMOS digital design in terms of supply voltage, threshold voltage, noise level and circuit configuration. At first, we modeled the noise immunity of the different logic gates in terms logic error probability including the effect of supply and threshold voltage, which is called electrical masking. Then, time masking has been modeled to include the variation of the <b>spurious</b> <b>pulse</b> width and generation time in the overall logic error probability. Moreover, the logic masking effect has been also considered. The electrical, timing and logic masking have been combined to form the overall logic error probability model. The model has been used to evaluate the logic error probability caused by the noise at the different nodes in digital circuit examples. The model results have been compared with results obtained from HSPICE simulation. The results reveal that the model fit with the expected simulation results achieving speedup factor of more than 1000 over HSPICE. Moreover, the calculation time of the methodology is linearly proportional with the number of gates in a design, and hence, the method is suitable for investigating the noise immunity of the big circuits. The model can be used to identify the weak parts against the noise in a given design during the design phase and hence it helps the designer in giving specific design considerations to strengthen the weak nodes. The methodology is based on hypothetical noise distribution. So that, for more accurate results, a real noise distribution should be provided. //　In chapter four we present, first, an overview on the previous works regarding the on-chip noise measurement has been given. To avoid the problems attached with the previous designs, an on-chip noise detector has been designed and fabricated using 0. 18 μm technology. The detector can detect the single-event or the non-periodic signals within the measurement time window. It is equipped with a programmable voltage divider to be able to detect high-swing signals having maximum theoretical frequency of 5 GHz. The bandwidth of the output signal can be controlled by the user to fit the monitoring tools capability off-chip and to avoid the effects of the on-chip parasitic elements and hence conventional equipments can be used to measure the signal off-chip. Moreover, the detector is synthesizable and the designer can flexibly adjust its main parameters. A test chip is fabricated and tested successfully. The detector's design has been modified to increase the sampling rate. Upon the simulation results, the modified version is capable to measure signals of frequency (theoretically) up to 10 GHz. //　Chapter five includes the description of a CPU-interfaced system to monitor the minimum/maximum fluctuation in both VDD and ground in a design. In addition to the magnitude information, the system has the ability to report the timing and spatial information of the <b>spurious</b> <b>pulse.</b> The system is designed using Rohm 0. 18 μm technology. The fluctuation is detected by comparing with a reference voltage supplied form off-chip, and the fluctuation information is send off-chip in digital format. The detector is simple, therefore, it can be replicated within a design to detect the fluctuations on VDD/Ground net at different spots and hence, safe operation can be guaranteed. The detector is interfaced by a CPU and hence it is suitable for future VLSI/ULSI circuits. //　Finally, we conclude the study in chapter six. 報告番号: 甲 21838; 学位授与年月日: 2006 - 09 - 29; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6368 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|E

Tests have been performed to evaluate the light generation and transmission characteristics of 15 -meter long, 10 -fiber bundles of BCF- 10, BCF- 12, and BCF- 20 scintillating fibers (Saint Gobain) exposed to collimated gamma-ray sources. The test set-up used one R 9800 (Hamamatsu) photomultiplier tube (PMT) at each end, with a high-speed waveform digitizer to collect data. Time constraints were imposed on the waveform data to perform time-of-flight analysis of the events in the fiber bundles, eliminating <b>spurious</b> noise <b>pulses</b> in the high gain PMTs and also allowing 1 -dimensional localization of interactions along the lengths of the fiber bundles. This paper will present the results of these measurements including the attenuation coefficients of the two fiber types and the timing resolution (position uncertainty) possible for each fiber bundle when using the R 9800 PMTs...|$|R
50|$|Doppler is {{incompatible}} with most electronically steered phase-array antenna. This is because the phase-shifter elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit <b>pulse.</b> <b>Spurious</b> phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift, and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places Doppler modulation onto stationary clutter. That receive modulation corrupts the measure of performance for sub-clutter visibility. Phase shifter settling time {{on the order of}} 50ns is required. Start of receiver sampling needs to be postponed at least 1 phase-shifter settling time-constant (or more) for each 20 dB of sub-clutter visibility.|$|R
40|$|Abstract —We study bi-infinite {{sequences}} x =(xk) k∈Z {{over the}} alphabet { 0, 1, [...] .,q− 1 }, for an arbitrary q � 2, that satisfy the following q-ary ghost pulse (qGP) constraint: for all k, l, m ∈ Z such that xk, xl, xm are nonzero and equal, xk+l−m is also nonzero. This constraint arises {{in the context}} of coding to combat the formation of <b>spurious</b> “ghost ” <b>pulses</b> in high data-rate communication over an optical fiber. We show using techniques from Ramsey theory that if x satisfies the qGP constraint, then the support of x is a disjoint union of cosets of a subgroup kZ of Z and a set of zero density. I...|$|R
