5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and <b>shallow</b> water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in <b>shallow,</b> and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from <b>shallow</b> to deep water and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|This {{approach}} {{makes two}} assumptions. First, {{it assumes that}} the disadvantage of forfeiting one's turn {{is greater than the}} disadvantage of performing a <b>shallower</b> search. Provided the <b>shallower</b> search is not too much <b>shallower</b> (in practical implementation, the null-move search is usually 2 or 3 plies <b>shallower</b> than the full search would have been), this is usually true. Second, it assumes that the null-move search will produce a cutoff frequently enough to justify the time spent performing null-move searches instead of full searches. In practice, this is also usually true.|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of the simulated result in the <b>shallower</b> region may not be well guaranteed. Furthermore, the modeled fault does not reach the free surface. These factors result in an underestimation of the final slips in the <b>shallower</b> region compared to the inversion results. However, we point out that a significant effect from the <b>shallower</b> region is not required for the multi-event generation.|$|R
5|$|In the Cretaceous, a <b>shallow</b> seaway {{spread into}} the {{interior}} of North America from the Gulf of Mexico in the south into Utah and later to the Arctic Ocean in the far north. Geologists call this <b>shallow</b> sea the Cretaceous Seaway or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient Appalachian Mountains and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from <b>shallow</b> thrust faulting caused by the Sevier orogeny. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from {{being part of the}} Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay {{on top of each other}} as a result.|$|E

5|$|Oil and gas form on {{the bottom}} of <b>shallow</b> seas when {{micro-organisms}} decompose under anoxic conditions and later become covered with sediment. Many deserts were at one time the sites of <b>shallow</b> seas and others have had underlying hydrocarbon deposits transported to them by the movement of tectonic plates.|$|E
50|$|Multihulls have {{a broader}} variety of hull and payload geometries. They have a {{relatively}} large beam, deck area (upper and inner), above-water capacity, <b>shallower</b> draft (allowing operation in <b>shallower</b> water).|$|R
30|$|When fault {{elements}} dissect a permeable layer, {{a connection}} {{can be developed}} between <b>shallower</b> part (up thrown side) with the deeper one (downthrown side) that, in turn, will provide vertical fluid flow path and the pressure transfer from the higher-pressured part (deeper) to the <b>shallower</b> part until the two pressures are equalized. Then the <b>shallower</b> part will have a higher pore pressure than it should {{as a result of}} two natural causes: faulting and repressuring.|$|R
50|$|Another school {{suggests}} that desiccation was synchronous, but occurred mainly in <b>shallower</b> basins. This model {{would suggest that}} the sea level of the whole Mediterranean basin fell at once, but only <b>shallower</b> basins dried out enough to deposit salt beds. See image b.|$|R
5|$|The Chief Constructor, Sir Edward Reed, was ill so {{the design}} of this ship was {{entrusted}} to his assistant and brother-in-law, Nathaniel Barnaby, himself a future Chief Constructor. For reasons that have not survived, the Admiralty required that Penelope to be a ship of unusually <b>shallow</b> draught, possibly {{in light of the}} operations in the <b>shallow</b> Baltic Sea during the Crimean War of 1854–55.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} several ayres, or storm beaches, which form narrow spits of shingle or sand cutting across the landward and seaward ends of <b>shallow</b> bays. They can {{sometimes}} {{cut off a}} body of water from the sea, forming <b>shallow</b> freshwater lochs known as oyces. Examples include Vasa Loch and Lairo Water.|$|E

50|$|The {{yellowmouth grouper}} will {{occasionally}} swim into <b>shallower</b> waters, but normally lives in deep waters. It {{is also found}} on rocky bottoms and coral beds that range from 4 to 55 meters in depth. The smaller individuals will stay in the <b>shallows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The overall {{morphology}} of the basin, <b>shallowing</b> {{towards the}} margins and towards the northern section, {{is likely to}} have facilitated fluid migration in Cenozoic times towards these <b>shallower</b> regions.

40|$|We show {{experimental}} evidence that as relatively long unidirectional waves propagate over a sloping bottom, from a deeper to a <b>shallower</b> domain, {{there can be}} a local maximum of kurtosis and skewness close to the <b>shallower</b> side of the slope. We also show evidence that the probability of large wave envelope has a local maximum near the <b>shallower</b> side of the slope. We therefore anticipate that the probability of freak waves can have a local maximum near the <b>shallower</b> side of a slope for relatively long unidirectional waves.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>shallows</b> of water reservoirs, which are located between the shore line and the deep water area. The intermediate location of these <b>shallows</b> is the reason that their formation, especially at large amplitude of water level oscillations, is a very complex process. At the same time the role of these <b>shallows</b> is subject to considerable discussion in the relevant literature. Comprehensive investigations of water quality at present include not only the technological aspects of pollution control (waste treatment, water purification, etc.) but also the relevant ecological problems which in turn are closely related to social problems and to the conditions of human life. This paper describes the role of reservoir <b>shallows,</b> taking into consideration the entire spectrum of the above mentioned aspects. Special stress is given to the filtering role of shallows; they act as natural filters protecting water in the reservoir against the nonpoint source pollutants of agricultural origin which are difficult to control. The degree to which the reservoir <b>shallows</b> can act as the "natural filters" depends on their structure, which in turn depends on the regime of water level oscillations in the reservoir. This dependence makes possible the control of natural processes which occur in the ecosystem of the reservoir's <b>shallows</b> by the appropriate control of the reservoir water levels...|$|R
