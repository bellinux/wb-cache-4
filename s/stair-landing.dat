60|$|He {{took off}} his shoes, and put on his {{slippers}} and his house-coat, {{and went to the}} <b>stair-landing</b> outside, and listened to the voices in the library below. He could hear only women's voices, and he inferred that the young man who had been dining with his daughters was gone. He went back into his bedroom, and looked at the face of an unmasked thief in his glass.

He was pleased to superintend some of the details for a dance at Christmas-time before Virginia left Monticello, but he sat as usual on the <b>stair-landing.</b> There Mr. Jacob Cluyme (who had been that day in {{conversation}} with the teller of the Boatman's Bank) chanced upon him. Mr. Cluyme was so charmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted {{the rise and fall of}} sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr. Hopper to dinner. And from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of which Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society. If the Cluyme household was not polite, it was nothing. Eliphalet sat next to Miss Belle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he cherished for future use. Mrs. Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which (if the truth were told) needed an apology. All of which is significant, but sordid and uninteresting. Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before a rise.|$|E
