40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the dynamical coupling of the ocean's {{surface and the}} ocean's interior. In particular, we investigate the dynamics of an oceanic surface jet, and its interaction with vortices at depth. The jet is induced by buoyancy (density) anomalies at the surface. We first focus on the jet alone. The linear stability indicates there are two modes of instability: the sinuous and the varicose modes. When a vortex in present below the jet, it interacts with it. The velocity field induced by the vortex perturbs the jet and triggers its destabilisation. The jet also influences the vortex by pushing it under a region of co-operative shear. Strong jets may also partially <b>shear</b> <b>out</b> the vortex. We also investigate the interaction between a surface jet and a vortex dipole in the interior. Again, strong jets may partially <b>shear</b> <b>out</b> the vortex structure. The jet also modifies the trajectory of the dipole. Dipoles travelling towards the jet at shallow incidence angles may be reflected by the jet. Vortices travelling at moderate incidence angles normally cross below the jet. This {{is related to the}} displacement of the two vortices of the dipole by the shear induced by the jet. Intense jets may also destabilise early and form streets of billows. These billows can pair with the vortices and separate the dipole. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{resistance}} of conventionally constructed wood-framed structures to extreme {{events such as}} earthquakes and hurricanes depends {{in large part on}} the strength and energy absorption characteristics of the shear walls. These shear walls are often sheathed with oriented strand board (OSB) panels, and their performance is primarily a function of the nailed sheathing-to-framing connections at the panel edges. A new sheathing panel called Advanced OSB (AOSB) has been developed at the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center. The AOSB panel integrates glass fiberreinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing into regions of the OSB panel that have been observed to fail under hurricane or earthquake loading.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{contribution}} to the PHYSINDIEN research program. It was supported by CNRS-RFBR contract PRC 1069 / 16 - 55 - 150001. The effect of a bottom slope on the merger of two identical Rankine vortices is investigated in a two dimensional, quasi-geostrophic, incompressible fluid. When two cyclones initially lie parallel to the slope, and more than two vortex diameters away from the slope, the critical merger distance is unchanged. When the cyclones are closer to the slope, they can merge at larger distances, but they lose more mass into filaments, thus weakening the efficiency of merger. Several effects account for this: the topographic Rossby wave advects the cyclones, reduces their mutual distance and deforms them. This along shelf wave breaks into filaments and into secondary vortices which <b>shear</b> <b>out</b> the initial cyclones. The global motion of fluid towards the shallow domain and the erosion of the two cyclones are confirmed by the evolution of particles seeded both in the cyclone sand near the topographic slope. The addition of tracer to the flow indicates that diffusion is ballistic at early times. For two anticyclones, merger is also facilitated because one vortex is ejected offshore towards the other, via coupling with a topographic cyclone. Again two anticyclones can merge at large distance but they are eroded in the process. Finally, for taller topographies, the critical merger distance is again increased and the topographic influence can scatter or completely erode one of the two initial cyclones. Conclusions are drawn on possible improvements of the model configuration for an application to the ocean. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|During normal {{assembly}} and disassembly of bolted-joint components, thread damage and/or deformation may occur. If threads are overloaded, thread damage/deformation {{can also be}} anticipated. Typical inspection techniques (e. g. using GO-NO GO gages) may not provide adequate visibility {{of the extent of}} thread damage. More detailed inspection techniques have provided actual pitch-diameter profiles of damaged-hardware holes. A method to predict the reduction in thread shear-out capacity of damaged threaded holes has been developed. This method was based on testing and analytical modeling. Test samples were machined to simulate damaged holes in the hardware of interest. Test samples containing pristine parent-holes were also manufactured from the same bar-stock material to provide baseline results for comparison purposes. After the particular parent-hole thread profile was machined into each sample a helical insert was installed into the threaded hole. These samples were tested in a specially designed fixture to determine the maximum load required to <b>shear</b> <b>out</b> the parent threads. It was determined from the pristine-hole samples that, for the specific material tested, each individual thread could resist an average load of 3980 pounds. The shear-out loads of the holes having modified pitch diameters were compared to the ultimate loads of the specimens with pristine holes. An equivalent number of missing helical coil threads was then determined based on the ratio of shear-out loads for each thread configuration. These data were compared with the results from a finite element model (FEM). The model gave insights into the ability of the thread loads to redistribute for both pristine and simulated damage configurations. In this case, it was determined that the overall potential reduction in thread load-carrying capability in the hardware of interest was equal to having up to three fewer threads in the hole that bolt threads could engage. One- half of this potential reduction was due to local pitch-diameter variations and the other half was due to overall pitch-diameter enlargement beyond Class 2 fit. This result was important in that the thread shear capacity for this particular hardware design was the limiting structural capability. The details of the method development, including the supporting testing, data reduction and analytical model results comparison will be discussed hereafter...|$|E
40|$|Laminated {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} employed {{in a variety}} of industries ranging from Aerospace to Wind Power. The high specific stiffness and strength of these materials renders their wider application advantageous in many fields. However, the broader implementation of such composites is frequently restrained by their poor impact resistance and damage tolerance. Even events as innocuous as a dropped tool can impart significant damage to such materials. Such damage can lead to drops in the strength and stiffness that are unacceptable for many applications, particularly those in Aerospace. 3 D woven composites present a possible means of improving the impact resistance and damage tolerance of composite materials. The incorporation of out-of-plane fibres, transversely passing through layers of in-plane fibres, is the means by which this improvement in performance is obtained. This body of work presents an investigation into the behaviour of three dimensionally woven carbon fibre composites. Specifically, the subject composite fabric had an orthogonally woven three dimensional structure. The novelty of these materials is such that knowledge and understanding of their mechanical behaviour is very limited. The purpose of this work was to remedy this through experimental and analytical analysis of these composites. The 3 D woven materials were characterized experimentally using a variety of techniques. In addition to evaluating the material experimentally, analytical methods were also used. Current analytical methods were found to be deficient in their incapacity to account for in-plane crimp on a micro scale. As a result a new micro scale approach for predicting the stiffness and strength of these 3 D woven materials was developed. The composites used for this thesis were tested using a variety of means. The range of test methodologies used subjected the materials to in-plane, out-of-plane, dynamic and quasi- static loadings. Techniques used included; tension, shear, impact, compression after impact, bolt <b>shear</b> <b>out</b> and bearing pull through. Other means implemented included microscopy, C-scanning and Digital Image Correlation. In addition, conventional composites made from unidirectional pre-pregs or Non-Crimp Fabrics (NCFs) were tested to provide a basis for comparison. Analysis and prediction of the behaviour of conventional laminated composites can be performed using a variety of methods. While the range of methods available is broad, they commonly use individual plies of composite as their fundamental building blocks. This is both convenient analytically and experimentally as the properties of such individual lamina may be found with reasonable ease. However, 3 D woven composites are integrated laminates due to the out‐of‐plane fibres they possess. As a result, the accuracy of conventional experimental or analytical methods for evaluating these materials is likely to be poor. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the behaviour of these 3 D woven materials a new micromechanics model was developed. In contrast to other available methods, this micromechanics approach examines the effect of crimp at the fibre level. The method proposed is also distinct in its capability of simultaneously accounting for varying crimp across and along a section of composite.

40|$|Statistical weak lensing by {{large-scale}} structure { cosmic shear { is {{a promising}} cosmological tool, which has motivated {{the design of}} several large upcoming astronomical surveys. This Thesis presents a measurement of cosmic shear using coadded Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging in 168 square degrees of the equatorial region, with r 2 and median redshift of z med = 0. 52. These coadds were generated using a new rounding kernel method that was intended to minimize systematic errors in the lensing measurement due to coherent PSF anisotropies that are otherwise prevalent in the SDSS imaging data. Measurements of cosmic <b>shear</b> <b>out</b> to angular separations of 2 degrees are presented, along with systematics tests of the catalog generation and shear measurement steps that demonstrate that these results are dominated by statistical rather than systematic errors. Assuming a cosmological model corresponding to WMAP 7 (Komatsu et al., 2011) and allowing only the amplitude of matter fluctuations &sigma 8 to vary, the best-t value of the amplitude of matter fluctuations is &sigma 8 = 0. 636 + 0. 109 - 0. 154 (1 &sigma); without systematic errors this would be &sigma 8 = 0. 636 + 0. 099 - 0. 137 (1 &sigma). Assuming a flat &LambdaCDM model, the combined constraints with WMAP 7 are &sigma 8 = 0. 784 super>+ 0. 028 - 0. 026 (1 &sigma). The 2 &sigma error range is 14 percent smaller than WMAP 7 alone. Aside from the intrinsic value of such cosmological constraints from the growth of structure, some important lessons are identied for upcoming surveys that may face similar issues when combining multi-epoch data to measure cosmic shear. Motivated by the challenges faced in the cosmic shear measurement, two new lensing probes are suggested for increasing the available weak lensing signal. Both use galaxy scaling relations to control for scatter in lensing observables. The first employs {{a version of the}} well-known fundamental plane relation for early type galaxies. This modified "photometric fundamental plane" replaces velocity dispersions with photometric galaxy properties, thus obviating the need for spectroscopic data. We present the first detection of magnication using this method by applying it to photometric catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This analysis shows that the derived magnication signalis comparable to that available from conventional methods using gravitational shear. We suppress the dominant sources of systematic error and discuss modest improvements that may allow this method to equal or even surpass the signal-to-noise achievable with shear. Moreover, some of the dominant sources of systematic error are substantially different from those of shear-based techniques. The second outlines an idea for using the optical Tully-Fisher relation to dramatically improve the signal-to-noise and systematic error control for shear measurements. The expectederror properties and potential advantages of such a measurement are proposed, and a pilot study is suggested in order to test the viability of Tully-Fisher weak lensing {{in the context of the}} forthcoming generation of large spectroscopic surveys...|$|E
40|$|Straight-forward {{models of}} X-ray {{reflection}} in the inner region of accretion discs predict that primary X-ray flux and the flux reflected off {{the surface of the}} disc should vary together, albeit a short light travel time delay. Most of the observations, however, show that the X-ray flux can vary while the reflected features remain constant. Here we propose a simple explanation to this. In all likelihood, the emission of a moderately optically thick magnetic flare atop an accretion disc is anisotropic. A constant energy release rate in a flare will appear to produce a variable X-ray flux as the flare rotates with the accretion disc anchoring the magnetic tube. The reflector, on the other hand, receives a constant X-ray flux from the flare. Since the reflected emission is azimuthally symmetric, the observer will see a roughly constant reflected flux (neglecting relativistic effects). The model does not produce quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) if magnetic flux tubes are <b>sheared</b> <b>out</b> faster than they complete one orbit.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  3 b that the impact velocity/time curve {{displayed}} an S shape, i.e., it decreased gradually until it leveled off. While the deflection/time curve regarding impact loading demonstrated a linear increasing trend. When the impactor began to touch the board surface, matrix cracks first occurred along the fiber direction. At that state, the energy absorption of the board as well as the ratio of velocity decreased were very low. Then, a number of cracks started to generate, develop, and expand among interlayers, generating delamination. The energy absorption vs. time for the board increased gradually, and impact velocity decreased as the impactor energy decreased. After this occurrence, the reinforced bamboo bundle fibers (cross-laminated board) were subjected to compression, tensile, and shear stress under the effect of in-plane and transverse impacting stress waves [19]. The fibers of laminated layers were transversely deformed, which was demonstrated by pulling off or <b>shearing</b> <b>out</b> from {{the back side of the}} board, as seen in Fig.  4. At that moment, the energy absorption for the board increased quickly as the impact velocity rate decreased (Fig.  3).|$|R
