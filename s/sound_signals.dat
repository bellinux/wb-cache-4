25|$|The {{development}} of quadraphonic records {{was announced in}} 1971. These recorded four separate <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.|$|E
25|$|Sensory dissonance and its two perceptual manifestations (beating and roughness) {{are both}} {{closely related to}} a sound signal's {{amplitude}} fluctuations. Amplitude fluctuations describe variations in the maximum value (amplitude) of <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> relative to a reference point and {{are the result of}} wave interference. The interference principle states that the combined amplitude of two or more vibrations (waves) at any given time may be larger (constructive interference) or smaller (destructive interference) than the amplitude of the individual vibrations (waves), depending on their phase relationship. In the case of two or more waves with different frequencies, their periodically changing phase relationship results in periodic alterations between constructive and destructive interference, giving rise to the phenomenon of amplitude fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|A metamaterial-based device {{wirelessly}} converts a 900MHz microwave {{signal to}} 7.3 volts of direct current (greater {{than that of}} a USB device). The device can be tuned to harvest other signals including Wi-Fi signals, satellite signals, or even <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The experimental device used a series of five fiberglass and copper conductors. Conversion efficiency reached 37 percent. When traditional antennas are close to each other in space they interfere with each other. But since RF power goes down by the cube of the distance, the amount of power is very very small. While the claim of 7.3 volts is grand, the measurement is for an open circuit. Since the power is so low, there can be almost no current when any load is attached.|$|E

2500|$|A high-pass (low-cut) and/or {{low-pass}} (high-cut) filter {{may also}} be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low frequency <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> (termed infrasonic, or subsonic, a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can be hard on the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. [...] If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and low-pass filters function as end-cut filters. [...] A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or notch filter which includes a microprocessor to detect the onset of [...] feedback [...] "howls" [...] and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Ocean {{acoustic}} tomography {{is a technique}} used to measure temperatures and currents over large regions of the ocean. [...] On ocean basin scales, this technique {{is also known as}} acoustic thermometry. [...] The technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> to travel between two instruments, one an acoustic source and one a receiver, separated by ranges of 100–5000km. [...] If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of time-of-flight can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path. [...] Changes in the speed of sound are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature. [...] A 1°C change in temperature corresponds to about 4m/s change in sound speed. [...] An oceanographic experiment employing tomography typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a moored array that measures an area of ocean.|$|E

2500|$|Catfish {{can produce}} {{different}} types of sounds and also have well-developed auditory reception used to discriminate between sounds with different pitches and velocities. They are also able to determine {{the distance of the}} sound's origin and from what direction it originated. This is a very important fish communication mechanism, especially during agonistic and distress behaviors. Catfish are able to produce a variety of sounds for communication that can be classified into two groups: drumming sounds and stridulation sounds. [...] The variability in catfish <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> differs due to a few factors: the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resulting sound, and physiological differences such as size, sex, and age. [...] To create a drumming sound, catfish use an indirect vibration mechanism using a swimbladder. In these fishes, sonic muscles insert on the ramus Mulleri, also known as the elastic spring. The sonic muscles pull the elastic spring forward and extend the swimbladder. When the muscles relax, the tension in the spring quickly returns the swimbladder to its original position, which produces the sound.|$|E
