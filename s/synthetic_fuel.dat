5|$|In September 2006, the B-52 {{became one}} of the first US {{military}} aircraft to fly using alternative fuel. It took off from Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of Fischer-Tropsch process (FT) <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> and conventional JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines. On 15 December 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards with the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> powering all eight engines, the first time an air force aircraft was entirely powered by the blend. The seven-hour flight was considered a success. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, which aims to reduce crude oil usage and obtain half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. On 8 August 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully approved to use the FT blend.|$|E
5|$|The B-1B {{underwent}} {{a series of}} flight tests using a 50/50 mix of synthetic and petroleum fuel; on 19 March 2008, a B-1B from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, became the first USAF aircraft to fly at supersonic speed using a <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> during a flight over Texas and New Mexico. This was conducted {{as part of an}} ongoing Air Force testing and certification program to reduce reliance on traditional oil sources. On 4 August 2008, a B-1B flew the first Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod equipped combat sortie where the crew successfully targeted enemy ground forces and dropped a GBU-38 guided bomb in Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>fuel,</b> created via coal liquefaction, {{requires}} no engine modifications {{for use in}} standard automobiles. As a byproduct of oil embargoes during Apartheid in South Africa, Sasol, using the Fischer-Tropsch process, developed relatively low-cost coal-based fuel. Currently, about 30% of South Africa's transport-fuel (mostly diesel) is produced from coal. With crude-oil prices above US$40 per barrel, this process is now cost-effective.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} the WTW-LCA from flared {{associated}} gas for the three scenarios (a typical well in Ohio, and existing flares in the US, and globally); the volume of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> that could be produced for these three scenarios; the reduction in emissions by converting this associated gas directly to <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> at the wellhead; and the reduction in vehicle emissions from using the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> in diesel vehicles are described. The importance of these findings for the mitigation of global GHGs and reduced environmental impact from criteria pollutants in ambient air are discussed.|$|R
25|$|The new {{millennium}} brought new projects with worldwide impact. The X-35A and X-32A, competing {{models for the}} Joint Strike Fighter program, made their first flights in September and October 2000. The X-35A won the competition in 2001 and will eventually be built in various versions for America's flying armed services and for foreign air forces as well. Also new are the RQ-4 Global Hawk, YAL-1 Airborne Laser, the B-52 <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> program, the C-17 Globemaster III, and many prototype unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).|$|E
25|$|It {{serves as}} an {{important}} reaction in both coal liquefaction and gas to liquids technology {{as well as many}} other chemical processes aimed at producing compounds based on hydrocarbon chains. It works by combining carbon monoxide and hydrogen that are produced from coal, natural gas, or biomass in a process known as gasification, and the Fischer–Tropsch process then turns these gases into a synthetic lubrication oil and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel.</b> The Fischer–Tropsch process has received intermittent attention as a source of low-sulfur diesel fuel and to address the supply or cost of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Albert Speer {{claimed that}} the German economy {{achieved}} greater armaments output, not because of diversions of capacity from civilian to military industry but through streamlining of the economy. Richard Overy pointed out some 23 percent of German output was military by 1939. Between 1937 and 1939, 70 percent of investment capital went into the rubber, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel,</b> aircraft and shipbuilding industries. Hermann Göring had consistently stated that {{the task of the}} Four Year Plan was to rearm Germany for total war. Hitler's correspondence with his economists also reveals that his intent was to wage war in 1943–1945, when the resources of central Europe had been absorbed into the Third Reich.|$|E
30|$|This study {{establishes}} {{that the}} direct production of liquid <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> from associated flare gas at the wellhead can significantly reduce air emissions of GHGs and criteria pollutants in the US and globally. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels,</b> produced from flare gas, are premium products that improve engine performance, increase engine lifetime, and decrease emissions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, {{following}} the 1985 oil glut, President Reagan {{signed into law}} the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 which among other things abolished the <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation. [...] It is estimated that over 40 years {{the cost of the}} various efforts at creating <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> may have totaled as much as $8 billion.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} processes {{that can be}} used to produce <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
25|$|In principle, {{gasification}} {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it {{may be used for}} power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> via the Fischer–Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of gasification is that using the syngas (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially {{more efficient than}} direct combustion of the original fuel {{because it can be}} combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot's rule is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in gas engines, used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process into <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel.</b> Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as biodegradable waste. In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.|$|E
25|$|Renewable energy doesn't {{always have}} to come from a {{developing}} country. The Developing Areas Study Group session is a group of speakers from all over the energy businesses discuss the potential ideas to get developing countries the renewable energy that they need. Papers written by W. Morgan, R. Moss and P. Richard discuss the opportunities of renewable resources that lie within the developing country as well. Morgan and Richard claim firewood and agriculture could play a great role in an alternative energy solution in developing countries, while Richards claims that efficient use of agriculture could lead to renewable energy. Morgan also points out that green plants could play a great role in producing <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> alcohol, which would not only impact the developing country, but {{the world as a whole}} in providing an alternative fuel source.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, {{after the}} second oil crisis, the U.S. Congress {{approved}} the Energy Security Act forming the <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation and authorized up to $88 million for <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> projects. This program focused on implementation of commercially available processes such as Lurgi gasification of lignite and Texaco gasification of coal to feed a gas turbine/combined cycle electric generating system.|$|R
50|$|When {{petroleum}} is {{not easily}} available, chemical processes such as the Fischer-Tropsch process {{can be used to}} produce liquid fuels from coal or natural gas. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> from coal were strategically important during World War II for the German military. Today <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> produced from natural gas are manufactured, {{to take advantage of the}} higher value of liquid fuels in transportation.|$|R

25|$|The Luftwaffe {{was now in}} an {{impossible}} position. The oil industry had to be defended, but doing so was costly. I. Jagdkorps was losing fighters {{at a rate of}} 10% per mission, while the American bomber losses were only at two percent. It was not until July 28, 1944, during an attack by the USAAF's 92nd Bomb Group on the Leipzig/Leuna <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> complex that the first direct point-defense fighter action meant specifically to defend the synthetic oil facilities of Nazi Germany began, as the Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighters of I./JG 400 made their first operational strike against the USAAF's bomber combat boxes from JG 400's nearby base at Brandis, to little effect. By September 1944, the loss to kill ratio was against the Luftwaffe. With some exceptions, the loss rate for Allied formations remained under one percent, the German losses were lying between 10 and 20%. The Allied formations were 18 times larger than the Germans by this stage, which meant the respective loss ratios would indicate a higher loss for the German defenders. However, during September the actual kill count of the RLV during September 1944 was 307 shot down for 371 losses. By October 1944, serviceable aircraft amounted to just 347, excluding units on conversion training.|$|E

The forces assigned to the operation included two destroyers, two torpedo boats, and a mine-layer; Nürnberg herself carried 130 mines. Severe fuel shortages prevented any further operations. On 24 January, she steamed to Copenhagen, where she remained {{until the end of}} the war, as she had only [...] of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> oil aboard.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the corporation was to partner with industry (primarily oil and gas companies) to create a market for domestically-produced <b>synthetic</b> liquid <b>fuels,</b> with a goal of producing [...] of liquid fuel per day within five years. Critics of the <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation [...] point to its failure to achieve its goals [...] {{as a reason to}} prevent government from interfering with free markets. The purported objective behind the <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation [...] was to move research and development of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> out of the Department of Energy and into a public-private partnership that would produce tangible results {{in a short period of}} time. Many believe that the drop in worldwide oil prices in the early 1980s played a primary role in obviating the need for the corporation, at least from a short-term economic perspective.|$|R
2500|$|Capturing [...] is most {{effective}} at point sources, such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, industries with major [...] emissions, natural gas processing, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> plants and fossil fuel-based hydrogen production plants. Extracting [...] from air is also possible, but not very practical because the [...] is not concentrated.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon-neutral fuels {{can refer}} {{to a variety of}} energy fuels or energy systems which have no net {{greenhouse}} gas emissions or carbon footprint. [...] One class is [...] <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> (including methane, gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel or ammonia) produced from sustainable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater. [...] Other types can be produced from renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar panels, and hydroelectric power stations.|$|E
2500|$|Coal {{liquefaction}} methods involve {{carbon dioxide}} (...) {{emissions in the}} conversion process. If coal liquefaction is done without employing either {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) technologies or biomass blending, the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from crude oil. If CCS technologies are employed, reductions of 5–12% can be achieved in Coal to Liquid (CTL) plants and up to a 75% reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass (30% biomass by weight) in coal/biomass-to-liquids plants. For future <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuel</b> projects, carbon dioxide sequestration is proposed to avoid releasing [...] into the atmosphere. Sequestration adds to the cost of production.|$|E

The mathematical box {{is a beautiful}} way of wrapping up a problem, {{but it will not}} hold the phenomena unless they have been caught in a logical box to begin with. In the beginning we generally believed that if the price of conventional oil continued to increase, at some point the price of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> would become competitive. But in March 1981 we learned from a report prepared for the 97 th Congress (Congressional Research Service, 1981) that the costs of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> are driven by the cost of oil: even if oil were to reach $ 100 per barrel, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> would still be more expensive! 2 Finally we knew that <b>synthetic</b> <b>fuels</b> could never be justified on an economic basis.

With financial aid from the government <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation in 1983, the Cathedral Bluffs company revised its plan, and applied for a contract with <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation to sell it 14,100 barrels of shale oil per day, produced by room-and-pillar mining and surface retorting. But negotiations dragged on, and the <b>Synthetic</b> <b>Fuels</b> Corporation was defunded by the Reagan administration in 1985. Pumping and maintenance of the shaft were suspended in 1991, and the shaft house was demolished in 2002. The project had not produced any oil.|$|R
