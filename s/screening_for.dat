40|$|Introduction <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign is a {{multimedia}} campaign that informs {{men and women}} aged 50 and older {{about the importance of}} colorectal cancer screening. The Appalachia Cancer Network undertook a qualitative research study to help determine whether <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life materials are being used and distributed by organizations serving Appalachian residents and to help assess key informants’ perceived acceptability of the materials. Methods Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 13 state and local informants in three Appalachian states to assess the diversity of community organizations that received the materials, the level of material use, and receptivity to <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life. Results Regional cancer control programs were more active in promoting <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life at local levels than state health departments. Although state health departments are the primary route <b>for</b> distributing <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life materials, they did not report the breadth of activities noted by regional cancer control programs. Several local interview respondents were unfamiliar with <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life, and respondents who were familiar with <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life used the materials in a general, unplanned way. Although some respondents were unfamiliar with the campaign materials, they were interested in <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life. No formal evaluations on the effectiveness of the materials were reported. Conclusion More guidance on how to implement the <b>Screen</b> <b>for</b> Life campaign as a targeted health communication media campaign would be helpful...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: to {{assess the}} {{sensitivity}} and specificity of a <b>screening</b> battery <b>for</b> detecting cognitive impairment after stroke. Design: a randomized controlled trial. Methods: stroke patients were recruited from hospitals in three centres. Patients were <b>screened</b> <b>for</b> cognitive impairment on the Mini‐Mental State Examination, the Sheffield <b>Screening</b> Test <b>for</b> Acquired Language Disorders and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and received a further battery of assessments of cognitive function. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated <b>for</b> the three <b>screening</b> measures <b>for</b> overall conclusions regarding cognitive impairment reached from a comprehensive assessment. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves were plotted. Conclusion: the Mini‐Mental State Examination was not a useful <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> memory problems or overall cognitive impairment after stroke. The Sheffield <b>Screening</b> Test <b>for</b> Acquired Language Disorders was an appropriate <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> language problems. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices was appropriate as a <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> perceptual problems and visual inattention but not for executive deficits...|$|R

5|$|Two {{types of}} {{analysis}} {{are used in}} the bioprospecting of metagenomic data: function-driven <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> an expressed trait, and sequence-driven <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> DNA sequences of interest. Function-driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity, followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis. This approach is limited by availability of a suitable screen and the requirement that the desired trait be expressed in the host cell. Moreover, the low rate of discovery (less than one per 1,000 clones screened) and its labor-intensive nature further limit this approach. In contrast, sequence-driven analysis uses conserved DNA sequences to design PCR primers to screen clones for the sequence of interest. In comparison to cloning-based approaches, using a sequence-only approach further reduces the amount of bench work required. The application of massively parallel sequencing also greatly increases the amount of sequence data generated, which require high-throughput bioinformatic analysis pipelines. The sequence-driven approach to screening is limited by the breadth and accuracy of gene functions present in public sequence databases. In practice, experiments make use of a combination of both functional and sequence-based approaches based upon the function of interest, the complexity of the sample to be screened, and other factors.|$|E
5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E

Both were involved in the Wilhelmshaven mutiny at the end of the war. Following Germany's defeat, Graudenz was ceded to Italy and served as Ancona until 1937, when she was sold for scrap. Regensburg was transferred to France, where she served as Strasbourg until 1936, when she was converted into a barracks ship. She was ultimately scuttled in Lorient to protect the German U-boat pens there.|$|E

5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in {{position}} to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began {{to pass through the}} British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50km (31mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx.
