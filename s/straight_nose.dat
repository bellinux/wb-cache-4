25|$|Photograph 4. – Nasal hump excision: The black {{delineation}} {{indicates the}} desired nose-reduction outcome: a <b>straight</b> <b>nose.</b> The nasal hump is bone (red) above the scalloped grey line, and cartilage (blue) below the scalloped grey line. The surgeon cuts the cartilage {{portion of the}} hump with a scalpel, and chisels the bone portion with an osteotome (bone chisel). After chiselling away the main mass of the nasal hump with an osteotome, the surgeon then sculpts, refines, and smoothens the cut nasal bones with rasps (files).|$|E
25|$|The Senoufo {{people of}} the Ivory Coast {{represent}} tranquility by making masks with eyes half-shut and lines drawn near the mouth. The Temne of Sierra Leone use masks with small eyes and mouths to represent humility and humbleness. They represent wisdom by making bulging forehead. Other masks that have exaggerated long faces and broad foreheads symbolize the soberness of one's duty that comes with power. War masks are also popular. The Grebo of the Ivory Coast and Liberia carve masks with round eyes to represent alertness and anger, with the <b>straight</b> <b>nose</b> to represent unwillingness to retreat.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other species}} which were {{assigned}} to Styracosaurus have since been assigned to other genera. S. sphenocerus, described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1890 as a species of Monoclonius and based on a nasal bone with a broken Styracosaurus-like <b>straight</b> <b>nose</b> horn, was attributed to Styracosaurus in 1915. [...] "S. makeli", mentioned informally by amateur paleontologists Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas in 1990 in a caption to an illustration, is an early name for Einiosaurus. [...] "S. borealis" [...] is an early informal name for S. parksi.|$|E

25|$|Wide nose – To narrow a too-wide nose, {{the plastic}} surgeon cuts, contours, and rearranges the craniofacial bones {{to achieve the}} desired {{functional}} and aesthetic outcome of a narrower, <b>straighter</b> <b>nose.</b> To leave no visible, surgical scars upon the new nose, the surgeon effects the osteotome (bone chisel) incisions to the nasal bones beneath the facial skin.|$|R
500|$|Individuals of the Styracosaurus genus were {{approximately}} [...] long as adults and weighed around 2.7tonnes. The skull was massive, {{with a large}} nostril, a tall <b>straight</b> <b>nose</b> horn, and a parietosquamosal frill (a neck frill) crowned with at least four large spikes. Each of the four longest frill spines was comparable in length to the nose horn, at [...] long. The nasal horn is estimated at [...] long in the type specimen, but the horn is only partially complete. Based on other nasal horn cores from Styracosaurus and Centrosaurus, this horn may {{have come to a}} rounded point at around half of that length.|$|E
500|$|Canning {{was born}} on 17September 1734 in the City of London, the eldest of five {{surviving}} children born to William (a carpenter) and Elizabeth Canning. [...] The family lived in two rooms in Aldermanbury Postern (a northern extension of Aldermanbury that formerly ran from a postern gate on London Wall to Fore Street; it no longer exists) in London. Aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood. [...] Canning was born into poverty. Her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two-room property with James Lord, an apprentice. [...] Lord occupied the building's front room, while Canning's family lived in the back room. [...] Her schooling was limited to {{only a few months}} at a writing school, and aged 15or16 she worked as a maidservant in the household of nearby publican John Wintlebury, who considered her an honest but shy girl. [...] From October 1752 she lived at the neighbouring home of a carpenter Edward Lyon, who shared Wintlebury's opinion of the young maidservant. Canning was described as a plump 18-year-old, about [...] tall with a face pitted by smallpox, a long, <b>straight</b> <b>nose,</b> and wide-set eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{the vampires}} in the Twilight series, Edward is {{described}} as being impossibly beautiful. At various points in the series, Bella compares him to the mythical Greek god Adonis. His skin is [...] "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. She describes his facial features as being perfect and angular—high cheekbones, strong jawline, a <b>straight</b> <b>nose,</b> and full lips. His hair, which is always messy, retains the unusual bronze shade that he inherited in his human life from his biological mother. His eyes, once green, are now described as topaz. His appearance changes if he goes too long without feeding: his eyes darken, becoming almost black, and purple bruises appear beneath his eyes. Edward is 6'2", and has a slender but muscular body.|$|E
50|$|The Boa Island {{bilateral}} {{figure is}} 73 centimetres (29 in) high, 45 cm (18 in) wide on its two broader surfaces, and 30 cm (12 in) wide on its two narrow surfaces. Each {{side of the}} figure has a face and torso. On {{the sides of the}} stone where the two carved figures are joined, is an interlace design that may represent hair. The faces are large and pointed ovals in shape, with big eyes, <b>straight</b> <b>noses,</b> and half open mouths with protruding tongues above the pointed chins.|$|R

50|$|In Mali, Burkina Faso and Senegal for instance, {{those within}} the fulɓe {{cultural}} sphere, {{but who are}} not ethnically Fula, {{are referred to as}} yimɓe pulaaku, i.e. (people of the Fula culture). As such, Fulani culture includes people {{who may or may not}} be ethnic Fulani. Although slavery is now illegal, memories of the past relationship between Fulɓbe and Rimayɓe are still very much alive in both groups. Paul Riesman, an American ethnographer who resided among the Jelgooji Ful&#595;be of Burkina Faso in the 1980s, states that the Fulɓe are tall, slim, and light-skinned; they have thin <b>straight</b> <b>noses,</b> and their hair tends to be long and curly. In contrast, the Rimayɓe are stocky, tending towards corpulence, dark-skinned with flat 'squashed' noses, and short kinky hair.|$|R
2500|$|Colonel Edward W. Wynkoop wrote: [...] "Kit Carson {{was five}} feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140 pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, {{squarely}} built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body. But, {{his head and}} face made up for all the imperfections {{of the rest of}} his person. His head was large and well-shaped with yellow straight hair, worn long, falling on his shoulders. His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with high cheekbones, <b>straight</b> <b>nose,</b> a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The FA had {{the same}} {{distinctive}} styling as its larger cousin, the ALCO PA, with a long, <b>straight</b> <b>nose</b> tipped by a headlight in a square, slitted grille and raked windshields. Only the first 36 GM FA-1s had the distinctive trim pieces found behind the cab windows of the PA. [...] As with the PA, the overall design owed much to the Fairbanks-Morse Erie-built design, which had been constructed by ALCO's sales partner General Electric (GE) at their Erie, Pennsylvania, plant. GE's industrial designer Ray Patten styled the FA and FB, and many believe it likely that he took drawings of the Erie-built as a starting point, lengthening and squaring the nose and giving it a more aggressive look. The majority of FA components were compatible with the PA.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout October intense {{flying and}} air combat was routine. The month closed {{in a great}} blaze of activity. A great number of {{missions}} were carried out in spite of constant attacks by enemy aircraft. [...] On the 9th Lt. Kenney and his observer where attacked near Jametz in which one enemy aircraft was shot down and others driven off-Kenny would later be awarded the DSC. On the 30th, six combats were engaged in, with two enemy aircraft being shot down. Lieutenants Strahm and Jervey and Lambert and Pope started on a photographic mission between Montmedy and Longuyon when they were attacked by 14 enemy Fokkers. A wild combat followed in which two enemy aircraft were shot down and another went into a <b>straight</b> <b>nose</b> dive into the ground. The squadron's formation, however, had been driven off-course during the mission and one squadron aircraft {{had to return to}} Vavincourt, being badly shot-up. Lieutenants Strahm and Jervey, however continued their mission, taking a total of 66 photographs. Bad weather kept the squadron grounded until 4 November when operations resumed. On that day, three German aircraft were shot down.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{carved from}} a single block of white Carrara marble – a rare medium for Giambologna. The surface is highly finished and in good condition aside from some drill and rasp marks. It depicts a nude young woman {{in the act of}} washing, seated in an awkward position on a truncated column. She is voluptuous and fleshy in the usual Mannerist way. She has a blank, inscrutable expression, and wavy, centrally-parted hair. Her <b>straight</b> <b>nose</b> reflects classical Roman sculpture. There is a bracelet on her left arm, and a chemise or shift with embroidered cuffs is draped across her left thigh. The woman's pose is complex, with her weight resting mostly on her left buttock, which is seated on a round column from which drapery hangs. According to art historian Peggy Fogelman, [...] "With one leg and both arms positioned in front of her, the figure's weight and the compositional balance seem tilted forward". Her left leg is raised; her knee sharply bent. The head is inclined downwards, and her eyes are blank. She holds an ointment jar in her left hand, raised high above her head. Her right hand holds a small cloth which she uses to clean her left foot.|$|E

5000|$|According to craniometric {{analysis}} by Carleton Coon (1939), aquiline noses in Africa are largely restricted to populations from North Africa and the Horn of Africa (in contrast {{to those of}} Sub-Saharan Africa), which is more generally peopled by those of Semitic, Arab, and other non-"Negroid" [...] descent. However, they are generally less common in these areas than are narrow, <b>straight</b> <b>noses,</b> which instead constitute the majority of nasal profiles. It has been reported however, that aquiline noses are more prevalent among Egyptian, Tunisian, Moroccan, Eritrean and Somali people, than among Southern Europeans. Among the Copts and Fellahin of Egypt, two distinct nasal types reportedly exist: one with a narrow, aquiline nose accompanied by a slim face, slender jaw and thin lips; the other with a slightly lower rooted, straight-to-concave nose, accompanied by a wider and lower face, a strong jaw, prominent chin, and moderately full lips.|$|R
5000|$|Naturalistic style coffins have {{well defined}} heads and facial features. These coffins are often molded in relief and have large Egyptian features, i.e. almond shaped eyes, arched eyebrows, <b>straight</b> <b>noses,</b> and full lips. The hair or wigs {{tend to be}} molded less sharply. The face lid of the coffins are molded {{separately}} and then later replaced upon the larger coffin, {{the shape of the}} lid hole also took into consideration the interning of bodies and is large enough for its purpose. Distinctive features are the high curved forehead, arched eyebrows and eyelid, broad turned up nose with deeply indented nostrils, plump cheeks, and protruding chin. [...] Flat planes and consistent lines complete the face. Arms are often thin and stick like, crossed or holding objects such as lotus blossoms. The formations of the arms sculpted thinly {{along the edge of the}} lid are a conceptual representation and on a majority of the coffins they are not overly defined.|$|R

And now suppose one {{of those}} old Ninevite or Egyptian builders, with a couple of {{thousand}} men--mud-bred, onion-eating creatures--under him, to be set to work, like so many ants, on his temple sculptures. What is he to do with them? He can put them through a granitic exercise of current hand; he can teach them all how to curl hair thoroughly into croche-coeurs, as you teach a bench of school-boys how to shape pothooks; he can teach them all how to draw long eyes and <b>straight</b> <b>noses,</b> and how to copy accurately certain well-defined lines. Then he fits his own great design to their capacities; he takes out of king, or lion, or god, as much as was expressible by croche-coeurs and granitic pothooks; he throws this into noble forms of his own imagining, and having mapped out their lines so {{that there can be no}} possibility of error, sets his two thousand men to work upon them, with a will, and so many onions a day.|$|R
5000|$|While large noses {{are a sign}} of Jewishness, Jewish authors take small noses {{as a sign of}} the Gentile.
