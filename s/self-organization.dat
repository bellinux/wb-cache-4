5|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{has suggested}} that <b>self-organization</b> may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, Kauffman {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy (for example, using pyrophosphate) in driving biochemical reactions in cells, as proposed by Christian DeDuve and modelled mathematically by Richard Bagley and Walter Fontana. Their systems are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{self-organizing}} behaviour {{of social}} {{animals and the}} <b>self-organization</b> of simple mathematical structures both suggest that <b>self-organization</b> should be expected in human society. Tell-tale signs of <b>self-organization</b> are usually statistical properties shared with self-organizing physical systems. Examples such as critical mass, herd behaviour, groupthink and others, abound in sociology, economics, behavioral finance and anthropology.|$|E
25|$|Cited {{examples}} of self-organizing behaviour also {{appear in the}} literature of many other disciplines, both in the natural sciences and in the social sciences such as economics or anthropology. <b>Self-organization</b> has also been observed in mathematical systems such as cellular automata. <b>Self-organization</b> is {{not to be confused with}} the related concept of emergence.|$|E

25|$|<b>Self-organization</b> {{occurs in}} many physical, chemical, biological, robotic, and {{cognitive}} systems. Examples {{can be found}} in crystallization, thermal convection of fluids, chemical oscillation, animal swarming, and artificial and biological neural networks.|$|E
25|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{and other}} structuralists {{have suggested that}} <b>self-organization</b> may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, this {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy in driving biochemical reactions in cells. The systems of reactions in any cell are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy. <b>Self-organization</b> is not an alternative to natural selection, but it constrains what evolution can do and provides mechanisms such as the self-assembly of membranes which evolution then exploits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-organization</b> is {{realized}} in the physics of non-equilibrium processes, and in chemical reactions, where it {{is often described as}} self-assembly. The concept has proven useful in biology, from molecular to ecosystem level.|$|E
25|$|Phenomena from {{mathematics}} {{and computer science}} such as cellular automata, random graphs, and some instances of evolutionary computation and artificial life exhibit features of <b>self-organization.</b> In swarm robotics, <b>self-organization</b> is used to produce emergent behavior. In particular the theory of random graphs {{has been used as}} a justification for <b>self-organization</b> as a general principle of complex systems. In the field of multi-agent systems, understanding how to engineer systems that are capable of presenting self-organized behavior is an active research area. Optimization algorithms can be considered self-organizing because they aim to find the optimal solution to a problem. If the solution is considered as a state of the iterative system, the optimal solution is the selected, converged structure of the system. Self-organizing networks include small-world networks and scale-free networks. These emerge from bottom-up interactions, unlike top-down hierarchical networks within organizations, which are not self-organizing. Cloud computing systems have been argued to be inherently self-organising, but while they have some autonomy, they are not self-managing as they do not have the goal of reducing their own complexity.|$|E
25|$|In this scenario, the Internet fulfils {{the role}} of the network of “nerves” that {{interconnect}} the subsystems and thus coordinates their activity. The cybernetic approach makes it possible to develop mathematical models and simulations of the processes of <b>self-organization</b> through which such coordination and collective intelligence emerges.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-organization</b> {{in biology}} can be {{observed}} in spontaneous folding of proteins and other biomacromolecules, formation of lipid bilayer membranes, pattern formation and morphogenesis in developmental biology, the coordination of human movement, social behaviour in insects (bees, ants, termites), and mammals, flocking behaviour in birds and fish.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the field}} of group {{facilitation}} and organization development, {{there have been a}} number of new group processes that are designed to maximize emergence and <b>self-organization,</b> by offering a minimal set of effective initial conditions. Examples of these processes include SEED-SCALE, Appreciative Inquiry, Future Search, the World Cafe or Knowledge Cafe, Open Space Technology, and others (Holman, 2010).|$|E
25|$|On {{his blog}} in 2007, Myers {{reviewed}} Stuart Pivar's book Lifecode, which argues that <b>self-organization</b> at the embryonic and fetal stages determine {{the development and}} final structure of organisms. Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had no basis in actual evidence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-organization</b> was {{associated}} with general systems theory in the 1960s, but did not become commonplace in the scientific literature until physicists and complex systems researchers adopted it in the 1970s and 1980s., Dissertation Abstracts finds nothing before 1954, and only four entries before 1970. There were 17 in the years 1971–1980; 126 in 1981–1990; and 593 in 1991–2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy source}} under the thermosynthesis {{hypothesis}} was thermal cycling, {{the result of}} suspension of protocells in a convection current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the <b>self-organization</b> and dissipative structure required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Nowotny's {{work in the}} 1970s and 1980s {{includes}} {{topics such}} as scientific controversies and technological risks, social time, coping with uncertainty, <b>self-organization</b> in science and gender relations in science, resulting in major monographs, co-edited and edited books and numerous articles. In 1989, she published the book Eigenzeit (English title: Time: The Modern and Postmodern Experience), which has since been translated into several languages.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil next {{writes about}} {{creating}} a digital brain inspired by the biological brain he has been describing. One existing effort he points to is Henry Markram's Blue Brain Project, which is attempting to create a full brain simulation by 2023. Kurzweil says the full molecular modeling they are attempting will be too slow, {{and that they will}} have to swap in simplified models to speed up initial <b>self-organization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The hypercycle is a {{cycle of}} connected, {{self-replicating}} macromolecules. In the hypercycle, all molecules are linked such that each of them catalyses the creation of its successor, with the last molecule catalysing the first one. In such a manner, the cycle reinforces itself. Furthermore, each molecule is additionally a subject for self-replication. The resultant system is {{a new level of}} <b>self-organization</b> that incorporates both cooperation and selfishness. The coexistence of many genetically non-identical molecules makes it possible to maintain a high genetic diversity of the population. This can be a solution to the error threshold problem, which states that, in a system without ideal replication, an excess of mutation events would destroy the ability to carry information and prevent the creation of larger and fitter macromolecules. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} hypercycles could originate naturally and that incorporating new molecules can extend them. Hypercycles are also subject to evolution and, as such, can undergo a selection process. As a result, not only does the system gain information, but its information content can be improved. From an evolutionary point of view, the hypercycle is an intermediate state of <b>self-organization,</b> but not the final solution.|$|E
25|$|In social theory, {{the concept}} of self-referentiality has been {{introduced}} as a sociological application of <b>self-organization</b> theory by Niklas Luhmann (1984). For Luhmann {{the elements of a}} social system are self-producing communications, i.e. a communication produces further communications and hence a social system can reproduce itself {{as long as there is}} dynamic communication. For Luhmann human beings are sensors in the environment of the system. Luhmann developed an evolutionary theory of Society and its subsystems, using functional analyses and systems theory.|$|E
25|$|While {{features}} of <b>self-organization</b> and self-replication are often considered {{the hallmark of}} living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions. Stan Palasek suggested based on a theoretical model that self-assembly of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules can occur spontaneously due to physical factors in hydrothermal vents. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications {{for the study of}} the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.|$|E
25|$|The cybernetician William Ross Ashby {{formulated}} {{the original}} principle of <b>self-organization</b> in 1947. It states that any deterministic dynamic system automatically evolves towards {{a state of}} equilibrium that {{can be described in}} terms of an attractor in a basin of surrounding states. Once there, the further evolution of the system is constrained to remain in the attractor. This constraint implies a form of mutual dependency or coordination between its constituent components or subsystems. In Ashby's terms, each subsystem has adapted to the environment formed by all other subsystems.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} {{is found}} widely in biological systems {{and provides the}} basis {{of a wide variety of}} complex biological structures. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. Thus, self-assembly is also emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, emulsions, phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is <b>self-organization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chaos {{theory is}} {{a branch of}} {{mathematics}} focused {{on the behavior of}} dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. 'Chaos' is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, <b>self-organization,</b> and reliance on programming at the initial point known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The butterfly effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.|$|E
25|$|According to many phoneticians, {{the sounds}} of {{language}} arrange and re-arrange themselves through <b>self-organization</b> Speech sounds have both perceptual ("how you hear them") and articulatory ("how you produce them") properties, all with continuous values. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds which are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages {{turn out to be}} a compromise between acoustic distinctiveness on the one hand, and articulatory ease on the other.|$|E
25|$|Further models {{studied the}} role of <b>self-organization</b> in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, that is the {{existence}} of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables. Pierre-Yves Oudeyer developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalizations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals. These models also characterized how morphological and physiological innate constraints can interact with these self-organized mechanisms to account for both the formation of statistical regularities and diversity in vocalization systems.|$|E
25|$|A further key {{concept in}} the field of swarm {{intelligence}} is stigmergy. Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of <b>self-organization.</b> It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{systematic}} persecution {{beginning in}} 1614 faced stiff resistance from Christians, despite {{the departure of}} {{more than half the}} clergy. Once again, the main reason for this resistance was not the presence of a few priests but rather the <b>self-organization</b> of many communities. Forced to secrecy, and having a small number of clergymen working underground, the Japanese Church was able to recruit leadership from among lay members. Japanese children caused admiration among the Portuguese and seem to have participated actively in the resistance. Nagasaki remained a Christian city in {{the first decades of the}} 17th century and during the general persecutions, other confraternities were founded in Shimabara, Kinai and Franciscans in Edo.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} emergence—that the {{properties}} and functions {{found at a}} hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind self-organizing systems. An example of <b>self-organization</b> in biology leading to emergence {{in the natural world}} occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do. Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scent from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety of ant. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviour and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.|$|E
