40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the <b>sliding</b> <b>clutch</b> gear and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the declutch mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the <b>sliding</b> <b>clutch</b> and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The declutch mechanism required adjustment to allow full drive lug engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the clutch drive lugs. To better evaluate the operation of the clutch components, the grease was cleaned out of the compartment and a boroscope used so that the action of the clutch could be seen. Boroscope examination of several declutching and re-clutching tests showed that the clutch lugs would not engage fully. The majo...|$|E
25|$|In 1896, {{managing}} director of the Lunéville plant, Adrien, Baron de Turckheim, bought the rights to a design by Amédée Bollée. This used a front-mounted horizontal twin engine with <b>sliding</b> <b>clutches</b> and belt drive. It had a folding top, three acetylene headlights, and, very unusual for the period, plate glass windshield. While the company started out using engines from Bollée, de Dietrich eventually produced the entire vehicle themselves.|$|R

5000|$|Used in watches, the keyless {{work are}} the gears that wind the {{mainspring}} when the crown is turned, {{and when the}} crown is pulled out allow the hands to be set. The term originated because, before the modern form of keyless work was invented by the French watchmaker Adrien Philippe in 1843, watches were wound and set by inserting a separate key into holes {{in the back and}} turning it. [...] The core of the keyless mechanism is a gear on the watch's winding stem, the clutch (or castle wheel in Britain), with two sets of axial gear teeth on it, which slides in and out. When the stem is pushed in, a lever <b>slides</b> the <b>clutch</b> out, and the outer set of teeth engages a small wheel train which turns the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring. When the stem is pulled out, the <b>clutch</b> <b>slides</b> in, and the inner teeth engage another wheel, which turns the hour wheel in the motion work, turning the watch's hands.|$|R

[...] Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using side rods; see Jackshaft (locomotive) for details.|$|R

The braking system included larger front rotors and cross-drilling all around. Quicker steering, lower-profile tires, and new shock settings improved handling. Most importantly, engine and gearbox position was rethought, which improved the centre of gravity, aiding the handling and making the car less fearsome on the limit.|$|R

The approach presented in the paper provides a more refined visualization of the energy flow and is applicable to numerous designs including <b>sliding</b> gears, <b>clutches,</b> overrunning clutches and flywheels, amongst others.

The tribofilm formations {{as well as}} the chemical and mechanical degradation for frictional interfaces can be different for the choice of the lubricant conditions. The present investigations revealed the effects of water contamination in automatic transmission fluid (ATF) not only on the frictional performance, but also on the friction interfaces. The surface profiles of the tested separator plates, the EDS-SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis of the friction interfaces and optical microscopy for the used friction liners showed the difference in surface morphology, adsorption of additive elements, permeability and porosity for a humid clutch environment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} process of damping of non-linear vibrations in a three-mass model of a power transmission system with a multi-disc exible friction clutch switched on and o electroma-gnetically. Steady-state motion of the system is subject to harmonic exci-tation. The problem is considered on the assumption of a uniform unit pressure distribution between the contacting surfaces of the cooperating friction discs. Structural friction, small relative <b>sliding</b> of the <b>clutch</b> discs and linear viscotic damping have also been taken into account. In the case of sliding, the friction coecient is not constant but depends on the relative angular velocity of slowly sliding discs. The aim of the analysis is to assess the in uence of geometric parameters of the system, its exter-nal load, unit pressure, viscotic damping on resonance curves and phase shift angle of steady-state vibrations. The equations of motion of the examined system are solved by means of the slowly varying parameters (Van der Pol) method and digital simulation.

40|$|Flywheel {{energy storage}} devices may be coupled to {{mechanical}} transmissions for braking energy recovery {{and the provision}} of additional power for acceleration in hybrid vehicles. Power transmission across a continuous range of speed ratios is necessary. The flywheel size and depth-of-discharge must be chosen for a particular application, and this has a direct effect on transmission efficiency, required gearing ratios and mass of components. Optimisation of these parameters requires a fundamental understanding of this interaction, which has not previously been investigated and reported. To address this, the current paper presents a new method of analysing mechanical flywheel systems. A simple algebraic analysis can be used to specify flywheel system parameters for any regenerative braking application where the flywheel is used to provide initial acceleration of the vehicle from stationary. This has been applied to systems using geared transmissions with continuous speed variation achieved through <b>sliding</b> contact in <b>clutch</b> and brake components. The results of the analysis highlight how the optimum selection of flywheel depth-of-discharge must achieve a balance between high transmission efficiency and low system mass. This is illustrated for a passenger car application, allowing a full assessment of system performance and the specification of appropriate design parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{tribological}} contact under <b>sliding</b> {{condition in}} <b>clutch</b> facing surfaces during engagement manoeuvres is strongly affected by heat transfer {{occurring in the}} system. The frictional forces acting on contact surfaces produce mechanical energy losses which are converted in heat with ensuing temperature increase. In this paper, in order to estimate the error due by neglecting the effective spatial distribution of heat flux the Authors explored the thermal generation in a dry clutch architecture during a vehicle launch manoeuvre. The results of the longitudinal vehicle dynamics {{have been used in}} a FEA to evaluate how the spatial distribution of heat flux influences the temperature field of contact surfaces. To this aim, simulations obtained by considering the same engagement manoeuvre but under different hypothesis, i. e. linearly dependable with disc radius and uniform heat flux have been compared. The results showed that the estimated thermal field in dry clutch components changes by varying hypothesis. In particular, in the first case the interface temperature is higher than the second one and the difference could grow with repeated engagements leading to underestimate the thermal stress of clutch components. In such a way, this paper aims at providing useful references to design and control engineers in order to improve the dry-clutch transmissions performances...|$|R

Firstly we have to do the marketing study in order to estimate the amount of the production we expect to sell in the first and the following years. The marketing study is done by analyzing the data from Spain and European database in industrial section together with the assumption based on reality. The results from this part are the expected production per year which can let us make the decision for the machine type and it will be used in economic study as well. Then the proper manufacturing process and specific tool’s type for each part will be decided and written on the Phase Document and the Summary of the Operation. These 2 documents are in the form that suitable to be used in reality effectively. Not only the manufacturing procedure, we also indicate the proper cutting condition and the calculations of cycle time, cutting force, machine power and the quality verification for each part. The data obtained by the calculation will be used to choose the specific model of machines, the amounts of machines and workers required to achieve the expected production. After we have the clear image of the production line, we shall advance to the economic study. The economic study is a good and reliable tool to indicate the profitability of the business. Every possible cost of the company will be taken into account and be presented as “ Hour Cost “.
