During vegetation following characteristics were observed: field germination, density of vegetation after germination and before harvest, height of plants, height of apical part of the lowest pod from the ground and yield. The results imply that the most effective way of seed treatment is the complete seed treatment, which ensured the yield of 3. 29 t of seeds per hectare (average for three years), the second best was the treatment with the compound Lexin, thanks to which the achieved yield was 3. 18 t of seeds per hectare. Laboratory experiments showed that application of biologically active compounds Lignohumate B, Lexin and brassinosteroids has possitive effect on not only laboratory germination of seeds, but also on seed vitality (detected laboratory germination after accelerated aging test). All used biologically active compounds increased laboratory germination rate, rate of plants with opened cotyledons, rate of plants with opened true leaves and amount of above-ground and underground biomass in the initial phases of growth. In the same time, laboratory experiments proved, that even if chosen parts of evaluated varieties had very similar laboratory germination, among others declared by seed producer, vitality test (accelerated aging test) showed considerable differences in vitality (thus even in quality) of chosen parts of seeds.

40|$|Background. Dry legumes {{seeds are}} food of high {{nutrient}} density. Besides the biologically precious protein they contain essential unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins of group B, dietary fiber and antioxidants. The {{aim of the}} research was to assess the influence of different soaking and cooking methods on dietary fiber and phe- nolic compounds content, as well as antioxidative activity of selected legumes&rsquo;seeds. Material and methods. The experimental material was dry kidney bean originating from collection of Krakow&rsquo;s Plants and Seeds Horticulture POLAN LTD, and soya bean seeds bought at the market store. The technological treatment of seeds was performed in two stages: 1) soaking in cold and hot water, 2) cook- ing with three different kinds of equipment &ndash; electrical stove, induction stove and microwave oven. In the above described ways prepared material was examined for the dietary fiber and phenolic compounds content, as well as antioxidative activity. Results. The highest amount of dietary fiber was found in soya bean seeds cooked on an induction stove (27. 4 g&middot; 100 g- 1 &nbsp;d. m.) and electric stove (27. 3 g&middot; 100 g- 1 &nbsp;d. m.) after previous soaking in hot water. The dry soya bean and kidney bean seeds were characterised by a high content of phenolic compounds 163. 2 mg GAE&middot; 100 g- 1 d. m. and 173. 1 mg GAE&middot; 100 g- 1 d. m. respectively. The dry matter of cooked (on induction and electric stove) kidney bean and <b>soya</b> <b>seeds</b> was characterised by a higher phenolic compounds level (232. 7 - 311. 6 mg GAE&middot; 100 g- 1 and 224. 4 - 315. 6 respectively) than raw material. Antioxidative activity of untreated seeds of kidney bean and soya bean was 4. 5 and 4. 1 &mu;mol Tx&middot;g- 1 d. m. respectively. The high ability of free radicals scavenging was observed in kidney bean i. e. 8. 7 &mu;mol Tx&middot;g- 1 &nbsp;d. m. after traditional soaking and 9. 5 &mu;mol Tx&middot;g- 1 d. m. after &ldquo;hot&rdquo; soaking. Conclusions. Soaking and cooking of seeds (despite the species) influenced growth of phenolic compounds content in dry matter. More advantageous way of soaking of kidney bean seeds was &ldquo;hot&rdquo; soaking. That way of treatment caused, first of all, shortening of the whole heat treatment process. Cooking of soya and kidney bean seeds with electric and induction stoves favoured keeping of dietary fiber, phenolic compounds and antioxidative activity of seeds in comparison to thermal treatment in combined microwave oven...|$|E

Four irrigation regimes: 80 - 85 % (T 1), 70 - 75 % (T 2), 60 - 65 % (T 3) of field capacity, and non-irrigated regime (T 0) were evaluated each experimental year. The experimental design was a randomised complete block with four replications on a Calcaric Chernozem. Water stress (drought) during growing season in the non-irrigated treatment (T 0) decreased plant physiological activity, vegetative growth, and productivity of soya bean. Irrigation treatments significantly (P < 0. 01) influenced <b>soya</b> bean <b>seed</b> yield and yield components. The treatment T 2 produced higher seed yield than T 1 and T 3. Irrigation regimes had statistically significant different effects on yield components such as the plant height at harvest, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, mass of pod with seeds per plant, 1, 000 seed mass and hectoliter mass of <b>soya</b> bean <b>seeds.</b> Yield reduction was mainly due to a lower number of pods and seeds per plant and lower seed mass. The T 1 treatment had the highest plant height of soya bean in all three growing years.

30|$|The {{rapidly growing}} global demand for energy and {{industrial}} raw materials from crude {{oil and the}} consequent depletion of crude oil reserves in addition to adverse environmental concerns and unstable nature of the international market make imperative the need to explore alternative sources of fuel and industrial raw materials. There {{has been an increase}} in the world production of oil seeds over the last 30  years. This would appear {{to be related to the}} increasing demand for oil seed products and by-products. Most seeds are cultivated primarily for their oil and meal. The oil from most seeds can be used for edible purposes (example is fluted pumpkin <b>seed</b> oil, <b>soya</b> bean <b>seed</b> oil) and about 80  % of the world production of vegetable oil is for human consumption while the remaining 20  % is shared between animals and chemical process industries [1]. As a result of the extensive demand of oil for consumption and industrial uses, analysis of many oils has been carried out. Most vegetable seed oils find wide applications in the production of soaps, paints, varnishes, lacquers, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, printing inks, dyes, pesticides, and insecticides [2, 3, 4, 5]. Also, with increase in petroleum prices and uncertainties surrounding petroleum availability, vegetable oil can be employed as an alternative fuel and for biodiesel production which aims to overcome energy crisis problem [6]. Due to the increasing applications of vegetable oils, a number of seed oils have been characterized but the vast majority have not been adequately evaluated and this is particularly valid for gmelina, which falls into this group of under-utilized species of plant. The ability of a particular oil seed to fit into the growing industry depends on its utilization potential, rate of production, and availability of processing technology [7].|$|R

Quality criteria for the evaluation and scrutiny of qPCR raw data were established, such as cut-off limits for the coefficient of determination (R 2), PCR efficiency and reproducibility. In this manuscript, different data evaluation approaches for qPCR raw data from the three interlaboratory comparisons were compared and the impact on the mean DNA copy number ratio and its standard deviation has been assessed. The importance of raw data evaluation and data filtering is discussed and its relevance not only for GMO reference material certification campaigns but also for routine GMO measurements is shown.

40|$|Soya bean is {{also known}} as green manure because it can {{increase}} soil fertility level. Nowadays, agricultural fields in Indonesia has drastically lowered in number to become housing and accomodate industrial purposes. Soya bean planting using agroforestry system is considered to overcome such problems in Indonesia as well as an effort to optimize under-tree spaces (forest vegetations). Soya bean rooting system is capable of forming nodulation in which Rhizobium japonicum bacteria colonize. Rhizobium bacteria establish such beneficial symbiosis with soya bean roots to fixate free nitrogen (N 2) from air (Rahmat, 1995). Rhizobium japonicum is employed as an effort {{to increase the number of}} soil-living rhizobium bacteria which in turn provide the plant with Nitrogen and thus increase the soya bean production (Freire, et. al. 1977). Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculum on soya bean is necessarily needed if soil nitrogen is the limiting factor of plant growth (Idiyah, 1997). Rhizobium infection and colonization into plant roots and initial root nodules are fully influenced by Ca. Ca is needed in rhizobium infection on interface level with medium of soil (Yutono, 1985). This research is conducted to isolate, select, and describe Bradyrhizobium japonicum in soya bean grown under sengon tree. The research was conducted in trial field of Muhammadiyah University of Malang in Tegalgondo and Biotechnology laboratory of Muhammadiyah University of Malang starting from April up to October 2007. Stages of operation include field preparation, <b>soya</b> bean <b>seed</b> planting, nodules picking up, nodules sterilization, Bradyrhizobium japonicum isolation, keeping of isolated strains, Gram Test, and bacteria portrayal. The research resulted in that by isolating, selecting, and describing 7 bacteria strains were found on the basis of its growth speed and share same characters including varyingly colony colors, from yellow to brownish white with colony tip is branched round to fully round and share the same thickness (Thick) ...|$|R
40|$|The eight-week {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} involving 27 -wk-old Isa brown laying hens {{to study the}} effect of dry extrusion processing on partial reduction in total glucosinolates content of locally produced rapeseed and on productivity and eggs quality parameters of laying hens. Thirty-six hens were randomly assigned one of three treatments (CONTR, AERS and HERS), each comprising 12, individual caged layers. The main composition of the diets was the same, but extruded <b>soya</b> bean <b>seed</b> were replaced with 2. 5 % of the extruded rapeseed in the AERS group and 4. 5 % in the HERS group. Rapeseed was extruded together with faba beans. Due to extrusion process the glucosinolates content was reduced by 7. 83 μmol/g of rapeseed. The results of conducted trial shows, that during all experimental period egg production parameters, such as the average feed intake (6529. 17 vs. 6257 g/hen/ 14 day; P < 0. 05) and laying intensity (94. 35 % vs. 89. 29; P < 0. 05) were statistically different for HERS and CONTR laying hens respectively. Only the feed conversion ratio to produce 1 kg of eggs, kg in AERS group was by 11 % lower compared to CONTR group (P < 0. 05). By analysing the effect of extruded rapeseed on egg mass, the statistical differences between treatments were no determined. The dietary treatments did not affect egg weight, albumen height, haugh units, albumen and yolk pH. However, in the HERS group were get eggs with the more intensive yolk color, higher redness (a) and yellowness (b) values. The inclusion of full-fat extruded rapeseed {{had no effect on}} egg shell quality parameters, i. e. shell breaking strength, shell weight with and without coat and shell index, but in the experimental groups were get eggs with the thinner shell (P < 0. 05). The internal egg quality analysis showed that with higher content of extruded rapeseed (4. 5 %) level in the diet, the total cholesterol in the eggs yolk decreased by 1. 92 mg/g in comparison wi[ [...] . ]...|$|R
40|$|The toxigenic fungal {{compounds}} called mycotoxin are {{poisonous substances}} produced by {{different species of}} fungus. Basically three major genera of fungus are identified to produce mycotoxins: they include Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillum. Although other genera also produces these toxigenic compounds. The presence of mytotoxins in food poses health risk ranging from mild to severe damage to the liver and kidney. Chronic damage may be induced in animals or human after ingestion of small quantity of the toxin present in contaminated foods. For example Aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus, if ingested from contaminated food could pose serious and severe health risk to man and animals. Foods like rice, corn, barley, wheat, sorghum, peanut, cotton <b>seeds,</b> <b>soya</b> bean, silages and by products feeds which have been mishandled are the major sources of mycotoxins. Different species of fungus produce different types of mycotoxins. The disease caused by ingestion of mycotoxins is called mycotoxicosis. Mycotoxin contamination of foods could be prevented by controlling the environmental condition that influence fungal growth, which is by controlling the physical conditions of the grains, cleaning the storage systems regularly and {{by the use of}} mold inhibitors and anti cracking additives. The control of the toxigenic compounds could also be by removing the suspected feed contaminated with mycotoxins or by addition of toxin binder to the ration of the feed...|$|R
40|$|The Project {{aimed at}} {{improving}} cost-of-production estimates for Irans' major crops, {{in cooperation with the}} Bureau of Agricultural Statistics and Information. The development objective of the project was to increase the production of strategic crops by ensuring that support prices established for wheat, barley, rice, <b>soya,</b> maize, sunflower <b>seed,</b> sugarbeet, cotton and jute, offer a reasonable return to farmers. The project evaluated the existing procedures for cost-of-production estimates and carried out a pilot survey to test alternative data-collection procedures. The survey allowed the improvement of the questionnaires used. It showed that farmers were not able to provide certain data with sufficient reliability and identified other sources for such information. The project has revealed the difficulty of accurate data collection on which reliability cost-of- production estimated may be based. National personnel have little knowledge of the theory, and little experience of the practice of such data-collection. Training in data collection is therefore a priority. There is scope for better coordination between data collection and data analysis. In particular, it is recommended that a working agreement be reached between the Department of Statistics and the Rural Research and Economic Centre for a joint programme of work. Once the necessary data is available regularly, and the capacity has been established to analyse and employ it systematically, it is recommended that the long-term aim should be to broaden the scope of the cost-of-production estimates, in order to cover the interrelationships between various farm activities...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world, <b>soya</b> {{beans and}} <b>seeds</b> are {{typically}} cultivated in large plantations. The way plantations {{have been established}} are often discussed as what represent the ‘global land grab’. Little has been discussed, however, about how large plantations evolve as they interact with various actors at national and local levels. In Mozambique’s plateaus, the soya sector was initially inspired by the large-scale South American production and it showed characteristics of the land grab. At the same time, it has developed into new types of business models, from contract farming to sourcing, which integrate more than 10, 000 smallholders in the value chain. This paper proposes to analyse {{the evolution of the}} soya sector in Mozambique, drawing on data collected from 160 households in Gurue district, in the province of Zambezia. It highlights how contract farming that is supposedly more ‘inclusive’ than the large-scale plantation had gone through a boom-and bust cycle, as smallholders have accumulated experience to exercise their agency to deal with the market, investors and fellow producers and begun to exit from the business and sell their produce to the open market. This process reveals how smallholders have exercised their agency to reject the contract and developed the soya bean production as a part of local struggles that are simultaneously influenced by multi-scale land and agricultural development projects of civil society and external donors. The paper concludes that developing the capacities of governments at different levels to grasp such evolvement, as well as of smallholders to hold governments accountable for their experience, is vital to make current soya business models socially inclusive and economically viable...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{resolves}} problems {{about the}} contain of mercury in chosen articles of food. Mercury, hydrargyrum, {{is a heavy}} metal, which is an important pollutant of environment. Mercury was determined for comparision in all in nine common articles of food. In rice, mushrooms, fish, lentils, poppy <b>seeds,</b> <b>soya,</b> soya dehydrated slice and oat flakes. Mushrooms were collected in four different provinces of Czech republic. In Highlands, Central province, South Bohemia and in province of Liberec. For comparings were analyzed cultivated mushrooms, Agaricus bisporus, from supermarket. As a fish were analyzed lyofilized samples of catfish, Silurus glanis. The other articles of food were bought in supermarkets. On an atomic absorption spectometer AMA 254 (Altec, Prague, CR), was made validation of analytic method. Results: accuracy (97 %), precision (3, 33 %), sensitivity (0, 00251 l/kg), limit of detection ((LOD= 0, 31 ?g/l), limit of quantification (LOQ= 1, 04 ?g/l), linear dynamic range (LDR= 1, 04 až 100 ?g/l) and correlation coefficient of linear part of calibration (0, 9979). Measurement of all samples was done with spectometer AMA 254. By analysis of all materials was detected that increased concentration of total mercury in all occures especially in mushrooms. The highest measured value, 5, 7 mg/kg, {{was found in a}} mushroom Xerocomellus chrysenteron from South Bohemia. Measured concentrations at lyofilized fish weren't important, it was only 0, 04 mg/kg. In other articles of food weren't detected overlimited values. We obtained from acquired results, that the highest amount of mercury is contained in our conditions in mushrooms. According to World Health Organisation is determined that the highest tolerable concentration for articles of food is 0, 5 mg/kg of mercury. In mushrooms was found after recalculation as a top limit 0, 57 mg/kg of mercury. So, this result is overlimited...|$|R
