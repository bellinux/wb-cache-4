5|$|Manchester United won {{the match}} 6–5 on penalties, after a 1–1 draw {{following}} extra time. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Manchester United in the 26th minute with a header from a cross by Wes Brown, but Frank Lampard equalised shortly before half-time. The second half {{and most of}} extra time passed without incident until Chelsea's Didier Drogba was sent off for slapping Nemanja Vidić four minutes from the end. In the penalty shoot-out, Ronaldo missed Manchester United's third kick, giving John Terry the {{chance to win the}} game for Chelsea, only for him to <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> hit the post. Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's effort from Chelsea's seventh kick to give Manchester United their third European Cup title.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slips</b> <b>and</b> falls are {{frequent}} incidents that occur everywhere either in an office, a school, a factory, a public building or a warehouse, inside and outside. This {{research focuses on}} <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls incident at workplace only because, workplace {{is an area that}} employees are not protected from such hazards. There are several factors that induce <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> fall incidents especially among workers. Although this incident seldom occur but the effect of this accident surely cause various kind problem either to victim or employer. The effects of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls not only cause a small or simple injury, instead it might result in serious injuries such as permanent injury and also result in fatalities. Besides the injuries, the victim also have to support the medical cost {{and at the same time}} the victim will loose of their jobs or salary result of the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls incident. Although victim may get their compensation claims from that accident, it would commensurate for victim or victim’s family. Because of such reason, this project will identify the main cause of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls incident among workers at workplace.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the frequent <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls in older adults of myasthenic lower extremities, a method was proposed that could analyze {{the process of}} <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls with the modified peak of required coefficient of friction(RCOF) and the amplitude of the body center of mass(COM). This method, based on the lower extremities dynamic model by Kane's equations, {{can be used to}} rapidly detect parameters in each gait cycle, and analyze every instantaneous balance status during walking. According to the results, the critical point thresholds of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls have been judged and verified and the theoretical groundwork for <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls’ gaits in older adults of myasthenic lower extremities has been established. By comparing the experimental data between no myasthenia and myasthenic older people, myasthenic older people's gaits became more and more unstable because of the weak neuromuscular control. For it, <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls more easily occur on myasthenia older people. The experimental data show that the method can well and effectively describe the process of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls...|$|R

Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege. Ruricius gave Constantine the <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought encounter that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed. Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by Aquileia, Mutina (Modena), and Ravenna. The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.|$|E

5|$|In Soul Reaver 2, it is {{established}} that, in Nosgoth, fatalism is an actuality—history is immutable, and all individuals {{are subject to}} predestination. Raziel, due to his paradoxical destiny, is the only exception to this rule—his presence enables temporal paradoxes to be triggered, altering history for better or worse. Kain relies on Raziel's free will {{in a bid to}} outsmart Moebius and resolve the dilemma he faced in Blood Omen, ultimately hoping to enable both the restored Pillars and the vampire race to co-exist in the future. Soul Reaver 2 opens as Raziel emerges from the time <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> is greeted by Moebius, having arrived in an era 30 years prior to the events of Blood Omen. Two further time periods, 100 years after and 500 years before Blood Omen respectively, are also explored as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the explanation by the women {{that they had been}} caught up in what is now called a time <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou. At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant-garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{managerial}} change from Burley to Freedman, the club announced plans to relocate the club back {{to the site of the}} Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, built on the club's original home, redeveloping it into a 25,000-seater, purpose-built football stadium. The following season started well, with a League Cup run that saw Palace beat Crawley Town, Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and by late October the club were third in the league. A League Cup victory over Southampton set up a quarter final tie away at Manchester United. However league form began to <b>slip</b> <b>and</b> Palace went six games without scoring immediately prior to the match at Old Trafford. Entering the tie as the underdogs, a 35-yard free-kick from Darren Ambrose and an extra time header from Glenn Murray saw Palace win at Old Trafford for the first time in 22 years. The club then announced potential plans to update the image of the club through a new badge. On the pitch, league form remained patchy, and the semi-final of the League Cup ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Cardiff. Palace finished the season in seventeenth place, an improvement on the previous season.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: Physical {{activity}} {{has been shown}} to be beneficial at improving health in some medical conditions and in preventing injury. Epidemiologic studies suggest that physical activity is one factor associated with a decreased risk for <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls in the older ($ 65 years) adult population. While the risk of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls is generally lower in younger than in older adults; little is known of the relative contribution of physical activity in preventing <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls in younger adults. We examined whether engagement in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) was protective of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls among a younger/middle-aged (# 50 years old) working population. Methods: 475 workers from 36 limited-service restaurants in six states in the U. S. were recruited to participate in a prospective cohort study of workplace slipping.

5|$|On October 10, 1848 the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad—Chicago's first railroad—began {{operating}} out of a depot {{on the west side}} of the Chicago River, near the corner of Canal and Kinzie Streets. Though the City of Chicago had authorized the railroad to construct a bridge across the north branch of the river as early as July 17, 1848, it was not until 1851 that the railroad began to purchase the land needed to build the Wells Street Station to the east of the river. In order to access the new station a floating pontoon bridge designed by Jenks D. Perkins was built across the north branch at roughly the same location as the earlier pedestrian bridge. This bridge—the first railroad bridge in Chicago—was completed in 1852, allowing trains to access the railroad's new Wells Street Station and subsequently industry on the north bank of the Chicago River as far as the Ogden <b>Slip</b> <b>and</b> Navy Pier.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slips</b> <b>and</b> falls are a {{major cause}} of serious injury, {{disability}} and death at work. This research focus on <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls events due to contamination factors on different ramp angles among workers because employees are exposed to such danger at the workplace. The goals of this study were to identify; the main factors that cause <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls on inclined surfaces, the effects of contaminants on gait, and walking speed downhill before the slips occur. Three different contaminants variaty in viscosity (water, suds and oil), three ramp angels (3 ?, 7 ? and 14 ?) and two shoe types (Saftey boot and Sneaker) were used during the trials. In addition, eight healthy male subjects (22 - 28 years) were asked to walk as naturally as possible throught testing. This project produced an outcome of the slip distance based on the interaction of the factors that causes the incident of <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls. As a resualt, slope and contaminant factors are known as the main elements that increase the risk of sliping and falling on ramps. Furthermore, the walking speed increase while the ramp angle will rise. Based on the result, suggestion and guideline can be produce to overcome the <b>slips</b> <b>and</b> falls instance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slipping</b> <b>and</b> {{tripping}} {{contribute to}} {{a large number of}} falls and fall-related injuries. While the vestibular system is known to contribute to balance and fall prevention, it is unclear whether it contributes to detecting slip or trip onset. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of <b>slipping</b> <b>and</b> tripping on head acceleration during walking. This information would help determine whether individuals with vestibular dysfunction are likely to be at a greater risk of falls due to <b>slipping</b> or tripping, <b>and</b> would inform the potential development of assistive devices providing augmented sensory feedback for vestibular dysfunction. Twelve young men were exposed to an unexpected slip or trip. Head acceleration was measured and transformed to an approximate location of the vestibular system. Peak linear acceleration in anterior, posterior, rightward, leftward, superior, and inferior directions were compared between <b>slipping,</b> tripping, <b>and</b> walking. Compared to walking, peak accelerations were up to 4. 68 m/s 2 higher after <b>slipping,</b> <b>and</b> up to 10. 64 m/s 2 higher after tripping. Head acceleration first deviated from walking 100 - 150 ms after <b>slip</b> onset <b>and</b> 0 - 50 ms after trip onset. The temporal characteristics of head acceleration support a possible contribution of the vestibular system to detecting trip onset, but not slip onset. Head acceleration after <b>slipping</b> <b>and</b> tripping also appeared to be sufficiently large to contribute to the balance recovery response...|$|R
