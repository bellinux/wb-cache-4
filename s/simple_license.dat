50|$|BSD {{licenses}} are {{a family}} of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the use and redistribution of covered software. This {{is in contrast to}} copyleft licenses, which have reciprocity share-alike requirements. The original BSD license was used for its namesake, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix-like operating system. The original version has since been revised and its descendants are more properly termed modified BSD licenses. BSD is both a license and a class of license (generally referred to as BSD-like). The modified BSD license (in wide use today) is very similar to the license originally used for the BSD version of Unix. The BSD license is a <b>simple</b> <b>license</b> that merely requires that all code licensed under the BSD license be licensed under the BSD license if redistributed in source code format. BSD (unlike some other licenses) does not require that source code be distributed at all.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the Family Radio Service was {{authorized}} starting in 1996. It uses half-watt hand-held FM UHF radios with 14 fixed channels. Many radios {{sold in the}} United States are advertised as having 22 channels (instead of 14) and claim extremely long range capability. These radios are actually dual-mode radios with both FRS and 8 GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) exclusive frequencies programmed in them. Use of GMRS requires a <b>simple</b> <b>license,</b> although many users never acquire the license. GMRS radios can transmit up to 5 watts of power. FRS channels 1 through 7 are shared with GMRS and therefore higher power {{can be used on}} channels 1-7, providing greater communication range compared to the 500 mW FRS power limit. Channels 8-14 are FRS only and even combination FRS/GMRS radios may legally only transmit up to 0.5 watts on channels 8-14. The eight GMRS frequencies are often programmed in these radios as channels 15-22, with up to 5 watts of power. Some transceivers feature switchable high/low power output on channels 1-7 and 15-22. Operating GMRS equipment without a license and/or using GMRS power levels on FRS frequencies is illegal and {{is often referred to as}} [...] "bubble-pack piracy" [...] due to the plastic bubble packs that dual-service FRS/GMRS radios are often packaged and sold in. Due to lax enforcement of these rules, the vast majority of GMRS and high power FRS users are unlicensed. GMRS users have the option of setting up repeater systems on the eight GMRS-only frequencies. however the majority of 22-channel FRS/GMRS radios do not support repeater capability. All channels must be shared by all users. All users must cooperate in the sharing of channels. Repeaters are not permitted on FRS frequencies (this includes channels 1-7). 462.675 MHz is the recommended GMRS calling/emergency/motorist assistance channel. Channel 1 (462.5625 MHz) is also often used as an unofficial calling channel.|$|E
40|$|The KOPEK Payment System {{supports}} {{payment of}} online content or services {{as well as}} single sign in. Setting up the KOPEK Payment System is easy, the system consist of the KOPEK Payment Server {{as well as an}} end user client. The server is installed so that it will be exposed to the desired customers, usually directly on the Internet. It can be installed in front an existing web server that handles more advanced content or services than the KOPEK Payment Server itself supports. Access to the content or the service will then be controlled by the rules configured in the KOPEK Payment Server. The KOPEK client application will be used from any end user who will access that content in order to identify the end user and make sure the user has met the requirements defined in the KOPEK Payment Server. <b>Simple</b> <b>license</b> control over personal licenses can be achieved by creating a web page and make the KOPEK Payment Server control access to that web page. An application can then try to access that web page and will only proceed if the web page can be read. If the web page cannot be read, the end user hasn 9 ̆ 2 t met the requirements defined in the KOPEK Payment Server and hence the end user doesn 9 ̆ 2 t have a valid license. This results in support for quite advanced copy protection when using the KOPEK Payment System. The copy protection can be further enhanced by also using the KOPEK Payment Systems support for centralized electronic identification systems, like the Norwegian BankID or BuyPass. In the market there exists some solutions that have specialized in license control and copy protection. These solutions seem to cover most of the more advanced licensing models, but none of these solutions can supply both a complete solution for license control and copy protection as well as a solution for electronic distribution of the licenses. There would probably be a market for such complete solutions and since the KOPEK Payment System already support both electronic distribution of licenses and can be used for <b>simple</b> <b>license</b> control an expansion of the KOPEK Payment System to also support more advanced license control. However, the KOPEK Payment System has some obvious weaknesses when it comes to dependence on an Internet connection and that both the company responsible for the KOPEK Payment System central servers as well as the company responsible for the KOPEK Payment Server used for license control can continue to keep the servers operative...|$|E

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the Degree of Master of Business Admnistration in Information TechnologyOpen source software (OSS) is gradually trying to dominate the software world. Lower hardware and software costs, <b>simple</b> <b>license</b> management, reduced de pendance on software vendors and ease of customization {{are some of the}} main reasons for OSS to be more popular in the software world (Computer Economics 2005). Most of the countries are now promoting OSS since the usage of pirated software is being widely discouraged. Thus, the need for OSS is rapidly increasing in the software market. As a result, a lot of investors are eying up on companies that develop OSS. Investing on a company is known to be a risk. It is a known fact that anyone who is planning to invest on a company would consider many aspects before doing so. OSS companies are mostly funded by venture capitalists and when investing on such companies, one should make sure that they do not end up in a loss. Therefore, before investing on such companies, a background study should be done. The objective of this research study is to find out what factors are dominating the operation of OSS companies and to find out whether there are any relationships between the identified factors and the revenue generated by these companies. The analysis was done with regard to three main factors; business models followed by the companies, revenue models adopted and type of applications developed by these companies. For the analysis, nearly ninety five OSS companies were studied. By analyzing data of these OSS companies, it was evident that some of the factors were having an impact on the revenue generated while some did not. Namely; business models, revenue models and type of licenses followed did not affect the revenue generation of the companies, while multiple applications being developed had an influence on the revenue generated. Then by analyzing the data in different ways, a model was created for investors to base their decisions when planning to invest on OSS companies. This thesis provides the key recommendation that an investor should not consider only on business models, revenue models and applications developed when planning to invest on OSS developing companies but should base investment decisions also on other important influencing factors which were highlighted in this research...|$|E

In 1995, the Fujimori government passed a land law (Law 26505) that granted mining corporations the right to use land for their operations in exchange for monetary compensation to the landowners. In addition, the Fujimori administration installed a new tax regime that exempted mining corporations from taxation and paying royalties until they regained their initial investments. Fujimori also spearheaded other reforms that removed restrictions on profit/capital remittances, eliminated performance requirements for foreign investments, reduced tariffs on imports and removed tariffs on exports, established <b>simpler</b> <b>licensing</b> procedures, modified policies regarding indigenous land tenure, lowered taxes, liberalized capital market, and privatized state firms and financial institutions.

40|$|A {{communications}} system {{operating in the}} 2. 4 GHz ISM unlicensed band was developed for GeneSat- 1, an innovative technology demonstration mission intended to validate the use of research quality instrumentation for in situ biological research and processing. As a key underlying mission-enabling technology, and responding to a lowcost, quick turn-around philosophy, this {{communications system}} is based on commercial-of-the-shelf components not originally intended for space flight. The system utilizes a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique widely used in wireless phones, Internet hubs and other devices. This approach provided exceptional benefits relevant to small satellite missions: low cost, highly integrated hardware resulting in small volume, ready commercial availability, plug and play integration, and <b>simple</b> <b>licensing</b> requirements. As a comparison with typical amateur band systems widely used in spacecraft of this class, besides avoiding the restrictions {{on the nature of}} the mission, it has the potential for higher throughput and includes security features such as addressing and encryption. Challenges in using this component included the accommodation of Doppler frequency shift, coordinating propagation delays with a time-division multiplexing architecture, and establishing suitable interface requirements for the Earth communication station.

40|$|Legal context The Creative Commons (CC) {{movement}} {{operates as}} an important counterpoint to the expansionist copyright regime in the digital environment relating to recorded music by seeking to create a free and <b>simple</b> <b>licensing</b> mechanism that operates to construct a pool of content that creators can use without charge. It creates an alternative model for creators to use in order to authorise the use/reuse of their work that circumvents the traditional market for copyright content as well as fostering its own CC-orientated intermediary outlets. CC depends on copyright’s underlying proprietary system. However, CC arguably constrains creators {{in terms of the}} content they can use to produce new works and does nothing to necessarily overcome the complexities posed by copyright infringement should a licence be breached. Nonetheless, {{there are a number of}} intermediaries that provide CC-licenced content which suggests that the movement has traction. Following an analysis of the CC-orientated intermediaries in comparison with those engendered by copyright, it may be argued that the CC licensing system makes it difficult to transition from an amateur to a professional context. Nonetheless, its symbolic value remains important. This piece will address the intermediary market structure for CC works as well as the potential difficulties commercial exploitation in order to evaluate whether or not it can be seen as a beneficial system for content creation and dissemination.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimality-theoretic comparison of three round vowel {{patterns in the}} Altaic family. At the core is an analysis of bisyllabic trigger round harmony, a pattern uncovered in recent investigation of Classical Manchu and Oroqen (Tungusic; Zhang 1996). In these languages round spreading takes place only when the first two syllables of a word are round. This study isolates two separate properties of round vowel distribution in bisyllabic trigger patterns: round licensing ([+round] must {{be linked to the}} initial syllable) and round spreading. Bisyllabic triggers are derived through a constraint interaction explored here, called ÔParasitic Constraint SatisfactionÕ, in which a given constraint loses to satisfaction of a dominating constraint except when violation of that dominating constraint is independently induced by a third higherranked constraint. In the case of bisyllabic trigger round harmony, this kind of interaction is achieved by ranking licensing and spreading separately with respect to a tautosyllabicity constraint on features. More detailed examination of the spreading and licensing requirements finds that they can be analyzed solely in terms of markedness and faith constraints. Positional identity (Beckman 1997) and markedness of feature cooccurrences play a critical role, characterizing the special status of the initial syllable and realizing height stratification of rounding restrictions.

50|$|The B-Bender {{device was}} invented in 1967 by drummer and {{machinist}} Gene Parsons and guitarist Clarence White to fit White's Fender Telecaster. The original Parsons/White Stringbender was licensed to Leo Fender in 1968, but he never put it into production. Parsons continued to build and install the device himself, and sold several hundred to the Japanese instrument company Tokai Gakki for installation in their guitars. In the late 1980s, Parsons and business partner Meridian Green approached Fender again and met with luthier Fred Stuart at the new California Fender Custom Shop. Stuart and the Custom Shop eventually produced about 200 Clarence White model Telecasters equipped with the Parsons/White Stringbender, plus Scruggs tuners on both E strings. Based on this success, Fender decided to mass-produce a similar model. Parsons and Green redesigned the B-bender device for <b>simpler</b> installation and <b>licensed</b> it to Fender as the Parsons/Green B-Bender.

We find that there is a clear relationship between the type of benefit (financial reward, reputation, or positioning) that firms seek and the patent governance structures (buying or selling patents, <b>simple</b> or cross <b>licensing,</b> or pooling) they use. We also find a relationship between the obstacles (problems related to patent search, patent transparency, contract, enforcement, regulation or practice) firms experienced in the value creation processes and the patent governance structures they use.
