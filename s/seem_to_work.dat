25|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{faced in}} determining {{a theory of}} anaphora that properly encompasses bound variable pronouns is properly determining the definition of bound. As previously stated, a bound variable pronoun {{is said to be}} bound if it is c-commanded by its antecedent. In many cases, this definition makes correct predictions about the availability of bound variable interpretations. However, as in the example below, this requirement does not always <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans never <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1990s, Faldo {{remained}} a European Tour player while also visiting America regularly and playing events around the world, but in 1995 {{he decided to}} concentrate on playing on the U.S. PGA Tour, as his priority was to win further major championships (and three out of the four majors are played in the United States). At first this strategy didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> as he had a moderate 1995 season, but in April 1996 he won a famous victory at Augusta to collect his sixth and final major championship.|$|E
25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesn’t need awareness, but it does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E

25|$|Incompatible systems. A new API or {{communications}} protocol may <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> when two systems use different versions, but errors may occur when a function or feature implemented in one version is changed or missing in another. In production systems which must run continually, {{shutting down the}} entire system for a major update may not be possible, {{such as in the}} telecommunication industry or the internet. In this case, smaller segments of a large system are upgraded individually, to minimize disruption to a large network. However, some sections could be overlooked and not upgraded, and cause compatibility errors which may be difficult to find and repair.|$|E
25|$|In {{mainstream}} economic theory, a {{free market}} rations an increasingly scarce commodity by increasing its price. A higher price should stimulate producers to produce more, and consumers to consume less, while possibly shifting to substitutes. The first three mitigation strategies in the above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum {{as well as the}} availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising prices) would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright shortages, attempts at price control may require some sort of rationing scheme.|$|E
25|$|Mexico was {{the first}} time that Prost would {{publicly}} complain that his Honda V10 did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as well as Senna's, pointing out that early in the race he was clearly faster than Senna through the Peraltada curve heading onto the long front straight, but that even with a tow from Senna he was not able to make any ground on him. Then later in the race when Senna was coming up to lap Prost (who had much fresher tyres), the Brazilian was easily able to catch and pass him on the straight despite being slower through the final turn (it was later revealed that Prost ran less wing than Senna which should have theoretically given him better straight line speed).|$|E

I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> it out without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting {{an awful lot of}} film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Cooper was a {{conservative}} Republican like his father, and voted for Calvin Coolidge in 1924, Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932, and campaigned for Wendell Willkie in 1940. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting [...] "foreign" [...] ideas. In a radio address that {{he paid for}} himself {{just prior to the}} election, Cooper said, [...] "I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't even <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> any too well where they come from ... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again." [...] He also attended a Republican rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that drew 93,000 Dewey supporters.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss {{wrote in}} the script for the Daleks' {{redesign}} to be [...] "big buggers...bigger than we've seen them before". The eyestalk {{was designed to be}} level with Smith's eyeline. Moffat and Gatiss wanted the new Daleks to be very colourful, similar to the Daleks of films from the 60s. Gatiss originally wanted there to be a green Dalek, but he decided that green [...] "just doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> somehow". Nick Briggs, who voiced the Daleks, planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice. Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate [...] "Spitfires in space". A replica of a World War II Spitfire was used in front of a greenscreen to shoot the live action parts of the scene and the image of the Spitfire, {{while the rest of the}} scene was computer-generated. The sequence contained the line [...] "Broadsword to Danny Boy", a reference to a similar line in the film Where Eagles Dare. Gatiss provided the voice of the Spitfire pilot himself, doing one version clean and another with his hand over his mouth. In an interview in April 2010, Gatiss described how the cameo came about: ...|$|E

500|$|However, Prost had {{the firm}} belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna {{as the future}} of the team. Prost {{recalled}} that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him. Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Although Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments, he received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his [...] teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as well as was once normal. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, wondering if there was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use.|$|E
500|$|Describing Vala's {{attitude}} towards bonding with other characters as [...] "in {{a strange way}} quite level-headed" [...] and [...] "quite honest", Black interpreted Vala's behavior {{as a reaction to}} growing attached to people where the relationships never <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out. Cooper explained that by Vala's contacting of Stargate Command about the imminent threat at the end of season 9, she [...] "has reached a point of honesty with [...] characters and possibly herself on a level that she's never had before." [...] From the beginning of season 10, Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping requested a similarly positive camaraderie between their characters as male characters have. Tapping noted Carter's respect for Vala despite them being at opposite ends in their actions; Tapping also thought Carter finds Vala amusing rather than annoying. A scene in [...] "Morpheus" [...] that was intended to establish this relationship was cut for time, and until the late season 10 episode [...] "Family Ties" [...] would accommodate this with a shopping scene, the actresses acknowledged their connection through looks and subtle nuances. By joining SG-1, Vala also shared a spot with stoic warrior Teal'c as the only alien members of the team, and actor Christopher Judge (Teal'c) explained that his character's amusement with Vala contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. The relationship between Vala and SG-1 team leader Colonel Cameron Mitchell (played by Ben Browder) was rarely emphasized in the series since Black and Browder were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series Farscape.|$|E
500|$|Curiosity {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Bill Lamb of About.com began his review stating {{that it is}} always interesting to have new artists making music both familiar and fresh. He went to describe the six [...] "electronic pop songs strong, almost too short to be satisfying but immensely repeatable." [...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional bogging down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which harks back to the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is your choice to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in front of your bedroom mirror. Overall a great EP. I can’t wait to put the top down and blast her tunes all summer." [...] Jen Appel of idobi Radio commented that, overall, Curiosity is the kind of extended play that brings attention from the teenage public due to its mainstream songs, and added, [...] "if you are looking for fun, lovable songs to make you smile, this is your go-to mix." [...] Appel only criticized the lyrical content, noting that it is [...] "very childish but <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the music nonetheless." ...|$|E

500|$|Bosh has {{traditionally}} played the power forward position, including {{during his first}} season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6ft 11in (2.11m) and 235pounds (107kg), Bosh possesses excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size. He is particularly noted {{for his ability to}} drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he is also proficient—but he is also known for his well-developed jump shot. Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: [...] "We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth." [...] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions. He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left. It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his [...] "arrival" [...] to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime. When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot [...]343 from the three point arc for the season; he improved to [...]400 the following season. Despite his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.|$|E
