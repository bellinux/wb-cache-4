40|$|We {{present some}} {{detail of the}} {{waveguide}} probe and SIS mixer chip designs for a low-noise 180 - 300 GHz double- sideband receiver with an instantaneous RF bandwidth of 24 GHz. The receiver's single SIS junction is excited by a broadband, fixed-tuned waveguide probe on a silicon substrate. The IF output is coupled to a 6 - 18 GHz MMIC low- noise preamplifier. Following further amplification, the output is processed by an array of 4 GHz, 128 -channel analog autocorrelation spectrometers (WASP 11). The <b>single-sideband</b> <b>receiver</b> noise temperature goal of 70 Kelvin will provide a prototype instrument capable of rapid line surveys and of relatively efficient carbon monoxide (CO) emission line searches of distant, dusty galaxies. The latter application's goal is to determine redshifts by measuring the frequencies of CO line emissions from the star-forming regions dominating the submillimeter brightness of these galaxies. Construction of the receiver has begun; lab testing should begin in the fall. Demonstration of the receiver on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) telescope should begin in spring 2003...|$|E
40|$|A {{monolithic}} microwave {{integrated circuit}} (MMIC) receiver {{can be used}} as a building block for next-generation radio astronomy instruments that are scalable to hundreds or thousands of pixels. W-band (75 - 110 GHz) low-noise receivers are needed for radio astronomy interferometers and spectrometers, and can be used in missile radar and security imagers. These receivers need to be designed to be mass-producible to increase the sensitivity of the instrument. This innovation is a prototyped <b>single-sideband</b> MMIC <b>receiver</b> that has all the receiver front-end functionality in one small and planar module. The planar module is easy to assemble in volume and does not require tuning of individual receivers. This makes this design low-cost in large volumes...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} an integrated sideband-separating SIS mixer at 100 GHz based on waveguide split block. The measured <b>single-sideband</b> (SSB) <b>receiver</b> noise temperatures with L-band IF (fc = 1. 5 GHz) {{are less than}} 60 K in the LO frequency range of 90 – 115 GHz, and min-imum value of around 35 K is achieved at 100 GHz. The image rejection ratios are more than 11 dB in the frequency range of 90 – 110 GHz. We have installed the sideband-separating SIS mixer into an atmospheric ozone measuring system at Osaka Prefecture University and successfully ob-served an ozone spectrum at 110 GHz in SSB mode. This experimental result indicates that the sideband-separating SIS mixer is very useful for astronomical observation as well as atmospheric observation...|$|R
40|$|Coherent, black-body-referenced {{measurements}} of submillimeter-wave sideband generator (SBG) output power are reported here. This SBG utilizes a submillimeter-wave laser, microwave synthesizer, and high frequency Schottky diode to produce tunable radiation. An output power 10. 5 RW at a drive frequency of 1. 6 THz has been obtained, and SBG radiation was efficiently {{separated from the}} laser driver with Si etalons. The power measurements were made using a dual CO 2 -Submillimeter-wave laser system and two Schottky diodes, one as the sideband generator and one as the coherent receiver. The SBG efficiency of four different models of University of Virginia (UVa) diodes were studied and the output mode of the sideband (without the unshifted laser present) was also easured.

40|$|Millimeter and {{submillimeter}} heterodyne receivers using state-of-the-art SIS detectors {{are capable}} of extremely large instantaneous bandwidths with noise temperatures within a few Kelvin of the quantum limit. We present the design for a broadband, sensitive, heterodyne spectrometer under development for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The 180 - 300 GHz double-sideband design uses a single SIS device excited by a full bandwidth, fixed-tuned waveguide probe on a silicon substrate. The IF output frequency (limited by the MMIC low noise IF preamplifier) is 6 - 18 GHz, providing an instantaneous RF bandwidth of 24 GHz (double-sideband). The SIS mixer conversion loss should {{be no more than}} 1 - 2 dB with mixer noise temperatures across the band within 10 K of the quantum limit. The <b>single-sideband</b> <b>receiver</b> noise temperature goal is 70 K. The wide instantaneous bandwidth and low noise will result in an instrument capable of a variety of important astrophysical observations beyond the capabilities of current instruments.

40|$|A {{spectral}} {{survey of}} Orion-KL {{has been carried}} out in the 2 mm atmospheric window in the frequency range 149. 6 - 159. 6 GHz, using the FCRAO 14 m telescope. Typical sensitivities achieved were T(sub A sup *) approximately 0. 03 - 0. 1 K, peak-to-peak. Over 180 spectral lines were detected, including approximately 45 unidentified features. The spectra were measured with a <b>single-sideband</b> <b>receiver</b> and, even at levels of T(sub A sup *) approximately 30 mK, are far from being confusion-limited. Fifteen known species were conclusively identified in Orion in this spectral region, with the largest numbers of lines arising from methyl formate, ethyl cyanide, methanol, and dimethyl ether. These species have beam-averaged column densities of N(sub tot) approximately 0. 5 - 8 x 10 (exp 15) /sq cm. Several other species have been tentatively observed, including acetaldehyde, C 2 S, and possibly EtOH. The large organic species, however, appear to arise from different regions. For example, CH 3 CCH and (CH 3) 2 O come primarily from the extended ridge, while EtCN and VyCN exclusively arise in the hot core. This survey clearly demonstrates that the 2 mm window is rich in spectral lines. It also suggests there is much chemical selectivity in the formation of large organic interstellar molecules...|$|E
40|$|We have {{upgraded}} the 60 -cm radio survey telescope {{located in}} Nobeyama, Japan. We {{developed a new}} waveguide-type sideband-separating SIS mixer for the telescope, which enables the simultaneous detection of distinct molecular emission lines both in {{the upper and lower}} sidebands. Over the RF frequency range of 205 – 240 GHz, the <b>single-sideband</b> <b>receiver</b> noise temperatures of the new mixer are 40 – 100 K for the 4. 0 – 8. 0 GHz IF frequency band. The image rejection ratios are greater than 10 dB over the same range. For the dual IF signals obtained by the receiver, we have developed two sets of acousto-optical spectrometers and a telescope control system. Using the new telescope system, we successfully detected the 12 CO (J = 2 − 1) and 13 CO (J = 2 − 1) emission lines simultaneously toward Orion KL in 2005 March. Using the waveguidetype sideband-separating SIS mixer for the 200 GHz band, we have initiated the first simultaneous 12 CO (J = 2 − 1) and 13 CO (J = 2 − 1) survey of the galactic plane as well as large-scale mapping observations of nearby molecular clouds.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn order to automatically tune a <b>single-sideband</b> (SSB) radio <b>receiver</b> to the carrier frequency of a voice-modulated, suppressed-carrier, single-sideband radio signal, {{the difference between}} the frequency of the suppressed carrier and the frequency of the local oscillator in the receiver must be determined. A circuit which generates a sinusoidal voltage of the same frequency as the tuning error is examined analytically and experimentally. The design of the circuit is based on the principle that vowel sounds in human speech are periodic. The inputs to the circuit are the audio output of the SSB receiver for which the tuning error is desired and the audio output of an envelope detector which amplitude demodulates the SSB radio signal. The envelope detector provides a reference signal which is a harmonic of the fundamental modulating frequency of the SSB radio signal. This reference signal and the SSB receiver audio are non-linear processed to generate the error voltage. Receiver tuning errors as small as 0. 1 Hertz were measured using this circuit.

40|$|We {{developed}} a waveguide-type dual-polarization sideband-separating SIS receiver {{system of the}} 100 -GHz band for the 45 -m radio telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, Japan. This receiver is composed of an ortho-mode transducer and two sideband-separating SIS mixers, which are both based on the waveguide technique.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a two-beam waveguide-type dual-polarization sideband-separating SIS receiver system in the 100 -GHz band for z-machine on the 45 -m radio telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. The receiver is intended for astronomical use in searching for highly redshifted spectral lines from galaxies of unknown redshift. This receiver has two beams, which have 45 ^" of beam separation and allow for observation with the switch in the on-on position. The receiver of each beam is composed of an ortho-mode transducer and two sideband-separating SIS mixers, which are both based on a waveguide technique, and the receiver has four intermediate frequency bands of 4. 0 [...] 8. 0 GHz. Over the radio frequency range of 80 [...] 116 GHz, the <b>single-sideband</b> <b>receiver</b> noise temperature is lower than about 50 K, and the image rejection ratios are greater than 10 dB {{in most of the}} same frequency range.
