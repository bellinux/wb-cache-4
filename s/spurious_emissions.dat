500|$|Absorption filters {{dissipate}} {{the energy}} in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. [...] This {{is in contrast}} to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. [...] Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. [...] This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. [...] An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> such as harmonics or spurious sidebands. [...] A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. [...] This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. [...] Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. [...] Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. [...] Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. [...] These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material. [...] Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.|$|E

50|$|A PLL {{includes}} a phase detector, filter and oscillator connected {{in a closed}} loop, so the oscillator frequency follows (equals) the input frequency. Although the average output frequency equals the input frequency, the oscillator's frequency fluctuates or vibrates about that average value. The closed loop operates to correct such frequency deviations; higher performance PLL reduces these fluctuations to lower values, however these deviations can never be stopped. See Control theory. Phase noise, <b>spurious</b> <b>emission,</b> and jitter are results of the above phenomena.|$|R
50|$|Intermodulation is also rarely {{desirable}} in radio, as {{it creates}} unwanted <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions,</b> {{often in the}} form of sidebands.

50|$|The {{harmonic}} {{output of}} a transmitter is best checked using an RF spectrum analyzer or by tuning a receiver {{to the various}} harmonics.

5000|$|Stability is {{required}} {{in at least two}} senses. The receiver must stay [...] "tuned" [...] to the incoming radio signal and must not [...] "drift" [...] with time or temperature. Additionally, the great magnitude of gain generated must be carefully controlled so that <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> are not produced within the receiver. These would lead to distortion of the recovered information, or, at worst, may radiate signals that interfere with other receivers.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, a {{spectral}} mask, {{also known}} as a channel mask or transmission mask, is a mathematically-defined set of lines applied to the levels of radio (or optical) transmissions. The spectral mask is generally intended to reduce adjacent-channel interference by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the necessary bandwidth. Attenuation of these <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> is usually done with a band-pass filter, tuned to allow through the correct center frequency of the carrier wave, as well as all necessary sidebands.|$|E
5000|$|Overmodulation is the {{condition}} that prevails in telecommunication when the instantaneous level of the modulating signal exceeds the value necessary to produce 100% modulation of the carrier.

Overmodulation results in <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> by the modulated carrier, and distortion of the recovered modulating signal. This means that the envelope of the output waveform is distorted.|$|E

50|$|Early in the {{development}} of radio technology it was recognized that the signals emitted by transmitters had to be 'pure'. Spark-gap transmitters were outlawed once better technology was available as they give an output which is very wide in terms of frequency. The term <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> refers to any signal which comes out of a transmitter other than the wanted signal. In modern equipment there are three main types of spurious emissions: harmonics, out of band mixer products which are not fully suppressed and leakage from the local oscillator and other systems within the transmitter.|$|E
50|$|The rusty bolt {{effect is}} radio {{interference}} due to interactions with dirty connections or corroded parts. It is more properly known as passive intermodulation, and {{can result from}} a variety of different causes such as ferromagnetic conduction metals, or nonlinear microwave absorbers and loads. Corroded materials on antennas, waveguides, or even structural elements, can act as one or more diodes. (Crystal sets, early radio receivers, used the semiconductor properties of natural galena to demodulate the radio signal, and copper oxide was used in power rectifiers.) This gives rise to undesired interference, including the generation of harmonics or intermodulation. Rusty objects that should not be in the signal-path, including antenna structures, can also reradiate radio signals with harmonics and other unwanted signals. As with all out-of-band noise, these <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> can interfere with receivers.|$|E
