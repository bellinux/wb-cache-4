While Heffer {{could work with}} Barbara Castle, she was moved in a reshuffle in 1972 and replaced by Reg Prentice who was already beginning the move {{across the political spectrum}} which would see him join the Conservative Party in 1977. Prentice's refusal to pledge support to five dockers imprisoned under the Industrial Relations Act appalled Heffer who considered resignation. When in February 1973 it became clear that Prentice had more leadership support, Heffer resigned (refusing an offer of another post).

We compare two possible formulations, one based on compliance and the other on the testing theory of De Nicola and Hennessy. We show that if the language of contracts is sufficiently expressive then the resulting <b>sub-contract</b> relations are incomparable. However if we put natural restrictions on the contract language then the <b>sub-contract</b> relations coincide, at least when applied to servers. But when formulated for clients they remain incomparable, for many reasonable contract languages. Finally we give one example of a contract language for which the client-based <b>sub-contract</b> relations coincide. ...|$|R

The research used satisfaction and benefit analysis to produce internal strengths and weal(nesses of <b>sub-contract</b> system, while using external analysis to produce opportunity and threat.

The result showed that the problems in <b>sub-contract</b> system implementation at PT FAK were sub-conkactor's low bargaining position especially in price determination, ineffective communication and the company has not managed the <b>sub-contract</b> system in optimal level.

Sub-contractors satisfy with the companies payment and production period, but has not satisfy in price determining process, raw material assistance and production quality level received by the company. The sub-contractors get significant benefit in increasing product's quality level and insignificant benefit in productivity, pricing level and income increased and business risk decreased. Alternative strategies for <b>sub-contract</b> system were to include the sub-contractor in product development process, development of <b>sub-contract</b> program, sub-contractor performance improvement, development of subcontract system and procedures and production efficiency. ...|$|R
