50|$|In late 1970, MCI Communications {{created a}} {{subsidiary}} company named MCI Satellite, Inc. The {{idea was that}} satellites could provide 'long distance' service from anywhere to anywhere without having to build {{thousands of miles of}} terrestrial network facilities. In early 1971, MCI and Lockheed Missiles and Space Company created a joint venture named MCI Lockheed Satellite Corp. which was the first company to request FCC authorization as a <b>Specialized</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Carrier</b> using satellite based communications. A year later, MCI and Lockheed sought an additional source of funding and Comsat Corp. entered the venture which was renamed CML Satellite Corp. In need of cash, MCI sold its share of the venture to IBM Corporation in 1974 (Lockheed also subsequently sold its share to IBM). IBM and Comsat brought in Aetna Insurance Company as a third partner and renamed the company Satellite Business Systems (SBS).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems facing the telecommunications industry {{is the extent to which}} competition will be introduced into what has been, for the most part, a regulated industry. In the forefront of the competitive environment has been the telephone interconnection industry. The genesis of this industry was the Carterfone decision by the Federal Communications Commission which allowed competition in the interconnection field. It is the thesis of this project that the most significant factor affecting the telephone interconnection industry today is the continued impact of competition on the industry. To insure that the project stayed within manageable limits the authors chose to examine the issues dealing with that part of the interconnect industry providing for the connection of answering devices, acoustic couplers, personal custom telephones, intercom systems, key business systems, or private branch exchanges (PBX) to the telephone system. Issues surrounding the competitive interconnect services of microwave and satellite links provided by the specialized common carriers are beyond the scope of this project. The <b>specialized</b> <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> area is a critical issue on its own right and should be the subject of investigation by future participants in the Telecommunications Program. An analysis of present, past and potential interconnect manufacturers is provided to show how the lure and promise of competition has affected the industry. Because there are hundreds of companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of interconnect devices, only a limited cross section has been chosen for this project...|$|E

5000|$|Despite a 1967 {{recommendation}} that MCI's application be approved, final authorization for MCI to begin operations was delayed until after H. Rex Lee became an FCC Commissioner in October 1968. Following Lee's joining of the commission, MCI {{began a series}} of submissions including a proposal for a low-cost educational television network designed to show MCI as being more flexible to public needs than AT&T. [...] While MCI was performing this lobbying, the President's Task Force on Communication Policy issued a report recommending that <b>specialized</b> <b>common</b> <b>carriers</b> be allowed free access into the private line business.|$|R

50|$|In {{common law}} countries, <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> {{is a legal}} {{classification}} for a person or company which transports goods and is legally prohibited from discriminating or refusing service based on the customer or nature of the goods. The <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> framework {{is often used to}} classify public utilities, such as electricity or water, and public transport. In the United States, there has been intense debate between some advocates of net neutrality, who believe Internet providers should be legally designated <b>common</b> <b>carriers,</b> and some Internet service providers, who believe the <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> designation would be a heavy regulatory burden.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> is {{distinguished}} from a contract carrier (also called a public carrier in UK English), {{which is a}} carrier that transports goods for only {{a certain number of}} clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a private <b>carrier.</b> A <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> holds itself out to provide service to the general public without discrimination (to {{meet the needs of the}} regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the [...] "public convenience and necessity." [...] A <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is [...] "fit, willing, and able" [...] to provide those services for which it is granted authority. <b>Common</b> <b>carriers</b> typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers (i.e., canal operating companies, trucking companies), and other freight companies generally operate as <b>common</b> <b>carriers.</b> Under US law, an ocean freight forwarder cannot act as a <b>common</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|R
50|$|Private {{carriers}} may {{refuse to}} sell their services at their own discretion, whereas <b>common</b> <b>carriers</b> must treat all customers equally.

2500|$|The court vacated {{two parts}} of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, {{determining}} that the FCC did not have the authority to impose these orders without classifying network providers as <b>common</b> <b>carriers.</b> Since the FCC had previously classified broadband providers as [...] "information services" [...] and not [...] "telecommunications services," [...] they could not be regulated as <b>common</b> <b>carriers</b> under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Therefore, the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 regulations, which could only be applied to <b>common</b> <b>carriers,</b> could not be applied to broadband providers. The court upheld the transparency order of the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, which it found was not contingent upon network operators being classified as <b>common</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
