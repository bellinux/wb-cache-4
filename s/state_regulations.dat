5|$|For {{southern}} sea otters to {{be considered}} for removal from threatened species listing, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that the population should exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. In response to recovery efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005–2014 at just under 3,000. There was some contraction from the northern (now Pigeon Point) and southern limits of the sea otter's range during the end of this period, circumstantially related to an increase in lethal shark bites, raising concerns that the population had reached a plateau. However, the population increased markedly from 2015–2016, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California sea otter survey 3-year average reaching 3,272 in 2016, the first time it exceeded the threshold for delisting from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Assuming the population maintains positive trends, ESA delisting is inevitable, although southern sea otters would still be fully protected by <b>state</b> <b>regulations</b> and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which sets a higher threshold for protection, subjectively at about 8,400 individuals.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} is {{theoretical}} substantiation {{of the process of}} formation of the mechanism of <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of the fuel and energy complex (FEC) of a Ukrainian region.

It develops the mechanism of <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of FEC, realisation of which would ensure stable, effective and system functioning of fuel and energy processes, which would be an effective support for economy of the country and its development. It analyses main principles, functions, forms, methods and means of <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of FEC.

3000|$|... 16 Aghion, Algan and Cahuc (2011) {{find that}} <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of labor {{markets and the}} quality of labor {{relations}} are negatively correlated. They argue that <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> can reduce the possibility for workers to experiment negotiation and learn about the potentially cooperative nature of labor relations. In turn, distrustful labor relations can lead to low union density and high demand for <b>state</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|R
30|$|On {{the latter}} {{question}} concerning <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> {{and the quality}} of industrial relations, Aghion et al. (2009) exploit the negative association between <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of minimum wages {{and the quality of}} industrial relations (the latter again based on the World Competitiveness Report data). The authors contend that this relation will reflect different ways of regulating labor markets—either through the state or through civil society (i.e., unionism), depending on the degree of cooperation in the economy. On the authors’ model, distrustful labor relations lead to low unionization and a high demand for <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of wages. Once in place, strong <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> crowds out the possibility for workers to engage in negotiation and learn about the potentially cooperative nature of labor relations. As a result, there can be multiple equilibria, with a bad equilibrium characterized by poor, uncooperative industrial relations and extensive <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> of the minimum wage and a good equilibrium in which labor relations are cooperative as indexed by high union density and low <b>state</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|R
5|$|Unusually for a river, the Saw Mill's waters have {{consistently}} had a slightly alkaline pH, suggesting {{it has not}} been as affected by acid rain as other Hudson tributaries. In 1951, a state Department of Health survey reported pH between 7.25 and 9.1. Four decades later, another study found pH readings rising steadily from 7.59 in Chappaqua to 8.24 in Yonkers. Similarly, a 2007 Manhattan College study done for the New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7.36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7.81 near Torre Road in Yonkers, with a drop to 7.67 at the tunnel, for a total median for the river of 7.59.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{environmental}} management systems (EMS) and aims to enhance {{our understanding of the}} relationship between environmental <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> and self-regulation. Unlike previous studies that treat <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> as uni-dimensional and focus on externally certified forms of environmental self-regulation, this article takes a more nuanced approach. It looks at how direct and indirect <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> and its stringency influence both non-certified in-house and externally certified adoption of EMS. Methodologically, the study differentiates from previous research by acknowledging the interconnected nature of in-house and external certification decisions, viewing these decisions as sequential. Based on a survey of 2076 UK firms, findings show that effective environmental protection entails collaboration between environmental <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> and in-house adoption of EMS. Results also reveal that externally certified EMS substitute for <b>state</b> environmental <b>regulation,</b> filling the void that results from weakening <b>state</b> <b>regulation</b> in the context of neoliberalism...|$|R
