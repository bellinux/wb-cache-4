5|$|B. bufo {{is part of}} {{a species}} complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A <b>serological</b> <b>investigation</b> into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{abnormalities}} affecting the deltoid are tears, fatty atrophy, and enthesopathy. Deltoid muscle tears are unusual and frequently related to traumatic shoulder dislocation or massive rotator cuff tears. Muscle atrophy {{is the result}} of various causes, including aging, disuse, denervation, muscular dystrophy, cachexia and iatrogenic injury. Deltoideal humeral enthesopathy is an exceedingly rare condition related to mechanical stress. Conversely, deltoideal acromial enthesopathy is likely a hallmark of seronegative spondylarthropathies and its detection should probably be followed by pertinent clinical and <b>serological</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Sandhi shoola {{refers to}} the joints pain where there is pain with or without {{inflammation}} and {{can be caused by}} injury or a number of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Ayurveda system of medicine believes this as Sandhi shoola condition in which there is difficulty in walking and running and based on the physical examination, it is categorized into major types i. e. Aamvata (AV), Sandhivata (SV) and Vatarakta (VR). However, biochemical and <b>serological</b> <b>investigations</b> for Sandhi shoola were not cited in ancient Ayurveda literature. A retrospective study in which biochemical and <b>serological</b> <b>investigations</b> such as uric acid (UA), Ca 2 + and rheumatoid arthritis factor (RAF), C-reactive protein (CRP), antistreptolysin-O (ASO) were carried out respectively in 50 Sandhi shoola patients of Ayurveda hospital in Kolkata. The individual information about clinical symptoms and diagnosis by the hospital professionals were recorded. UA and Ca 2 + content in serum was determined by enzymatic and Cresolphthalein complexone kit methods respectively, however RAF, CRP and ASO were determined through latex agglutination method. Results showed that maximum number of patients (24) suffered from AV followed by SV (15) and VR (11). The range of the UA and Ca 2 + were 2. 6 – 18. 0 mg/dl and 7. 0 – 11. 3 mg/dl respectively. The average UA content is maximum in case of VR, while no significant difference was found in Ca 2 + content among the three Sandhi shoola. Serological tests indicated maximum RAF positive samples in case of AV followed by SV patients, while CRP was positive in maximum patients of AV and SV. Results revealed a strong diagnostic measure for Sandhi shoola and suggested that higher UA content and positive RAF should be a diagnostic measure in case of Vatarakta and Aamvata respectively. In conclusion, modern biochemical and <b>serological</b> <b>investigations</b> should be exercised in Ayurveda practice for diagnostic and validation with scientific justification strengthening the Ayruvedic principles...|$|R
