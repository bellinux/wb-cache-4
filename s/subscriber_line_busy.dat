5000|$|BT {{provided}} connectivity {{between the}} end user and the nearest BT Serving Exchange via asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line,</b> symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line,</b> and fibre to the x. The end user access line could have a bandwidth ranging between 288 kbit/s and 8,128 kbit/s (8 Mibit/s) downstream and up to 832 kbit/s upstream for Asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line,</b> and up to 2048 kbit/s (2 Mibit/s) for Symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line.</b> For fibre-based connections, speeds can {{be as high as}} 100 Mbit/s although most connections of this type are fibre from exchange to cabinet so therefore limited to a maximum of 40 Mbit/s.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> is called, a relay on the <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> card {{connects the}} ringing {{generator}} to the <b>subscriber</b> <b>line.</b> The exchange also sends a ringback tone to the calling party. When the called party answers {{by taking the}} telephone handset off the switchhook, the subscriber's telephone draws direct current from the central office battery. This current is sensed by the line card and the ringing relay is de-energized.|$|R
50|$|A digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> access {{multiplexer}} (DSLAM, often pronounced dee-slam) is {{a network}} device, often located in telephone exchanges, that connects multiple customer digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) interfaces to a high-speed digital communications channel using multiplexing techniques.|$|R
50|$|A digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) modem is {{a device}} used to connect a {{computer}} or router to a telephone line which provides the digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> service for connectivity to the Internet, {{which is often}} called DSL broadband.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} switching networks {{consisting of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> and crosswires connected by switches. A connection between two subscribers is made along one crosswire via two switches. We determine the {{minimum number of}} switches necessary for such a switching network to be rearrangeably nonblocking and construct a switching arrangement which achieves this minimum for any (even) number of <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> Two procedures for assignment of crosswires to <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> pairs are described. One makes correct choice of connection route without backtracking provided all connections are known beforehand; the other determines a rearrangement of existing assignments when a new connection is required. We characterize the switching networks which have the minimum number of switches for networks with up to eight <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> and give nonisomorphic solutions for larger networks...|$|R
50|$|Consumer-oriented ADSL was {{designed}} to operate on existing lines already conditioned for Basic Rate Interface ISDN services, which itself is a digital circuit switching service (non-IP), though most incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) provision rate-adaptive digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (RADSL) to work on virtually any available copper pair facility, whether conditioned for BRI or not.Engineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as high bit rate digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (HDSL) and symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) to provision traditional Digital Signal 1 (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.|$|R
50|$|Asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) {{is a type}} {{of digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) technology, a data {{communications}} technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, pair gain is the {{transmitting}} {{of multiple}} POTS signals over the twisted pairs traditionally {{used for a}} single traditional <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> in telephone systems. Pair gain {{has the effect of}} creating additional <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> This is typically used as an expedient way to solve <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> shortage problems by using existing wiring, instead of installing new wires from the central office to the customer premises. The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.|$|R
50|$|With {{the growth}} in {{popularity}} of digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) and the benefits provided by shorter metallic loops used with DLC systems, digital loop carriers are sometimes integrated with digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> access multiplexers (DSLAM), both systems then {{taking advantage of the}} digital transmission link from the DLC to the CO.|$|R

50|$|A {{symmetric}} digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) is {{a digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires {{of the telephone}} network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, {{is identical to the}} bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth. SDSL is generally marketed at business customers, while ADSL is marketed at private as well as business customers.|$|R

5000|$|DSL {{originally}} {{stood for}} [...] "digital subscriber loop". In telecommunications marketing, the term digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> is widely understood to mean Asymmetric Digital <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Line</b> (ADSL), {{the most commonly}} installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256 kbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is lower than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric. With a symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.|$|R
