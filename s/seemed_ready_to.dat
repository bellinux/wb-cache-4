5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E
25|$|By {{the efforts}} of Cresson and his New York counterpart, the American Colonization Society went through a reorganization, with fiscal {{responsibility}} first {{on the list of}} changes. Cresson traveled the South in the late 1830s to promote colonization of Liberia, and wrote in 1840 that the whole region, particularly Kentucky, <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> send its slaves to Liberia. emancipation of slaves was seen to be wholly contingent upon their removal from the United States. Slaveholders expected compensation for losing workers.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{took the}} opening kickoff and scored {{on their first}} drive, {{advancing}} the ball 65 yards in 13 plays. Tom Brady completed four passes to receiver David Givens for 40 yards on the drive, including a 7-yard touchdown pass, and converted a fourth down on his own 44-yard line with a 2-yard run. Manning <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> counter, driving the Colts 68 yards to the New England 5-yard line, but on third down and 3, his pass was intercepted by Rodney Harrison in the end zone. After the interception, the Patriots drove 67 yards to the Colts 13-yard line where Vinatieri's 31-yard field goal increased their lead to 10–0.|$|E

25|$|Plans {{changed when}} the adventurer John Meares {{reported}} that the Spanish had impounded his ship {{and hundreds of thousands}} of pounds' worth of goods at Nootka Sound. Although it is now known that his claims of loss were somewhat exaggerated, Britain had recently beaten Spain at war and <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resume hostilities; Parliament readied the fleet in the Nootka Crisis. Roberts and Vancouver left Discovery to serve in the Channel Fleet while Discovery became a depot ship for processing victims of the press gang. The Spanish capitulated in the Nootka Sound Convention, whose terms resulted in inconsistent instructions for the British and Spanish officers sent to implement them.|$|E
25|$|At the EuroBasket 1999, Alvertis <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> lead Greece to {{its first}} medal since 1989. After leading the team in offense, with 18.1 points per game in the {{qualifying}} round, everything seemed to indicate a great EuroBasket for the Greek star. Nevertheless, misfortune {{is part of the}} game of basketball. A few days before the tournament, Alvertis suffered a severe injury during practice. This injury made him not only miss the EuroBasket, but also the major part of the Panathinaikos 1999–2000 season. Without its offensive leader, and also without Nikos Oikonomou and Efthimios Rentzias, who were also injured, Greece finished in an embarrassing sixteenth and last position. Greece failed to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics of course, and was doomed to two years of exclusion from every major tournament.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} {{play of the}} second half, Jackson broke off a 34-yard run, but was knocked {{out of the game}} on the play, and the team failed to score when Bengals safety David Fulcher intercepted a pass that bounced out of Allen's hands and {{returned}} it 11 yards to the Cincinnati 19-yard line. After forcing a punt, the Raiders drove 45 yards in eight plays and scored on a 49-yard Jeff Jaeger field goal to increase their lead to 10–3. Cincinnati responded with a 13-play (11 runs), 71-yard drive to score on Esiason's 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Stanford Jennings, tying the game with just under 12 minutes left in the game. But the Raiders took over the game from that point with consecutive scoring drives. The Bengals defense <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> force a punt when linebacker Carl Zander sacked Schroeder for a 10-yard loss, bringing up third down and 20 from the Raiders 22-yard line. But on the next play, Schroeder completed a 26-yard pass to Brown for a first down. Following two running plays, Schroeder threw a 41-yard touchdown bomb to tight end Ethan Horton that put the Raiders up 17–10 {{at the end of a}} 7-play, 80-yard drive. On the third play of the Bengals ensuing drive, Townsend sacked Esiason for a 15-yard loss that forced the Bengals to punt. Taking over on their own 30-yard line, Los Angeles put the game away with a 62-yard drive, featuring runs by Allen for gains of 20 and 18 yards, that ate up 5:13 and ended on Jaeger's 25-yard field goal with 19 seconds left in the game.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{consistent}} ship crashes {{along the}} northeastern Cape Guardafui headland, Boqor Osman's kingdom entered into an informal agreement with Britain, wherein the British {{agreed to pay}} the King annual subsidies to protect shipwrecked British crews and guard wrecks against plunder. The agreement, however, remained unratified, as the British feared that doing so would [...] "give other powers a precedent for making agreements with the Somalis, who <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> enter into relations with all comers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{conservative}} millionaire Secretary of Commerce, Sinclair Weeks, was the administration's {{most vocal}} {{and most powerful}} voice on labor law. [...] Secretary of Labor Durkin was increasingly isolated and ineffective within the administration. [...] As the effective date of Styles' resignation approached, Eisenhower <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> appoint Lawrence E. Gooding, chairman of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, to the NLRB as his replacement. But Gooding was opposed by the American Federation of Labor, and Eisenhower (who was courting the more conservative elements in the labor movement) decided against nominating him.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla assumed that Togo's Emmanuel Adebayor had taken a dive in the penalty area, whereas most replays implied his heels had been clipped by Patrick Muller. [...] The website Sport Network {{discusses}} the incident as follows: [...] "Referee Carlos Amarilla caused controversy in the thirty-fifth minute when he somehow failed to give a penalty after Adebayor was hacked down by Patrick Muller. The Arsenal man had cut inside and <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> unleash a shot at the Swiss goal, until Muller's trailing leg took Adebayor down." ...|$|E

2500|$|As police arrived, {{the house}} lights {{were brought up}} and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near {{the rear of the}} theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that {{he was the first to}} reach Oswald and that Oswald <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> {{surrender}} saying, [...] "Well, it is all over now." [...] McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that there was considerable competition within the coalition. [...] "There were many more people with aspirations than space to accommodate them, and they all <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> jump ship when they felt they were being excluded" [...] said Janet Kelly, a Veneuelan political commentator. Columnist Patricia Poleo of the Caracas newspaper El Nuevo Pais joined several government officials when she later suggested that during Carmona's tenure, Isaac Perez Recao, {{a member of a}} family that owned a controlling stake in a firm called Venoco, a subsidiary of which Carmona ran, had allegedly been a key financier of the coup and had been pulling strings behind the scenes. [...] "He immediately surrounded himself with people who invoked fear in Venezuela" [...] complained one official about Cormona. [...] "Obviously, this coup was very poorly coordinated. It caught the democratic opposition by surprise." [...] The Miami Herald reported that [...] "moderate politicians complained that Carmona, a centrist businessman, had been 'hijacked' by rightists." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Houston completely {{took over}} the game. [...] Houston receiver Ken Burrough caught a pass from Pastorini at the Pats 40-yard, broke through coverage from Mike Haynes, and took off for a 71-yard touchdown reception. [...] Raymond Clayborn's 47-yard kickoff return gave the Patriots a chance to strike back, but two plays later, Steve Grogan's pass on a flea flicker play was intercepted by Mike Reinfeldt on the Oilers 1-yard line. [...] Aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty that gave them a first down after failing to convert a 3rd down on their own 7-yard line, Houston drove 99 yards to score on Pastorini's 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mike Barber. [...] Again, the Patriots <b>seemed</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> respond, driving to the Oilers 23-yard line, but again they came up short due to Reinfeldt, who intercepted another pass from Grogan to end the drive. [...] Reinfeldt's 27-yard return and another unccessary roughness penalty against New England gave the Oilers a first down on the Patriots 49-yard line. [...] Pastorini completed a 22-yard pass to Barder, and eventually got his team a 21-0 lead with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Barber {{at the end of}} the possession.|$|E
40|$|Conventional risks, such as {{environmental}} degradation, {{tend to take}} on new dimensions due to increasingly extreme weather conditions, growing geographical concentration of populations and wealth, etc. Emerging issues, such as new diseases, biotechnologies, bio-terrorism, are occurring, {{many of which are}} characterised by extreme uncertainty and the possibility of extensive harm. Government capacity to adjust to traditional and new risks seems increasingly challenged by modern complexities, {{while at the same time}} people <b>seem</b> more <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> accept risk resulting from “private” decisions rather than those resulting from “public” decisions (for example most consumers <b>seem</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> assume the uncertainty resulting from the use of cellular phones or pharmaceuticals). ...|$|R
