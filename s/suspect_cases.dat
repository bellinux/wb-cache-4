50|$|By March 1945 many {{buildings}} on Fantome Island urgently required repair. However, the lock hospital had outlived its usefulness. An {{inspection of the}} facility by Dr GS Hayes in early 1945 discovered {{that most of the}} suspected gonorrhoea patients tested had clean smears, and therefore had been cured; and in addition some had never had gonorrhoea. Dr Hayes stated that <b>suspect</b> <b>cases</b> were sent to Fantome Island from various settlements (the majority from Cherbourg), and were treated as if they had gonorrhoea, whether they did or not. The syphilis cases were mostly in a non-infectious stage, and could be returned to the settlements, with weekly injections. Hayes believed that <b>suspect</b> <b>cases</b> could be isolated and treated on the mainland, as there was no STI specialist to evaluate the cases as they arrived on Fantome Island. Upon the closure of the Fantome Island Lock Hospital on 31 August 1945, 13 patients were transferred to the existing hospital on Palm Island, and some buildings were later removed to Palm Island for a new lock hospital and other purposes. Julian's role on Fantome Island ended at this point.|$|E
