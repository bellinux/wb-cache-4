500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. I like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|Content {{relating}} to the Egyptian mixed-sex schools instituted by Suzanne Mubarak was gathered, but Bilheimer eventually removed much of this content from the film because the Arab Spring made the information in {{this portion of the}} film outdated, despite the continued existence of most of these schools. Much of the interview with Molly Melching was removed as well. During the editing of Not My Life, Bilheimer cut the interview with Tutu, but later re-added a single quotation. In this interview, Bilheimer told Tutu about meeting normally reasonable, compassionate women who, when speaking about human traffickers, <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Hang him up by his balls and then cut 'em off!" [...] Tutu, head of the truth and reconciliation commission, surprised Bilheimer with his response, saying that [...] "these people have committed monstrous acts," [...] but that, according to Christianity, traffickers can still be redeemed and become saints.|$|E

500|$|Hadji, age 16, became Dr. Quest's {{personal}} assistant, lacking his mentor's {{formal education}} but sharing his burning interest in archaeology, anthropology and the paranormal. A Hindu, as {{mentioned in the}} original series episode [...] "Riddle Of The Gold," [...] and a yogi, he held a fatalistic attitude towards the show's drama, reacting to situations [...] "from the philosophical {{point of view that}} everything is as it's supposed to be". Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling Jonny. Lawrence cut Hadji's classic telekinesis to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices. [...] "He doesn't <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," [...] season one voice actor Michael Benyaer explained. [...] "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers. He can do more plausible stuff. There is an episode where Hadji pretends to stop his breathing so that the bad guys think he is dead." [...] Takashi drew Hadji taller and thinner than his classic counterpart.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{introduced}} {{the first two}} of his many characters during The Raleigh Cigarette Program's first season. The character of Clem Kadiddlehopper {{was based on a}} Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. Skelton's voice pattern for Clem was similar to the later cartoon character, Bullwinkle; there was enough similarity to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose. The second character, The Mean Widdle Kid, or [...] "Junior", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. [...] "Junior" [...] would <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "If I dood it, I gets a whipping.", followed moments later by the statement, [...] "I dood it!" [...] Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname [...] "Junior" [...] long before it was heard by a radio audience. While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea of using the character on the radio show was Edna's. Skelton starred in a 1943 movie of the same name, but did not play [...] "Junior" [...] in the film.|$|E

There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." [...] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac.

500|$|In 2009, before Rowland and Guetta collaborated for [...] "When Love Takes Over", {{the media}} {{reported}} that Columbia Records and Rowland were to part ways by mutual agreement. However in a 2010 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated {{the decision to}} leave was not hers: the label ended their contract because singles from the previous record Ms. Kelly did not sell sufficiently well. After the release of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] she {{would go on to}} fire Matthew Knowles. It has since been suggested Rowland had fallen out with former fellow Destiny's Child singer Beyonc√© Knowles. The media reported that Knowles' decision to release one more video ("Why Don't You Love Me") from her album I Am... Sasha Fierce just before Rowland released [...] "Commander" [...] was unfair on Rowland. These claims would be denied by the singer who said that despite the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] airing several days before [...] "Commander", the media was [...] "making too much of a big deal of release schedules and trying to create a feud where it doesn't exist." [...] She also said, [...] "we all came out {{at the same time and}} it really doesn't matter... I think there's room for everybody... There's Bey, there's Ciara putting something out and [...] GaGa putting something out, but, because we started out together, people are going to <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that.

[...] Wolff liked Garagiola's pizazz as he would <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> [...] "the guy stapled him to the bag" [...] or that a runner is [...] "smilin' like he swallowed a banana peel." [...] Also in 1962, NBC broadcast the National League tie-breaker series between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Bob Wolff and George Kell were the announcers for the playoff series. Wolff also hosted the pre-game shows for NBC's World Series coverage from 1962 to 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating ‚Ä¶ everyone asks the same question and I even get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come across my books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I wrote my first book, make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' ‚Äì or <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. The implications are really quite insulting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{separating}} from Gordon, Jackson cloistered {{herself in}} her home and lived alone for the first time‚Äîthe first six months she stated she never actually left her house due to being terrified of Gordon seeing her. Weary after her years of public scorn, she didn't {{know what to do}} with her life and was afraid to perform again. Jackson struggled to rebuild her confidence but was plagued with self-doubt, explaining, [...] "I got to the point, [...] where‚Äîwell, you know in the media they <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh, she can't sing. She has no talent. She can't dance.' I started believing that, and I was thinking, 'Oh my God'. And I started thinking, 'Oh gee, how could this happen to me?' How could I start believing this?". After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose [...] "Free the World". She performed the song for friends to a positive reception. This spurred on Jackson to write more songs, ending up with a full album, Startin' Over.|$|E

He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace." [...] ‚Äì Jenny Rylance ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} tracks on the album include [...] "Bonsai People", which is a Red Hot Chili Peppers type funk metal song. The lyrics compare childlike people to bonsai trees {{in a way that}} they are tiny (humble, God-fearing) but as a strong breed they can endure the rending of wind (temptation) since their roots are deeply entrenched into soil (word of God). [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] on the other hand is a dark, melodic black metal type song which begins with oppressive clean guitaring. With a haunting voice a person whispers the words [...] "Hell is a totally cool site, so let's get there, all right?". This sentence is probably an attempt to describe the attitude of some of the black metal fans; the lyrics tell that those who <b>say</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that are under the 'spell of hell' which the devil uses to mislead people. Consecutively, it can be said that [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] was Deuteronomium's way of expressing their stance on the black metal movement which had at that time become very popular, with Emperor and likes being played on the Finnish metal radio program 'Metalliliitto', as the band members recall in an interview. [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] became Deuteronomium's best known song. The songs [...] "III" [...] and [...] "Northern Praise" [...] are also black metal influenced and present more worshipful lyrics, the forementioned is vocalized in Finnish and refers to the trinity of God. The latter is also a somewhat popular song as it is noted for being one of their best known songs. The self-titled song [...] "Street Corner Queen" [...] is a punk rock influenced death metal song about a prostitute, the lyrics tell that she sells love though deep inside she knows that it's not love at all, and that she seeks comfort from wrong ways. [...] "Druglord" [...] is another punk rock influenced death metal track. The lyrics are written from the perspective of a young person who suffers from drug addiction.|$|E
