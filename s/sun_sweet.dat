(<b>SUN),</b> <b>sweet</b> white lupin seeds (L), SBM/SUN, SBM/L) were investigated {{in a growing}} trial on 30 male Apennine lambs. Feeding consumption was not significantly affected by the diets however, lambs receiving the diet containing lupin, as main protein source, trended towards better feed conversion rates. Diets did not significantly affect final live weight, average daily gain, feed conversion rate and protein efficiency ratio (PER); also these parameters appeared slightly better in the lambs receiving the diet containing lupin, as main protein source.

40|$|The {{development}} of resistant maize (Zea mays) varieties against drought and heat {{is on the}} rise as these abiotic stress factors affect maize production. Plants including maize respond by altering their metabolism to produce LEA proteins (dehydrins), antioxidants, compatible solutes and some secondary metabolites as strategies to maintain plant metabolism. This study looks at identifying dehydrins and metabolites in maize leaves subjected to both drought and heat stress. Two genotypes namely; Obaatampa a tropical variety and <b>Sun</b> <b>Sweet,</b> a temperate variety were subjected to drought, heat, combined stress (heat x drought) and a control condition over a period of 7 days in a 2 x 2 factorial design. From the same plant, samples were taken for metabolite profiling and protein extraction. GC-MS metabolite profiling detected 312 metabolites including amino acids and oligopeptides, carbohydrates, organic acids and terpenoids among others. Aconitic acid and asparagine were up regulated in all 3 conditions. Proline was also up regulated under heat and combined stress condition but drought observed a low regulation of proline. Drought generally observed a low regulation of metabolites; however, maleic acid was up-regulated under drought stress. Raffinose among other carbohydrates was up regulated under all conditions implying a possible osmotic function. Some terpenoids (B-amyrin) were also up regulated implying some defensive mechanisms are being employed against pathogens. ANOVA-PCA and heatmap gave clear indications of the effect of heat on metabolite regulation. ANOVA-PCA and the heatmap showed that temperature stress regulated majority of these metabolites followed by combined stress then drought as this was evident from the fold-change values. PCA and Anova (Appendix 3) for metabolites show that there was significant (P< 0. 05) difference between specific metabolites for the two (2) genotypes (ANOVA- Appendix 3). However, the two genotypes reacted in a similar way though they observed some difference with specific metabolites. Furthermore, some dehydrins (DHNs) were also identified in the protein extraction. These identified proteins include 20, 23, 50 and 100 kDa weight dehydrin. These DHNs were identified in all stress conditions and in all genotypes. However, problems with proteins extraction prevented a complete picture of dehydrin responses to stress, though plants express unique proteins in all variety of stress conditions. In conclusion, heat stress has a high metabolite effect on plants than drought and combined stress. Furthermore, genotypes respond in a similar way to different stress conditions and produce DHNs, as a tolerance mechanism against stress conditions...|$|E

Experimental diets had no significant effect (p> 0. 05) on feed intake, body weight gain, water consumption, water: feed ratio, feed conversion ratio and feed cost per broiler while final live weight was affected significantly (p< 0. 05). Increasing dietary SOR content beyond 15 % reduced growth rate, which cumulatively caused a decrease in final live weight. Diets had significant effect only thigh+drumstick and the abdominal fat, and the dressing percentage values of broilers on the SOR diets were higher those on the control.

40|$|Short- and {{long-term}} {{responses of the}} violaxanthin (V) and lutein epoxide (Lx) cycles were studied in two species of Lauraceae: sweet bay laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) and avocado (Persea americana L.). The Lx content exceeded the V content in shade leaves of both species. Both Lx and V were de-epoxidised on illumination, but only V was fully restored by epoxidation in low light. Violaxanthin was preferentially de-epoxidised in low light in L. nobilis. This suggests that Lx accumulates with leaf ageing, partly because its conversion to lutein is limited in shade. After exposure to strong light, shade leaves of avocado readjusted the total pools of α- and β-xanthophyll cycles by de novo synthesis of antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin and lutein. This occurred in parallel with a sustained depression of Fv/Fm. In Persea indica, a closely related but low Lx species, Fv/Fm recovered faster after a similar light treatment, suggesting {{the involvement of the}} Lx cycle in sustained energy dissipation. Furthermore, the seasonal correlation between non-reversible Lx and V photoconversions and pre-dawn Fv/Fm in <b>sun</b> leaves of <b>sweet</b> bay supported the conclusion that the Lx cycle is involved in a slowly reversible downregulation of photosynthesis analogous to the V cycle...|$|R

[...] I but foretell thy fortunes--then expire; [...] 30 [...] Think not that I would look on them and live. [...] A Spirit forces me to see and speak, [...] And for my guerdon grants not to survive; [...] My Heart shall be poured over thee and break: [...] Yet for a moment, ere I must resume [...] Thy sable web of Sorrow, let me take [...] Over the gleams that flash athwart thy gloom [...] A softer glimpse; some stars shine through thy night, [...] And many meteors, and above thy tomb [...] Leans sculptured Beauty, which Death cannot blight: [...] 40 [...] And from thine ashes boundless Spirits rise [...] To give thee honour, and the earth delight; [...] Thy soil shall still be pregnant with the wise, [...] The gay, the learned, the generous, and the brave, [...] Native to thee as Summer to thy skies, [...] Conquerors on foreign shores, and the far wave,[301] [...] Discoverers of new worlds, which take their name;[302] [...] For thee alone they have no arm to save, [...] And all thy recompense is in their fame, [...] A noble one to them, but not to thee-- [...] 50 [...] Shall they be glorious, and thou still the same? [...] Oh! more than these illustrious far shall be [...] The Being--and even yet he may be born-- [...] The mortal Saviour who shall set thee free, [...] And see thy diadem, so changed and worn [...] By fresh barbarians, on thy brow replaced; [...] And the <b>sweet</b> <b>Sun</b> replenishing thy morn, [...] Thy moral morn, too long with clouds defaced, [...] And noxious vapours from Avernus risen, [...] Such as all they must breathe who are debased [...] 60 [...] By Servitude, and have the mind in prison.[303] [...] Yet through this centuried eclipse of woe[cf] [...] Some voices shall be heard, and Earth shall listen; [...] Poets shall follow in the path I show, [...] And make it broader: the same brilliant sky [...] Which cheers the birds to song shall bid them glow,[cg] [...] And raise their notes as natural and high; [...] Tuneful shall be their numbers; they shall sing [...] Many of Love, and some of Liberty, [...] But few shall soar upon that Eagle's wing, [...] 70 [...] And look in the Sun's face, with Eagle's gaze, [...] All free and fearless as the feathered King, [...] But fly more near the earth; how many a phrase [...] Sublime shall lavished be on some small prince [...] In all the prodigality of Praise! [...] And language, eloquently false, evince[ch] [...] The harlotry of Genius, which, like Beauty,[ci] [...] Too oft forgets its own self-reverence, [...] And looks on prostitution as a duty.[304] [...] He who once enters in a Tyrant's hall[cj][305] [...] 80 [...] As guest is slave--his thoughts become a booty, [...] And the first day which sees the chain enthral [...] A captive, sees his half of Manhood gone[306]-- [...] The Soul's emasculation saddens all [...] His spirit; thus the Bard too near the throne [...] Quails from his inspiration, bound to please,-- [...] How servile is the task to please alone! [...] To smooth the verse to suit his Sovereign's ease [...] And royal leisure, nor too much prolong [...] Aught save his eulogy, and find, and seize, [...] 90 [...] Or force, or forge fit argument of Song! [...] Thus trammelled, thus condemned to Flattery's trebles, [...] He toils through all, still trembling to be wrong: [...] For fear some noble thoughts, like heavenly rebels, [...] Should rise up in high treason to his brain, [...] He sings, as the Athenian spoke, with pebbles [...] In's mouth, lest Truth should stammer through his strain. [...] But out of the long file of sonneteers [...] There shall be some who will not sing in vain, [...] And he, their Prince, shall rank among my peers,[307] [...] And Love shall be his torment; but his grief [...] Shall make an immortality of tears, [...] And Italy shall hail him as the Chief [...] Of Poet-lovers, and his higher song [...] Of Freedom wreathe him with as green a leaf. [...] But in a farther age shall rise along [...] The banks of Po two greater still than he; [...] The World which smiled on him shall do them wrong [...] Till they are ashes, and repose with me. [...] The first will make an epoch with his lyre, [...] 110 [...] And fill the earth with feats of Chivalry:[308] [...] His Fancy like a rainbow, and his Fire, [...] Like that of Heaven, immortal, and his Thought [...] Borne onward with a wing that cannot tire; [...] Pleasure shall, like a butterfly new caught, [...] Flutter her lovely pinions o'er his theme, [...] And Art itself seem into Nature wrought [...] By the transparency of his bright dream.-- [...] The second, of a tenderer, sadder mood, [...] Shall pour his soul out o'er Jerusalem; [...] 120 [...] He, too, shall sing of Arms, and Christian blood [...] Shed where Christ bled for man; and his high harp [...] Shall, by the willow over Jordan's flood, [...] Revive a song of Sion, and the sharp [...] Conflict, and final triumph of the brave [...] And pious, and the strife of Hell to warp [...] Their hearts from their great purpose, until wave [...] The red-cross banners where the first red Cross [...] Was crimsoned from His veins who died to save,[ck] [...] Shall be his sacred argument; the loss [...] 130 [...] Of years, of favour, freedom, even of fame [...] Contested for a time, while the smooth gloss [...] Of Courts would slide o'er his forgotten name [...] And call Captivity a kindness--meant [...] To shield him from insanity or shame-- [...] Such shall be his meek guerdon! who was sent [...] To be Christ's Laureate--they reward him well! [...] Florence dooms me but death or banishment, [...] Ferrara him a pittance and a cell,[309] [...] Harder to bear and less deserved, for I [...] 140 [...] Had stung the factions which I strove to quell; [...] But this meek man who with a lover's eye [...] Will look on Earth and Heaven, and who will deign [...] To embalm with his celestial flattery, [...] As poor a thing as e'er was spawned to reign,[310] [...] What will he do to merit such a doom? [...] Perhaps he'll love,--and is not Love in vain [...] Torture enough without a living tomb? [...] Yet it will be so--he and his compeer, [...] The Bard of Chivalry, will both consume[311] [...] 150 [...] In penury and pain too many a year, [...] And, dying in despondency, bequeath [...] To the kind World, which scarce will yield a tear, [...] A heritage enriching all who breathe [...] With the wealth of a genuine Poet's soul, [...] And to their country a redoubled wreath, [...] Unmatched by time; not Hellas can unroll [...] Through her Olympiads two such names, though one[312] [...] Of hers be mighty;--and is this the whole [...] Of such men's destiny beneath the Sun?[313] [...] 160 [...] Must all the finer thoughts, the thrilling sense, [...] The electric blood with which their arteries run,[cl] [...] Their body's self turned soul with the intense [...] Feeling of that which is, and fancy of [...] That which should be, to such a recompense [...] Conduct? shall their bright plumage on the rough [...] Storm be still scattered? Yes, and it must be; [...] For, formed of far too penetrable stuff, [...] These birds of Paradise[314] but long to flee [...] Back to their native mansion, soon they find [...] 170 [...] Earth's mist with their pure pinions not agree, [...] And die or are degraded; for the mind [...] Succumbs to long infection, and despair, [...] And vulture Passions flying close behind, [...] Await the moment to assail and tear;[315] [...] And when, at length, the wingéd wanderers stoop, [...] Then is the Prey-birds' triumph, then they share [...] The spoil, o'erpowered at length by one fell swoop. [...] Yet some have been untouched who learned to bear, [...] Some whom no Power could ever force to droop, [...] 180 [...] Who could resist themselves even, hardest care! [...] And task most hopeless; but some such have been, [...] And if my name amongst the number were, [...] That Destiny austere, and yet serene, [...] Were prouder than more dazzling fame unblessed; [...] The Alp's snow summit nearer heaven is seen [...] Than the Volcano's fierce eruptive crest, [...] Whose splendour from the black abyss is flung, [...] While the scorched mountain, from whose burning breast [...] A temporary torturing flame is wrung, [...] 190 [...] Shines for a night of terror, then repels [...] Its fire back to the Hell from whence it sprung, [...] The Hell which in its entrails ever dwells.|$|R

Wherefore do I assume [...] 450 [...] These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, [...] Refusing to accept as great a share [...] Of hazard as of honour, due alike [...] To him who Reigns, and so much to him due [...] Of hazard more, as he above the rest [...] High honourd sits?

But they [...] Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice [...] Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; [...] Thir rising all at once was as the sound [...] Of Thunder heard remote.

Devil with Devil damn'd [...] Firm concord holds, men onely disagree [...] Of Creatures rational, though under hope [...] Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, [...] Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife [...] 500 [...] Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, [...] Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: [...] As if (which might induce us to accord) [...] Man had not hellish foes anow besides, [...] That {{day and night for}} his destruction waite. [...] The Stygian Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth [...] In order came the grand infernal Peers, [...] Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd [...] Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less [...] Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, [...] 510 [...] And God-like imitated State; him round [...] A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd [...] With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. [...] Then of thir Session ended they bid cry [...] With Trumpets regal sound the great result: [...] Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim [...] Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie [...] By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss [...] Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell [...] With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim.

[...] As when to warn proud Cities warr appears [...] Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush [...] To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van [...] Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears [...] Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms [...] From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. [...] Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell [...] Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air [...] 540 [...] In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. [...] As when Alcides from Oealia Crown'd [...] With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore [...] Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, [...] And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw [...] Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde, [...] Retreated in a silent valley, sing [...] With notes Angelical to many a Harp [...] Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall [...] By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate [...] 550 [...] Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. [...] Thir song was partial, but the harmony [...] (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) [...] Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment [...] The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet [...] (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) [...] Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, [...] In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high [...] Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, [...] Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, [...] 560 [...] And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. [...] Of good and evil much they argu'd then, [...] Of happiness and final misery, [...] Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, [...] Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: [...] Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm [...] Pain for a while or anguish, and excite [...] Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest [...] With stubborn patience as with triple steel. [...] Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, [...] 570 [...] On bold adventure to discover wide [...] That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps [...] Might yeild them easier habitation, bend [...] Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks [...] Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge [...] Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; [...] Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, [...] Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; [...] Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud [...] Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton [...] 580 [...] Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. [...] Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, [...] Lethe the River of Oblivion roules [...] Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, [...] Forthwith his former state and being forgets, [...] Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. [...] Beyond this flood a frozen Continent [...] Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms [...] Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land [...] Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems [...] 590 [...] Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, [...] A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog [...] Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, [...] Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air [...] Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. [...] Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, [...] At certain revolutions all the damn'd [...] Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change [...] Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, [...] From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice [...] 600 [...] Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine [...] Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, [...] Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. [...] They ferry over this Lethean Sound [...]|$|R
