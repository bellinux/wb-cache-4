40|$|Leishmania (Leishmania) aethiopica and L. (L.) tropica cause {{cutaneous}} leishmaniases {{and appear}} to be related. L. aethiopica is geographically restricted to Ethiopia and Kenya; L. tropica is widely dispersed from the Eastern Mediterranean, through the Middle East into eastern India and in north, east and south Africa.

Here, eight <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. aethiopica were characterized genetically and compared with 156 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. tropica {{from most of the}} latter species' geographical range to discern the closeness. Twelve unlinked microsatellite markers previously used to genotype <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. tropica were successfully applied to the eight <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. aethiopica and their microsatellite profiles were compared to those <b>of</b> 156 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. tropica from various geographical locations that were isolated from human cases of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, hyraxes and sand fly vectors. All the microsatellite profiles were subjected to various analytical algorithms: Bayesian statistics, distance-based and factorial correspondence analysis, revealing: (i) the species L. aethiopica, though geographically restricted, is genetically very heterogeneous; (ii) the <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. aethiopica formed a distinct genetic cluster; and (iii) <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. aethiopica are closely related to <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> L. tropica and more so to the African ones, although, by factorial correspondence analysis, clearly separate from them.

5|$|A <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans.

After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
