25|$|All the {{proposed}} methods can be grouped into two major families: solid-state fingerprint readers and optical fingerprint readers. The procedure for capturing a fingerprint using a sensor consists of rolling or touching with the finger onto a <b>sensing</b> <b>area,</b> {{which according to}} the physical principle in use (optical, ultrasonic, capacitive or thermal) captures the difference between valleys and ridges. When a finger touches or rolls onto a surface, the elastic skin deforms. The quantity {{and direction of the}} pressure applied by the user, the skin conditions and the projection of an irregular 3D object (the finger) onto a 2D flat plane introduce distortions, noise and inconsistencies in the captured fingerprint image. These problems result in inconsistent and non-uniform irregularities in the image. During each acquisition, therefore, the results of the imaging are different and uncontrollable. The representation of the same fingerprint changes every time the finger is placed on the sensor plate, increasing the complexity of any attempt to match fingerprints, impairing the system performance and consequently, limiting the widespread use of this biometric technology.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{parallel}} plate capacitor has two conductors {{separated by a}} dielectric layer. Most of the energy in this system is concentrated directly between the plates. Some of the energy spills over into the area outside the plates, and the electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields.

A {{parallel plate}} capacitor {{is not a good}} choice for such a sensor pattern. Placing a finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area to the capacitive system.

This paper presents a clustering mechanism for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks based on overlapped Field of View (FoV) areas. Today, for random deployments, dense networks of low cost, low resolution and low power multimedia nodes are preferred than sparse cases of high cost, high resolution and high power nodes. Overlapping FoVs in dense networks causes wasting power of system because of redundant <b>sensing</b> of <b>area.</b> The main aim of the proposed clustering method is energy conservation and prolonging network lifetime.

40|$|International audienceA mobile robot, {{represented}} by a point moving along a polygonal line in the plane, has to explore an unknown polygon {{and return to the}} starting point. The robot has a <b>sensing</b> <b>area</b> which can be a circle or a square centered at the robot. This area shifts while the robot moves inside the polygon, and at each point of its trajectory the robot "sees" (explores) all points for which the segment between the robot and the point is contained in the polygon and in the <b>sensing</b> <b>area.</b> We focus on two tasks: exploring the entire polygon and exploring only its boundary. We consider several scenarios: both shapes of the <b>sensing</b> <b>area</b> and the Manhattan and the Euclidean metrics. We focus on two quality benchmarks for exploration performance: optimality (the length of the trajectory of the robot is equal to that of the optimal robot knowing the polygon) and competitiveness (the length of the trajectory of the robot is at most a constant multiple of that of the optimal robot knowing the polygon). Most of our results concern rectilinear polygons. We show that optimal exploration is possible in only one scenario, that of exploring the boundary by a robot with square <b>sensing</b> <b>area,</b> starting at the boundary and using the Manhattan metric. For this case we give an optimal exploration algorithm, and in all other scenarios we prove impossibility of optimal exploration. For competitiveness the situation is more optimistic: we show a competitive exploration algorithm for rectilinear polygons whenever the <b>sensing</b> <b>area</b> is a square, for both tasks, regardless of the metric and of the starting point.
