5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid <b>support</b> <b>is</b> contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid <b>support</b> <b>is</b> contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether parents' social <b>support</b> <b>was</b> {{related to their}} children's peer acceptance and likability. The moderating role of the parent's and the child's gender was also examined.

Results revealed that perceived <b>support</b> <b>was</b> related to a reduction of subsequent depression for both male and female adolescents. In addition, instrumental enacted <b>support</b> <b>was</b> a significant predictor of subsequent depression for male adolescents, whereas socioemotional enacted <b>support</b> <b>was</b> a significant predictor of subsequent depression for female adolescents. Functional differences in the types of social support for Chinese male and female adolescents, as well as implications for clinical intervention, are discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Perceptions {{of social}} support from family, non-family adults, and peers were {{examined}} {{in relation to the}} psychopathology reported by 220 suicidal adolescents (152 females) during a psychiatric hospitalization. Results of regression analyses showed that, among females, family <b>support</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Among males, peer <b>support</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Across gender, more peer <b>support</b> <b>was</b> associated with more externalizing behavior problems; whereas, family <b>support</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to these problems and to alcohol/substance abuse. Paralleling normative findings, age was positively associated with peer support, and females perceived more peer support than did males. Findings extend previous research on social support to suicidal adolescents, and broaden the literature by examining extrafamilial support and a broader range of relevant psychopathology. That <b>is,</b> perceived social <b>support</b> relates to psychiatric impairment differentially by gender, and normative, age-related variations in perceptions of social <b>support</b> <b>are</b> detected even among highly impaired adolescents. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological <b>support</b> <b>is</b> the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have.

5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific <b>support</b> <b>is</b> that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E

The tangible, emotional and informational functions of social <b>support</b> <b>were</b> measured as aggregate values across support sources.

Intended breastfeeders also indicated they received more emotional and information support from the baby's father and prenatal classes. Tangible, emotional and informational support did not change pre- and postnatally for women who breastfed. However, certain sources did provide more support postnatally.
