Like all group formation processes in rural <b>communities,</b> Farmer <b>Research</b> <b>Committees</b> are vulnerable to being captured by an elite unless the appropriate precautions are taken to ensure a Committee represents a reasonably homogeneous set of interests in a shared agro-ecological recommendation domain. A committee can include a few as four or as many as 40 members, depending on the socio-cultural context. Members who do not put in the time or effort considered necessary by the community or client group can be replaced.|$|R
40|$|According to a {{surveying}} by European <b>Community</b> <b>research</b> <b>committee</b> (CEC 2001), {{the risk}} of die for pedestrians and cyclists because of street incidents is 8, 9 times higher {{than one of the}} occupants of motor vehicles. From statistics we’ve found that the greatest part of these accidents is due to the collision of the pedestrian on the front part of motor vehicles, and that fact affects the considerations on the passive safety. The aim of this work is to try to determine the state-of-the-art regarding vehicles design, within pedestrian safety problem, taking care to finite element methods and models used for vehicle study and development. In fact, currently, the simulation of vehicle dynamics is carried out from car manufacturing companies and companies that develop finite elements software for dynamic simulation. Probably, the software manufacturing companies supply greater information, since they publish own researches by promoting seminaries and conferences, in which many universities take part. The car manufacturing companies, on the contrary, also having greater input data, stretch to keep some competitive products researches secrets. Carrying out researches between the greatest conferences and associations promoters that take care to street safety, it’s possible to know the research actual state on the pedestrian safety and to determine the way to improve the vehicle front part. The more important research results will be reported; several of these regarding the finite elements dynamic simulation in passive safety field will be mentioned. Particularly, impactors modeling and certification will be in the first rank, besides studies for improving the vehicle performances within pedestrian safety problematic...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{contribution}} of student co-researchers to a community-based participatory Photovoice investigation of Indigenous children's food-related lived experience. We examine co-researchers’ contributions to the research process, their role in knowledge co-generation and dissemination, and factors that fostered research partnership with the teenage co-researchers. Methods: High school students attending a First Nation community school in Canada were trained as research partners. They contributed to aspects of research design, conducted interviews with grades 3 and 4 Photovoice participants, and participated in data analysis {{and the development of}} a culturally relevant photobook. The study was initiated by the <b>community's</b> <b>research</b> <b>committee.</b> It is informed by critical consciousness theory and the positive youth development framework. Results: Student co-researchers incorporated culturally appropriate strategies as they interviewed participants. Co-researchers adopted conversational approaches, built rapport by articulating personal and cultural connections, and engaged in mentoring and health promotion as they interviewed participants. They made critical contributions to dissemination by developing photobook content that promoted the importance of traditional foods and the vital role of family and community in healthy eating practices. Relationships and “dialogic” space were important to building partnership with and promoting capacity development among youth co-researchers. Conclusions: Partnership between university researchers and Indigenous student co-researchers holds great promise for health promotion in <b>communities.</b> Co-researchers developed <b>research</b> and leadership skills, gained understanding of health challenges facing their community, and initiated health and cultural promotion through the project's Photobook. This investigation supports the powerful potential of student co-researchers to meaningfully contribute to research processes and to build knowledge that is relevant and credible both within and outside of their communities.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this work}} is to explain the work of Design Methods’ {{research}} group of Dept. of Mechanical Engineering of Salerno University, {{in the field of}} research regarding vehicles pedestrian safety problem, taking care to finite element methods and models used and developed for vehicle design and optimization. Design/methodology/approach Our developed models show a very good Numeric/Experimental correlation, and we’ve numerically certified our virtual impactors, designed following EEVC-WG 17 specification. These impactors have been tested also at higher speed and we have obtained a good correlation with some problems because of the critical behavior of the foam solved following different model-design optimization methods. Findings Best results obtained and explained in this paper are concerning impactors modeling and certification, and Experimental/Numerical correlation of full impact tests. Research limitations/implications The achievement of the maximum possible pedestrian safety performance, compatibly with the others, sometimes conflicting, performances, {{is one of the main}} objectives to reach, for the automotive industry by now and, above all, for the future. Practical implications According to a surveying by European <b>Community</b> <b>research</b> <b>committee,</b> the risk of die for pedestrians and cyclists because of street incidents is eight/nine times higher than one of the occupants of motor vehicles. From statistics we’ve found that the greatest part of these accidents is due to the collision of the pedestrian on the front part of motor vehicles, and that fact affects the considerations on the passive safety. Originality/value The most Important Automotive industries had understood the impact of new regulations about homologation and began to study the problem and particularly how to introduce new Homologation parameters in their Product development cycles, today based on Virtual Prototyping of the Whole Vehicle and final Physical testing of few physical prototypes.
