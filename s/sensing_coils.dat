50|$|Kinman {{holds the}} most number of patents {{concerned}} with increasing {{the efficiency of}} and minimizing the noise <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> in hum-canceling guitar pickups.|$|E
50|$|Kinman Guitar Electrix {{were awarded}} 5 or more US patents {{beginning}} circa 1996 for innovative design concerned with hum canceling single pole pickups. Kinman at first concentrated on particularly the Fender type single coil pickup and in 2009 the P-90 pickup. One {{of the most}} important elements of Kinman's patents is the use of iron in the core of the noise sensing coil. This was absolutely novel in 1996 and without the presence of iron to boost the efficiency of the noise sensing coil differential coil technology would not have been possible. Vertical differential coil technique is also described in Kinman's US Patents 5,668,520 and 6,103,966 with priority date of March 1996. After 1998 DiMarzio and Seymour Duncan also began using iron and differential winding techniques in the noise <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> in some of their products. Over the years Kinman has improved and refined their designs to a point where the popular consensus is the sound of some models is indistinguishable from noisy single coils. Kinman also manufactures noiseless P-90 and Telecaster pickups under US Patent 7,022,909Also Ilitch Electornics patented their revolutionary hum-canceling technology which has been developed for aftermarket guitars (Strats, Teles, Gibson Les Pauls and many others).|$|E

25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary.

By winding the <b>sense</b> <b>coil</b> wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the <b>sense</b> <b>coil,</b> the entire circuit became capacitively coupled.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection <b>sensing</b> <b>coils.</b> For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E

The change in inductance due to change in pressure is measured by an improved modified operational amplifier based network. The proposed network permits offset inductance compensation of <b>sensing</b> <b>coil</b> and also minimizes the stray capacitance between <b>sensing</b> <b>coil</b> and ground using dummy inductor whose value equal to zero level inductance of <b>sensing</b> <b>coil</b> and op-amps with high input impedance.

It has been observed that the variation in gauge pressure from 0 to 70 psi having linear relationship with output ac voltage in the range of 0 to 85. 0 mV. Corresponding to pressure variations, the ac output voltage further converted into an electric current of 4 to 20 mA for remote indication and control purpose. The investigations have been performed to sense air pressure of pressure tank fitted with pump piston. The experimental results are found to have good linearity of about ± 0. 1 % and resolution.

40|$|Inductive power {{transfer}} (IPT) {{remains one of}} the most common ways to achieve wireless {{power transfer}} (WPT), operating on the same electromagnetic principle as electrical transformers but with an air core. IPT has recently been implemented in wireless charging of consumer products such as smartphones and electric vehicles. However, one major challenge with using IPT remains ensuring precise alignment between the transmitting and receiving coils so that maximum power transfer can take place. In literature, much of the focus is on improving the electrical circuits or IPT coil geometries to allow a greater transmission range. Nevertheless, most IPT products today rely on precise alignment for efficient power transfer. In this thesis, the use of <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> to detect and correct lateral misalignments in a typical IPT system is modeled and tested. The <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> exploit magnetic-field symmetry to give a nonlinear measure of misalignment direction and magnitude. To test this idea, three experiments are performed: 1) measure the voltage of experimental <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> for various lateral misalignment distances, 2) implement closed-loop control and measure performance for an experimental two-dimensional (2 D) automatic IPT alignment mechanism, and 3) test automatic IPT alignment on a plausible mobile robot wireless charging scenario. The experimental <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> give a misalignment sensing resolution of 1 mm or less in two lateral directions, allowing automatic alignment control in real time with a maximum lateral positioning error of less than ? 2 mm. This precise alignment allows for efficient power transfer to occur. When implemented on the mobile robot platform, the automatic positioning system gives similar results, allowing the robot to position itself above a wireless charger precisely?a task the mobile robot cannot accomplish using its navigation camera alone. The results of this experiment give confidence that similar <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> can be used to reduce lateral misalignments in scaled IPT systems, such as electric-vehicle wireless chargers...|$|E

40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} material construction has been devised for <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> of {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) magnetometers that {{are subject to}} a combination of requirements peculiar to some advanced applications, notably including low-field magnetic resonance imaging for medical diagnosis. The requirements in question are the following: The <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> must be large enough (in some cases having dimensions of as much as tens of centimeters) to afford adequate sensitivity; The <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> must be made electrically superconductive to eliminate Johnson noise (thermally induced noise proportional to electrical resistance); and Although the <b>sensing</b> <b>coils</b> must be cooled to below their superconducting- transition temperatures with sufficient cooling power to overcome moderate ambient radiative heat leakage, they must not be immersed in cryogenic liquid baths. For a given superconducting sensing coil, this combination of requirements can be satisfied by providing a sufficiently thermally conductive link between the coil and a cold source. However, the superconducting coil material is not suitable as such a link because electrically superconductive materials are typically poor thermal conductors. The {{heterogeneous material}} construction makes it possible to solve both the electrical- and thermal-conductivity problems. The basic idea is to construct the coil as a skeleton made of a highly thermally conductive material (typically, annealed copper), then coat the skeleton with an electrically superconductive alloy (typically, a lead-tin solder) [see figure]. In operation, the copper skeleton provides the required thermally conductive connection to the cold source, while the electrically superconductive coating material shields against Johnson noise that originates in the copper skeleton...|$|E

Delamination sensing is carried out for composite laminated beam specimens, one with delamination and the other without any defect or damage. Actuation coil is used to induce stress in the magnetostrictive material, <b>sensing</b> <b>coil</b> is used for sensing to measure the induced open circuit voltage. Due to delamination, the stress produced in the magnetostrictive patch changes and that alters the magnetic flux through the <b>sensing</b> <b>coil.</b> This causes {{a change in the}} induced open circuit voltage across the <b>sensing</b> <b>coil.</b> The paper presents, the sensing of delamination in composite laminates using multiple magnetostrictive patches with horse-shoe type coil arrangement. The difference in the open circuit voltage with and without delamination is treated as delamination sensing voltage. For theoretical modeling, different models of the laminated composite beams with magnetostrictive sensors and actuators have been developed for the beams with and without delamination. Finite element analysis is carried out using NISA finite element software. Numerical values of open circuit voltage verses actuation current for both the experimental and computational studies are presented.

The resulting conductivity indicated that the tip of the shaped charge jet has a bulk temperature on the order of 1200 K. The experimental data were directly compared to temperature distributions generated by hydrocodes using both the Johnson-Cook and Steinberg-Guinan-Lund strength models.
