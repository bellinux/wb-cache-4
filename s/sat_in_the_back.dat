5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{row of the}} chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made {{a member of a}} special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E
25|$|Waight was {{assigned}} to 22 Squadron as an observer; he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat of a two-seated Bristol F.2 Fighter and manned the rear machine guns to ward off attacks from behind. On 10 July 1918, Waight scored his first victory while piloted by ace T. W. Martin; he drove down a German Pfalz D.III fighter over Lille.|$|E
25|$|Jugan {{was born}} in Glassport, Pennsylvania on October 16, 1957. He became {{interested}} in pro wrestling as a child after attending a live event at the McKeesport Palisades. Jugan later became a regular studio audience member on the famed Saturday night television program Studio Wrestling. Although the show was restricted to people over 18, Jugan was often sneaked in {{through the back door}} of the WIIC-TV studio by Bruno Sammartino's manager and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> row of the bleachers. Jugan was studying photography in school at the time and began taking pictures at the matches. An official ringside photographer during the final years of Studio Wrestling, he eventually started submitting photos and writing for various wrestling magazines and newsletters. He was also president of a fanclub for Luis Martinez.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{grinding}} of brakes. The car {{came to a}} standstill below. A woman, who <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat, raised her veil and looked upwards.|$|R
6000|$|They <b>sat</b> unnoticed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> pew, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom, and {{she watched}} the dirty, disorderly work of {{bricklayers}} and plasterers. Workmen in heavy boots walking grinding down the aisles, calling out in a vulgar accent: ...|$|R

25|$|The raiders' luck {{held and}} both the car and lorry were able to {{re-enter}} the Republic of Ireland without incident. At the Monaghan side of the border, {{a member of the}} Royal Ulster Constabulary gave the lorry the right of way and were able to drive the last 7 miles safely. The party split up at a dump in County Meath, upon meeting with IRA Chief of Staff Tony Magan, with some making their way back to Dublin by bus. Boyce and Joe Christie, another member of the raid, were to drive the lorry back to Dublin themselves. While Boyce <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the lorry, Christie climbed into the drivers' cabin and ordered the driver to divert from the pre-arranged route and onto the main roads. They eventually attracted the attention of a Garda police car on the outskirts of Dublin, having heard news of the Armagh raid, and attempted to block the road. Christie told the driver to ram the car but it was able {{to pull out of the}} way. The two men in the lorry were later taken into custody when returning it to its owner. They were questioned by police but were released partly due to lack of evidence, nothing save two revolvers were found in the truck, and the Irish government's embarrassment over the incident.|$|E
500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by {{the collar of his}} shirt while Biedron <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
2500|$|Police detectives {{later said}} it {{appeared}} Ferguson {{had been planning}} the shooting {{for more than a}} week. Chief Joseph Flynn of the Long Island Rail Road police said, [...] "This was the work of a deranged, maniacal person who {{for a variety of reasons}} decided to explode." [...] None of Ferguson's victims were black, although it was unclear whether any other black passengers were aboard the train. Ferguson showed no emotion as he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself. Upon seeing Ferguson, one of the victims became hysterical and shouted, [...] "How can he be sitting there so calm after everything he did?" ...|$|E
60|$|The words {{bit into}} Reist's heart. He <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> gloomy silence. From afar off {{he seemed to}} hear the battle-cry of his beloved soldiers, the thunder of hoofs, the {{flashing}} steel, {{the glory of the}} charge thrilled his blood. There was patriotism indeed--there, where the lances dripped red and the bullets flew. And he, Nicholas of Reist, <b>sat</b> skulking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> room of a doubtful café, safely out of harm's reach, talking treason with one who had ever been the foremost of his country's enemies.|$|R
60|$|Rollo and Carlos {{walked back}} and forth in front of these cages several times, looking at the animals. They admired the beauty and grace of the tigers and leopards, and the majestic dignity of the lions. There were a lion and a lioness {{together}} <b>in</b> one cage. <b>The</b> lioness was walking restlessly to and fro; while <b>the</b> lion <b>sat</b> crouched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> part of <b>the</b> cage, with an expression upon his countenance <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> lofty pride and majesty of his character, and the patience and submissiveness which pertained to his situation, were combined.|$|R
60|$|Sophy Gerard <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> little <b>back</b> room of Louise's house, {{which the}} latter called her den, but which she seldom entered. The little actress was looking very trim and neat {{in a simple}} blue-serge costume which fitted her to perfection, her hair very primly {{arranged}} and tied up with a bow. She had a pen in her mouth, there was a sheaf of bills before her, and an open housekeeping-book lay on her knee. She had been busy for the last half-hour making calculations, the result of which had brought a frown to her face.|$|R
2500|$|The pair {{put their}} {{carefully}} crafted plan in motion {{on the afternoon}} of May 21, 1924. Using an automobile that Leopold had rented under the name [...] "Morton D. Ballard", they offered Franks a ride as he walked home from school. The boy refused initially, since his destination was less than two blocks away; but Loeb persuaded him to enter the car to discuss a tennis racket that he had been using. The precise sequence of the events that followed remains in dispute, but a preponderance of opinion placed Leopold behind the wheel of the car, while Loeb <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat with the chisel. Loeb struck Franks, sitting in front of him in the passenger seat, several times in the head with the chisel, then dragged him into the back seat, where he was gagged and soon died.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the thirteenth}} day, [...] {{had become a}} young woman, and on that day she said to First Woman, [...] "Something unusual has passed through me." [...] First woman said, [...] "That is your first race, [...]" [...] They covered {{the floor of the}} hogan with blankets, and Changing Woman lay on them face down. First Man pulled her hair down, and shaped her face, and dressed her in {{beautiful}} goods, beads, bracelets, and earrings, and tied her hair with a strip of perfect buckskin. Then First Man and First Woman stepped outside the hogan and told [...] to run her first race around a cedar tree and return, from east to west, as the sun does. When she returned, they invited all the people to a sing over her in the hogan called , Changeable House, on the mountain called [...] four days later. A great crowd gathered in the evening of the fourth day. A sweet corn cake was made from different colored corn meal sweetened with yeast. The Night Chant was sung, and in the morning the men received some of the maiden's cake as a gift for their chants, and , Changing Woman <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the hogan as gifts were piled in front of her. In this way the First Race of every young woman should be celebrated.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Saturday 27 December 1997, just before 10.00 a.m., Wright was assassinated by INLA prisoners inside the Maze Prison. The {{operation}} was undertaken by three INLA volunteers – Christopher [...] "Crip" [...] McWilliams, John [...] "Sonny" [...] Glennon and John Kennaway – armed with two smuggled pistols, an PA63 semi-automatic and a [...]22 Derringer. He {{was shot in the}} forecourt outside H Block 6 as he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a prison van (alongside another LVF prisoner, Norman Green and one prison officer acting as escort) {{on his way to the}} visitor's complex where he had an arranged visit with his girlfriend, Eleanor Reilly. John Glennon had been pretending to paint a mural in the sterile area between A and B wings which placed him in a position to see and hear what happened in the forecourt. Upon hearing the announcement over the prison Tannoy system that Wright and Green had been called for their respective visits, Glennon gave a pre-arranged signal to his two waiting comrades. They moved into position at the A wing turnstile; Glennon ran into the canteen and he mounted a table situated beneath a window which gave him a clearer view of the block forecourt. When he saw Wright entering the van at 9.59 a.m. he gave a second pre-arranged signal, which was: [...] "Go, go, go".|$|E
60|$|Greatly distressed and perplexed at the unkind way she {{had been}} spoken to, Fan changed her dress and <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>back</b> room to do some work. After a while she heard a great noise as of {{furniture}} being dragged about, and presently Rosie came <b>in</b> with <b>the</b> separate pieces of her dismantled bed.|$|R
60|$|Gradually {{the events}} of the {{preceding}} night crept with silent blood-stained feet into his brain, and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair, came <b>back</b> to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still sitting there, too, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight now. How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.|$|R
6000|$|The men rowed gently, as if {{they enjoyed}} the sweet calm of early morning, and were unwilling to disturb the innumerable flocks of wild-fowl that chuckled among the reeds and sedges everywhere. Harold <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stern, leaning <b>back,</b> and only dipping the steering-oar lazily {{now and then to}} keep the canoe from running on the bank, or {{plunging}} into a forest of gigantic rushes. Disco, having resolved to solace himself with a whiff of his darling pipe, had resigned [...] "the helm" [...] to Jumbo, and laid himself in a position of comfort which admitted of his resting his head on <b>the</b> gunwale <b>in</b> such a manner that, out of the corners of his eyes, he could gaze down into the water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dave, don't {{let her out}} {{for more}} than fifty miles an hour," [...] remarked Sam Day, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the leading auto, {{between two of the}} young ladies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Cotton and {{her brother}} <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> parlor after school was over, and the young ladies were sent to bed. Mr. John was very deaf, and Miss Priscilla very near-sighted, two {{convenient}} afflictions for the girls on some occasions, but once they proved quite the reverse, as you shall hear.|$|E
60|$|At eleven {{they all}} {{drove out to}} the Old Farm Inn. Babbitt <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Doppelbrau's car with Louetta Swanson. Once he had timorously tried {{to make love to}} her. Now he did not try; he merely made love; and Louetta dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger Eddie was, and {{accepted}} Babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.|$|E
60|$|Two of the Indians {{took the}} bow, the third Indian and Isaac <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, <b>back</b> to back, and Crow knelt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stern. Once {{launched}} on that wild ride Isaac forgot his uneasiness and his bruises. The night was beautiful; {{he loved the}} water, and was not lacking in sentiment. He gave himself up to the charm of the silver moonlight, of the changing scenery, and the musical gurgle of the water. Had {{it not been for}} the cruel face of Crow, he could have imagined himself on one of those enchanted canoes in fairyland, of which he had read when a boy. Ever varying pictures presented themselves at the range, impelled by vigorous arms, flew over the shining bosom of <b>the</b> stream. Here, <b>in</b> a sharp bend, was a narrow place where the trees on each bank interlaced their branches and hid the moon, making a dark and dim retreat. Then came a short series of ripples, with merry, bouncing waves and foamy currents; below lay a long, smooth reach of water, deep and placid, mirroring the moon and the countless stars. Noiseless as a shadow the canoe glided down this stretch, the paddle dipping regularly, flashing brightly, and scattering diamond drops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear moonlight.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{business}} has he there? Ah, tell me that; what {{business has}} he there?" [...] said Robinson to himself, as he <b>sat</b> moodily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small <b>back</b> room upstairs. [...] "Ah, tell me that, what business has he here? Did not {{the old man}} promise {{that she should be}} mine? Is it for him that I have done all; for him that I have collected the eager crowd of purchasers that throng the hall of commerce below, which my taste has decorated? Or for her--? Have I done this for her,--the false one? But what recks it? She shall live to know that had she been constant to me she might have sat--almost upon a throne!" [...] And then he rushed again to his work, and with eager pen struck off those well-known lines about the house which some short time after ravished the ears of the metropolis.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} Thursday was changeable, damp, and gloomy; and {{the night}} threatened to be windy and unpleasant. Stockdale had gone away to Knollsea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, to be present at some commemoration service there, and on his return he was met by <b>the</b> attractive Lizzy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passage. Whether influenced by the tide of cheerfulness which had attended him that day, or by the drive through the open air, or whether from a natural disposition to let bygones alone, he {{allowed himself to be}} fascinated into forgetfulness of the greatcoat incident, and upon the whole passed a pleasant evening; not so much in her society as within sound of her voice, as she <b>sat</b> talking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> parlour to her mother, till the latter went to bed. Shortly after this Mrs. Newberry retired, and then Stockdale prepared to go upstairs himself. But before he left the room he remained standing by the dying embers awhile, thinking long of one thing and another; and was only aroused by the flickering of his candle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> socket as it suddenly declined and went out. Knowing that there were a tinder-box, matches, and another candle in his bedroom, he felt his way upstairs without a light. On reaching his chamber he laid his hand on every possible ledge and corner for the tinderbox, but {{for a long time in}} vain. Discovering it at length, Stockdale produced a spark, and was kindling the brimstone, when he fancied that he heard a movement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passage. He blew harder at the lint, the match flared up, and looking by aid of the blue light through the door, which had been standing open all this time, he was surprised to see a male figure vanishing round the top of the staircase with the evident intention of escaping unobserved. The personage wore the clothes which Lizzy had been brushing, and something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outline and gait suggested to the minister that the wearer was Lizzy herself.|$|R
60|$|After a {{very early}} breakfast next morning, Mrs Keswick set out upon her journey, driving the sorrel horse with much steadiness, intermingled with {{severity}} whenever he allowed himself {{to drop out of}} his usual jogging pace. Plez <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> part of the spring-wagon, and whenever the old lady saw an unusually large stone lying in the track of the road, she would stop, and make him get out and throw it to one side.|$|E
60|$|Tim Tangs was not happy. This {{scheme of}} {{emigration}} was dividing {{him from his}} father--for old Tangs would on no account leave Hintock--and {{had it not been}} for Suke's reputation and his own dignity, Tim would at the last moment have abandoned the project. As he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> part of the room he regarded her moodily, and the fire and the boxes. One thing he had particularly noticed this evening--she was very restless; fitful in her actions, unable to remain seated, and in a marked degree depressed.|$|E
6000|$|As {{concrete}} {{evidence of the}} Honourable Hilary Vane's importance, when he travelled he had only to withdraw from his hip-pocket a book in which many coloured cards were neatly inserted, an open-sesame which permitted him to sit without payment even in those wheeled palaces of luxury known as Pullman cars. Within {{the limits of the}} State he did not even have to open the book, but merely say, with a twinkle of his eyes to the conductor, [...] "Good morning, John," [...] and John would reply with a bow and a genial and usually witty remark, and point him out to a nobody who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the car. So far had Mr. Hilary Vane's talents carried him.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes--once {{or twice}} in a week--that lady visited <b>the</b> upper regions <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> child lived. She came like a vivified figure out of the Magasin des Modes--blandly smiling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most {{beautiful}} new clothes and little gloves and boots. Wonderful scarfs, laces, and jewels glittered about her. She had always a new bonnet on, and flowers bloomed perpetually in it, or else magnificent curling ostrich feathers, soft and snowy as camellias. She nodded twice or thrice patronizingly to the little boy, who {{looked up from his}} dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was painting. When she left the room, an odour of rose, or some other magical fragrance, lingered about the nursery. She was an unearthly being in his eyes, superior to his father--to all the world: to be worshipped and admired at a distance. To drive with that lady <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carriage was an awful rite: he <b>sat</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat and did not dare to speak: he gazed with all his eyes at the beautifully dressed Princess opposite to him. Gentlemen on splendid prancing horses came up and smiled and talked with her. How her eyes beamed upon all of them! Her hand used to quiver and wave gracefully as they passed. When he went out with her he had his new red dress on. His old brown holland was good enough when he stayed at home. Sometimes, when she was away, and Dolly his maid was making his bed, he came into his mother's room. It was as the abode of a fairy to him--a mystic chamber of splendour and delights. There <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wardrobe hung those wonderful robes--pink and blue and many-tinted. There was the jewel-case, silver-clasped, and the wondrous bronze hand on the dressing-table, glistening all over with a hundred rings. There was the cheval-glass, that miracle of art, in which he could just see his own wondering head and the reflection of Dolly (queerly distorted, and as if up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling), plumping and patting the pillows of the bed. Oh, thou poor lonely little benighted boy! Mother is the name for God <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lips and hearts of little children; and here was one who was worshipping a stone! ...|$|R
60|$|All {{night long}} Gudruda <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bride's seat. There she <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> silver summer midnight, looking on the slain who were strewn {{about the great}} hall. All night she <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bride's seat thinking--ever thinking.|$|R
30|$|Another {{resistance}} {{strategy was}} refusal. “I will not raise {{my hand in}} that stupid way,” Dasha told me. “And I will not move my seat; I like being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> It’s stupid.” Sadly, {{it became clear to}} me that despite the fact she had <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian track class for two years, over 50  % of <b>the</b> information spoken <b>in</b> Mongolian and in Chinese was unknown or unclear to her. Instead of trying to catch up or keep up with her peers, Dasha’s strategy was to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> corner and play with her phone, IPod, and/or IPAD using Russian. Unfortunately, her strategy of refusing to participate also undermined her chances for gaining much communicative competence in either Mongolian or Chinese.|$|R
60|$|Three days later, Lenore {{accompanied}} her {{father on the}} ride to the Bend country. She <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{seat of the car}} with Jake--an arrangement very gratifying to the cowboy, but received with ill-concealed displeasure by the driver, Nash. They had arranged to start at sunrise, and it became manifest that Nash had expected Lenore to sit beside him all during the long ride. It was her father, however, who took the front seat, and behind Nash's back he had slyly winked at Lenore, as if to compliment her on the evident success of their deep plot. Lenore, at the first opportunity that presented, shot Nash a warning glance which was sincere enough. Jake had begun to use keen eyes, and there was no telling what he might do.|$|E
6000|$|He {{found that}} Pete {{and the other}} young men {{considered}} the Bunch too austerely polite and the Carrie who merely kissed behind doors too embarrassingly monogamic. As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to the Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the Bunch off to [...] "times" [...] with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department stores and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to accompany them. There was a motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a grubby shrieking cash-girl from Parcher and Stein's. He sat beside her and worried. He was apparently expected to [...] "jolly her along," [...] but when she sang out, [...] "Hey, leggo, quit crushing me cootie-garage," [...] he did not quite know how to go on. They <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> room of a saloon, and Babbitt had a headache, was confused by their new slang looked at them benevolently, wanted to go home, and had a drink--a good many drinks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said just}} {{now that he}} saved me. He did save me; you shall hear how. One Sunday our regular clergyman at the Refuge {{was not able to}} officiate. His place was taken by a stranger, quite a young man. The matron told us the stranger's name was Julian Gray. I <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> row of seats, under the shadow of the gallery, where I could see him without his seeing me. His text was from the words, 'Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance. 'What happier women might have thought of his sermon I cannot say; there was not a dry eye among us at the Refuge. As for me, he touched my heart as no man has touched it before or since. The hard despair melted in me at the sound of his voice; the weary round of my life showed its nobler side again while he spoke. From that time I have {{accepted}} my hard lot, I have been a patient woman. I might have been something more, I might have been a happy woman, if I could have prevailed on myself to speak to Julian Gray." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, Thomas <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{front row}} {{and asked the}} first {{question}} during White House press conferences. However, according to Thomas in a 2006 Daily Show interview, this ended because she no longer represented a wire service. During the Bush administration, Thomas was moved to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> row during press conferences; She was called upon at briefings {{on a daily basis}} but no longer ended Presidential news conferences saying, [...] "Thank you, Mr. President."
