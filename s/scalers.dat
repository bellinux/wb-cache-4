500|$|The men who removed {{this rock}} were called [...] "high scalers". While {{suspended}} {{from the top of}} the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety. One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high <b>scalers</b> were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high <b>scalers</b> received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the [...] "Human Pendulum" [...] for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon. To protect themselves against falling objects, some high <b>scalers</b> took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called [...] "hard boiled hats" [...] (later [...] "hard hats") and strongly encouraged their use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scaler</b> {{finds himself}} in an {{parallel}} universe where he encounters another reptilian man named Leon, who <b>Scaler</b> notes as having the same name as his estranged father. Leon challenges <b>Scaler</b> to retrieve a lizard egg being incubated in a mysterious mechanism. When <b>Scaler</b> does so and returns the egg to Leon, he persuades Leon to let him help retrieve {{the rest of the}} eggs scattered in the multiverse. Leon grudgingly agrees, and reveals that <b>Scaler</b> can exchange Klokkies (balls of energy that <b>Scaler</b> obtains by killing hostile creatures) with his pet repadactyl Reppy (a large, six-eyed, flying, laser-shooting, manta-like creature) to improve <b>Scaler's</b> abilities, including sharper claws, camouflage, and the ability to discharge static electricity from his body. Leon also reveals that <b>Scaler</b> can obtain the ability to transform into other creatures by defeating enough of that creature. Among the transformations <b>Scaler</b> obtains during the game are Bakuldan (a demonic creature that can spawn bombs at will), Krock (a spiky creature that can curl into a ball and roll at high speeds), Doozum (a flying creature that can shoot sonic projectiles), Fruzard (a chicken-like creature that can shoot lasers) and Swoom (an amphibious penguin-like creature).|$|R

Looger and his subordinates discover that <b>Scaler</b> knows of their plot and kidnap him; the game opens with Bootcamp interrogating <b>Scaler</b> by electrocuting him.

500|$|By this time, Sands had {{extensive}} experience with electronics {{and was immediately}} thrust into the electronics group, which was tasked with making instruments for the whole laboratory, and whose head was Darol Froman. Within this group, his close collaborators were William Elmore, William Higinbotham, and Ernest Titterton. [...] Anybody who had an instrumentation problem {{would come to the}} group for help. As a result, Sands worked with Luis Alvarez, Robert Bacher, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Otto Frisch, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segrè, Robert Walker and Robert Wilson; many of these famous physicists played important roles in his later career. In particular, he formed a close relationship with Rossi, with whom he later decided to work on his post-war Ph.D. degree. Rossi was most interested in the group's nuclear electronics equipment: pulse counters and amplifiers, discriminators, and <b>scalers.</b> [...] In this area, Sands designed and patented a pulse height analyzer, and with Otto Frisch and Elmore, a pulse amplifier. [...] He also created electronics for more general purposes, such as precise temperature regulation, and control of electroplating operations.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the final}} result of {{ultrasonic}} <b>scalers</b> can be produced by using hand <b>scalers,</b> ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> are sometimes faster and less irritating to the client. Ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> do create aerosols which can spread pathogens when a client carries an infectious disease. Research differs on {{whether there is a}} difference in effectiveness between ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> and hand instruments. Of particular importance to dentists themselves is that the use of an ultrasonic scaler may reduce the risk of repetitive stress injury, because ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> require less pressure and repetition compared to hand <b>scalers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sonic and {{ultrasonic}} <b>scalers</b> are {{powered by}} a system that causes the tip to vibrate. Sonic <b>scalers</b> are {{powered by a}}n air-driven turbine. Ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> use either magnetostrictive or piezoelectric systems to create vibration. Magnetostrictive <b>scalers</b> use a stack of metal plates bonded to the tool tip. The stack is induced to vibrate by an external coil connected to an AC source. Ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> also include a liquid output or lavage, which aids in cooling the tool during use, as well as rinsing all the unwanted materials from the teeth and gum line. The lavage {{can also be used}} to deliver antimicrobial agents.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic <b>scalers,</b> {{also known}} as power <b>scalers,</b> are {{effective}} in removing calculus, stain, and plaque. These <b>scalers</b> are also useful for root planing, curettage, and surgical debridement. Not only is tenacious calculus and stain removed more effectively with ultrasonic <b>scalers</b> than with hand instrumentation alone, {{it is evident that}} the most satisfactory clinical results are when ultrasonics are used in adjunct to hand instrumentation. There are two types of ultrasonic scalers; piezoelectric and magnetostrictive. Oscillating material in both of these handpieces cause the tip of the scaler to vibrate at high speeds, between 18,000 and 50,000 Hz. The tip of each scaler uses a different vibration pattern for removal of calculus. The magnetostrictive power scaler vibration is elliptical, activating all sides of the tip, whereas the piezoelectric vibration is linear and is more active on {{the two sides of the}} tip.|$|E

In this study, an ultrasonic dental <b>scaler</b> tip produced by machining process was redesigned for the PIM process.

A PIM feedstock was made of SUS 316 L powder and a wax based binder. The filling balance in the mold was checked by a short shot test with LDPE and the PIM feedstock. Production capability of the PIM process for the dental <b>scaler</b> tip was examined with the mold.
