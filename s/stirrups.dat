5|$|Japanese lacquerware {{has a long}} history, {{back as far as}} the Jōmon period, {{because of}} {{decorative}} value and the quality as protective finish. Initially lacquer was used to enhance properties of utilitarian objects such as watertight drinking vessels, cooking and household goods. The oldest extant decorated item dates to the 6th century; in the medieval and early modern period lacquer was used in the manufacture of many products such as toiletry boxes, inkstone cases, eating utensils, plates, bowls, containers, furniture, saddles, <b>stirrups</b> or armour.|$|E
5|$|Stirrup: There are {{authors who}} {{point out that}} it is unclear whether the stirrup was invented by {{northern}} nomads or the sedentary Chinese. Liu Han (1961) credited the invention of the stirrup to nomadic invaders of northern China. Archaeologial evidence shows that horse riders in India had a small loop for a single toe to be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. However, the first true depiction of the stirrup is featured on a Jin Dynasty (265–420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single stirrup and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle <b>stirrups</b> for both feet comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. The first actual specimens of <b>stirrups</b> comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. The stirrup was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. By the 6th century, the use of the stirrup had spread as far west as the Byzantine Empire, where both the stirrup and Celtic horseshoe were adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when fighting. This {{may have led to}} greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without <b>stirrups.</b> In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.|$|E

50|$|Skirt or Jockey: {{piece of}} leather that {{goes over the}} <b>stirrup</b> bar, to help prevent the rider's leg from rubbing on the buckle of the <b>stirrup</b> leather (which is {{adjusted}} so it is right against the <b>stirrup</b> bar). It also helps to keep the buckle of the <b>stirrup</b> leather from unbuckling and sliding down. The skirt is small to allow {{easy access to the}} <b>stirrup</b> leather.|$|R
5000|$|One reason riders {{can become}} hung up {{is due to}} {{improper}} <b>stirrup</b> sizing. If the <b>stirrup</b> is too large, the foot can go through the <b>stirrup</b> opening and be caught. If the <b>stirrup</b> is too small, the foot can become trapped more easily as the foot cannot free itself. The main reason for a rider to become hung up in the irons {{is due to the}} 'closing door effect' of a lost <b>stirrup</b> trying to return to lie flat {{against the side of the}} horse. When the rider falls and the <b>stirrup</b> is free, it tends to return to its home position flat against the horse's side. As the <b>stirrup</b> returns to the horse, the opening for the foot gets smaller and smaller and can catch a falling rider's boot in that smaller opening.(see Fitting the <b>stirrup,</b> below). Proper <b>stirrup</b> placement, on the ball of the foot, instead of jammed [...] "home" [...] clear up to the arch, also lowers the risk of a rider being dragged.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological finds {{from the}} Carpathian Basin provide {{evidence}} of the crafts practiced by the Magyars. 10th-century warriors' graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads, spear-heads, <b>stirrups,</b> and snaffle bits made of iron show that blacksmiths had a pre-eminent role in the militarized Magyar society. Engraved or gilded sabres and sabretache platesoften decorated with precious stonesand golden or silver pectoral disks evidence {{the high levels of}} skills of Magyar gold- and silversmiths. Cemeteries in the Carpathian Basin also yielded scraps of canvas made of flax or hemp. The positioning of metal buttons in the graves shows the Magyars wore clothes that either opened down the front or were fastened at the neck. Ear-rings were the only accessories worn above the belt by Magyar warriors; jewelry on their upper bodies would have hindered them from firing arrows. In contrast, Magyar women wore head jewelry decorated with leaf-like pendants, ear-rings, decorated pectoral disks, and rings with gemstones.|$|E
5|$|Near the Ellipse, {{and within}} sight of the White House, the hearse halted and Reagan's body was {{transferred}} to a horse-drawn caisson for the procession down Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill. Nancy Reagan stepped out of her limousine to witness the body's transfer; she was met with a warm greeting, including applause. The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the caisson as it made its way to the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the caisson was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the <b>stirrups.</b> The caisson paused at 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, where 21 Air Force F-15's from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. Meanwhile, in the {{years prior to the}} war basic defence industries had been established in Australia for the production of uniforms, webbing, boots, small arms and explosives and ammunition. Despite this, the majority of the equipment initially issued came from British Army stocks until Australian production was able to be increased to meet the demand that resulted from rapid military expansion {{at the start of the}} war. These included such items as heliographs, water bottles, bits, <b>stirrups,</b> spurs and shovels, although saddlery and harnesses were provided by a local government manufacturer. Although Australia had a relatively limited industrial base during the war, it was ultimately able to supply the majority of the Army's more simple requirements; however, the remainder of the more complex equipment had to be purchased from suppliers in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|One reason riders {{can become}} hung up {{is due to}} {{improper}} <b>stirrup</b> sizing.

5|$|To their left, the Union Brigade {{suddenly}} {{swept through}} the infantry lines, giving rise to the legend {{that some of the}} 92nd Gordon Highland Regiment clung onto their <b>stirrups</b> and accompanied them into the charge. From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th Ligne. The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, 45th Ligne, as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry. The Greys captured the eagle of the 45th Ligne and overwhelmed Grenier's brigade. These would be the only two French eagles captured by the British during the battle. On Wellington's extreme left, Durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.|$|E
25|$|Some older works {{attribute}} the Gothic victory to overwhelming Gothic numbers, to Gothic cavalry, and sometimes to Gothic use of <b>stirrups.</b> More recent scholarly works mostly {{agree that the}} armies were similarly sized, that the Gothic infantry was more decisive than their cavalry, and that neither the Romans nor the Goths used <b>stirrups</b> until the 6th century. For many years Roman cavalry had used horned saddles which enabled riders to use the bow and lance. <b>Stirrups</b> first appear in Europe in the 6th century, probably brought by the Avars.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem is}} the {{effectiveness}} of shear reinforcement. FRP rebar <b>stirrups</b> formed by bending before hardening generally perform relatively poorly in comparison to steel <b>stirrups</b> or to structures with straight fibres. When strained, the zone between the straight and curved regions are subject to strong bending, shear, and longitudinal stresses. Special design techniques are necessary {{to deal with such}} problems.|$|E

2500|$|Poorly {{designed}} V-brakes {{can suffer}} from a sudden failure when the noodle end pulls through the metal <b>stirrup,</b> leaving the wheel with no braking power. [...] Although the noodle {{can be regarded as}} a service item and changed regularly, the hole in the <b>stirrup</b> may enlarge through wear. [...] The <b>stirrup</b> cannot normally be replaced, so good quality V-brakes use a durable metal for the <b>stirrup.</b>|$|R
25|$|Modern <b>stirrups</b> {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of styles, sizes and {{materials}} and are attached to most saddles by means of adjustable stirrup leathers, which can be altered in length to fit both the size of the rider and the need to remain over the horse's optimal center of balance for a given equestrianism discipline. There are safety concerns associated with the use of <b>stirrups,</b> including a risk that a fallen rider may get their foot caught in the stirrup and be dragged by the horse, or that long hours of use without rest may cause problems in the human foot's Peroneus Tertius tendon. <b>Stirrups</b> are safer to use when riding boots are worn, and proper sizing and placement of the foot on the stirrup increases both safety and usability.|$|E
25|$|The stirrup, {{which gives}} greater {{stability}} to a rider, {{has been described}} {{as one of the most}} significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by <b>stirrups</b> was less likely to fall off while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, <b>stirrups</b> provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry adversaries. Contrary to common modern belief, however, it has been asserted that <b>stirrups</b> actually did not enable the horseman to use a lance more effectively (cataphracts had used lances since antiquity), though the cantled saddle did.|$|E
25|$|Leathers and Flaps (English), or Fenders (Western): The leather straps {{connecting}} the <b>stirrups</b> to the saddle tree and leather flaps giving {{support to the}} rider's leg and protecting the rider from sweat.|$|E
50|$|Short <b>stirrup,</b> long <b>stirrup,</b> and green/novice rider: These {{classes are}} for the riders with less {{experience}} and or horses who can not jump quite as high. Short <b>stirrup</b> classes are usually for riders 12 and under, long <b>stirrup</b> classes are for those 13 and over, although age varies between shows. Fence heights in these divisions are usually 2. Green or novice rider divisions have courses set at 23"-26".|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} results, {{this study also}} investigates {{the relationship between the}} strain of the <b>stirrup</b> and the peak maximum shear crack for each shear-span to depth ratio. The yielding strain of the <b>stirrup</b> that corresponds to the peak maximum shear crack width is then regressed linearly. When the <b>stirrup</b> yields, the peak maximum shear crack width ranges from 0.93 to 1.22  mm, suggesting that the shear-span to depth ratio only slightly affects the relationship between the yielding strain of the <b>stirrup</b> and the peak maximum shear crack width. Additionally, when the peak maximum shear crack width is limited to 0.3  mm, the allowable strain of <b>stirrup</b> ranges from 0.25 to 0.33 times the yielding strain of the stirrup; when the peak maximum shear crack width is limited to 1.0  mm, the allowable strain of <b>stirrup</b> ranges from 0.82 to 1.09 times the yielding strain of the <b>stirrup.</b>|$|R
25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short <b>stirrup,</b> in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a tightrope walker balances the acrobat. Obviously, a <b>stirrup</b> leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a <b>stirrup</b> length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the <b>stirrup</b> until the rider feels they will not lose the <b>stirrup</b> is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the <b>stirrup</b> is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct <b>stirrup</b> length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|R
25|$|Double seat saddles {{have two}} pairs of <b>stirrups</b> and two deep padded seats for use when double-banking or riding double with a child behind an adult rider. The western variety has one horn {{on the front of}} the saddle.|$|E

25|$|Before a {{horse show}} or other competition, the rider should take extra care {{to clean the}} saddle and polish all metal parts, {{including}} the D-rings, <b>stirrups,</b> stirrup bars and nailheads on an English saddle; and the buckles, dees, and ornamental silver on a Western saddle.|$|E
5000|$|The risk {{of being}} dragged by a foot caught in the <b>stirrup</b> spawned an {{adaptation}} in riding footwear: Riding boots have a raised heel {{of at least a}} half-inch, and in special designs like the western cowboy boot, often more. This [...] "ridge" [...] created by the raised heel will usually catch {{on the bottom of the}} <b>stirrup,</b> preventing the foot from slipping through the <b>stirrup</b> and dragging the rider. Riding boots also have a smooth sole that can easily slide in and out of the <b>stirrup.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{cultures}} {{included the}} Chavin and the Moche. In these vessels the <b>stirrup</b> handle actually forms {{part of the}} spout, which emanates {{from the top of}} the <b>stirrup.</b> The jars, which were often elaborately figurative, would be cast from a mold, while the <b>stirrup</b> spout was built by hand and welded to the vessel with slip.|$|R
2500|$|In mid 2008, the Labour {{government}} of then Prime Minister Gordon Brown extended <b>Stirrup's</b> {{term of office}} until 2011, which effectively prevented the three individual Service chiefs of the time from competing for the UK's senior military position. On 14 July 2010, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox announced that General Sir David Richards, the then Chief of the General Staff, would succeed <b>Stirrup</b> as Chief of the Defence Staff in October 2010. Richards took over on 29 October 2010 and <b>Stirrup</b> was created a life peer as Baron <b>Stirrup,</b> of Marylebone in the City of Westminster. He was introduced into the House of Lords on 1 February 2011, where he sits as a crossbencher. [...] <b>Stirrup</b> officially retired from the RAF on 4 April 2011.

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{equipment}} {{on the horse}} included long-necked spurs which enabled the rider to control the horse with extended legs, a saddle with a high back to provide leverage during the charge or when hit, as well as <b>stirrups</b> for the necessary leverage to deliver blows with the lance (Tkačenko).|$|E
25|$|Long <b>stirrups</b> {{allow the}} rider {{to ride with}} a long leg, with the knee relaxed and only {{slightly}} bent, allowing a deep and stable seat in the saddle. When riding a long stirrup, the rider has excellent control of the horse and the greatest ability to feel and communicate with the horse via the riding aids. This provides a sturdy base for activities where precision is required or when the rider is {{at risk of being}} unseated. For both reasons, long <b>stirrups</b> were thus the choice of heavy cavalry such as the medieval knights, who fought in close quarters and used weapons such as the lance and long, heavy swords. Historically, this type of stirrup adjustment and the riding seat it produced was called la brida. Today it is the choice for dressage and many types of western riders.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} used by early roughriders {{consisted of a}} poley saddle or exercise pad, without <b>stirrups</b> or a crupper and a chest rein that ran from the girth to the rider's hand, leaving him without any control of the buckjumper's head. Bullock and bareback riders were still permitted to use two hands at this stage.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{important}} that the <b>stirrup</b> be the correct width for the boot. A <b>stirrup</b> that is too narrow will increase the chance that the boot will get caught in it (which would be very dangerous should the rider fall), and a too-wide <b>stirrup</b> makes it harder for a rider to keep it under the foot, and presents some risk that the foot might slip all the way through. It is generally suggested that the <b>stirrup</b> be no more than 1inch larger than the widest part of the sole of the rider's boots.|$|R
2500|$|During the Nara period, {{the base}} of the <b>stirrup</b> which {{supported}} the rider's sole was elongated past the toe cup. [...] This half-tongued style of <b>stirrup</b> (hanshita abumi) remained in use until the late Heian period when a new <b>stirrup</b> was developed. [...] The fukuro abumi or musashi abumi had a base that extended the full length of the rider's foot and the right and left sides of the toe cup were removed. [...] The open sides were designed to prevent the rider from catching a foot in the <b>stirrup</b> and being dragged.|$|R
