25|$|Abdul-Rauf {{was born}} in Gulfport, Mississippi, the son of Jacqueline Jackson. He {{was raised in a}} <b>single-parent</b> <b>family,</b> along with his two brothers, Omar and David. His {{childhood}} was characterized by poverty, as there were times that he and his brothers were not able to have proper nutrition. Abdul-Rauf missed the fourth grade and, later on, he was placed in special education classes. He suffered from a moderate form of Tourette syndrome, a condition that went undiagnosed until he was 17. Abdul-Rauf managed to overcome difficulties to become a basketball prodigy for Gulfport High School. In his senior season in high school he averaged 29.9 points and 5.7 assists per game and was called up to the McDonald's All-American Game. He was also named Mississippi Mr. Basketball twice, in 1987 and 1988.|$|E

Psychologist Steve Harriman covers the Krabs family dynamic in the 2005 Berkley Book Absorbing SpongeBob. He calls attention to the lack of explanation for the disparity between Pearl and Mr. Krabs' species, noting that it is only after watching several episodes that viewers realize the Krabs family is broken. He also questions the decision to focus on Patrick's family not Pearl's in the only episode dealing [...] "head-on with a core pathology of family""I'm with Stupid". In his review of the third season, Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict called Mr. Krabs and Pearl (as well as Krabs' girlfriend Mrs. Puff, whom he mistook for the character's wife) one of [...] "the most head-scratching family units [...] ever come across".|$|E
500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps we could do it with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a <b>single-parent</b> <b>family,</b> with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E
40|$|Survey data {{indicate}} that Americans have become increasingly accepting of <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> formed through divorce and non-marital childbearing since 1960 (Thornton 1989; Thornton and Young-DeMarco 2001; Pagnini and Rindfuss 1993). But knowledge of attitudes about <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> is limited {{in terms of both}} time period and detail. Most data series do not begin until after 1950 (Thornton 1995) and focus narrowly on measuring views of the demographic trends that have fueled the increase in <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> rather than on a broader set of attitudes about <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> or factors that might influence these attitudes. ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} social policy towards <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> in the Czech Republic with focus on alimony policy. I deal {{more closely with}} the {{standard}} of living by <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> and obligated parents. This problem is explored on the basis of theoretical framework called social construction of the target populations. Social policy towards <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> does not reflect their needs at the right time. Different approach could lead to improvement of their standard of living. The Czech society has not come with an agreement on reforming the social system to more benefit the <b>single-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Despite the fact that the concept of supporting <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> has been formally accepted by European Union and Czech government {{as one of the top}} priorities, this proclamation has not brought any real change to the single-parent families` standard of living. I try to understand a present situation/image of social policy towards <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> in regard to alimony policy with an application of theoretical framework social construction of the target population basis. For this purpose, I identify the real social construction of <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> and obligated parents in the political discourse.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether multisystemic therapy (MST) improved family relationships among youths with poorly controlled {{type 1 diabetes}} and whether these changes mediated MST effects on health outcomes. The moderating effect of family demographics on study outcomes was also assessed. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 127 youths. Changes in general family relationships and caregiver support for diabetes care from baseline to treatment completion were assessed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) {{was used to test}} whether changes in family relations mediated improvements in frequency of blood glucose testing (BGT) and metabolic control. Results MST increased support for diabetes care from both primary and secondary caregivers in two-parent but not in <b>single-parent</b> <b>families.</b> However, MST had the strongest effects on BGT and metabolic control in <b>single-parent</b> <b>families.</b> SEM did not support family relations as the mediator of improved BGT or metabolic control. Rather, MST had a direct effect on BGT for all participants. BGT mediated improvements in metabolic control among <b>single-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Conclusions MST improved family relationships for youths with diabetes in two-parent but not in <b>single-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Objective outcomes related to diabetes were strongest for <b>single-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Other processes such as increased parenta...|$|R

40|$|<b>Single-parent</b> <b>families</b> in the Czech Republic from census {{and sample}} surveys Abstract The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to comprehensively chart {{as much as possible}} what we can learn about <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> in the Czech Republic from all publicly available data sources, such as surveys and censuses. Incomplete families are viewed from a historical and the contemporary perspective and the expected development of a structure for the future is also shown. <b>Single-parent</b> <b>families</b> are a contemporary phenomenon because the number of dependent children in the incomplete families in the Czech republic has increased by almost a half in the last fifteen years. The thesis provides information about various data sources regarding <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> and it evaluates their use and comparability for the research. It also contains an analysis of the structure of families and households based on the population development and census data in the Czech Republic. The financial situation of <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> is examined in detail - their income expenditure, individual groups of cash expenditures. The thesis also focuses on the description of their apartment's facilities.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that pluralization of society and {{societal}} conditions {{have an impact on the}} modern family, its role and structure. Changes in the hierarchy of societal values and attitude of society towards family lead to significant changes in its structure and way of functioning. The image of the family consisting of father, mother and children has more often been replaced by the image of families with one parent and children. There are multiple causes of <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> (single parenthood) such as death, divorce, abandonment of the family by one of the parents, etc. The positions and attitude of society towards <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> is different and it‚Äôs actually depending on the cause of their occurrence.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the effects of}} family income and family structure on family resource allocation behavior. The results indicate that, with everything else held constant, families with higher income allocate {{a greater share of}} their resources to normal goods than do low-income families. With family income held constant, <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> allocate more of their expenditure to medical services and inferior goods, and allocate much less of their resources to normal goods. This expenditure behavior suggests that <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> have an economically disadvantaged status compared to two-parent families. On the other hand, these <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> have different preferences as well. Single-father families allocate more of their resources to adult goods such as drinking and tobacco while single-mother families devote more resources to family- and/or child-oriented goods such as education. This study makes a unique contribution not only by assessing the effects of family income on resource allocation behavior but also by providing a picture of how <b>single-parent</b> <b>families</b> and two-parent families allocate their resources in Taiwan.
