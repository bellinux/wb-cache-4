One strategy is <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy based on currency pricing formula; the other strategy is constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategy based on linear rule. Monte Carlo simulation {{is used to}} test the performance of the strategies. For <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy, the effect of changing initial wealth on saving performance and hedging performance is revealed. I find that increasing initial wealth can improve both saving performance and hedging performance of <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy. For CPPI strategy, extensive combinations of initial wealth cases and multiples are tested. I find that different multiples change the distribution pattern of CPPI strategy dramatically. In general, bigger multiples will reduce the hedging performance but as long as the multiple is smaller than 21, the floor level can always be protected. Because of effect of changing multiples on saving performance of CPPI is complicated, I propose saving premium at risk and minimum saving ratio to seek the optimal multiple for each initial wealth case. The performance comparisons between <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy and CPPI strategy show that CPPI strategy dominates the competitor in terms of hedging performance while <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy has better saving performance on average. I find that the CPPI strategy is more attractive to hedgers if foreign currency is expected to appreciate while the <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy is more attractive if foreign currency is expected to depreciate. I propose a method to improve the hedging performance of <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> option strategy and find that it cannot be used if initial wealth is not sufficient enough...|$|E

40|$|Current {{behavioral}} and neurophysiologic studies propose that many animals can detect and discriminate the invariant statistics found in natural vocalization (Geffen et. al., 2011; Rodriguez et al., 2010). However, according to current research the neuronal mechanisms underlying the sound discrimination process is still unclear. While numerous auditory statistics have been manipulated, none has varied the temporal and tonal frequency cues independently in their <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> sequences, {{thus it is}} still uncertain whether rats rely on temporal cues in the sound envelope for communication. The aim {{of this research is}} {{to determine whether or not}} rats rely on temporal cues in the sound envelope for call recognition and communication, as humans do similarly during speech perception. Studying the behavior and neural recordings related to sound and speech recognition can aid in the generating a biologically accurate computational model to further medical research of cortical response and pathways of sound and speech recognition...|$|E
40|$|Animals {{in groups}} often {{exchange}} calls, in patterns whose temporal structure {{may be influenced}} by contextual factors such as physical location and the social network structure of the group. We introduce a model-based analysis for temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taenopyggia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the next, and that "kernels" reflecting the temporal range of influence have a characteristic structure for a calling individual's effect on itself, its partner, and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of influences by call type as well as by individual...|$|E
40|$|Cane Toads (Rhinella marina) are {{invasive}} pests in {{many parts}} of the world, including the Japanese island of Ishigaki. Extensive research in Australia has identified promising new methods for control, but also has shown that toads exhibit geographic variation in many traits (suggesting that methods developed in one location may not work in another). Can the approaches developed in Australia play a useful role for controlling this invasive species in Japan? Our experimental trials on Ishigaki Island suggest that these new methods can be successfully applied to Japan. First, Cane Toad embryos exposed to chemical cues of conspecific tadpoles exhibited a reduction in viability (subsequent growth and development). This response appears to be species-specific, with native frog embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from toad tadpoles, and Cane Toad embryos not being affected by exposure to cues from native frog tadpoles. Second, Cane Toad tadpoles were attracted to traps containing water from conspecific eggs, and toxin from adult conspecifics. Third, adult Cane Toads were attracted to acoustic cues of calling males, with sex differences in rates of attraction to specific versions of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> (males were attracted to choruses whereas females were attracted to low-frequency calls). Our results suggest that the methods developed by Australian researchers are applicable to controlling invasive Cane Toads in Japan...|$|E

40|$|Thresholds for evoked vocal {{responses}} and thresholds of multiunit midbrain auditory responses to pure tones and synthetic calls were investigated in males of Pleurodema thaul, as behavioral thresholds well above auditory sensitivity {{have been reported}} for other anurans. Thresholds for evoked vocal responses to synthetic advertisement calls played back at increasing intensity averaged 43 dB RMS SPL (range 31 – 52 dB RMS SPL), measured at the subjects’ position. Number of pulses increased with stimulus intensities, reaching a plateau at about 18 – 39 dB above threshold and decreased at higher intensities. Latency to call followed inverse trends relative to number of pulses. Neural audiograms yielded an average best threshold in the high frequency range of 46. 6 dB RMS SPL (range 41 – 51 dB RMS SPL) and a center frequency of 1. 9 kHz (range 1. 7 – 2. 6 kHz). Auditory thresholds for a <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> having a carrier frequency of 2. 1 kHz averaged 44 dB RMS SPL (range 39 – 47 dB RMS SPL). The similarity between thresholds for advertisement calling and auditory thresholds for the advertisement call indicates that male P. thaul use {{the full extent of}} their auditory sensitivity in acoustic interactions, likely an evolutionary adaptation allowing chorusing activity in low-density aggregations.

40|$|Gravid {{females of}} Alytes obsUtriams and Alytes dstemasU were tested with {{synthetic}} calls in seven-speaker playback tests. A first, "mean-centered " test presented call * with frequencies representing {{an array of}} different calls spanning over {{the range of the}} population (± 2. 25 SD). In this test, females of both species approached a <b>synthetic</b> <b>call</b> that was lower than the average call frequency of the male population although the difference was significant only for A. obstetricans. The regression between female weight and size and preferred frequency was not significant in either species. These results confirm the reported trends of females preferring lower frequency calls (corresponding to larger males) based on two-speaker playback tests for A. obsUtricans. For A. cisternasii, the lack of significance of the seven-speaker test suggests that the preference trend previously found in two-speaker tests may be obscured in more complex acoustical environments. A second "supernormal stimulus " test presented females with calls ranging from the lowest frequency values of the male population (- 2. 25 SD) and lower, up to — 6. 75 SD beyond the range. In both species females preferentially approached calls higher than the mean frequency of the stimulus presented. This result suggests that in both cases selection for low frequencies is not open ended, and that the preferred frequency is within the range of the male population.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISISexual {{selection}} {{is one of}} the main evolutionary forces that drive signal evolution. In previous studies, we have found out that males of Pleurodema thaul, a frog with an extensive latitudinal distribution in Chile, emits advertisement calls that show remarkable variation among populations. In addition, this variation is related to intense inter-male acoustic competition (intra-sexual selection) occurring within each population. However, the extent to which female preferences contribute to the signal divergence observed is unclear. To study the responsiveness of females in each population, we stimulated females with <b>synthetic</b> <b>calls</b> designed with the acoustic structure of their own population and subsequently responsive females were subjected to a two-choice experiment, where they were stimulated with <b>synthetic</b> <b>calls</b> of their own population versus a call of a foreign population. Females do not show phonotactic preferences for calls of their own or foreign populations as measured with both linear and circular variables. The lack of phonotactic preferences suggests an absence of participation of inter-sexual selection processes in the divergence of the acoustic signals of P. thaul, highlighting the importance of intra-sexual selection for the evolution of these signals. These results concur with studies in other vertebrates emphasizing the relevance of interactions among males for the evolution of acoustic communication systems.

40|$|The vocal {{repertoire}} of mallard ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos, consists {{of only two}} call types, {{both of which are}} made up of trains of repeated notes. Recognition of separation- induced distress calls is known to depend on {{the degree to which a}} number of acoustic features match species-typical values. The present study extends these findings by examining the importance of spectral characteristics for recognition of contentment calls. Measurements were made of the dominant frequency at the temporal mid-point of contentment notes, generating estimates of the population mean and variance for this feature. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>calls</b> were then generated that either matched the mean dominant frequency, or differed from it in increments of two standard deviations. Ducklings received repeated computer-controlled playback presentations of one of these sounds, or of a control natural call. Stimuli were timed to occur just as the ducklings began a distress call, and the duration of the vocal inhibition elicited was used as an assay of call recognition. Ducklings were reliably less responsive to <b>synthetic</b> <b>calls</b> that had frequency characteristics which differed from the population mean by more than two standard deviations and were hence improbable in natural calls. Comparisons with song playback experiments suggest that such 'probability-based' recognition of conspecific acoustic signals may be a common perceptual process in birds. The effects of increasing and decreasing dominant frequency were similar, implying that processing of spectral information is based on absolute, rather than relative, frequency characteristics. 12 page(s...|$|R
50|$|An {{experiment}} {{conducted by}} Anthony Arak, where playback of <b>synthetic</b> <b>calls</b> from male natterjack toads {{was used to}} manipulate behavior of the males in a chorus, the difference between strategies and tactics is clear. While small and immature, male natterjack toads adopted a satellite tactic to parasitize larger males. Though large males on average still retained greater reproductive success, smaller males were able to intercept matings. When the large males of the chorus were removed, smaller males adopted a calling behavior, no longer competing against the loud calls of larger males. When smaller males got larger and their calls more competitive, then they started calling and competing directly for mates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Males of the quacking frog Crinia georgiana produce calls {{consisting}} of 1 – 11 notes. Playback experi-ments using <b>synthetic</b> <b>calls</b> showed that males tend {{to match the}} number of notes in 2 -note and 4 -note stimuli; however, males tended to produce more than 1 note {{in response to a}} 1 -note stimulus and fewer than 8 notes in response to an 8 -note stimulus. Successive playbacks of two, 4 -note calls from separate speakers indicate that males are likely to match the combined number of notes in the calls of two neighbors, even if they are not equi-distant from the focal male. The results are compared with the few other studies of matching in anurans, and interpreted in terms of hypotheses developed to explain matching in songbirds. One attractive and testable hy-pothesis for call matching in C. georgiana is that males are attempting to produce calls that are at least as attrac-tive to females as those of rivals, without wasting ener-gy...|$|R
40|$|Male {{and female}} African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis) produce calls {{and engage in}} dueting in both silt-filled ponds and {{laboratory}} aquaria. Previous research has established that males produce different answer calls in response to receptive (11 - 12 Hz click rate) and nonreceptive (click rate of 4 Hz) female calls. In the present study, in addition to male answer calls, male phonotropism behaviors were measured {{for the first time}} during playbacks of natural female rapping and ticking calls as well as synthetic stimuli consisting of ticking calls with 90 -msec interclick intervals (ICIs) and rapping calls with 250 -msec ICIs. Also, the results show that males approach a loudspeaker significantly more often in response to rapping calls and remain longer in the proximity of the speaker. Moreover, males produce answer calls more frequently in response to female rapping calls and produce few answer calls in response to female ticking <b>calls.</b> <b>Synthetic</b> ticking <b>calls</b> with 90 -msec ICIs evoked an intermediate phonotaxis response, whereas <b>synthetic</b> rapping <b>calls</b> with 250 -msec ICIs evoked the same level of phonotaxy as do natural ticking calls.
