40|$|We examine {{central bank}} {{intervention}} in foreign exchange markets using a dynamic censored regression model. We allow {{the amount of}} purchase and <b>sale</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> depend nonlinearly upon lagged values of intervention and on measures of disorderly foreign exchange markets. Using data for the CBRT, we find persistence in interventions, which may suggest the presence of political costs and/or a signal of future monetary policy. We find strong evidence of nonnormality and heteroskedasticity in the Tobit model of the reaction function. Results using a robust estimator reveal the importance of considering these specification issues when modeling central bank intervention.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{an active}} enforcement program to increase retailers' {{compliance with the}} law prohibiting tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> minors. METHODS: Tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> minors were monitored in 319 outlets in 6 pairs of communities in Erie County, New York. One community in each pair was randomly assigned <b>to</b> an enforcement <b>intervention.</b> RESULTS: Retailers' compliance with the law increased from 35 % in 1994 to 73 % in 1995. However, the change in compliance rates was roughly the same for stores in the enforcement and nonenforcement communities. CONCLUSIONS: Active compliance checking of retail outlets as a strategy to reduce illegal tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> minors may only be necessary insofar as it contributes {{to an increase in}} retailers' perception that the threat of enforcement is real...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The primary {{goals of}} this study were to assess the {{propensity}} for alcohol <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> underage customers and obviously intoxicated customers at community festivals, and to assess the prevalence of alcohol control policies at these events. A secondary goal was to identify server and festival characteristics and festival policies related to the likelihood of illegal alcohol sales. METHODS: We conducted pseudo-underage purchase attempts at 43 festivals and pseudo-intoxicated purchase attempts at 50 festivals to assess the likelihood of illegal sales. Research staff made observations at festivals and contacted festival planners by telephone following each event to assess which alcohol policies were implemented. We conducted backwards stepwise multivariate analyses for each purchase attempt outcome to identify policies and characteristics related to likelihood of illegal alcohol sales. RESULTS: Pseudo-intoxicated buyers purchased beer in 89 % of 95 attempts (standard deviation [SD]= 0. 31) and pseudo-underage buyers were able to purchase beer in 50 % of 82 attempts (SD= 0. 50). All festival planners reported having {{at least two of the}} 10 alcohol policies we assessed, but no festival had implemented all 10 policies. Server characteristics were not related to either purchase attempt outcome. In the multivariate analyses, having more alcohol control policies was related to a greater likelihood of illegal <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> intoxicated customers; however, having more alcohol control policies was associated with a lesser likelihood of alcohol <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> underage customers. Restricting the number of servings per person was also associated with a lesser likelihood of alcohol <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> underage customers. CONCLUSIONS: Propensity for illegal alcohol sales at festivals is very high. Research is needed <b>to</b> identify <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent illegal alcohol sales at these events...|$|R
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} Single‐group interrupted {{time series analysis}} (ITSA) is a popular evaluation methodology in which a single unit of observation is studied; the outcome variable is serially ordered as a time series, and the <b>intervention</b> is expected <b>to</b> “interrupt” the level and/or trend of the time series, subsequent to its introduction. The most common threat to validity is history—the possibility that some other event caused the observed effect in the time series. Although history limits the ability to draw causal inferences from single ITSA models, it can be controlled for by using a comparable control group {{to serve as the}} counterfactual. Method Time series data from 2 natural experiments (effect of Florida's 2000 repeal of its motorcycle helmet law on motorcycle fatalities and California's 1988 Proposition 99 <b>to</b> reduce cigarette <b>sales)</b> are used <b>to</b> illustrate how history biases results of single‐group ITSA results—as opposed to when that group's results are contrasted to those of a comparable control group. Results In the first example, an external event occurring {{at the same time as}} the helmet repeal appeared to be the cause of a rise in motorcycle deaths, but was only revealed when Florida was contrasted with comparable control states. Conversely, in the second example, a decreasing trend in cigarette <b>sales</b> prior <b>to</b> the <b>intervention</b> raised question about a treatment effect attributed to Proposition 99, but was reinforced when California was contrasted with comparable control states. Conclusions Results of single‐group ITSA should be considered preliminary, and interpreted with caution, until a more robust study design can be implemented...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{analysis of}} demand in eight major OECD wool-consuming countries {{is used to}} provide up-to-date estimates of price elasticities of demand for wool.

The computed ex ante prices are used in a dynamic simulation to estimate demand and, hence, revenue from wool <b>sales</b> <b>to</b> the eight countries {{in the absence of}} reserve price operations in Australia. Based on the preferred semi-log demand curve, the variability of wool prices is estimated to have been reduced by 44 per cent, due <b>to</b> Australian <b>intervention</b> in the market up to 1977 / 78.
