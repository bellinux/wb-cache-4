40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership within Australian local councils. Data from 177 local council employees indicated significant positive effects of some <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership on performance outcomes. Furthermore, some <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership moderated the effects of transactional leadership behaviours on performance outcomes, whereas another subcomponent of <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership moderated the effects of social processes of leadership on performance outcomes. In addition, some <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership partially mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and performance outcomes. Theoretical and managerial implications following on from this study are discussed.

We use a random sampling technique to define a sample of 416 PhD faculty members of institutions of higher education who are on the list of Higher Education Commission (HEC) -approved PhD supervisors. Using structural equation modelling, we find that leadership styles and <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership have significant effects on followers' outcomes and that some of the <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership also significantly moderate the relationship between leadership styles and followers' outcomes {{in a manner consistent with}} the <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership proposition.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore {{alternative}} models of <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership. These alternative models are a leadership-only model, <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> the leadership-only model and <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> the leadership-mediated-effects model. Design/methodology/approach: Four occupational groups were targeted, namely, PhD faculty of institutions of higher education, medical doctors who work in district headquarters’ hospitals, licensed pharmacists and certified engineers. Also, a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, and 523 usable responses were received. Findings: Partial least square path modeling was used for data analysis, and the results of structural models revealed that: the dimensions of transformational leadership significantly affected the followers’ outcomes; a few <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership also significantly affected the followers’ outcomes; and, in some cases, <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership significantly mediated the relationship between dimensions of transformational leadership and followers’ outcomes. Practical implications: Findings of the study provide useful implications to improve the managerial practices of organizational leaders, work design strategies in organizations and overall organizational policies for effective functioning. Other developing countries with similar socio-economic status may use these findings to improve organizational functioning. Originality/value: This study makes important contributions to the leadership literature. It tests three alternative models in the domain of <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> the leadership theory and tests the separate effects of dimensions of transformational leadership and <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership on followers’ work outcomes. Further, it specifies the mediating effects of <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership on the dimensions of transformational leadership and followers’ work outcomes. Most important, this study for the first time tests transformational leadership and <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> leadership concepts in Pakistani work settings and advances the theoretical and empirical literature in this local context...|$|R

40|$|Bear bile {{has been}} a {{well-known}} Chinese medicine for thousands of years.

Accumulating research evidence has indicated that these potential <b>substitutes</b> <b>for</b> bear bile have displayed the same therapeutic effects as bear bile.
