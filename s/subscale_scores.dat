Considering that the length of hospital stay (LOS) has {{a significant effect on}} the total healthcare cost, determining whether the CARE-C scores could predict the LOS of PAC patients is of great interest to the PAC providers. This prospective trial included PAC patients with stroke or central nervous system injuries. The demographic data and CARE-C scores were collected after admission and before discharge. A multivariable stepwise linear regression model was used to identify the predictors of the LOS using age, sex, tube placement status, CARE-C component scores at admission, and score differences between admission and discharge as independent variables. This study included 178 patients (66 women and 112 men), {{with a mean age of}} 61. 9 ± 15. 6 years.

A questionnaire, on a SCL- 3 scale developed as a pilot study, was administered to 354 male and female students and 382 expectant and nursing mothers between April and July of 1988. The relationships between the change of SCl. - 4 scores and exercise or sport clubs in high school and college were analyzed on 117 male and 83 female students, and the effects of stress reduction following exercise were suggested. The results were summarized as follows: 1. By using factor analysis, nine factors can be named: persistence, lack of concentration and emotional confusion as mental stress, fatigue, sleep disorder, waking up disorder and muscle tension as physical stress. and anti-social behavior and tension toward others as social stress were extracted. A SCL- 4 scale consisting of 49 items was developed. 2. Although there was no significant difference between male and female students on the SCL total score, their stress levels were significantly lower than that of expectant and nursing mothers. Significantly lower scores were found in physical stress : fatigue, sleep disorder, muscle tension, and emotional confusion, in students. Tension toward others as social stress for students, therefore, was higher than that of expectant and nursing mothers. 3.

40|$|Background: As {{medication}} {{does not}} normalize outcomes {{of children with}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), especially in real-life functioning, nonpharmacological methods are important to target this field. This randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effects of a comprehensive executive skill training program for school-aged children with ADHD in a relatively large sample. Methods: The children (aged 6 – 12 years) with ADHD were randomized to the intervention or waitlist groups. A healthy control group was composed of gender- and age-matched healthy children. The intervention group received a 12 -session training program for multiple executive skills. Executive function (EF), ADHD symptoms, and social functioning in the intervention and waitlist groups were evaluated at baseline {{and the end of the}} final training session. The healthy controls (HCs) were only assessed once at baseline. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to compare EF, ADHD symptoms, and social function between intervention and waitlist groups. Results: Thirty-eight children with ADHD in intervention group, 30 in waitlist group, and 23 healthy children in healthy control group were included in final analysis. At posttreatment, intervention group showed significantly lower Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) total score (135. 89 ± 16. 80 vs. 146. 09 ± 23. 92, P= 0. 04) and monitoring score (18. 05 ± 2. 67 vs. 19. 77 ± 3. 10, P= 0. 02), ADHD-IV overall score (41. 11 ± 7. 48 vs. 47. 20 ± 8. 47, P< 0. 01), hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) <b>subscale</b> <b>score</b> (18. 92 ± 5. 09 vs. 21. 93 ± 4. 93, P= 0. 02), and inattentive <b>subscale</b> <b>score</b> (22. 18 ± 3. 56 vs. 25. 27 ± 5. 06, P< 0. 01), compared with the waitlist group. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed significant interactions between time and group on the BRIEF inhibition subscale (F = 5. 06, P= 0. 03), working memory (F = 4. 48, P= 0. 04), ADHD-IV overall score (F = 21. 72, P< 0. 01), HI <b>subscale</b> <b>score</b> (F = 19. 08, P< 0. 01), and inattentive <b>subscale</b> <b>score</b> (F = 12. 40, P< 0. 01).
