A Fast Fourier Transform algorithm was applied to the pre-processed images, and the transformation results were condensed into 33 feature signatures representing position or orientation invariant morphological features.

25|$|Microbial corrosion, or {{commonly}} known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and non-metallic materials, in {{the presence or absence}} of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide <b>stress</b> <b>cracking.</b> In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion. Concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products, leading to localized corrosion.|$|E
40|$|One {{aspect of}} {{licensing}} the high-level nuclear waste repository {{to be located}} at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is {{the determination of the}} inclusion of the effects of features, events, and processes (FEPs) on the performance of the repository. Among the FEPs evaluated are the advection of solids and liquids through <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> in waste packages and drip shields. The presence of one or more cracks or other small openings of sufficient size in a waste package or drip shield may provide a pathway for the advective flow of water (e. g., thin films or droplets) or solid material through a waste package or drip shield. The resulting flux may affect drip shield performance and/or subsequent dripping onto or into the waste packages. The objective of this set of tests involved the detection/non-detection of advective water flow through <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> similar to those that may occur in the drip shield or waste package. If sufficient flow volume was present then attempts were made to quantify the volume of water flow through a <b>stress</b> <b>crack.</b> Literature was reviewed to identify previous studies and models that may be relevant to the current study of flow through <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> in a drip shield or waste package. Although no studies could be found that were directly applicable to our current problem, studies were identified that investigated portions of the overall problem. The papers that were reviewed were organized into the following categories: (1) maximum static head in a crack; (2) liquid impingement on surfaces [1]; (3) leakage through <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> [2]; and (4) dripping from cracks and fractures [3]. Because of the unique configuration and processes associated with the current problem of flow through <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> in drip shields and waste packages, experimental studies are needed to better understand whether flow can occur in <b>stress</b> <b>cracks</b> from impinging water droplets...|$|R
50|$|Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics yields {{reliable}} {{results in}} the field of ductile materials like steel. Most of the experiments and theories in fracture mechanics are formulated taking ductile materials as object of interest. But if we compare the salient features in LEFM with results derived from the testing of concrete, we may find it irrelevant and sometimes trivial. For example, LEFM permits infinite <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip. This makes no sense in real analysis of concrete where the <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip is fixed. And LEFM fails to calculate <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip precisely. So we need some other ways to find out what is <b>stress</b> at <b>crack</b> tip and distribution <b>stress</b> near <b>crack</b> tip.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> of pipeline steels. The similarities, the differences and the influencing factors are considered for the high pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> caused by a concentrated bicarbonate-carbonate solution, and for the low pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> due to a diluter solution. For high pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking,</b> it is well accepted that the mechanism involves anodic dissolution for crack initiation and propagation. In contrast, {{it has been suggested}} that the low pH <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking</b> is associated with the dissolution of the crack tip and sides, accompanied by the ingress of hydrogen into the pipeline steel. But the precise influence of hydrogen on the mechanism needs to be further studied. (C) 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance and environmental <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E

40|$|The <b>stress</b> {{corrosion}} <b>crack</b> {{is one of}} {{the fracture}} phenomena for the major structure components in nuclear power plant. During the operation of a power plant, <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> are initiated and grown especially in dissimilar weldment of primary loop components. In particular, <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> usually occurs when the following three factors exist at the same time: susceptible material, corrosive environment, and tensile stress (residual stress included). Thus, residual stress becomes a critical factor for <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> when it is difficult to improve the material corrosivity of the components and their environment under operating conditions. In this study, <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracks</b> were artificially produced on STS 304 pipe itself by control of welding residual stress. We used the instrumented indentation technique and 3 D FEM analysis (using ANSYS 12) to evaluate the residual stress values in the GTAW area. We used the custom-made device for fabricating the <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>crack</b> in the inner STS 304 pipe wall.

25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and <b>stress</b> <b>crack</b> resistance.
