5000|$|In {{addition}} to methodological issues {{presented by the}} selection of a basket of goods, PPP estimates can also vary based on the <b>statistical</b> <b>capacity</b> of participating countries. The International Comparison Program, which PPP estimates are based on, require the disaggregation of national accounts into production, expenditure or (in some cases) income, and not all participating countries routinely disaggregate their data into such categories. Some aspects of PPP comparison are theoretically impossible or unclear. For example, there is no basis for comparison between the Ethiopian laborer who lives on teff with the Thai laborer who lives on rice, because teff is not commercially available in Thailand and rice is not in Ethiopia, so the price of rice in Ethiopia or teff in Thailand cannot be determined. As a general rule, the more similar the price structure between countries, the more valid the PPP comparison. PPP levels will also vary based on the formula used to calculate price matrices. Different possible formulas include GEKS-Fisher, Geary-Khamis, IDB, and the superlative method. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Linking regions presents another methodological difficulty. In the 2005 ICP round, regions were compared by using a list of some 1,000 identical items for which a price could be found for 18 countries, selected so that at least two countries would be in each region. While this was superior to earlier [...] "bridging" [...] methods, which do not fully take into account differing quality between goods, it may serve to overstate the PPP basis of poorer countries, because the price indexing on which PPP is based will assign to poorer countries the greater weight of goods consumed in greater shares in richer countries.|$|E

Absence of reliable data for births, deaths, and {{causes of death}} are {{at the root of}} this scandal of invisibility, which renders most of the world’s poor as unseen, uncountable, and hence uncounted. This situation has arisen because, in some countries, civil registration systems that log crucial statistics have stagnated over the past 30 years. Net of debt relief, official development assistance reached US$ 80 billion in 2004. Yet because of the weakness in recording vital statistics, we have little authoritative evidence that these funds have their desired effects on either mortality or poverty reduction. Sound recording of vital statistics and cause of death data are public goods that enable progress towards Millennium Development Goals and other development objectives that need to be measured, not only modelled. Vital statistics are most effectively generated by comprehensive civil registration. Civil registration has a dual function, both statistical and legal; it also helps with economic development. 30 years of stagnation will not be overcome quickly, although new efforts to develop national <b>statistical</b> <b>capacities</b> offer a unique opportunity to refocus attention on civil registration.

Although used for indexation of salaries, pensions, and social welfare benefits, but also as an approximation of the general inflation rate, there are several unresolved methodological issues associated with CPI’s calculation. Apart from the choice among two alternative concepts, the challenge of how to include owner-occupied housing (OOH) in CPI has also not been adequately resolved yet. Analysis in the article is based on Slovenian data. The results show that accuracy of the CPI significantly improves if it is calculated using one of the superlative and symmetric formulas, and that it makes sense to include OOH in CPI using the total acquisitions approach. The analysis further indicates that the choice of the index formula for calculating CPI has a much greater impact on the CPI value than inclusion of OOH.

In providing {{a more detailed}} structuring {{of the economy and}} integrating a correspondingly more relevant system of basic, producer and purchasers' prices by commodities and industry sectors, it helped lay to rest the early schism that developed between Keynes and Tinbergen over the question of the legitimacy of empirical economic modeling. The system was readily embraced by the advanced countries of Western Europe because it responded directly to the contemporary political imperatives of development planning and the need for economic forecasting models. But {{a large part of the}} non-Western "free world" encountered almost insurmountable difficulties in the full implementation of the system and became quickly bogged down in the quagmire of inter-industry statistics and valuation problems. Nancy and Richard Ruggles pressed for a revision providing workable solutions that would make the system more adaptable to the policy needs and <b>statistical</b> <b>capacities</b> of the majority of UN member countries. What actually happened took very much longer to reach fruition than was ever intended. The SNA 93 now represents the "gold standard" for national accounts, covering every aspect of economic activity. It is a masterpiece of conceptual coherence. Its encyclopedic character allows analysts and practitioners alike to dip into its voluminous pages for reasoned answers to why certain valuation questions and estimation procedures should be dealt with in a particular way. But SNA 93 remains a formidable document and it is not the operational data friendly framework that the Ruggles initially had envisaged. Copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

It contains basic information upon which the Commission relies in its discussions on the activities undertaken by ESCWA for strengthening the <b>statistical</b> <b>capacities</b> of member countries. The document {{highlights the importance of}} applying the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics that were issued by the United Nations in 1994, and of implementing the Declaration on Professional Ethics for Statisticians that was issued by the International Statistical Institute in 1985, as one of the conditions necessary for developing statistical systems that are consistent with international trends and that enjoy the confidence of the public. The report illustrates the link between the ten Fundamental Principles and their interdependency, and specifically explains that the professional independence of statistical offices constitutes the cornerstone of such principles. Despite the significant measures that have been taken by ESCWA member countries regarding the independence of national statistical offices, those offices continue to be in need of further legislative measures and regulations that clearly guarantee their professional independence, particularly with respect to defining scientific methodologies, the content of the outputs of statistical systems and the methods and timeliness of the dissemination of official statistics.

40|$|As {{transistor}} {{dimensions of}} Static Random AccessMemory (SRAM) become smaller {{with each new}} technology generation, they become increasingly susceptible to statistical variations in their parameters. These statistical variations can result in failing memory. SRAM {{is used as a}} building block for the construction of large Integrated Circuits (IC). To ensure SRAM does not degrade the yield (fraction of functional devices) of ICs, very low failure probabilities of Pfail = 10 - 10 are strived for. For instance in SRAMmemory design one aims to get a 0. 1 % yield loss for 10 Mbit memory, which means that 1 in 10 billion cells fails (Pfail = 10 - 10; this corresponds with an occurrence of - 6. 4 s when dealing with a normal distribution). To simulate such probabilities, traditional Monte-Carlo simulations are not sufficient and more advanced techniques are required. Importance Sampling is a technique that is relatively easy to implement and provides sufficiently accurate results. Importance sampling is a well known technique in statistics to estimate the occurrences of rare events. Rare or extreme events can be associated with dramatic costs, like in finance or because of reasons of safety in environment (dikes, power plants). Recently this technique also received new attention in circuit design. Importance sampling tunes Monte Carlo to the area in parameter space from where the rare events are generated. By this a speed up of several orders can be achieved when compared to standard Monte Carlo methods. We describe the underlying mathematics. Experiments reveal the intrinsic power of the method.
