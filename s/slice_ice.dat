40|$|Late Devensian/Midlandian glacial {{deposits}} on {{the southeast}} Irish coast contain {{a record of}} sedimentation {{at the margins of}} the Irish Sea ice stream (ISIS). Exposures through the Screen Hills reveal a stratigraphy that documents the initial onshore flow of the ISIS ('Irish Sea Till') followed by ice stream recession and readvances that constructed glacitectonic ridges. Ice-contact fans (Screen Member) were deposited in association with subglacial deformation tills and supraglacial/subaqueous mass flow diamicts. In SE Ireland, the ISIS moved onshore over proglacial lake sediments which were intensely folded, thrust and cannibalized producing a glacitectonite over which laminated and massive diamictons were deposited as glacitectonic <b>slices.</b> <b>Ice</b> marginal recession and oscillations are documented by: (a) ice-proximal, subaqueous diamict-rich facies; (b) isolated ice-contact glacilacustrine deltas; (c) syn-depositional glacitectonic disturbance of glacilacustrine sediments and overthrusting of ice-contact outwash; (d) offshore moraine ridges; and (e) changing ice flow directions and facies transitions. Diagnostic criteria for the identification of dynamic, possibly surging, ice-stream margins onshore include thrust-block moraines, tectonized pitted outwash and stacked sequences of glacitectonites, deformation tills and intervening stratified deposits. In addition, the widespread occurrence of hydrofracture fills in sediments overridden and locally reworked by the ISIS indicate that groundwater pressures were considerably elevated during glacier advance. The glacigenic sediments and landforms located around the terrestrial margins of the ISIS are explained as the products of onshore glacier flow that cannibalized and tectonically stacked pre-existing marine and glacilacustrine sediments. Localized tectonic thickening of subglacially deformed materials at the former margins of glaciers results in zones of net erosion immediately up-ice of submarginal zones of net accretion of subglacial till. The more stable the ice-stream margin the thicker and more complex the submarginal sedimentary stack...|$|R

40|$|Modifications to {{the novel}} ice {{crushing}} apparatus used by Gagnon and Daley (2006) to reduce its compliance in order to eliminate in-plane fractures and related behavior in the ice specimens have been completed. The first set of experiments with the modified apparatus has been performed using large single crystals of ice, lab-grown polycrystalline ice and iceberg ice. Rectangular thick sections (1 cm thickness) of ice were confined between two thick borosilicate glass plates and crushed at - 10 0 C from one edge face {{at a rate of}} 1 cm/s using a transparent Plexiglas platen (1 cm thickness) inserted between the plates. Visual data were recorded from the side using high-speed video (1000 images/s) and vertically through the platen using regular video. Pressure measurements were obtained at the platen/ice interface utilizing the system?s newly calibrated unique pressure sensor. Ice contact consisted of intact hard zones that sustained pressures in the 40 - 70 MPa range and pulverized ice where the pressure was generally lower. As in the previous report, the production and flow of liquid in a thin layer at the intact ice/platen interface was evident.

40|$|Ice {{crushing}} experiments {{similar to}} Gagnon and Daley (2005) have been repeated {{at twice the}} former high-speed video rate (1000 images/s) and {{with the intention of}} eliminating in-plane fractures that occurred in all previous tests. Rectangular thick sections (1 cm thickness) of lab-grown monocrystalline ice were confined between two thick Plexiglas plates and crushed at ? 10 oC from one edge face at a rate of 1 cm/s using a transparent Plexiglas platen (1 cm thickness) inserted between the plates. Visual data were recorded from the side using the high-speed video and vertically through the platen using regular video. It was concluded that the system was too compliant to prevent the in-plane fractures, however, one test did show near full-thickness intact ice. From this test unambiguous pressure measurements were obtained for the intact and pulverized ice at the ice/platen interface utilizing the system?s novel pressure sensor. As in the previous report, the production and flow of liquid in a thin layer at the intact ice/platen interface was evident. The apparatus was then modified significantly to reduce its compliance and more tests were conducted with the eventual desired result that in-plane fractures in the ice were eliminated. This confirmed that the apparatus is capable of yielding visual data of a 2 -D <b>slice</b> of <b>ice</b> during crushing as though {{it was part of a}} larger piece of ice.

40|$|A {{crushing}} apparatus {{incorporating the}} novel {{characteristics of the}} apparatus used by Gagnon and Bugden (2007), and fabricated at 3 times the scale, {{has been used to}} conduct crushing experiments on polycrystalline ice, large single crystals of ice and iceberg ice at ? 10 oC. The results confirmed that the behaviours of the different ice types were essentially invariant for the change of scale and that the apparatus functioned as intended at the larger scale, that is, it provided visual data of a 2 -D <b>slice</b> of <b>ice</b> during crushing as though {{it was part of a}} larger piece of ice. Rectangular thick sections (3 cm thickness) of ice were confined between two thick borosilicate glass plates and crushed from one edge face at a rate in the range 1. 5 ? 2. 5 cm/s using a transparent acrylic platen (3 cm thickness) inserted between the plates. Three identical pressure sensors, of the same type used before, were placed side-by-side to measure pressure across the full breadth of the platen/ice contact area between the glass plates as the samples were being crushed. The pressure data corroborated with the smaller-scale pressure data from the earlier tests and the apparatus served as a test bed to demonstrate that the pressure-sensing technology could function effectively in the side-by-side configuration. This technology will be used to obtain high spatial resolution pressure data during an upcoming full-scale study of ship / bergy bit impacts within the next few years.

40|$|The {{response}} of the tropical ocean to global climate change {{and the extent of}} sea ice in the glacial nordic seas belong to the great controversies in paleoclimatology. Our new reconstruction of peak glacial sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Atlantic is based on census counts of planktic foraminifera, using the Maximum Similarity Technique Version 28 (SIMMAX- 28) modern analog technique with 947 modern analog samples and 119 well-dated sediment cores. Our study compares two slightly different scenarios of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Environmental Processes of the Ice Age: Land, Oceans, Glaciers (EPILOG), and Glacial Atlantic Ocean Mapping (GLAMAP 2000) time slices. The comparison shows that the maximum LGM cooling in the Southern Hemisphere slightly preceeded that in the north. In both time <b>slices</b> sea <b>ice</b> was restricted to the north western margin of the nordic seas during glacial northern summer, while the central and eastern parts were ice-free. During northern glacial winter, sea ice advanced to the south of Iceland and Faeroe. In the central northern North Atlantic an anticyclonic gyre formed between 45 ° and 60 °N, with a cool water mass centered west of Ireland, where glacial cooling reached a maximum of > 12 °C. In the subtropical ocean gyres the new reconstruction supports the glacial-to-interglacial stability of SST as shown by CLIMAP Project Members (CLIMAP) [1981]. The zonal belt of minimum SST seasonality between 2 ° and 6 °N suggests that the LGM caloric equator occupied the same latitude as today. In contrast to the CLIMAP reconstruction, the glacial cooling of the tropical east Atlantic upwelling belt reached up to 6 °- 8 °C during Northern Hemisphere summer. Differences between these SIMMAX-based and published U 37 [k]- and Mg/Ca-based equatorial SST records are ascribed to strong SST seasonalities and SST signals that were produced by different planktic species groups during different seasons...|$|R
40|$|Ice is {{a unique}} and {{fascinating}} material. Much like the rock of the earth?s crust, sea ice can form a crust on the cold oceans of the world. The eastern coastal waters in Canada are prone to extensive ice coverage. Ice will often be the dominant consideration {{in the design of}} ships and offshore structures in Canadian waters. There are many Polar and sub-Polar areas of the world where sea ice is also the dominant natural feature and the key design challenge. Consequently, improving our understanding of ice loads is a topic of large practical significance, as well as being a fascinating scientific challenge. Several studies of ice crushing behavior have been conducted over of the past few decades. Some of the more recent investigations included in situ visual observations using indentors (Joensuu and Riska, 1988, Muhonen 1991, Gagnon, 1998; Fransson et al., 1991, Daley 1994) and a ship hull (Riska et al., 1990) that incorporated windows for viewing the indented ice surface. There have also been test apparatus that allowed viewing of the ice/indentor interface through the ice samples (Gagnon, 1994 a; Gagnon and M 8 lgaard, 1991). These have lead to significant new insights into the ice crushing process. Numerical contact process models based on available visual observations have been developed (Daley 1991, Daley et al. 1996). Further developments of these models is one of the continuing aims of this experimental work. The present study incorporates a similar concept to that of Wilson (1999), except that the strain rate is much higher, and is in the range associated with ice crushing rather than plastic deformation. The loads are much higher and the apparatus is correspondingly stronger. Experiments similar to the present ones have been performed by Gagnon (2004). While much {{progress has been made in}} the last 2 decades concerning the processes involved in ice crushing, considerable study remains in order to resolve divergent views that have developed. The importance of observing the ice behavior is, no doubt, a key factor. Here we report on-going development and results from a novel apparatus (Figure 1) designed to permit direct viewing of ice behavior during crushing. The goal for the design was to essentially take a <b>slice</b> of <b>ice</b> and observe its behavior during edge-on crushing as though it were part of a larger piece being crushed. The success of the apparatus until now has been limited because of in-plane fractures that persistently occurred in the ice specimens (Figure 5), with pulverized ice forming on one side of the fracture tending to obscure observations and likely influence the ice behavior (Gagnon and Daley, 2005).

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach of investigations {{was applied to}} obtain precise measurements of photosynthesis under natural conditions in the field from which questions were derived for further analysis in the laboratory. In situ measurements with the tracer 14 C through the entire thickness of a young sea ice floe revealed that algae are able to actively assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon under extreme conditions after inclusion into newly formed sea ice. These measurements were conducted with <b>ice</b> <b>slices</b> suspended in a new incubator. New sensors (oxygen micro-optodes) were introduced into sea ice research which withstand freezing without damage. A new laboratory sea ice microcosm was developed to simulate natural conditions of sea ice and to cultivating a sea-ice diatom (Fragilariopsis cylindrus) directly within brine channels. However, how changes of environmental conditions influence photosynthesis and how these diatoms are generally adapted to their habitat still remained unresolved. Consequently, the first molecular data base of an obligate psychrophilic diatom (Fragilariopis cylindrus) was conducted using an EST (expressed sequence tag) approach under freezing conditions. More than half (59 %) of these sequences could not be identified by GenBank comparison, indicating the existence of many unknown genes. A subset of identified genes and additional genes responsible for photosynthesis, respiration and cold adaptation were cloned and arranged on a macro-array to investigate gene expression under freezing conditions. These molecular measurements were paralleled by biophysical and biochemical investigations. Experimental results revealed that acclimation of diatom photosynthesis under freezing temperatures of sea water and different resource limitations (light, nutrients) requires chaperons and repair mechanisms in order to sustain chloroplast membranes and proteins which are responsible for energy generation and carbon dioxide fixation...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} during July, 2003 to June, 2013 about landing volumes of shark fishery (sharks and rays) in artisanal and industrial fishing sector only in group- wise not in species wise. In these periods, in artisanal fisheries gill nets (shark nets), set bag nets, long lines and trammel nets exploiting data were analyzed. But from 2012 - 13 periods in industrial fisheries harvesting data of sharks and rays by trawl fishing were started to record keeping in group wise. During 2012 - 13 total sharks and rays landing volume contributes only 0. 85 % (5017 MT) of total the marine fish production of Bangladesh. During 2010 - 11 to 2012 - 13 no sharks and rays product items had been traded from Bangladesh due to international market ban But from 2003 - 04 to 2009 - 10 period sharks and rays product with fish maws export to the Myanmar, India, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, USA and other countries. Dried and <b>iced</b> <b>sliced</b> meat of shark and rays, its sun-dried hide, bones, fins, tails, teeth and shark liver oil all are sold for local consumers, but only sets of fins (2 pectoral, 2 pelvic, 1 dorsal, 2 anal and 1 caudal fin) and skins were exporting to the foreign markets, which has been stopped now. In the year 2009 - 10 total 955 MT of sharks and rays product (with fish maws) were exporting and earning (app.) USD 1. 60 million. For the conservation and management of shark fishery need National Plan of Action, which exploiting in the MSY and help to banning of critically endangered sharks and rays species. Appropriate law in the Fish Act (at present Fish Act has no forms of restriction for harvesting sharks, while Forestry Act restricts it in Sundarbans area) for sustainable harvesting and conservation of the elasmobranchs. Such law should include how many boats (motorized- and non-motorized) and industrial trawlers could be allowed to harvest sharks from which area, in which season and the allowable limit of harvests; in every case proper ways of fishing methods should strictly be followed. Coastal areas around Saint Martin’s Island and Sundarbans proposed by the Bay of Bengal should be declared as Marine Protected Area as most sharks use these areas as their nursing grounds...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} to apply new techniques for measuring photosynthesis in Antarctic sea ice diatoms. A systematic approach of investigations was applied to obtain precise measurements of photosynthesis under natural conditions in the field from which questions were derived for further analysis in the laboratory. In situ measurements with the tracer 14 C through the entire thickness of a young sea ice floe revealed that algae are able to actively assimilate dissolved inorganic carbon under extreme conditions (e. g. - 7 °C, < 10 µmol photons m- 2) after inclusion into newly formed sea ice. These measurements were conducted with <b>ice</b> <b>slices</b> suspended in a new incubator. Unfortunately such bulk measurements did not provide encompass photosynthesis prevailing in the network of brine channels, pockets or bubbles. New sensors (oxygen micro-optodes) were therefore introduced into sea ice research which withstand freezing without damage, an important prerequisite to measuring oxygen dynamics directly within brine channels or brine pockets without disturbing the ice texture or brine chemistry. A new laboratory sea ice microcosm was developed to simulate natural conditions of sea ice and to cultivating a sea-ice diatom (Fragilariopsis cylindrus) directly within brine channels. Hence, changes of environmental conditions (e. g. melting, freezing, nutrient and light limitation) can now be simulated in the laboratory and effects on diatom photosynthesis can be investigated with the optodes without disturbing the habitat. However, how changes of environmental conditions influence photosynthesis and how these diatoms are generally adapted to their habitat still remained unresolved. Consequently, the first molecular data base of an obligate psychrophilic diatom (Fragilariopis cylindrus) {{was conducted}} using an EST (expressed sequence tag) approach under freezing conditions.
