5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks had quite a lot of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E

25|$|A small {{emergent}} {{community has}} been forming in Laikipia County, Kenya, abandoning Christianity in exchange for Judaism. There are an estimated 5,000 {{of them at the}} present time. Although at first Messianic, they concluded that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and are now waiting to be instructed in traditional Judaism. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> children of this community have been sent to the Abayudaya schools in Uganda to be instructed in Judaism and other subjects.|$|E
25|$|At first, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Livingstons' estates {{followed}} the British colonial patterns of Clermont. Rhinebeck House, today known as Grasmere, is the best-preserved example. Later on the houses {{began to show}} the influence of contemporary French tastes, abandoning the large central hall in favor of smaller rooms and passageways inside and focusing more attention on the garden side of the house, which usually faced the river and mountains as well. Montgomery Place, built by Janet Livingston Montgomery {{after the death of}} her husband Richard, is the only example from this period that remains largely as it was when first built.|$|E

Langton was chosen and was consecrated by the Pope at Viterbo on 17 June 1207.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> {{elements}} within the Indian National Congress were dissatisfied with {{the achievements of the}} Early Nationalists and vociferous critics of the methods of peaceful constitutional agitation that they promulgated. Young members advocated the adoption of European revolutionary methods to counter British imperialism while mainstream Early Nationalists remained loyal to the crown, with their desire to regain self-government lacking conviction. The Early Nationalists failed to attain their objectives, giving rise to another group of leaders known as Assertive or Extremist Nationalists. The most prominent leaders of the Assertive Nationalists were Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai and Bipin Chandra Pal, who are known collectively as the Lal-Bal-Pal trio.|$|E
25|$|Dodd {{stayed with}} his aunt, Mrs. Susan Dodd, in Little Rock. Except for some Union soldiers, {{there were very}} few teenage boys in the city, and Dodd was popular with the city's younger girls. He even became popular with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> {{servicemen}} at the arsenal, especially because he usually was accompanied by a local girl or two. In addition to his father's letters, he also delivered letters to several people he knew. Dodd attended some holiday dances with at least two girls, Mary Swindle and Minerva Cogburn. He also spent some time with 16-year-old Mary Dodge at her home, where Union officers were quartered. Mary supported the Southern cause; her father, R. L. Dodge, was a Vermont native on friendly terms with the Northern troops.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Postminimalism, Process Art and Arte Povera also emerged as revolutionary {{concepts}} and movements encompassing painting and sculpture, via Lyrical Abstraction and the Postminimalist movement, and in early Conceptual Art.

25|$|The art {{of playing}} the dhak is now being {{referred}} to as a dying profession,this is sad but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in Bankura district. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of Malla kings of Bishnupur. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. Times have changed. One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is a pittance. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> generation even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation, but do not have an alternative before themselves.|$|E
500|$|Accounts of McCool in his Somerset period portray {{him as a}} {{thoughtful}} but slightly aloof character. [...] "Off the field he was a quiet man," [...] wrote David Foot.

[...] "Occasionally <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> pros didn't relish the way he treated them. Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own." ...|$|E

They warned Parker he had [...] "better start running", but then blocked his path and quickly sprayed him in the face with CS gas. He was punched in the stomach then stabbed three times from behind through the throat and chest with a foot-long hunting knife. The knife penetrated completely through his body on two occasions and as he was lying on the ground he was repeatedly kicked and struck with a panel beater's hammer.|$|E
500|$|The show, {{as well as}} a {{majority}} of UPN's programs, were officially canceled {{as a result of the}} network's merger with the WB Television Network (the WB) to form the CW in 2006. Fern Gillespie of The Crisis was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network [...] "in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African American comedies" [...] for the creation of the CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks saying: [...] "Without that opportunity for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact." [...] Critic Tim Goodman identified Love, Inc. as one of six shows [...] "geared for an African American audience" [...] and featuring [...] "an African American lead actress" [...] that were canceled during the merger. He equated these cancellations as a sign of networks [...] "eliminat niche programming". The series has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD.|$|E
