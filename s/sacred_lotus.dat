5000|$|In ancient Roman {{religion}} and myth, Lucina was {{the goddess of}} childbirth who safeguarded {{the lives of women}} in labour. Lucina was also an epithet for Juno.

50|$|Nothing in a Japanese {{garden is}} natural or left to chance; each plant is chosen {{according}} to aesthetic principles, either to hide undesirable sights, {{to serve as}} a backdrop to certain garden features, or to create a picturesque scene, like a landscape painting or postcard. Trees are carefully chosen and arranged for their autumn colors. Moss is often used to suggest that the garden is ancient. Flowers are also carefully chosen by their season of flowering. Formal flowerbeds are rare in older gardens, but more common in modern gardens. Some plants are chosen for their religious symbolism, such as the <b>lotus,</b> <b>sacred</b> in Buddhist teachings, or the pine, which represents longevity.|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of George Loddiges, nuseryman and scientist, {{on the garden}} cemetery's design team, may account for Hosking's final choice of the <b>Sacred</b> <b>Lotus</b> flower for the decorative motifs at {{the tops of the}} Abney Park entrance pylons; a plant closely associated with the Nile and Egyptian religious symbolism. Botanical iconography was evidently preferred to 'sphinxes' and other populist or polychromatic Egyptian revival designs; and from Bonomi's accurate studies and drawings in Egypt, both the 'flower heads' / 'seed heads' and petals/sepals of the <b>Sacred</b> <b>Lotus</b> could be perfectly carved as pylon decorations that survive to this day (see photo).|$|E

50|$|The {{arrangement}} of flowers for home or building decor {{has a long}} history throughout the world. The oldest evidence of formal arranging of bouquets in vases comes from ancient Egypt, and depictions of flower arrangements date to the Old Kingdom (~2500 BCE).

50|$|Well-known {{members of}} the Proteales include the proteas of South Africa, the banksias and {{macadamias}} of Australia, the London plane, and the <b>sacred</b> <b>lotus.</b> The origins of the order are clearly ancient, with evidence of diversification in the mid-Cretaceous, over 100 million years ago. Of interest are the current family distributions, with the Proteaceae a mostly Southern Hemisphere family, while the Platanaceae and Nelumbonaceae are Northern Hemisphere plants.|$|E
50|$|Thermogenesis {{occurs in}} the flowers of many plants in the Araceae family {{as well as in}} cycad cones. In addition, the <b>sacred</b> <b>lotus</b> (Nelumbo nucifera) is able to thermoregulate itself, {{remaining}} on average 20 Â°C (36 Â°F) above air temperature while flowering. Heat is produced by breaking down the starch that was stored in their roots, which requires the consumption of oxygen at a rate approaching that of a flying hummingbird.|$|E
5000|$|Herbaceous macrophytes {{present in}} the reserve also provide {{important}} habitats for birds, otters and other wildlife [...] and include reeds (Phragmites spp.); sedges (Cyperus spp.), rushes (Scirpus spp.); Spike-rush (Eleocharis spp.); Grey Sedge (Lepironia articulata); Rice Grass (Paspalum scrobiculatum) and other grasses (Scleria spp.); <b>Sacred</b> <b>Lotus</b> (Nelumbo nucifera); White Lotus (Nymphaea lotus); Blue lotus (Nymphaea nouchali); Water Snowflake (Nymphoides indica); Asian Watermoss (Salvinia cucullata); Golden Bladderwort (Utricularia aurea); Hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum); Green Algae (Chara spp.) and myriad other Phytoplankton species.

50|$|Nelumbo nucifera, {{also known}} as Indian lotus, <b>sacred</b> <b>lotus,</b> bean of India, Egyptian bean or simply lotus, {{is one of two}} extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. The Linnaean {{binomial}} Nelumbo nucifera (Gaertn.) is the currently recognized name for this species, which has been classified under the former names, Nelumbium speciosum (Willd.) and Nymphaea nelumbo, among others. (These names are obsolete synonyms and should be avoided in current works.) This plant is an aquatic perennial. Under favorable circumstances its seeds may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{function}} of the plant cuticle is as a water permeability barrier that prevents evaporation {{of water from the}} epidermal surface, and also prevents external water and solutes from entering the tissues. In addition to its function as a permeability barrier for water and other molecules (prevent water loss), the micro and nano-structure of the cuticle confer specialised surface properties that prevent contamination of plant tissues with external water, dirt and microorganisms. Aerial organs of many plants, such as the leaves of the <b>sacred</b> <b>lotus</b> (Nelumbo nucifera) have ultra-hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties that have been described by Barthlott and Neinhuis (1997). The lotus effect has applications in biomimetic technical materials.|$|E

[...] The base of the building and the dais at the very foot of the shrine exhibit the shape known as æ ¼ç­é (kÅzama) resembling an excised bowl that is common on later furniture, altar platforms and railings.

50|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown Nymphaea caerulea to have {{psychedelic}} properties, {{and it may have}} been used as a sacrament in ancient Egypt and certain ancient South American cultures. Dosages of 5 to 10 grams of the flowers induces slight stimulation, a shift in thought processes, enhanced visual perception, and mild closed-eye visuals. Nymphaea caerulea is related to and possesses similar activity to Nelumbo nucifera, the <b>Sacred</b> <b>Lotus.</b> Both Nymphaea caerulea and Nelumbo nucifera contain the alkaloids nuciferine and apomorphine.These psychoactive effects make Nymphaea caerulea a likely candidate (among several) for the lotus plant eaten by the mythical Lotophagi in Homer's Odyssey.Used in aromatherapy, Nymphaea caerulea is purported to have a divine essence, bringing euphoria, heightened awareness and tranquillity.Other sources cite anti-spasmodic, sedative, purifying and calming properties.|$|E
