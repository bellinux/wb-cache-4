5|$|The cane cholla (or {{walking stick}} cholla, tree cholla, chainlink cactus, etc.) (Cylindropuntia imbricata) is a cactus {{found in the}} <b>Southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States and {{northern}} Mexico, including some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti. It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the <b>Southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting yellowish fruits.|$|E
5|$|In {{an average}} year, the {{remnants}} of 3.1Pacific tropical cyclones affect the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. In some locations, the systems provide 30% of the annual rainfall. In New Mexico, however, stations' annual rainfall from tropical cyclones range from 10% in the western portion to less than 5% in the eastern. Rainfall from tropical cyclones affect the Albuquerque International Sunport an average of 3.9days per year. Storms affect New Mexico less than Arizona, and are generally weaker. The greatest threat from such storms are accompanying floods. Damage from tropical cyclones {{is expected to increase}} as the population increases in the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

5|$|Storms that {{approach}} the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} do {{not typically}} bring high winds to the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. Most Pacific hurricanes {{are embedded in}} easterly winds south of the subtropical ridge, and thus move westward—away from large land masses—until they dissipate over cold waters. However, during early autumn, tropical cyclones generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve, or to curve again, northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. They also produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. However, many hurricanes that approach the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States tend to be undergoing extratropical transition as they encounter increased wind shear and markedly cooler sea surface temperatures, and as they interact with the deep troughs that caused them to recurve. Kathleen is one of only six recorded tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean known to have brought gale-force or hurricane-force winds to the Continental United States.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Odile is {{tied for}} the most intense landfalling {{tropical}} cyclone on the Baja California Peninsula during the satellite era. Sweeping across the peninsula in September2014, Odile inflicted widespread damage, particularly {{in the state of}} Baja California Sur, in addition to causing lesser impacts on the Mexican mainland and <b>Southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States. The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength. After meandering for several days, Odile began to track northwestward, intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category4 hurricane peak intensity on September14. The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125mph (205km/h). Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the Baja California Peninsula, briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September17. These remnants tracked northeastward across the <b>Southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States before they were no longer identifiable on September19.|$|E

5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Isis spread across the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, and rainfall reached over 0.75inches (19mm) in Nevada and Utah. Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, although upper-level moisture produced light rain across the Northwestern United States; Pocatello, Idaho recorded 0.59inches (15mm), while Missoula, Montana recorded 0.39inches (10mm).|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the year}} was Hurricane Isis, which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico. Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars. It later produced sporadic rainfall in the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, leading to some traffic accidents. In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico; the nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms, all of which remained offshore. One tropical cyclone, Hurricane Lester, affected Central America, causing two deaths in Guatemala. Three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to the <b>southwestern</b> <b>United</b> States, and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of California. Hurricane Madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern Texas.|$|E
