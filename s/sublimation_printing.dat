40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} digital print method of <b>sublimation</b> <b>printing</b> textiles using disperse dyes and low-tech desk-top printers. <b>Sublimation</b> <b>printing</b> {{has been widely}} used by the promotion industry for its rapid prototyping and commercial viability and is an immediate design to print process. This research looks at the potential for this method of digital print {{to be set up}} for small-scale production allowing the designer to be in full control of production and sampling. The research focuses on practical experiments across two main areas: 1. Technical - The research tested this digital print process observing the range and vibrancy of colour and the level of detail in comparison to traditional print methods. The research involved testing over 50 different polyesters to see the quality of print, and identify which fabrics are appropriate for a high-end fashion outcome. The work was sponsored by Lyson (www. lyson. com), who were interested in the creative application of their product. 2. Aesthetic - The traditional sublimation printed product can be crude with an unsophisticated design for the low-end market. Here the research investigated and developed this print process alongside innovative digital design work to create a collection of printed fabrics aimed towards the high-end market for fashion, thus creating a new aesthetic for textile design and digital print. The outcome of the research was a sample collection which was represented by Amanda Kelly International, and shown at the creative textile fair Indigo, Paris, and viewed by fashion houses such as Donna Karen, Calvin Klein and Emanuel Ungaro. Six out of eight designs were sold and put into production. It subsequently went on to be shown in New York and Japan. Consultancy work has since been completed, setting up of similar small scale print production facilities for design houses such as Amanda Kelly and Westcott Designs, London...|$|E

For the styling phase was used CorelDraw vector graphics program that allows changing the shape, size and color of the drawings without affecting the identity of the pattern. The embroidery was done using BERNINA Embroidery Software Designer Plus Software. This software allows you to export the model to any domestic or industrial embroidery machine regardless of brand. Finally we observed the resistance of the printed and embroided model to various: elasticity, resistance to abrasion and a sensory analysis on the preservation of color. After testing we noticed the imprint resistance applied to the fabric, resulting in a quality that makes possible to keep the Romanian traditional motif from generation to generation. ...|$|R
40|$|In packaging, spot colours {{are used}} to print key {{information}} like brand logos and elements for which the colour accuracy is critical. The present study investigates methods to aid the accurate reproduction of these spot colours with the n-colour printing process. Typical n-colour printing systems consist of supplementary inks {{in addition to the}} usual CMYK inks. Adding these inks to the traditional CMYK set increases the attainable colour gamut, but the added complexity creates several challenges in generating suitable colour separations for rendering colour images. In this project, the n-colour separation is achieved by the use of additional sectors for intermediate inks. Each sector contains four inks with the achromatic ink (black) common to all sectors. This allows the extension of the principles of the CMYK printing process to these additional sectors. The methods developed in this study can be generalised to any number of inks. The project explores various aspects of the n-colour printing process including the forward characterisation methods, gamut prediction of the n-colour process and the inverse characterisation to calculate the n-colour separation for target spot colours. The scope of the study covers different printing technologies including lithographic offset, flexographic, thermal <b>sublimation</b> and inkjet <b>printing.</b> A new method is proposed to characterise the printing devices. This method, the spot colour overprint (SCOP) model, was evaluated for the n-colour printing process with different printing technologies. In addition, a set of real-world spot colours were converted to n-colour separations and printed with the 7 -colour printing process to evaluate against the original spot colours. The results show that the proposed methods can be effectively used to replace the spot coloured inks with the n-colour printing process. This can save significant material, time and costs in the packaging industry...|$|R
40|$|The Re-Fashioned {{exhibition}} presented work by four {{artists that}} connect {{through the use}} of garments and textile making processes as a base for their work. Flattened clothing is overlaid with printed images, garments are cut-up and woven into other forms, and elements of garment and textile making processes are revealed and re-fashioned. The work explores a range of ideas including the gendered nature of textile making, clothing's relationship with identity and memory and the fragility of the human form. The use of reclaimed garments is a major element of Shelly Goldsmith's practice. Her work responds to the idea of memory and sense of self, and draws upon psychological and forensic theories associated with the cloths we wear, such as the notion of garments being laden with the wearer’s life; memories that may be retrieved and pieced together from the substances left behind on the clothes we wear. She works in a range of textile methods from hand stitch to digital <b>sublimation</b> <b>printing...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with representation. It considers {{the nature of a}} culturally located, discursive form called veitalatala and its creative translation into designed artifacts that consider the lyrical and graceful nature of Tongan women’s talanoa. The designed outcomes of the project consider the memories of three hou’eiki fafine (Tongan women) who left their homeland to settle abroad. Veitalatala: Mātanga ‘o e Talanoa is a creative synthesis of their talanoa, into new forms of artistic narrative, designed to capture the cultural and emotional resonance of their identities. The lyrical works orchestrate photography, animation, musical composition, sound design, filmed interviews, graphic design, <b>sublimation</b> <b>printing</b> on ngatu, and extensive postproduction experimentation, into unique texts that move the parameters of traditional documentation beyond conventional audio/visual interview. In so doing, the ngatu portraits and filmic veitalatala conceptually, contribute to the Tongan concept of luva (giving). Although Churchward (1959) defines veitalatala as a distinctly poetic form of talanoa, recent interviews with Havea (2014), Puloka (2014), Taliai (2014), Manu’atu, (2014), Taufa (2014), and Taumoepeau (2014) suggest that veitalatala is a complex and nuanced form of communication with diverse origins. Significantly, Tongia (2014) associates the term veitalatala with hou’eiki fafine. He suggests that it is a harmonious form of communication historically and socially related to the female gender. This thesis proposes through practice, that the tenets of veitalatala may be extended into artistic artifacts to create a contemporary, lyrical, yet culturally consistent means of representing histories and memories of Tongan hou’eiki fafine...|$|E
40|$|This {{body of work}} is {{the result}} of {{practice}} based research, culminating in a collection of five garments featuring pictorial prints, created through digital sublimation printing¹. The accompanying exegesis examines the place of my work within the contextual framework of related knowledge. The exegesis explores two main contextual notions. Firstly, the position of dolls' clothing play as a hegemonic tool in the process of learning to construct identity through self-presentation. This reflects on the practice of enculturing in girls the ability not just to do, but to observe oneself whilst doing. Secondly, the role of garments and fabric as liminal² markers at the transitional space between interior and exterior, domestic and public, self and not-self. My analysis is centered on the creation of original pieces of clothing. The garments are questioned by the issues explored in this exegesis. The research makes an original contribution to the body of knowledge {{by the nature of the}} creative work, and its analysis involving contemporary theoretical debate on the nature of fashion. ¹ <b>Sublimation</b> <b>printing</b> is a method of chemically bonding ink to a polyester or acrylic surface such as fabric, using extremely high heat and pressure.

40|$|As {{technology}} {{becomes increasingly}} more sophisticated, means {{and demand for}} digital communication are increasing. The geographical expansion of the business world has made communication alternatives critical to working together more effectively. Face to face meetings {{may not be possible}} or the most cost and time efficient approach. Also, there is a move towards working at home, telecommuting, by using electronic communication for interaction (Fitzgerald 1993). Thus, electronic correspondence is becoming essential and we are witnessing a move towards higher performance and potential for communication alternatives. Knowing the options and their appropriateness is a competitive advantage. 2 ̆ 2 In a information society dominated by computers and communications, value is increased by knowledge, {{as well as by the}} speed of movement of that knowledge. 2 ̆ 2 (Fitzgerald 1994). Graphic designers rely on strong communication with their clients. Clients 2 ̆ 7 needs must be expressed to the designer and designer 2 ̆ 7 s solutions must be communicated for approval. This process is repeated at several stages: initial, revision, and final. Traditionally, when face to face meetings were not feasible, comprehensives were mailed to the client. With the current move towards electronic communication, mail manual transportation are slower and possibly more expensive than electronic correspondence. With technology today, electronic correspondence may also include interactivity, voice, and video. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate alternative methods to face to face interaction between designer and client throughout the design approval process. The goal being to determine the appropriateness of each transmission application for information interchange of different kind of images and at different stages of the approval process. Appropriateness was to be determined by equipment, economic and time factors, interoperability, security, and aesthetic and communication quality. Facsimile technology, Adobe Acrobat 2 ̆ 7 s portable document formal files, the Internet, and videoconferencing were the vehicles analyzed as an electronic correspondence alternatives to face to face interaction. The vehicles were tested in two parts, through survey and actual transactions with graphic designers. Participants were provided questionnaires to evaluate and compare the visual and non visual aspects of each vehicle. This thesis did not test specific software or hardware, but rather the validity of the technique for interaction and transmission of data between designer and client throughout the design approval process. The test was in two parts. The first part was a survey sampling of 1 00 design sites, design firms and advertising agencies, to derive quantitative information on each transmission vehicle Based on the assessment of the appropriateness of each vehicle, determined by survey response in conjunction with background research, Facsimile technology, Adobe Acrobat, and videoconferencing were deemed appropriate for further testing. The Internet was deemed inappropriate. Three design sites were involved in comparing facsimile technology and PDF files to dye <b>sublimation</b> hardcopy <b>prints.</b> A video-conference was donated, conducted, and videotaped. Participants were asked to evaluate and compare visual and non-visual aspects of the transmitted comprehensives. The conclusion of this thesis project is that the technology is here to use for electronic alternatives to face to face interaction between clients. Some adjustments have to be made, though, before these technologies can be embraced completely. Electronic alternatives are not qualified for final approval because of lack of precision in color, lack of demonstrating production or finishing operations, and the quality of typography on monitors are extremely low causing the aesthetic quality to be extremely diminished. Second, the designers selected hardcopy as the best option for communicating the tested designs. This indicates the community is not ready to embrace electronic alternatives. This may be due to a lacking of advantage of the electronic option to deem them necessary and/or lack of comfortability with the electronic alternatives. Either reason, electronic alternatives to face to face interaction between client and designer is not, currenly, being fully accepted. As for the vehicles themselves, Adobe Acrobat was found to be a very appropriate product to use between designer and client to communicate design comprehensives for initial and revision stages. Facsimile transmissions are appropriate for initial comprehensives or for revisions of comprehensives already seen at higher quality by the client. The Internet is presently not appropriate for private one-to-one file transfer between client and designer. Its strengths do not outweigh its risks. Videoconferencing is electronic correspondence, not file transfer. It can be used in combination with mail carrier service and file transfer or alone. If the client has been sent appropriate final proofs and the conference is used for verbal and visual communication, it is appropriate for all stages. If the final proof has not been sent, it is very appropriate for initial and revision stages. In comparison to mail carriers, all electronic options transmission times were significantly faster. All transmissions were under a hour. Additionally, all alternatives except videoconferencing, were less expensive...|$|R
40|$|Stains and Stories is {{a series}} of textile-based {{installations}} and limited-edition prints, which form part of an ongoing project to examine perceived latent matter (memories and experiences) in worn clothing. The work seeks to present complex ideas about easily accessible objects (clothes), in order to provoke contemplation about human experience and enhance psychological knowledge. I consulted with Dr. Alison Fendley, Senior Biologist at the Forensic Science Service, in developing approaches to releasing and constructing narrative in worn clothing. Drawing on Edmund Locard’s 'exchange principle', I tested ideas concerning our psychological relationship to clothing, the internal and external 'landscape', and the physical transference of experience onto cloth/clothes. Synthesising traditional and new textile processes with fine art concepts was key to the project. I use a wide range of materials and techniques in this work to express ideas. I employed laser etching to draw on fabric (used clothing) to express retrieval of disturbing memories: the digital laser was used to draw onto the cloth by scalding its surface, penetrating the fibre of worn garments to reveal glimpses of the intensity of experience left behind. For other work, looking at retrieving memory at the end of life, I printed archival plant matter (pressed plants) from the Natural History Museum herbarium onto reclaimed garments. I specifically chose to use <b>sublimation</b> <b>printing</b> (rather than screen printing, for example) – a process where intense heat and pressure vaporises solid dye, imprinting the image of the pressed plants onto cloth, so that the pressed plants are burnt, crushed and destroyed in the process. The work was originally shown at Fabrica, and subsequently developed and toured to other venues. A symposium at Fabrica discussed this work with forensic psychologist Anna Motz and I have presented it through many lectures, and my article 'Scrap of a Thing [...] .
