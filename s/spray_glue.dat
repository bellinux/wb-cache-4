40|$|Due to {{the health}} risk related to {{occupational}} air pollution exposure, we assessed concentrations and identified sources of particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a handcraft workshop producing fishing lures. The work processes in the site included polyurethane molding, spray painting, lacquering, and gluing. We measured total VOC (TVOC) concentrations and particle size distributions at three locations representing the various phases of the manufacturing and assembly process. The mean working-hour TVOC concentrations in three locations studied were 41, 37, and 24 ppm according to photo-ionization detector measurements. The mean working-hour particle number concentration varied between locations from 3000 to 36, 000 cm− 3. Analysis of temporal and spatial variations of TVOC concentrations revealed that {{there were at least}} four substantial VOC sources: <b>spray</b> <b>gluing,</b> mold-release agent <b>spraying,</b> continuous evaporation from various lacquer and paint containers, and either spray painting or lacquering (probably both).

50|$|Borosilicate glass {{has become}} the {{material}} of choice for fused deposition modeling (FDM), or fused filament fabrication (FFF), build plates. Its low coefficient of expansion makes borosilicate glass, when used in combination with resistance-heating plates and pads, an ideal material for the heated build platform onto which plastic materials are extruded one layer at a time. The initial layer of build must be placed onto a substantially flat, heated surface to minimize shrinkage of some build materials (ABS, polycarbonate, polyamide, etc.) due to cooling after deposition. The build plate will cycle from room temperature to between 100 °C and 130 °C for each prototype that is built. The temperature, along with various coatings (Kapton tape, painter tape, hair <b>spray,</b> <b>glue</b> stick, ABS+acetone slurry, etc.), ensure that the first layer may be adhered to and remain adhered to the plate, without warping, as the first and subsequent layers cool following extrusion. Subsequently, following the build, the heating elements and plate are allowed to cool. The resulting residual stress formed when the plastic contracts as it cools, while the glass remains relatively dimensionally unchanged due to the low coefficient of thermal expansion, provides a convenient aid in removing the otherwise mechanically bonded plastic from the build plate. In some cases the parts self-separate as the developed stresses overcome the adhesive bond of the build material to the coating material and underlying plate.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of arthroscopic airbrush assisted cartilage repair. METHODS: An airbrush device (Baxter) was used to spray both human expanded osteoarthritic chondrocytes and choncrocytes with their pericellular matrix (chondrons) at 1 × 10 (6) cells/ml fibrin glue (Tissucol, Baxter) in vitro. Depth-dependent cell viability was assessed for both methods with confocal microscopy. Constructs were cultured for 21 days to assess matrix production. A controlled human cadaveric study (n = 8) was performed to test the feasibility of the procedure in which defects were filled with either arthroscopic airbrushing or needle extrusion. All knees were subjected to 60 min of continuous passive motion and scored on outline attachment and defect filling. RESULTS: Spraying both chondrocytes and chondrons in fibrin glue resulted in a homogenous cell distribution throughout the scaffold. No difference in viability or matrix production between application methods was found nor between chondrons and chondrocytes. The cadaveric study revealed that airbrushing was highly feasible, and that defect filling through needle extrusion was more difficult to perform based on fibrin glue adhesion and gravity-induced seepage. Defect outline and coverage scores were consistently higher for extrusion, albeit not statistically significant.

40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} {{is a common}} process to join metals in the {{automotive}} industry. Adhesives are often used as sealers to seams of metals that are joined. Anti-spatter compounds sometimes are sprayed onto metals to be welded to improve the weldability. Spot welding produces complex aerosols composed of metal and volatile compounds (VOCs) which can cause lung disease in workers. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n =  12 /treatment group) were exposed by inhalation to 25  mg/m 3 of aerosol for 4  h/day ×  8  days during spot welding of galvanized zinc (Zn) -coated steel in {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>glue</b> or anti-spatter <b>spray.</b> Controls were exposed to filtered air. Particle size distribution and chemical composition of the generated aerosol were determined. At 1 and 7  days after exposure, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to assess lung toxicity. The generated particles mostly were in the submicron size range with a significant number of nanometer-sized particles formed. The primary metals present in the fumes were Fe (72. 5 %) and Zn (26. 3 %). The addition of the anti-spatter <b>spray</b> and <b>glue</b> did affect particle size distribution when spot welding galvanized steel, whereas they had no effect on metal composition. Multiple VOCs (e. g., methyl methacrylate, acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, benzene, xylene) were identified when spot welding using either the glue or the anti-spatter spray that were not present when welding alone. Markers of lung injury (BAL lactate dehydrogenase) and inflammation (total BAL cells/neutrophils and cytokines/chemokines) were significantly elevated compared to controls 1  day after exposure to the spot welding fumes. The elevated pulmonary response was transient as lung toxicity mostly returned to control values by 7  days. The VOCs or the concentrations that they were generated during the animal exposures had no measurable effect on the pulmonary responses. Inhalation of galvanized spot welding fumes caused acute lung toxicity most likely due to the short-term exposure of particles that contain Zn.

Work related symptoms of the eyes and airways (nose or lower airways, or both), and lung function were also evaluated.  RESULTS—P-MDX was detected in 65 % of the workers, U-TDX in 47 %, HDX in none. Three per cent were positive for S-IgE-MDI, 33 % for S-IgG-MDI, 32 % for S-IgG-TDI, and 12 % for S-IgG-HDI. A few clerks had metabolites, and some had antibodies. Most metabolites and immunoglobulins were slightly correlated—for example, P-MDX v S-IgG-MDI: rs= 0. 21. Workers who heated glue had increased P-MDX (odds ratio (OR) = 12 for a value above the median) and S-IgG-MDI (OR= 3. 7), sprayers P- 2, 4 -TDX (OR= 6. 2) and P- 2, 6 -TDX (OR= 16). Twenty six per cent of the workers had work related symptoms of the airways, 21 % from the nose, 11 % from the lower airways. <b>Spraying</b> of <b>glue</b> increased the risk of work related symptoms and slightly decreased lung function.

40|$|Background: In spinal surgery, {{repair of}} the dura is {{difficult}} {{when it is}} torn, fragile, or is ossified as in cases with OPLL. We report our experience with a non-suture dural repair technique in patients undergoing spinal surgery; it employs a dura substitute composed of polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh and fibrin glue.

The dural defect {{is covered with a}} patch <b>sprayed</b> with fibrin <b>glue</b> without suturing to the dura mater. We first evaluated this technique in an experimental study by performing water leakage tests. Between May 2001 and January 2005 we used it in 160 spinal surgeries that required intraoperative dura repair. Results: Our preliminary tests showed that the threshold for water pressure without leakage was 161 ± 42 mmHg and 96. 5 ± 32 mmHg when the unsprayed margin {{around the perimeter of the}} patch was 5 mm and 2 mm, respectively. Of the 160 operated patients, 10 (6. 3 %) experienced subcutaneous CSF leakage. Of these, 6 required a second operation, in the other 4 the CSF collection diminished spontaneously. There were no other complications such as allergic reaction, adhesion, or infection.

Histopathological findings revealed proliferating tumor cells with clear cytoplasm surrounded by hyalinizing stroma in the submucosal minor salivary glands. Immunohistochemical stains revealed these tumor cells to be positive for epithelial cell markers but negative for myoepithelial ones. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of HCCC. Good wound healing and no evidence of local recurrence and metastasis have been shown since surgery. 1...|$|R

(See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as <b>spray</b> paints, markers, <b>glues,</b> and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse <b>glue,</b> shoe polish, <b>spray</b> paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as amyl nitrites or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a protective sheathing around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Products Abused as Inhalants Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature •	Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, and lighter fluid •	Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, and glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents •	Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics •	Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases •	Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—used primarily as sexual enhancers •	Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures. When marketed for illicit use, organic nitrites are often sold in small brown bottles labeled as “video head cleaner,” “room odorizer,” “leather cleaner,” or “liquid aroma. ...|$|R
