Axl, however, never made it to the show for reasons never made clear.

Rotten was replaced with [...] "Mass Transit" [...] Eric Kulas, an untrained seventeen-year-old who convinced booker Paul Heyman that he was nineteen and had been trained by the veteran Killer Kowalski. Kulas was hospitalized as a result, eventually receiving fifty stitches. New Jack was charged with aggravated assault stemming from the incident, but was acquitted. Kulas subsequently sued New Jack and ECW for damages in July 1998, but lost the case. Kulas died on May 12, 2002 at the age of 22 due to complications from gastric bypass surgery.

40|$|Discrete {{time signal}} and systems courses {{are a good}} {{starting}} point to study in the electrical and computer engineering program. It is interesting because of the multimedia capability and the ability of the students to make <b>something</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> audio signals. Also, discrete time signals and systems are used increasingly in a wide spectrum of applications, such as; instrumentation, telecommunications, medical, automotive, control, graphics/imaging, military, consumer electronics, industrial, voice/speech etc. This will help students get an idea on how and where they can use it. For that reason it should be introduced to students early because it would help in recruitment and retention of electrical and computer engineering students. To motivate the beginning engineers to the hard work of connecting mathematics and computation, we can teach discrete time signal and systems interactively and visually using some computer tools. In this paper, we present a suite of interactive discrete time signal and systems demonstration modules using MATLAB, Simulink and TI DSK 6713 DSP kit. Using some practical applications and simulation, we can make the class more interesting and interactive. Most demos use real-world signals such as speech and music so that the student can appreciate the concepts better. W...|$|R
