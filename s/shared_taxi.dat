25|$|Transport by bus {{services}} {{form the}} main component of public transport services in New Zealand cities, {{and the country}} also has a network of long-distance bus or coach services, augmented by door-to-door inter-city shuttle vans, a type of <b>shared</b> <b>taxi.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, Brussels {{has had a}} car-sharing service {{operated}} by the Bremen company Cambio, {{in partnership with the}} STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006, a public bicycle-sharing programme was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by Villo!. Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by Collecto, a <b>shared</b> <b>taxi</b> system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.|$|E
25|$|The first {{widespread}} {{motor vehicle}} services were <b>shared</b> <b>taxi</b> services termed service cars; a significant early provider was Aard, operating elongated Hudson Super-Six Coaches. By 1920 AARD covered {{most of the}} North Island and even provided transport for the Prince of Wales. By 1924 the services covered even more areas. Aard {{was taken over by}} New Zealand Railways Road Services in 1928. The road fleet of New Zealand Railways Corporation was privatised in 1991 with the long-distance business still existing as InterCity, having more recently incorporated Newmans Coachlines. Another former extensive coach business was Mount Cook Landlines, which closed in the 1990s. Internet-based nakedbus.com is building another nationwide network, partly as a reseller of several smaller bus operators' capacity.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>share</b> <b>taxis</b> are {{operated}} {{under one of}} two regimes. Some <b>share</b> <b>taxis</b> are operated by a company. For example, in Dakar there are company-owned fleets of hundred of car rapides. In Soviet Union, <b>share</b> <b>taxis,</b> known as marshrutka, were operated by state-owned taxi parks. There are also individual operators in many countries. In Africa, while there are company <b>share</b> <b>taxis,</b> individual owners are more common. Rarely owning more than two vehicles at a time, they will rent out a minibus to operators, who pay fuel and other running costs, and keep revenue.|$|R

25|$|Sun Prairie has no {{municipal}} bus, {{but instead}} {{has provided a}} Shared Ride Taxi service for the past decade, whereby residents can travel throughout the city for a small charge, sometimes sharing the ride with other passengers. This service is subsidized by grants obtained by the city, which also provide for low income transit via the use of identification cards. Corner service is also available at some street locations during the academic school year, and is intended primarily for middle-school and high school students. Although the taxi service is exclusively for the city, <b>Shared</b> <b>Taxi</b> also provides for thrice-daily shuttle service (8:30 am, 12:30pm, 4:30pm) to nearby East Towne Mall, on the northeastern edge of Madison, where commuters can connect to the Madison Metro bus system.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} has increased {{investment in the}} transport infrastructure of Rwanda since the 1994 genocide, with aid from the United States, European Union, Japan, and others. The transport system consists primarily of the road network, with paved roads between Kigali and most other major cities and towns in the country. Rwanda is linked by road to {{other countries in the}} East African Community, namely Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Kenya, {{as well as to the}} eastern Congolese cities of Goma and Bukavu; the country's most important trade route is the road to the port of Mombasa via Kampala and Nairobi, which is known as the Northern Corridor. The principal form of public transport in the country is the minibus, accounting for more than half of all passenger carrying capacity. Some minibuses, particularly in Kigali, operate an unscheduled service, under a <b>shared</b> <b>taxi</b> system, while others run to a schedule, offering express routes between the major cities. There are a smaller number of large buses, which operate a scheduled service around the country. The principal private hire vehicle is the motorcycle taxi; in 2013 there were 9,609 registered motorcycle taxis in Rwanda, compared with just 579 taxicabs. Coach services are available to various destinations in neighbouring countries. The country has an international airport at Kigali that serves several international destinations, the busiest routes being those to Nairobi and Entebbe; there is one domestic route, between Kigali and Kamembe Airport near Cyangugu. The national carrier is RwandAir, and the country is served by seven foreign airlines. [...] the country has no railways, but there is a project underway, in conjunction with Burundi and Tanzania, to extend the Tanzanian Central Line into Rwanda; the three countries have invited expressions of interest from private firms to form a public private partnership for the scheme. There is no public water transport between the port cities on Lake Kivu, although a limited private service exists and the {{government has}} initiated a programme to develop a full service. The Ministry of Infrastructure is also investigating the feasibility of linking Rwanda to Lake Victoria via shipping on the Akagera River.|$|E

Residents of transit-deprived parts of New York City started a <b>share</b> <b>taxi</b> service with minibuses {{and their own}} private vehicles. The fare {{on each of these}} <b>share</b> <b>taxis</b> was one dollar.

[...] In an engaged taxi, the driver will not take any more passenger (as opposed to a <b>shared</b> <b>taxi).</b> Usually drivers charge much more to have the taxi engaged, sometimes as much as 8-10 times the price of a <b>shared</b> <b>taxi.</b> In a <b>shared</b> <b>taxi,</b> the driver will usually get more people who need to go along the same way.
