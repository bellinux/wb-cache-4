5|$|Sarria {{was honored}} in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee's Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria's {{lifetime}} of activism was commemorated {{when the city}} of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court. A plaque outlining Sarria's accomplishments {{is embedded in the}} <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the Harvey Milk Memorial Branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which is located at 1 José Sarria Court.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

50|$|Now, these tiles are {{spreading}} throughout the world. There are many tactile tiles installed at subway stations and on <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> Seoul, Korea. The installation situation in Seoul is more challenging than in Japan. Since {{the surface of}} various <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> Seoul are not flat, there are many places which do not convey {{the meaning of a}} Tactile Tile.|$|R

Assassinations of former members of ASALA-RM continued in Armenia into the late 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The borough {{accepted}} {{public water}} in September 1896. Electric streetlights were installed after much discussion in 1915. Before that, gas lamps {{were used to}} light the streets. Over the years, boardwalks were replaced by bricks, then by concrete sidewalks. There are still two brick <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> the borough. Horseshoe Pike, formerly Main Street, has the only fully paved <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> the borough.|$|R

50|$|McCrory {{established}} a Residential Tree Ordinance in 2004, which required developers to save 10% {{of the trees}} in every new residential development. He also {{established a}} Sidewalk Policy, which required <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> every new subdivision and provided funding for <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> neighborhoods without them, {{in order to encourage}} walking. He also worked to integrate bike lanes into the city's transportation policy, establishing 42 miles of bike lanes throughout the city.|$|R
25|$|Bates also {{sponsored}} and {{campaigned for}} {{the passage of}} Measure S in 2012, a sit-and-lie ordinance which would have made sitting on the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> certain commercial districts illegal and subject to citation and/or arrest depending on number of repeated violations. Bates and Measure S supporters unsuccessfully argued that threatening legal sanction would encourage persistently homeless individuals to access social services.|$|E
25|$|On May 14, 2008 Markham-Cousins {{sent letters}} to {{students}} and family members explaining {{the reasons for the}} Fresh Start.

Student drew with chalk on the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the school in support of the teachers.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{discovered}} that on July 6, 1953, she collapsed on a <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish Harlem section of Manhattan, and later died of pneumonia {{at a hospital}} in Harlem at the age of 39. Since no one claimed her body and she had no identification on her, the city gave her a pauper's burial on Hart Island, the city's only potter's field.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 {{the tiled}} facades of these {{buildings}} were falling off, necessitating sheltering structures over the <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> some places to protect pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|Washburn {{received}} {{a grant from}} the State for the sum of $282,000 to build 6000 ft of <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> the town, but were never constructed.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{people moved}} to Portland {{following}} the fair, {{which is why}} many houses around Portland {{were built in the}} years that followed. [...] There were also many street paving and <b>sidewalk</b> projects <b>in</b> the years that followed the fair, and many of the <b>sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> Portland (East Portland especially) are dated from 1910 to 1920.|$|R
25|$|Half of Flint's {{fourteen}} tallest {{buildings were}} built during the 1920s. The 19-story Genesee Towers, formerly the city's tallest building, {{was completed in}} 1968. The building became unused in later years and fell into severe disrepair: a cautionary sign warning of falling debris {{was put on the}} <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of it. An investment company purchased the building for $1, and it was demolished (by implosion) on December 22, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The narrow axis of {{the plan}} faces {{the street to the}} east, and the main {{entrance}} lies midway along the long side of the plan. The use of hip roofs includes a very large cantilevered hip roof over the living room terrace. The pitch of the main hip roof is shallow enough to give the passer-by on the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the house the impression that it is a flat roof.|$|E
25|$|The west facade {{consisted}} of a glass curtain wall which sloped slightly inward. The facade projected outward (imitating bays and turrets) at points, and at points it featured a gabled roof. On the south corner of the building, a circular street plaza sliced into the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> the west (providing a few parking spaces) while cutting an arc into {{the facade of the}} building. This helped create a transition from the flat southern facade to the more diverse western facade.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} redesign, {{the small}} Norman Bethune Square has been {{redesigned}} and enlarged. <b>Sidewalks</b> <b>in</b> the area will also be widened, with additional trees.|$|R

25|$|Through the {{combined}} efforts of two Phoenix philanthropists, Walter Bimson and Lewis Ruskin, Waddell received a commission in 1970 {{to create a}} major work for downtown Phoenix. When completed in 1974, Dance consisted of eleven life-sized figures in various dance positions and another figure playing the flute. Although the piece has been moved from its original location in the Phoenix Civic Plaza to the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the Herberger Theater, it remains Waddell’s tour de force in his adopted home of Arizona.|$|E
25|$|He {{looked to}} Ayeni and Wilson v. Layne, {{decided by the}} Supreme Court the year before, as precedents. In the latter case the Court had {{unanimously}} held it was unconstitutional for reporters to accompany federal marshals executing an arrest warrant in a private residence since their presence served no valid law enforcement purpose. Since the two cases involved private homes with a reasonable expectation of privacy, he distinguished Lauro's by noting the perp walk had occurred on a public street and <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of the police station.|$|E
25|$|On March 6, 1978, {{during a}} legal battle related to {{obscenity}} in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Flynt and his local lawyer, Gene Reeves Jr., were returning to the courthouse when they were shot on the <b>sidewalk</b> <b>in</b> front of 136 South Perry Street in Lawrenceville by a sniper standing near an alley across the street. The shooting left Flynt partially paralyzed with permanent spinal cord damage, {{and in need of}} a wheelchair. Flynt's injuries caused him constant, excruciating pain and he was addicted to painkillers until multiple surgeries deadened the affected nerves. He also suffered a stroke caused by one of several overdoses of his analgesic medications. He recovered but has had pronunciation difficulties since.|$|E
