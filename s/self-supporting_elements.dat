40|$|The {{importance}} of spatial spheres in dramas has only slightly been researched. On the whole this {{problem has been}} considered relatively unimportant. Ever {{since the publication of}} Lessing’s Laokoon the distinguishing characteristic of a literary work was considered to be the element of “time”, in contradistinction to works of the visual arts (painting and sculpture) where “space” was primary. It will be demonstrated that in Barlach’s plays space assumes considerable importance. Although the dramatic concern is primarily expressed through successive dialogues and monologues, Barlach’s language nevertheless can imaginatively create spatial spheres different from those visible on stage. Both spheres of action, the visible and the invisible, are important for the function of the plot. This thesis tries to demonstrate: First, that there exists a specific dramatic problem as to spatial spheres in the plays of Ernst Barlach; Second, that the spatial spheres can be viewed as <b>self-supporting</b> <b>elements</b> contributing toward the interpretation of a given play; Third, that the interrelationship of the visible to the invisible spatial spheres and the lines of demarcation between them is of utmost importance. As representative of these two spheres in Barlach’s works, I have chosen Der blaue Boll and Der tote Tag. In Der tote Tag the relationship of the visible to the invisible leads to the problem of vision in a single-scene play. Decisive here is not the fact of the unity of place, but the perspective relative to the visible scenes in the total context of the play. In Der blaue Boll the invisible spatial spheres are realized through the stage setting; they project inner events – both visionary and real – of the individual characters. Decisive for the specific assertion of the existence of spatial spheres in a multiple-scene play is the relationship of invisible projected space images to the stage setting as well as the interaction of individual scenes to each other. A brief survey of the other six Barlach-plays shows the same development of the interrelationship of the visible to the invisible spheres; both are important for the interpretation. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the relationship of the spatial spheres to the dialogue, the characters, and to time are discussed. It is postulated that the formation of various spatial spheres can express the general ideological foundation and the specific intellectual position in a play. But beyond these assertions the conclusion is reached that the structure of spatial spheres indicates the development of the plot. Through widening, confinement, circular movement, or ascent of the various spatial structures, specific plot movements are made physically visible. Barlach strives for the synthesis of the sterilized realistic spatial sphere with an objective eternal space, between which the human soul appears to be the scene of action subjected to varying changes, yet at the same time remaining in a state of serenity. The final part deals with the specific problem of the production of Barlach’s plays. A synthesis between realism and symbolism, the empirical and the supernatural, has seldom been staged satisfactorily. Yet Barlach’s style combines both in various spatial spheres. In every one of Barlach’s plays the problem of the relationship of the visible-finite to the invisible-infinite, the obvious to the unprecedented, is characteristic. But the infinite can only be experienced by means of the finite. Only through the realistic portrayal of the finite can the invisible be made apparent...|$|E

Electrode connections (31, 32) are accessible {{from outside of}} the substrate surface. An organic function layer is arranged between the base electrode and a top electrode (33). The function layer is enclosed between the substrate and a <b>self-supporting</b> cover structural <b>element</b> (20) that is made of conductive material. The conductive material is conductively coupled at laterally distributed places with the base or top electrode, and is electrically conductively coupled with the electrode connections. USE - Organic photoelectric component e. g. organic LED or organic photovoltaic cell (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The utilization of the <b>self-supporting</b> cover structural <b>element</b> made of conductive material decreases inactive edge regions of the organic photoelectric component, thus yielding a larger optically active surface of the component.

40|$|Profile {{steel shell}} {{structures}} are used popularly due to aesthetic and economical use of materials. The {{aim of this}} research work {{is to develop a}} <b>self-supporting</b> roofing <b>element</b> using profiled steel sheet such as zincalume, with potential for application in affordable quality housing. An analytical investigation using finite element method is carried out on the structural strength and behaviour of different types of <b>self-supporting</b> roofing <b>elements.</b> An experimental study on the structural strength and behaviour of a selected roofing element is conducted to validate the analytical investigation. Conventionally, profile steel sheet such as zincalume and galvanized iron sheet is using in roof as a covering materials using different type of internal support without any attention paid to their structural capability. It is an innovative system that is self-supporting roofing system where sheeting roofs run continuous lengths of roof sheeting from one end to other end support through eliminating internal support. This kind of roofing system has significant advantages of removing the internal trussing and support. An attempt has been made to find out efficient, economic and aesthetically pleasing shape of shell <b>elements</b> to provide <b>self-supporting</b> roofing system on the basis of present results. The load deflection, stress-strain and deflected shape profiles for investigated roofing element is showed that parabolic roofing element having crown height 1 / 6 of chord length is more efficient than others. It is observed that a parabolic shape roofing element with optimum crown height is structurally and economically able to use as a supporting roofing system for 8 m span lengths using 1. 25 mm thick profiled zincalume sheets. It can be concluded that the proposed roofing system has a great potential to be exploited for housing construction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a novel piezoresistive high-g {{accelerometer}} design, that partially overcomes a common drawback of shock sensor concepts, namely that their bandwidth, i. e. natural frequency, cannot be increased without sacrificing sensitivity. Its figure of merit (sensitivity multiplied by frequency squared) is about 5 × 10 6 m - 1. This is one order of magnitude higher than in existing designs in the literature or currently on the market. The increase is {{made possible by a}} design approach that focuses on displacements rather than stresses and the utilization of a spring-mass system related parameter called the "geometrical constant". The concept allows finding initial design geometries, which can be used for further optimization, and may be applied to sensors other than accelerometers. The accelerometer design presented in this paper is implemented as a MEMS device that features <b>self-supporting</b> piezoresistive <b>elements.</b> The first specimens have been characterized for shocks of up to 75, 000 × g in Hopkinson bar experiments and have sensitivities ranging from 0. 035 to 0. 23 V/V exc. /g and natural frequencies ranging from 2. 7 to 3. 7 MHz. Also, measurement data from a 200, 000 × g survivability check is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and experimental analysis of a resonant gyroscope. Initially, this involved the development of a fabrication process suitable for the construction of metallic microstructures, employing a combination of nickel electroforming and sacrificial layer techniques to realise free-standing and <b>self-supporting</b> mechanical <b>elements.</b> This was undertaken and achieved. Simple beam elements of typically 2. 7 mm x 1 mm x 40 µm dimensions have been constructed and subject to analysis using laser doppler interferometry. This analysis tool was used to implement a fill modal analysis in order to experimentally derive dynamic parameters. The characteristic resonance frequencies of these cantilevers have been measured, with 3. 14 kHz, 23. 79 kHz, 37. 94 kHz and 71. 22 kHz being the typical frequencies of the first four resonant modes. Q-factors of 912, 532, 1490 and 752 have been measured for these modes respectively at 0. 01 mbar ambient pressure. Additionally the mode shapes of each resonance was derived experimentally and found to be in excellent agreement with finite element predictions. A 4 mm nickel ring gyroscope structure has been constructed and analysed using both optical analysis tools and electrical techniques. Using laser doppler interferometry the first four out-of-plane modes of the ring structure were found to be typically 9. 893 kHz, 11. 349 kHz, 11. 418 kHz and 13. 904 kHz with respective Q-factors of 1151, 1659, 1573 and 1407 at 0. 01 mbar ambient pressure. Although electrical measurements were found to be obscured through cross coupling between drive and detection circuitry, the in-plane operational modes of the gyroscope were sucessfully determined. The Cos 2 Ө and Sin 2 Ө operational modes were measured at 36. 141 kHz and 36. 346 kHz, highlighting a frequency split of 205 kHz. Again all experimentally derived modal parameters were in good agreement with finite element predictions. Furthermore, using the analysis model, the angular resolution of the gyroscope has been predicted to be approximately 4. 75 º/s...|$|R
40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) is an innovative composite material {{consisting of a}} fine grained concrete and a non-corroding textile reinforcement made of high strength carbon or alkali-resistant glass fibers. Due to the non-corroding textile fabrics thin-walled, light-weight structures can be constructed with TRC. In Germany in two collaborative research centers, one at RWTH Aachen University and the other at the Technical University Dresden, the new composite material was systematically investigated in recent years. Based on interdisciplinary research results experimental and numerical methods {{have been developed for}} material characterization giving a deeper insight in the complex material behavior of the new composite material. The high application potential of TRC in the construction industry has been demonstrated by various application examples ranging from large-sized facade <b>elements,</b> <b>self-supporting</b> sandwich panels to pedestrian bridges. Furthermore, the innovative composite has a high application potential in the field of strengthening of existing steel {{reinforced concrete}} structures. The material characteristics of TRC are also particularly attractive for filigree concrete shell structures as the flexible textile fabrics can be easily adapted to complex curved geometries. Due to their low weight TRC structures can be efficiently fabricated as precast elements and mounted on site. Compared to conventional steel reinforced shell structures using labor-intensive formworks the technical challenges arising in the context of TRC constructions shift to lifting, adjusting and coupling of the individual precast elements. As the dimensioning approaches developed within the collaborative research center mainly focus on linear structural elements such as truss and beam elements they had to be adopted to spatial structures and general loading conditions. Therefore a dimensioning approach for TRC shell structures with combined normal and bending loading has been developed. The underlying n-m interaction diagram is based on the cross-sectional strength characteristic of the composite. The nonlinear load-bearing behavior of TRC shell structures including stress redistribution has been investigated with a formulated anisotropic damage model. Starting point of the developed calibration procedure for the material model is the characteristic strain-hardening response of the composite material measured in the tensile tests. In order to provide a reproducible material characterization suitable test setups for TRC are needed. The developed experimental and numerical concepts are described in detail and exemplified for two TRC shell structures recently constructed at RWTH Aachen University. Furthermore, the fabrication technique applied for TRC shell structures is described differing strongly from the approaches used for conventional steel reinforced concrete. Especially the high positional accuracy within the cross-section of the filigree TRC shells requires innovative solutions...|$|R
