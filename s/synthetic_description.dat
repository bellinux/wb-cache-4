The blowup of the projective plane P2 at the point P, which we will denote X, isX is a projective variety {{because it is a}} closed subvariety of a product of projective varieties. It comes with a natural morphism π to P2 that takes the pair [...] to Q. This morphism is an isomorphism on the open subset of all points [...] with Q ≠ P because the line [...] is determined by those two points. When Q = P, however, the line [...] can be any line through P. These lines correspond to the space of directions through P, which is isomorphic to P1. This P1 is called the exceptional divisor, and by definition it is the projectivized normal space at P. Because P is a point, the normal space {{is the same as the}} tangent space, so the exceptional divisor is isomorphic to the projectivized tangent space at P.|$|E

Unlike existing systems, SPLAY covers {{all aspects of the}} development and evaluation chain. It allows developers to express algorithms in a concise, simple language that highly resembles pseudocode found in research papers. The execution environment has low overheads and footprint, and provides a comprehensive set of libraries for common distributed systems operations. SPLAY applications are run by a set of daemons distributed on one or several testbeds. They execute in a sandboxed environment that shields the host system and enables SPLAY to also be used on nondedicated platforms, in addition to classical testbeds like PlanetLab or ModelNet. A controller manages applications, offering multi-criterion resource selection, deployment control, and churn management by reproducing the system’s dynamics from traces or <b>synthetic</b> <b>descriptions.</b> SPLAY’s features, usefulness, performance and scalability are evaluated using deployment of representative experiments on PlanetLab and ModelNet clusters. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{classical}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the {{osculating plane}} {{of a space}} curve k, at a point P 2 k, are: 1) it is the plane given by the tangent at P and a neighbour point on k; or 2) it is the plane given by P and a neighbour tangent; or 3) it is the plane given by P and two consecutive neighbours of P on k; or, finally, 4) it is the (common) tangent plane of the surface, swept out by the tangents of the space curve, taken at any point of the tangent through P. Only the last description matches perfectly with the analytic formalism, by means of which the theory is usually made rigourous. We shall present a formalism which a little more directly fits with (or vindicates) the three last of these descriptions; and which is rigourous. It does not vindicate the first description; for, in our formalism, the...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyze the {{applicability}} of crowding differential evolution to unsupervised clustering. The basic idea of this approach, interpreting the clustering problem as a multi-modal optimization one, {{is similar to that}} of unsupervised niche clustering proposed by Nasraoui et al. [10] but instead of evolving only the clusters centers and statistically estimating the other parameters (scales and orientation) we evolve both the centers and the param-eters of the clusters. Moreover, to simplify the evolutionary process, especially in the case of high-dimensional data, we evolve only hyper-ellipsoids parallel with the axes. In order to model rotated clusters we used a multi-center represen-tation, i. e. the cluster is covered by many normally oriented hyper-ellipsoids. Besides the fact that it simplifies the evolu-tionary process this multi-center representation allows de-scribing almost arbitrary shaped clusters. Preliminary ex-perimental results suggest that the proposed approach en-sures a reliable identification of clusters in noisy data pro-viding in the same time multi-center <b>synthetic</b> <b>descriptions</b> for them. ...|$|R

These applications address a broad scientific community beyond the solar and stellar one and require combining indices elaborated with data from different databases (e. g. seismic archives and ground-based spectroscopic surveys).

40|$|The {{availability}} of many genome sequences gives us abundant information, which is, however, {{very difficult to}} decode. As a consequence, in order to advance our understanding of biological processes at the whole-cell scale, it becomes very important to develop higher-level, <b>synthetic</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{of the contents of}} a genome. At the protein level, an effective scale of description is provided by protein domains. Domains are independent unit-shapes (or &#x 22;folds&#x 22;) forming proteins. They are structurally stable and have thermodynamic origin. A domain determines a set of potential functions and interactions for the protein that carries it, for example DNA- or protein-binding capability or catalytic sites. Protein domains are found on genomes with notable statistical distributions, which bear a high degree of similarity. A stochastic growth model with two universal parameters, related to a minimal number of domains and to the relative time-scale of innovation to duplication reproduces two important features of these distributions: (i) the populations of domain classes (the sets, related to homology classes, containing realizations of the same domain in different proteins) follow common power-laws whose diversity is related to genome size measured {{by the total number of}} proteins or protein domains and (ii) the number of domain families is sublinear in genome size. In this evolutionary process, selective pressure can enter both as a global constraint on the innovation time-scale, and as a regulator of the population of specific domain classes, related to their modularity: some shapes are common to all genomes, some are contextual. These two features are sufficient to obtain general quantitative agreement with data from hundreds of genomes, and show that robust self-organizing phenomena encase specific selective pressures during evolution...|$|R

GEOGINE {{can be used as}} an efficient computational kernel for fast reliable application development and delivery in advanced biomedical engineering, biometric, intelligent computing, target recognition, content image retrieval, data mining technological areas mainly. Ontology can be regarded as a logical theory accounting for the intended meaning of a formal dictionary, i. e., its ontological commitment to a particular conceptualization of the world object. According to this approach, "n-D Tensor Calculus" can be considered a "Formal Language" to reliably compute optimized "n-Dimensional Tensor Invariants" as specific object "invariant parameter and attribute words" for automated n-Dimensional shape/texture optimal <b>synthetic</b> object <b>description</b> by incremental model generation. The class of those "invariant parameter and attribute words" can be thought as a specific "Formal Vocabulary" learned from a "Generalized Formal Dictionary" of the "Computational Tensor Invariants" language. Even object chromatic attributes can be effectively and reliably computed from object geometric parameters into robust colour shape invariant characteristics. As a matter of fact, any highly sophisticated application needing effective, robust object geometric/colour invariant attribute capture and parameterization features, for reliable automated object learning and discrimination can deeply benefit from GEOGINE progressive automated model generation computational kernel performance.

To make the experiment more realistic in terms of autocorrelation structure and marginal distribution, each yi(t) is a real fMRI time series with length T= 1200 (see “Applications in fMRI data” section). The five mother time series yi(t) are uncorrelated (absolute cross-correlation <[*] 0.05 at all lags), and they are normalized to zero-mean, unit-variance. To create correlations between domains (i.e., domain-level edges), we construct five new time series xi(t) based on linear combinations of two or more mother time series. For instance, if we set xi(t)=(1 −α)yi(t)+αyj(t+τ) with 0 <α< 1 and xj(t)=yj(t), domains i and j become positively correlated at a lag τ; the correlation increases with α. The time series xi are again normalized to zero-mean, unit-variance. We then scale the time series of domain i by a factor √(s_i) to control the variance of each domain (Var[xi(t)]=si).|$|R
