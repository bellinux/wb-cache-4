5|$|Grace {{may have}} felt pleased that he had got his man {{but he did not}} get his expenses, for Surrey refused to pay them. There was a <b>subscript</b> the {{following}} winter when Grace and his brother E. M. were called to account by the Gloucestershire membership and a special enquiry was ordered.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbol for}} {{pressure}} is usually P or p which may use a <b>subscript</b> {{to identify the}} pressure, and gas species are also referred to by <b>subscript.</b> When combined these subscripts are applied recursively.|$|E
25|$|If a text (such as this one) {{discusses}} multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, {{the base}} (itself represented in base10) is added in <b>subscript</b> {{to the right}} of the number, like this: numberbase. Unless specified by context, numbers without <b>subscript</b> are considered to be decimal.|$|E
40|$|Mata is Stata's matrix language. In the Mata Matters column, we {{show how}} Mata {{can be used}} interactively to solve {{problems}} and as a programming language to add new features to Stata. <b>Subscripting</b> {{is the subject of}} this column. Stata has three <b>subscripting</b> modes, and two of them are about more than accessing an element of a vector or matrix. The advanced forms of <b>subscripting</b> can, by themselves, be the solution to some problems. Mata, <b>subscripts,</b> list <b>subscripts,</b> range <b>subscripts,</b> sampling with replacement, permutation matrices and vectors...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{only one}} data {{structure}} - multi-dimensional sparse arrays (key-value nodes, sub-trees, and associative memory are all equally valid descriptions) with up to 32 <b>subscripts.</b> A scalar {{can be thought of}} as an array element with zero <b>subscripts.</b> Nodes with varying numbers of <b>subscripts</b> (including one node with no <b>subscripts)</b> can freely co-exist in the same array. For example, if one wanted to represent the national capitals of the United States: ...|$|R
25|$|For {{electronic}} wavefunctions, even {{states are}} usually indicated by a <b>subscript</b> g for gerade (German: even) and odd states by a <b>subscript</b> u for ungerade (German: odd). For example, the lowest energy {{level of the}} hydrogen molecule ion (H2+) is labelled 1σg and the next-closest (higher) energy level is labelled 1σu.|$|E
25|$|In {{contexts}} {{where the}} base is not clear, hexadecimal numbers can be ambiguous and confused with numbers expressed in other bases. There are several conventions for expressing values unambiguously. A numerical <b>subscript</b> (itself written in decimal) can give the base explicitly: 15910 is decimal 159; 15916 is hexadecimal 159, which is equal to 34510. Some authors prefer a text <b>subscript,</b> such as 159decimal and 159hex, or 159d and 159h.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no signs}} of iota adscript or iota <b>subscript.</b> N εφελκυστικον is met with 63 times.|$|E
3000|$|... where {{a spatial}} {{subchannel}} pair is denoted by an accent with <b>subscripts</b> (n,l) and a subchannel-antenna pair is denoted by <b>subscripts</b> (n,m).|$|R
40|$|If the {{elements}} of continued fraction-oriented physical and mathematical systems are systematically arranged with respect to <b>subscripts</b> attached to {{the elements}}, the choice of order and parity for the <b>subscripts</b> often leads to easily implemented algorithms for the combinatorial determination of the <b>subscripts.</b> All the essential information of the problem ca...|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. Summation over {{repeated}} <b>subscripts</b> {{is implied}} and <b>subscripts</b> {{preceded by a}} comma denote partial differentiation {{with respect to the}} corresponding Cartesian coordinate.|$|R
25|$|If the meson is not pseudoscalar (JP = 0−) or vector (JP = 1−), J {{is added}} as a <b>subscript.</b>|$|E
25|$|In many {{quantum field}} theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, left- and {{right-handed}} fermions are identical. However, in the Standard Model, left-handed and right-handed fermions are treated asymmetrically. Only left-handed fermions {{participate in the}} weak interaction, {{while there are no}} right-handed neutrinos. This is an example of parity violation. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital L <b>subscript</b> (e.g. L) and right-handed fields are denoted by a capital R <b>subscript.</b>|$|E
25|$|In electrochemistry, lambda also {{denotes the}} ionic {{conductance}} {{of a given}} ion (The composition of the ion is generally shown as a <b>subscript</b> to the lambda character).|$|E
5000|$|When using Apple LLVM {{compiler}} 4.0 or later, arrays and dictionaries ( [...] and [...] classes) can {{be manipulated}} using <b>subscripting.</b> [...] <b>Subscripting</b> {{can be used to}} retrieve values from indexes (array) or keys (dictionary), and with mutable objects, {{can also be used to}} set objects to indexes or keys. In code, <b>subscripting</b> is represented using brackets [...]|$|R
5000|$|The M {{database}} is a key-value database engine {{optimized for}} high-throughput transaction processing. As such {{it is in}} the class of [...] "schema-less", [...] "schema-free," [...] or NoSQL databases. Internally, M stores data in multidimensional hierarchical sparse arrays (also known as key-value nodes, sub-trees, or associative memory). Each array may have up to 32 <b>subscripts,</b> or dimensions. A scalar {{can be thought of as}} an array element with zero <b>subscripts.</b> Nodes with varying numbers of <b>subscripts</b> (including one node with no <b>subscripts)</b> can freely co-exist in the same array.|$|R
5000|$|... {{where the}} [...] are the longitudes of perihelia and the [...] are the longitudes of the {{ascending}} nodes, for Neptune (with <b>subscripts</b> [...] "N") and the resonant object (no <b>subscripts).</b>|$|R
25|$|It is the {{evolution}} function when the control inputs (or source term, or forcing inputs) are Heaviside functions: the notation emphasizes this concept showing H(t) as a <b>subscript.</b>|$|E
25|$|The group symbol <b>subscript</b> is {{one less}} {{than the number of}} nodes in each case, since each of these groups was {{obtained}} by adding a node to a finite group's graph.|$|E
25|$|Drug regimens are {{similarly}} abbreviated in a standardised manner. The drugs are listed using their single letter abbreviations (in the order given above, which {{is roughly the}} order of introduction into clinical practice). A prefix denotes the number of months the treatment should be given for; a <b>subscript</b> denotes intermittent dosing (so 3 means three times a week) and no <b>subscript</b> means daily dosing. Most regimens have an initial high-intensity phase, followed by a continuation phase (also called a consolidation phase or eradication phase): the high-intensity phase is given first, then the continuation phase, the two phases divided by a slash.|$|E
50|$|Note: The <b>subscripts</b> {{outside the}} {{parenthesis}} indicate which variables {{are being held}} constant during differentiation. Due {{to the definition of}} the partial derivative, these <b>subscripts</b> are not required, but they are included as a reminder.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{dimension}} of an array value in Analytica is identified by an Index variable. When slicing or <b>subscripting,</b> the syntax identifies the dimension(s) over {{which you are}} slicing or <b>subscripting</b> by naming the dimension. Such as: ...|$|R
3000|$|Here, d {{indicates}} {{thickness of}} each structure, the <b>subscripts</b> ⊥ and ∥ denote components perpendicular and {{parallel to the}} anisotropy axis, and the <b>subscripts</b> m and d indicate metal and dielectric material, respectively. Effective permittivity ε [...]...|$|R
25|$|The {{coordination}} {{number of}} ligands attached {{to more than}} one metal (bridging ligands) is indicated by a <b>subscript</b> to the Greek symbol μ placed before the ligand name. Thus the dimer of aluminium trichloride is described by Al2Cl4(μ2-Cl)2.|$|E
25|$|The Int type {{refers to}} a machine-sized integer (used as a list <b>subscript</b> with the !! operator), while Integer is an arbitrary-precision integer. For example, using Integer, the {{factorial}} code above easily computes factorial 100000 {{as a number of}} 456,574 digits, with no loss of precision.|$|E
25|$|Irreducible root {{systems are}} named {{according}} to their corresponding connected Dynkin diagrams. There are four infinite families (An, Bn, Cn, and Dn, called the classical root systems) and five exceptional cases (the exceptional root systems). The <b>subscript</b> indicates the rank of the root system.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{derivatives}} are used: Partial derivatives are denoted either by the operator [...] or by <b>subscripts</b> preceded by a comma. Covariant derivatives are denoted either by the operator [...] or by <b>subscripts</b> preceded by a semicolon.|$|R

500|$|... {{where the}} <b>subscripts</b> denote the {{respective}} partial derivatives.|$|R
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} notation, due to the 1927 paper of J. W. Alexander and G. Briggs and later extended by Dale Rolfsen in his knot table (see image above and List of prime knots). The notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number. One writes the crossing number with a <b>subscript</b> to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number. This order is arbitrary and so has no special significance (though in each number of crossings the twist knot comes after the torus knot). Links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a <b>subscript</b> to denote its order within the links with {{the same number of}} components and crossings. Thus the trefoil knot is notated 31 and the Hopf link is 2.|$|E
25|$|Unlike kana, {{which uses}} a <b>subscript</b> e, in braille the -ye in foreign {{borrowings}} is written with yōon and the kana from the e row: that is, kye, she, che, nye, hye, mye, rye, voiced gye, je, bye, and plosive pye are written with the yōon prefixes plus ke, se, te, ne, he, me, re. The syllable ye is written yōon plus e.|$|E
25|$|The h {{refers to}} its being an h-parameter, {{a set of}} {{parameters}} named for their origin in a hybrid equivalent circuit model. F is from forward current amplification also called the current gain. E refers to the transistor operating in a common emitter (CE) configuration. Capital letters used in the <b>subscript</b> indicate that hFE refers to a direct current circuit.|$|E
