50|$|Wartenberg's migratory sensory {{neuropathy}} (also {{known as}} Wartenberg's migrant sensory neuritis) (WMSN) {{is a rare}} condition identified by Robert Wartenberg in 1958 which is easy to confuse with {{the early stages of}} multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. However this is a benign relapsing and remitting condition in which pain and subsequent loss of sensation in the distribution of individual cutaneous nerves is induced by movement of the limbs inducing stretch. The movements may be very small, and the periods of pain, dysaesthesia, and numbness can vary from almost instantaneous to chronic. In some cases, reports discount WMSN as a diagnosis where there is less prominent pain. Wartenberg’s sensory neuritis is a distinct, exclusively sensory, neuropathy, marked by pain preceding numbness in affected nerves. An episode of stretching preceding pain is not necessary for the diagnosis.

50|$|After the {{extraction}} and tea creaming processes, the tea solution {{is still too}} dilute to pass through a drier. Drying at this point would take too much capital for little gain, and any type of spray or freeze-drying would cause the resulting powder to have too low a density. The answer is to first concentrate the solution to what is usually 40% solids before drying, which involves the removal of water through evaporation. Concentration of tea is normally done through reduction of pressure. At high temperatures, the theaflavins in the solution are converted to thearubigins and carbohydrates caramelize. Forced evaporation systems had hot spots which led to undesirable <b>sensory</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as stewed and burnt flavors. Plate heat exchangers can cause the desired evaporation at around 45 °C, with short residence times that {{reduce the risk of}} thermal damage. This method can produce an extract with 45% solids. Aroma stripping is done prior to concentration, because those compounds run the risk of being lost during evaporation.|$|E
