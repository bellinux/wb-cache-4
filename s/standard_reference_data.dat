40|$|Quantitative {{evaluation}} of image registration algorithms {{is a difficult}} and under-addressed issue {{due to the lack}} of a <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> in most registration problems. In this work a method is presented whereby detailed <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> <b>data</b> may be constructed in an efficient semi-automatic fashion. A well-distributed set of n landmarks is detected fully automatically in one scan of a pair to be registered. Using a custom-designed interface, observers define corresponding anatomic locations in the second scan for a specified subset of s of these landmarks. The remaining n- s landmarks are matched fully automatically by a thin-plate-spline based system using the s manual landmark correspondences to model the relationship between the scans. The method is applied to 47 pairs of temporal thoracic CT scans, three pairs of brain MR scans and five thoracic CT datasets with synthetic deformations. Interobserver differences are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the matched points. The utility of the <b>reference</b> <b>standard</b> <b>data</b> as a tool in evaluating registration is shown by the comparison of six sets of registration results on the 47 pairs of thoracic CT data. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract Background Using genomic DNA {{as common}} {{reference}} in microarray experiments {{has recently been}} tested by different laboratories. Conflicting results have been reported {{with regard to the}} reliability of microarray results using this method. To explain it, we hypothesize that data processing is a critical element that impacts the data quality. Results Microarray experiments were performed in a γ-proteobacterium Shewanella oneidensis. Pair-wise comparison of three experimental conditions was obtained either with two labeled cDNA samples co-hybridized to the same array, or by employing Shewanella genomic DNA as a <b>standard</b> <b>reference.</b> Various <b>data</b> processing techniques were exploited {{to reduce the amount of}} inconsistency between both methods and the results were assessed. We discovered that data quality was significantly improved by imposing the constraint of minimal number of replicates, logarithmic transformation and random error analyses. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that data processing significantly influences data quality, which provides an explanation for the conflicting evaluation in the literature. This work could serve as a guideline for microarray data analysis using genomic DNA as a <b>standard</b> <b>reference.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|While the {{near-infrared}} wavelength {{regime is}} becoming more and more important for astrophysics there is a marked lack of spectrophotometric standard star data that would allow the flux calibration of such data. Furthermore, flux calibrating medium- to high-resolution échelle spectroscopy data is challenging even in the optical wavelength range, because the available flux standard data are often too coarsely sampled. We will provide <b>standard</b> star <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> that allow users to derive response curves from 300 nm to 2500 nm for spectroscopic data of medium to high resolution, including those taken with échelle spectrographs. In addition we describe a method to correct for moderate telluric absorption without the need of observing telluric <b>standard</b> stars. As <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> for the flux standard stars we use theoretical spectra derived from stellar model atmospheres. We verify that they provide an appropriate description of the observed standard star spectra by checking for residuals in line cores and line overlap regions in the ratios of observed (X-shooter) spectra to model spectra. The finally selected model spectra are then corrected for remaining mismatches and photometrically calibrated using independent observations. The correction of telluric absorption is performed with the help of telluric model spectra. We provide new, finely sampled reference spectra without telluric absorption for six southern flux standard stars that allow the users to flux calibrate their data from 300 nm to 2500 nm, and a method to correct for telluric absorption using atmospheric models.

40|$|We address two {{problems}} in the lifecycle of a production classifier: the monitoring of its decisions quality and the updating of the classifier over time. The proposed architecture consists of four off-line classifiers and an associative fusion module. The fusion is a T-norm based outer-product of the classifiers ’ normalized outputs. By attaching a confidence measure to each output of the fusion, we generate a distribution of the production classifier’s quality. The lower tail of this distribution identifies the least reliable cases, which become candidates for auditing and manual QA. The upper tail identifies the most reliable cases, which become candidates for updating the <b>standard</b> <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> set used to design and tune the production classifier.
