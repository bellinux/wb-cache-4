5|$|All {{the guests}} agree to stay — except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, {{they decide to}} return home but {{on the way to}} the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's nothing more than a brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.|$|E
5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, {{but after the}} first day of the trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate in}} Bulgarian {{academic}} circles {{as to whether}} the church was built as a monastery church or as a separate cathedral. If the buildings neighbouring the church are interpreted as the residential part of a monastery, it was most probably established after the construction of the Round Church, during the rule of Tsar Peter I (r. 927–969). The absence of entrances on these buildings on the sides facing the church and the presence of a large atrium make it unlikely. Another argument against the Round Church being a monastery church is its location, isolated from other buildings yet accessible to the public outside the inner city. Scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it a city cathedral and compares it in function to the Great Basilica in Pliska. Another researcher, Krastyu Miyatev, <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> royal church of Simeon, but art historian Nikola Mavrodinov and archaeologist Totyu Totev insist it belonged to a monastery from the beginning.|$|E

50|$|The {{sentence}} {{has raised}} a controversy {{all around the}} world, with disputes between those who <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victory {{for human rights and}} freedom from intolerance, and those who <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attack on religious freedom and the right to free speech, which in themselves are both regarded as human rights.|$|R
5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> betrayal. At {{the end of the}} novel Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{original}} building no longer exists, Mr Nelson of Friars' Carse built another 'Hermitage', {{of a different}} design, on the same site in 1874. The British Listed Building register <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 're-surfaced' building of circa 1790. Adamson visited it in 1879 and records that it contained the rigid form of a monk, with shaven crown, chipped nose, and folded hands, lying on its back at the entrance. The building otherwise only contained a chair and a small table. The building was recently (2009) restored again and now has an interpretation board detailing its history and a trail guide indicates its location.|$|E

25|$|Thus Tillich dismisses a literalistic Biblicism. Instead of {{rejecting the}} notion of {{personal}} God, however, Tillich <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being. Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject–object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements {{that can be made}} about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to anthropomorphism but also to a philosophical mistake that Immanuel Kant warned against, that setting limits against the transcendent inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred {{in the sense that they}} function to participate or point to the Ground of Being. Tillich insists that anyone who participates in these symbols is empowered by the Power of Being, which overcomes and conquers nonbeing and meaninglessness.|$|E

Hao Wei <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign to confess his feelings for Kai Qi, but she rejects him midway into his confession. Knowing what her answer will be beforehand, Hao Wei tells her he will be leaving the country to pursue his real interest. Ah Jie unhappy with Kai Qi running out on him that day, has the entire restaurant staff help him teach her a lesson by pretending to ignore his love for her. Knowing she has done Ah Jie wrong, Kai Qi puts her pride aside and publicly confesses her love for Ah Jie.|$|E

500|$|The keys in {{this section}} refer to the Weimar version, {{although}} the recording by Masaaki Suzuki, with commentary by Klaus Hofmann, uses the Leipzig keys. Hofmann notes the work's [...] "Lutheran character", quoting Luther's litany inserted in the third movement, and <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "recitative study", exploring the secco recitative of the Italian opera, introduced by Erdmann Neumeister, and also the accompagnato with rich instrumental accompaniment. Gardiner finds all three cantatas for the occasion, dealing with God's word, [...] "characterised by his vivid pictorial imagination, an arresting sense of drama, and by music of freshness and power that lodges in the memory".|$|E

500|$|Tobin {{experimented with}} various instruments. He {{does not come}} from a music family, nor has he had any formal {{training}} in music theory. About his music in general, Tobin says that he <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "genuine" [...] expression of the time he lives in, as he says that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were [...] "genuine" [...] expressions of the 1960s. Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo. Tobin's albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.|$|E

500|$|During {{his years}} in Venice Monteverdi {{published}} his sixth (1614), seventh (1619) and eighth (1638) books of madrigals. The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua. Hans Redlich <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions {{in the manner of}} the prima pratica, together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607–08. The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of Lamento d'Arianna, which, says Massimo Ossi, gives [...] "an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint". The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by Giambattista Marino, and two settings of Petrarch which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some [...] "stunning musical moments".|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{the town}} the {{bridge over the}} river still exists and the river symbolizes time and timelessness, healing and the natural cycle of life and death. Nick is on a journey, perhaps he <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{religious}} quest given the Christian symbolism of the fish. From the town, a road leads into pristine back-country. It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current, just as Nick needs to hold steady. From the bridge he glimpses a kingfisher taking wing, a bird Johnston points out symbolizes [...] "halcyon days, peace and tranquility". A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war, and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully {{so as not to}} damage its protective slime coat. The campsite symbolizes safety, set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture.|$|E
500|$|Traveling Shoes is [...] "more tightly controlled" [...] than Angelou's {{previous}} books, {{most likely}} due to {{the dominance of the}} travel motif. [...] Setting, always an important element for Angelou, becomes even more important in this book. [...] Unlike her previous books, most of this book's action occurs in one setting, Accra, which contributes to and is tightly connected with her personal development. Angelou's feelings towards living in Ghana are ambivalent, which provides Traveling Shoes with richness and depth. [...] Many feel that Angelou's inclusion of her tour with The Blacks to Berlin and Venice as a digression that detracts from the African setting, but Lupton <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> contribution to her character development and provides the book with a [...] "universal quality" [...] as Angelou reaches beyond the confines of her personal life and encounters racism in Germany. [...] During this trip, she comes to see her fellow African-Americans differently, as more spirited than the Africans she has met in Ghana.|$|E
