40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to {{studying}} the boundedness on Lebesgue spaces of bilinear multipliers on whose symbol is narrowly supported around a curve (in the frequency plane). We {{are looking for the}} optimal decay rate (depending on the width of this support) for exponents satisfying a <b>sub-HÃ¶lder</b> scaling. As expected, the geometry of the curve plays an important role, which is described. This has applications for the bilinear Bochner-Riesz problem (in particular, boundedness of multipliers whose symbol is the characteristic function of a set), {{as well as for the}} bilinear restriction-extension problem.
