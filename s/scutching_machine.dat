25|$|Scutching {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first <b>scutching</b> <b>machine</b> was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The <b>scutching</b> <b>machine</b> worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|E
50|$|A modern <b>scutching</b> <b>machine</b> can {{process up to}} 500 kg of flax every hour, and {{produces}} about 70 kg of flax fibers and 30 kg of tow. Older machines create more waste.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} days of the cotton {{industry}} the raw material was manually beaten with sticks after being placed on a mesh, a process known as willowing or batting, until the task was mechanised by the development of machines known as willowers. <b>Scutching</b> <b>machines</b> were introduced in the early 19th-century, and processed the raw material into a continuous sheet of cotton wadding known as a lap.|$|R
50|$|Scutching is done {{several ways}} by <b>machine.</b> <b>Scutching</b> mills started in Ireland, and were {{commonly}} used there by 1850, {{at a time when}} hand scutching was still common in Continental Europe. <b>Machine</b> <b>scutching,</b> while faster and cheaper, causes more waste than scutching by hand. One method of <b>machine</b> <b>scutching</b> is to crush the stalks between two metal rollers so that parts of the stalk can be separated.|$|R
50|$|Before cotton is {{processed}} {{it has to}} be cleaned of its seeds and other impurities, which in the early days was done by spreading the raw cotton on a mesh and beating it with sticks, a process known as willowing or batting. A <b>scutching</b> <b>machine</b> for cotton, known as a scutcher, was invented in 1797, but did not get much attention until it was introduced in Manchester cotton mills in 1808 or 1809.

40|$|The {{cultivation}} of flax {{on the farm}} of Skelton Castle has been prosecuted {{for the last five}} years, and in every season good crops have been obtained. The climate has been found eminently adapted to its growth, and to the after-processes of steeping and grassing. During the first four years it was tried on small portions of land; the breaking and scutching, then effected by hand labour,alone absorbing the value of the flax raised, and rendering its cultivation unprofitable. In 1849 a <b>scutching</b> <b>machine</b> was put up, which, together with other appliances to lessen the amount of manual labour and the benefit of increased experience, occasioned from that year a greater breadth of land to be sown...|$|E
