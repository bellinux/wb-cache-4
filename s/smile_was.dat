25|$|The Beach Boys {{were formed}} by Brian, his {{brothers}} Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Brian, {{who grew up}} influenced by boogie-woogie and jazz-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. He co-wrote, arranged, and produced their LP Pet Sounds (1966), {{considered one of the}} greatest albums ever made. The intended follow-up, <b>Smile,</b> <b>was</b> canceled for various reasons, which included Wilson's deteriorating mental health. As he suffered repeated nervous breakdowns, Wilson's contributions to the Beach Boys diminished, and his erratic behavior led to tensions with the band. In the 1970s, he was increasingly reputed for his hermitic lifestyle and substance abuse. Following a court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy, Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. He remains a member of the Beach Boys' corporation, Brother Records Incorporated.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: THE SMILE: A VIRTUAL AND VIRTUOUS EXPRESSION In {{the theory}} of Helmuth Plessner, an eminent {{contemporary}} philosopher of anthropology, <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> a miming expression independent from laugh. Laugh represents an interruption of a special situation: it is a manifestation of disorder and confusion. <b>Smile</b> <b>is</b> on the contrary a controlled mediation of man {{in regards to the}} world. The nature of <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> usually refined and mitigating; it can reveal, to a careful look, a lot of sensation and psychical conditions. Ultimately, <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> the must virtual and virtuous expression of human eccentricity...|$|R
500|$|From 1966 to 1967, <b>Smile</b> <b>was</b> {{repeatedly}} delayed as the Beach Boys {{were subject}} to a considerable level of media hype amid a publicity campaign that proclaimed [...] "Brian Wilson is a genius". When the group dropped out of headlining the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, they began to be derided by a contingent of the rock press as the archetypal [...] "pop music cop-outs". After settling payment disputes with Capitol Records, Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>was</b> distributed in collaboration with Brother Records, a new record label and holding company founded by the band. Its production was unusually credited to [...] "the Beach Boys" [...] rather than Brian alone, marking {{the point where he}} began relinquishing his hold as the group's creative leader. <b>Smile</b> <b>was</b> ultimately left unfinished as the group embarked on a brief tour of Hawaii, and then, the recording of their next album, Wild Honey, released only three months later.|$|E

It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart. Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album. Leaf wrote: [...] "By the time Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>was</b> released... the Beach Boys had become cultural dinosaurs.

500|$|Among {{the works}} created by Leonardo in the 16th century {{is the small}} {{portrait}} known as the Mona Lisa or [...] "la Gioconda", the laughing one. In the present era it {{is arguably the most}} famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called [...] "sfumato", or Leonardo's smoke.

40|$|A <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} {{frequent}} facial expression, but not all <b>smiles</b> <b>are</b> equal. A social-functional account holds that smiles of reward, affiliation, and dominance serve basic social functions, including rewarding behavior, bonding socially, and negotiating hierarchy. Here, we characterize the facial-expression patterns associated with these three types of smiles. Specifically, we modeled the facial expressions using a data-driven approach and showed that reward <b>smiles</b> <b>are</b> symmetrical and accompanied by eyebrow raising, affiliative smiles involve lip pressing, and dominance <b>smiles</b> <b>are</b> asymmetrical and contain nose wrinkling and upper-lip raising. A Bayesian-classifier analysis and a detection task revealed that the three <b>smile</b> types <b>are</b> highly distinct. Finally, social judgments made by a separate participant group showed that the different smile types convey different social messages. Our results provide the first {{detailed description of the}} physical form and social messages conveyed by these three types of functional smiles and document the versatility of these facial expressions...|$|R

500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} that Smile had been scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for <b>Smile</b> <b>was</b> now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable.

Capitol A director Karl Engemann began circulating a memo, dated July 25, 1967, in which Smiley <b>Smile</b> <b>was</b> {{referred to as a}} [...] "cartoon" [...] stopgap for Smile. The memo also discussed conversations between him and Wilson pertaining to the release of a 10-track Smile album, which would not have included the songs [...] "Heroes and Villains" [...] or [...] "Vegetables". This never came to fruition and, instead, the group embarked on a tour of Hawaii in August. Bruce Johnston, who was absent for most of the recording sessions, did not accompany the group, although Brian did. Their performances were limited to two shows at an auditorium in Honolulu, which were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album, Lei'd in Hawaii. On stage, the band continued to exhibit a more minimal sound.|$|E

I did all that stuff. ... I admit to wanting to make a commercially successful pop record, so I might have complained about some of the lyrics on Smile." [...] Capitol was not interested in Wilson's newest ideas for forthcoming projects, such as an album of found sounds, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, Brother Records. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Love was [...] "the most receptive" [...] to the idea, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Wilson's decision to employ his newfound [...] "best friend" [...] David Anderle {{as the head of the}} label—despite the wishes of band manager Nick Grillo.
