5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of <b>senility.</b> They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E
25|$|After he secured {{hereditary}} {{rule for}} his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when <b>senility</b> made further governance by him impossible.|$|E
25|$|He alone who is {{free from}} hunger, thirst, <b>senility,</b> disease, birth, death, fear, pride, attachment, aversion, infatuation, worry, conceit, hatred, uneasiness, sweat, sleep and {{surprise}} {{is called a}} God.|$|E
25|$|Grampa Simpson is a World War II {{veteran and}} retired farmer who was later {{sent to the}} Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He {{is known for his}} long, rambling, often {{incoherent}} stories and <b>senility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of intelligence, though, he was, in Duel and Duality, able to {{manipulate}} Mrs. Miggins' casual conversation about how stupid Prince George was (George himself was present) so {{that it did not}} offend George. Additionally, in Sense and <b>Senility,</b> he warns the Prince of a supposed plot to kill him.|$|E
25|$|Between 1917 and 1926, Voronoff {{carried out}} over five hundred transplantations on sheep and goats, {{and also on}} a bull, {{grafting}} testicles from younger animals to older ones. Voronoff's observations indicated that the transplantations caused the older animals to regain the vigor of younger animals. He also considered monkey-gland transplantation an effective treatment to counter <b>senility.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1895, <b>senility</b> forced Olmsted to retire. By 1898 {{he moved}} to Belmont, Massachusetts, and took up {{residence}} as a patient at the McLean Hospital, for whose grounds he had submitted a design which was never executed. He remained there {{until his death in}} 1903. He was buried in the Old North Cemetery, in Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Firs – a manservant, aged 87. An aging eccentric, Firs {{considers}} the emancipation of the Russian serfs a disaster, and talks nostalgically {{of the old}} days when everybody admired their masters and owners, such as Gayev's parents and grandparents. His <b>senility</b> is a source of much of the play's poignancy, symbolizing the decay of the old order into muttering madness.|$|E
25|$|After 1843, fast on {{the heels}} of the Syrian debacle, and the treaty of Balta Liman, which forced the Egyptian {{government}} to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine <b>senility</b> or the effects of the silver nitrate he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, the University of St Andrews conferred {{an honorary}} LLD upon Terry, and in 1925 she was {{appointed}} Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, {{only the second}} actress, after Geneviève Ward, to be created a dame for her professional achievements. In her last years, she gradually lost her eyesight and suffered from <b>senility.</b> Stephen Coleridge anonymously published an annotated volume of his correspondence with Terry, The Heart of Ellen Terry, in 1928.|$|E
25|$|The stable {{political}} environment in Arizona that Hayden had enjoyed {{during most of}} his career began to change by the 1950s. Following World War II, large numbers of Midwestern expatriates moved to Arizona and bolstered the growth of the Republican Party within the state. While he was still popular with long-term Arizona residents, many of the new arrivals were unfamiliar with Hayden's congressional record. As a result, during the 1956 election Hayden's campaign produced a number of television and radio appearances designed to inform voters of the Senator's accomplishments and dispel rumors of failing health and <b>senility.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} than 153,000 {{hospital}} beds, 121,000 physicians and 37,000 dentists (ratios comparable to developed nations). The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from tumors from 14% to 20%, respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and infectious diseases, 4%. Causes related to <b>senility</b> led {{to many of the}} rest. Infant deaths have fallen from 19% of all deaths in 1953 to 3% in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 he {{fell and}} injured {{his back and}} used the {{downtime}} from tennis and skiing to write an autobiography called Yet Being Someone Other (1982), which discussed his love {{of the sea and}} his journey to Japan with Plomer in 1926. (His affection for that country and its people, despite his wartime experiences, had first been explored in 1968 in his Portrait of Japan.) By now Ingaret was slipping into <b>senility,</b> and he spent much time with Frances Baruch, an old friend. In 1984 his son John (who had gone on to be an engineer in London) died, and van der Post spent time with his youngest daughter Lucia and her family.|$|E
25|$|Nyle goes to see Dr. Arboria, now aged, {{somewhere on}} the grounds of the Institute. Displaying signs of <b>senility,</b> Arboria remains either ignorant or {{indifferent}} of Nyle's psychosis, regarding him as his best protégé. A flashback to 1966 reveals that Elena's mother was Dr. Arboria's wife, who was present when Arboria himself led a young Nyle through a procedure meant to allow him to achieve transcendence. As a part of the procedure, Nyle was submerged in a vat of black liquid, providing him with hellish, otherworldly visions; Nyle emerged from the vat insane, fatally attacking Mrs. Arboria. An unperturbed Dr. Arboria is shown submerging the infant Elena in the black liquid. Back in the present, Nyle kills Arboria by administering a drug overdose.|$|E
25|$|Each Senate {{committee}} and subcommittee {{is led by}} a chair (usually {{a member of the}} majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even <b>senility.</b> Committee chairs are elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: they control the committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president; they manage {{on the floor of the}} full Senate the consideration of those bills the committee reports. This last role was particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence: senators who cooperate with their committee chairs are likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it, than they were before reform. The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking member. In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as the vice chair.|$|E
500|$|Abraham Jedediah [...] "Abe" [...] Simpson, II (better known {{simply as}} Grampa), voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is the patriarch of the Simpson family, the father of Homer. He is a World War II veteran who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He {{is known for his}} {{borderline}} <b>senility,</b> his long rambling (and probably apocryphal) stories and his love of Matlock. He shares his name with one of Matt Groening's relatives, in this case his grandfather. However, Groening says he refused to name him, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, the writers chose the name Abraham.|$|E
500|$|Moran's {{accounts}} even altered dates. At different points, {{he claimed}} Poe {{was brought to}} the hospital on October 3 at 5 p.m., on October 6 at 9 a.m., or on October 7 (the day he died) at [...] "10 o'clock in the afternoon". For each published account, he claimed to have the hospital records as reference. A search for hospital records a century later, specifically an official death certificate, found nothing. Some critics claim Moran's inconsistencies and errors were due only to a lapse of memory, an innocent desire to romanticize, or even to <b>senility.</b> At the time he wrote and published his last account in 1885, Moran was 65.|$|E
500|$|The {{efforts of}} the Prince Regent to gain his sisters {{increased}} independence were further hastened along with Queen Charlotte's death in 1818. In her last years, Sophia resided in the household of her niece Princess Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria), at Kensington Palace. There, she fell under the sway of Victoria's comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who took advantage of her <b>senility</b> and blindness; rumours also circulated that Sophia was in awe of Conroy because {{of his ability to}} deal effectively with the [...] "bullying importunities" [...] of Sophia's supposed illegitimate son. Sophia frequently served as his spy on the Kensington household as well as on her two elder brothers, while Conroy squandered most of her money. The princess died on 27 May 1848 at her residence in Vicarage Place, Kensington Palace.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{suggestions}} of <b>senility</b> in later life, Princess Andrew remained lucid but physically frail. She died at Buckingham Palace on 5 December 1969. She left no possessions, having given everything away. Initially her remains {{were placed in}} the Royal Crypt in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, but before she died she had expressed her wish to be buried at the Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene in Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem (near her aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, a Russian Orthodox saint). When her daughter, Princess George of Hanover, complained that it would be too far away for them to visit her grave, Princess Andrew jested, [...] "Nonsense, there's a perfectly good bus service!" [...] Her wish was realized on 3 August 1988 when her remains were transferred to her final resting place in a crypt below the church.|$|E
500|$|By 1971, Edna Stengel {{was showing}} signs of Alzheimer's disease, and in 1973, {{following}} a stroke, she was moved into a nursing home. Casey Stengel continued to live in his Glendale home {{with the help of}} his housekeeper June Bowdin. Stengel himself showed signs of <b>senility</b> in his last years, and during the final year of his life, these increased. In his last year, Stengel cut back on his travel schedule, and was too ill to attend the Yankees' Old-Timers Day game in August 1975, at which it was announced that Billy Martin would be the new team manager. A diagnosis of cancer of the lymph glands had been made, and Stengel realized he was dying. In mid-September, he was admitted to Glendale Memorial Hospital, but the cancer was inoperable. [...] He died there on September 29, 1975. Stengel was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale.|$|E
500|$|In 1949 Wheeler was {{appointed}} Honorary Secretary of the British Academy after Frederic G. Kenyon {{stepped down from}} the position. According to Piggott, the institution had [...] "unhappily drifted into <b>senility</b> without the excuse of being venerable", and Wheeler devoted much time attempting to revitalise the organisation and ensured that Charles Webster {{was appointed}} President. Together, Wheeler and Webster sought {{to increase the number of}} younger members of the Academy, increasing the number of Fellows who were permitted to join and proposing that those over 75 years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation's council; this latter measure was highly controversial, and though defeated in 1951, Wheeler and Webster were able to push it through in 1952. In doing so, Piggott stated, Wheeler helped rid the society of its [...] "self-perpetuating gerontocracy". To aid him in these projects, Wheeler employed a personal assistant, Molly Myers, who remained with him for the rest of his life.|$|E
500|$|Grant (1992) {{acknowledges}} that Robert II's reign {{in terms of}} foreign and domestic policy was [...] "not so unsuccessful". [...] As far as William, Earl of Douglas's reaction was concerned when he staged an armed demonstration before Robert's coronation, Grant does not hold {{to the view that}} Douglas was in some way demonstrating against Robert's legitimate right to the throne, but more an assertion that royal patronage should not continue as in the time of David II. [...] Grant also advocates that the demonstration was aimed at father and son Robert and Thomas Erskine, who held the castles of Edinburgh, Stirling and Dumbarton from Robert's predecessor. [...] Grant seriously called into question the dependability of Froissart's writings as an effective source for Robert II's reign. [...] Influential magnate coalitions headed by Carrick, having undermined the king's position, manipulated the Council of November 1384 to effectively oust Robert II from any real power. [...] Grant gives little weight to the asserted <b>senility</b> of Robert, and suggests that the deposition of Carrick in 1388, and then the resolution to join the Anglo-French truce of 1389, were both at the instigation of Robert II. [...] Yet power was not handed back to Robert II but to Carrick's younger brother, Robert, earl of Fife which once again saw the king at the disposition of one of his sons. [...] Despite this, the now unknown source whom both Wyntoun and Bower relied on made the point that Fife deferred to his father on affairs of state emphasising the difference in styles in the guardianships of his two sons.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} in the episode Sense and <b>Senility,</b> his uncle with the Baldrick surname once played as a [...] "second codpiece" [...] for the leading character of Macbeth, {{but only in the}} fight scenes. Blackadder concludes that the uncle was a [...] "stunt codpiece" [...] and inquires if he ever had a [...] "large part", to which Baldrick answers that it [...] "depends who was playing Macbeth".|$|E
2500|$|Chi Zhi (Ganoderma rubra) is {{bitter and}} balanced. It mainly treats binding in the chest, boosts the heart qi, {{supplements}} the center, sharpens the wits, and [...] {{not to forget}} [...] Protracted taking may make the body light, prevent <b>senility,</b> and prolong life {{so as to make}} one an immortal. Its other name is Dan Zhi (Cinnabar Ganoderma). It grows in mountains and valleys.|$|E
2500|$|Burnet's last {{public service}} came in 1868, {{when he was}} {{appointed}} as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention which nominated Horatio Seymour for president. [...] In his later years, Burnet suffered from <b>senility,</b> and before his death he carried a trunk of his private papers into an empty lot and burned them all. [...] He died on December 5, 1870, aged 82, in Galveston. [...] He was first buried in Magnolia Cemetery, but in 1894 his remains were moved to Galveston's Lakeview Cemetery, where he was buried next to Sidney Sherman's grave.|$|E
2500|$|Keaton's {{first film}} of 2000 was Hanging Up with Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. Keaton also {{directed}} the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview {{that she would}} never direct herself in a film, saying [...] "as a director, you automatically have different goals. I can't think about directing when I'm acting." [...] The film was a drama about three sisters coping with the <b>senility</b> and eventual death of their elderly father, played by Walter Matthau. Hanging Up rated poorly with critics and grossed a modest US$36million at the North American box office.|$|E
2500|$|Old Man Sedgwick: Orville Lloyd Dutton Manly Alvin Norbert [...] "Old Man" [...] Sedgewick. Old Man Sedgwick's age {{is never}} officially disclosed, {{although}} he {{is reported to have}} known John A. Macdonald when he (John) was only a child, and in one episode, he {{is said to have been}} born [...] "sometime in the mesozoic era". He does havea [...] son who was 97 years of age, and his parents were still alive (his father bearing the name [...] "Dead Man Walking Sdgewick") Sedgewick is often described as being irritable and suffering from <b>senility,</b> for which he takes medication.|$|E
2500|$|Sanielevici's novel {{ideas on}} {{politics}} {{made it into}} his other essays. Besides its overall anti-fascism, În slujba Satanei?!... features his criticism of other public figures, mainly agrarian and Poporanist politicians. The language, Călinescu notes, is [...] "inimitable". Sanielevici accuses C. Stere of <b>senility,</b> judges Ibrăileanu a [...] "weak critic", and dismisses Viaţa Românească columnist Mihai Ralea, who [...] "is very bad at coordinating"; he also describes the post-Poporanist National Peasants' Party as laughable when in government. În slujba Sataneis other targets are foreign writers and critics whom Sanielevici disliked, from world federalist author H. G. Wells to modernist novelist André Gide.|$|E
2500|$|Pat {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{original}} cat characters, along with Roast Beef and Ray. Over the years, his role has receded into the background, but his is still a notable presence. He is a generally unpleasant character — he typically plays the antagonist — and seems to hate anyone that does not live up to his impossibly high standards of behavior. He seems to suffer from Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and has some anger management problems, for which he attends a support group. [...] Raymond's mother revealed that Pat also suffers from Crohn's disease, though this could be attributed to some slight <b>senility</b> of hers.|$|E
2500|$|Audubon {{made some}} {{excursions}} out West where {{he hoped to}} record Western species he had missed, but his health began to fail. In 1848, he manifested signs of <b>senility</b> or possibly dementia from {{what is now called}} Alzheimer's disease, his [...] "noble mind in ruins." [...] He died at his family home in northern Manhattan on January 27, 1851. Audubon is buried in the graveyard at the Church of the Intercession in the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum at 155th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, near his home. An imposing monument in his honor was erected at the cemetery, which is now recognized as part of the Heritage Rose District of NYC.|$|E
2500|$|Barks {{responded to}} some fan letters asking about Scrooge's Adamic age, {{that in the}} story [...] "That's No Fable!", when Scrooge drank water from a Fountain of Youth for several days, rather than making him young again (bodily contact with the water was {{required}} for that), ingesting the water rejuvenated his body and cured him of his rheumatia, which arguably allowed Scrooge to live beyond his expected years {{with no sign of}} slowdown or <b>senility.</b> Don Rosa's solution to the issue of Scrooge's age is that he set all of his stories in the 1950s or earlier, which was when he himself discovered and reveled in Barks's stories as a kid, and in his unofficial timelines, he had Scrooge die in 1967, at the age of 100 years.|$|E
2500|$|Slonim, who {{regarded}} {{himself as}} a libertarian socialist rather than a Marxist, worked on establishing [...] "self-instruction circles", circulating banned literature among students, artisans and workers, and traveled to Europe to meet with Osip Minor. As he recalled in the 1960s, the Eser leadership was [...] "appalled to discover than in Odessa and the nearby region {{most of the work}} was being done by boys and girls of 16 or 17." [...] According to later sources, he was {{brought to the attention of}} the Okhrana and left Russia surreptitiously. From 1911, he studied philosophy and literature at the University of Florence, where he took his Ph.D. In 1914, he published in Italy a translation of Ivan Turgenev's poetry cicle, <b>Senility.</b> By 1918, Slonim was also a graduate of Saint Petersburg Imperial University.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1923, he {{was again}} frequenting Viața Românească, at the Poporanists' new club in Bucharest. The modernist Felix Aderca, who also paid a visit, recalls that [...] "lily-white" [...] Rosetti was {{showing signs of}} <b>senility,</b> {{describing}} medieval genealogies to a bindery foreman. Also that year, Rosetti indirectly contributed {{to the history of}} Romanian cinema, as one of his novellas became the basis for Alfred Halm's The Gypsy Girl at the Alcove. A lost film adapted by Beldiman (who also appears in it as Taverner Ștrul), it is noted for starring both Elvira Popescu and Ion Finteșteanu, as well as for its depiction of sexual abuse by the boyars on their female slaves. Rosetti's final scholarly work was a 1923 piece on medieval Moldavia from Lațcu to Alexander I, followed in 1924 by a third edition of Cu paloșul.|$|E
2500|$|Agathon {{complains}} {{that the previous}} speakers have {{made the mistake of}} congratulating mankind on the blessings of love, failing to give due praise to the god himself (194e). He says that love is the youngest of gods and is an enemy of old age (195b). [...] He says that the god of love shuns the very sight of <b>senility</b> and clings to youth. [...] Agathon says love is dainty, and likes to tiptoe through the flowers and never settles where there is no [...] "bud to bloom" [...] (196b). It would seem that none of the characters at the party, {{with the possible exception of}} Agathon himself, would be candidates for love's companionship. Socrates, probably the oldest member of the party, seems certain to be ruled out. He also implies that love creates justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom. These are the cardinal virtues in ancient Greece. Although devoid of philosophical content, the speech Plato puts in the mouth of Agathon is a beautifully formal one, and Agathon contributes to the Platonic love theory with the idea that the object of love is beauty.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Lynch {{suggests}} that the earlier 20th century historians made hasty evaluations of both Robert II and Robert III, when they characterised them as [...] "pathetically weak personalities" [...] and their reigns as [...] "nineteen years of <b>senility</b> and sixteen of infirmity". Lynch also {{makes the point that}} the complaints made in the later chronicles of lawlessness and disturbance in the country was mainly confined to the north with the king's brother Alexander, lord of Badenoch and Earl of Buchan at its root. The death of John, lord of the Isles heralded a state of dissension between the lordship and the crown that was to last for two generations and which even Robert III's successor James I was unable to deal with properly. Lynch states that much of the troubles during Robert III's reign derived from the sharp deterioration of the royal revenues. The unruliness of northern Scotland was the result of competing factions within the royal family—Lynch {{suggests that}} the weakness in kingship before 1406 [...] "can be exaggerated", citing Buchan's enforced appearance at Robert III's council to answer for his incendiary attack on Elgin and its cathedral, and Albany's obtainment of a submission from the lord of the Isles.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Burns' {{state of}} mind {{is the subject of}} {{frequent}} jokes on the show. At times, he appears to be completely removed from reality and modern conventions. He continually fails to recognize Homer Simpson or remember his name, even though many of the recent major events in Mr. Burns' life have involved Homer in some way. Mr. Burns is, for the most part, unaware of the townspeople's general dislike of him. He also displays mannerisms which are considered outdated, such as practicing phrenology, writing with a quill pen, and using an antique view camera to take photographs. He is also angered when Springfield Elementary children mock his dated car, saying it was [...] "the first car to outrun a man!" [...] Mr. Burns refers to many celebrities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the present tense, assuming they are still alive. In [...] "Homer at the Bat", Mr. Burns instructs Smithers to recruit dead-ball era players, such as Honus Wagner and Cap Anson for the plant's softball team, and has to be told that all of them died long ago. He also once rewarded Homer for being the first to arrive at work with a ticket to the 1939 World's Fair. However, despite his obvious <b>senility</b> and social ineptitude, Mr. Burns is an extraordinarily clever businessman, as he has lost his fortune several times, only to regain it a very brief time later. In the episode [...] "The Old Man and Lisa", Mr. Burns loses his fortune, and regains it by opening a recycling plant, which allows him to regain his nuclear power plant. Additionally, in the episode [...] "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story", Mr. Burns loses both his fortune and nuclear power plant to the Rich Texan after losing a scavenger hunt, but eventually gains both back after a series of events that includes him briefly working at Moe's Tavern.|$|E
