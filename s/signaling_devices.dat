It consists of measuring, control and <b>signaling</b> <b>devices</b> located in zones where driving conditions may vary, such as at interchanges, viaducts, bridges and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur. The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users. The A11 motorway mainly runs through a plain, south of Sava River, requiring no major structures except for the exit interchanges themselves.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, warfare was {{changing}} and fifes {{were no longer}} practical as combat <b>signaling</b> <b>devices,</b> being gradually replaced by the infantry bugle. They were still used as signaling (as opposed to musical) instruments by American units during the Civil War, but were gradually phased out by the 1880s. A similar evolution occurred in the British Army. The US Marines were the last American units to drop fifers from their rolls. However, the British have an unbroken tradition of using fife and drum corps attached to their regiments, with whom they still parade regularly. Germany also continued an unbroken tradition of fife and drum corps {{until the end of}} World War II. They were integral to the regular German Army, Air Force and Navy, and not merely part of the Hitler Jugend and the Nazi Party organizations. [...] Bands of fifes and drums were regularly at the head of regimental parades and ceremonies of the infantry regiments, military schools and naval and air bases.|$|E
