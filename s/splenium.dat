50|$|The pericallosal cistern {{is one of}} the subarachnoid cisterns. It lies {{along the}} top of the corpus callosum from the <b>splenium</b> to the genu. It then joins the cistern of lamina terminalis which connects it with the chiasmatic cistern.|$|E

50|$|Dejerine in 1892 {{described}} specific symptoms {{resulting from}} a lesion to the corpus callosum that caused alexia without agraphia. The patient had a lesion in the left occipital lobe, blocking sight in the right visual field (hemianopia), and in the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum. Dejerine interpreted this case as a disconnection of the speech area in the left hemisphere from the right visual cortex.|$|E

50|$|Patient VP is a {{woman who}} {{underwent}} a two-stage callosotomy in 1979 at the age of 27. Although the callosotomy was reported to be complete, follow-up MRI in 1984 revealed spared fibers in the rostrum and <b>splenium.</b> The spared rostral fibers constituted approximately 1.8% of the total cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum and the spared splenial fibers constituted approximately 1% of the area. VP's postsurgery intelligence and memory quotients were within normal limits.|$|E
50|$|White matter {{integrity}} {{has also}} been shown to relate to cognitive change. Specifically, white matter integrity in the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum {{has been found to be}} a marker of healthy cognitive ageing. Lower white matter hyperintensity load {{has also been}} considered a sign of successful cognitive ageing, because it was associated with higher general cognitive ability and faster processing speed at age 73 after age 11 intelligence was controlled for.|$|E
5000|$|The subparietal sulcus (Sulcus subparietalis) or suprasplenial sulcus is a sulcus, or crevice, on {{the medial}} surface of each {{cerebral}} hemisphere, above the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum. It separates the precuneus from the posterior {{part of the}} cingulate gyrus. It is the posterior continuation of the cingulate sulcus. The cingulate sulcus actually [...] "terminates" [...] as the marginal sulcus of the cingulate sulcus (margin of cingulate gyrus). It extends posteriorly toward the calcarine sulcus.|$|E
5000|$|The front {{portion of}} the human corpus callosum has been {{reported}} to be significantly larger in musicians than nonmusicians, and to be 0.75 cm2 [...] or 11% larger in left-handed and ambidextrous people than right-handed people. This difference is evident in the anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum, but not in the <b>splenium.</b> Other magnetic resonance morphometric study showed corpus callosum size correlates positively with verbal memory capacity and semantic coding test performance.Children with dyslexia tend to have smaller and less-developed corpus callosums than their nondyslexic counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a {{cortical}} {{area in the}} brain, located posteriorly (towards the back) and comprising Brodmann areas 29 and 30 [...]The region's name {{refers to}} its anatomical location immediately behind the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum in primates, although in rodents it is located more towards the brain surface and is relatively larger. Its function is currently not well understood, but its location close to visual areas and also to the hippocampal spatial/memory system suggest it may {{have a role in}} mediating between perceptual and memory functions.|$|E
50|$|Thinner axons in the genu {{connect the}} prefrontal cortex {{between the two}} halves of the brain; these fibres arise from a fork-like bundle of fibers from the tapetum, the forceps anterior. Thicker axons in the mid body, or trunk of the corpus callosum, {{interconnect}} areas of the motor cortex, with proportionately more of the corpus callosum dedicated to supplementary motor regions including Broca's area. The posterior body of the corpus, known as the <b>splenium,</b> communicates somatosensory information between {{the two halves of}} the parietal lobe and the visual cortex at the occipital lobe, these are the fibres of the forceps posterior.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{cases have}} {{injury to the}} {{occipital}} and temporal lobes and the critical site of injury {{appears to be in}} the left occipito-temporal region, often with involvement of the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum. The etiology of the cognitive impairment, as well the areas of the brain affected by lesions and stage of recovery are the primary determinants of the pattern of deficit. [...] More generalized recognition impairments, such as, animate object deficits, are associated with diffuse hypoxic damage, like carbon monoxide poisoning; more selective deficits are correlated with more isolated damage due to focal stroke.|$|E
50|$|The {{corpus callosum}} (CC) {{is the major}} route of {{communication}} between the two hemispheres. At maturity it is a large mass of white matter and consists of bundles of fibres linking the white matter of the two cerebral hemispheres. Its caudal and <b>splenium</b> portions contain fibres that originate from the primary and second auditory cortices, and from other auditory responsive areas. Transcallosal interhemispheric transfer of auditory information {{plays a significant role}} in spatial hearing functions that depend on binaural cues. Various studies have shown that despite normal audiograms, children with known auditory interhemispheric transfer deficits have particular difficulty localizing sound and understanding speech in noise.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{location}} and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with PCA syndrome. Blockages of the proximal portion of the vessel produce only minor deficits due to the collateral blood flow from the opposite hemisphere via the posterior communicating artery. In contrast, distal occlusions result in more serious complications. Visual deficits, such as agnosia, prosopagnosia or cortical blindness (with bilateral infarcts) may be a product of ischemic damage to occipital lobe. Occlusions of {{the branches of the}} PCA that supply the thalamus can result in central post-stroke pain and lesions to the subthalamic branches can produce “a wide variety of deficits”. Left posterior cerebral artery syndrome presents alexia without agraphia; the lesion is in the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum.|$|E
50|$|The {{corpus callosum}} (CC), like the {{anterior}} commissure, {{is a major}} neuronal link connecting the two cerebral hemispheres. However, unlike the anterior commissure (which is present in all vertebrates), the CC is only present in placental animals (including humans). An MRI study comparing the CC of right-handed homosexual and heterosexual men found that {{all parts of the}} CC are larger in homosexual men. In particular, the isthmus (a part of the CC between the callosal body and the <b>splenium)</b> is significantly larger in size in homosexual than heterosexual men. The size of the CC has a strong genetic basis, with heritability rates between 82-94%. This association of sexual orientation with a brain structure having high heritability supports a genetic and neurobiological basis in the origin of sexual orientation.|$|E
50|$|Pure alexia {{almost always}} {{involves}} an infarct {{to the left}} posterior cerebral artery (which perfuses the <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum and left visual cortex, among other things). The resulting deficit will be pure alexia - i.e., the patient can write but cannot read (even what they have just written). However, because pure alexia affects visual input, not auditory input, patients with pure alexia can recognize words that are spelled out loud to them. This is because the left visual cortex has been damaged, leaving only the right visual cortex (occipital lobe) able to process visual information, but it is unable to send this information to the language areas (Broca's area, Wernicke's area, etc.) in the left brain because of {{the damage to the}} <b>splenium</b> of the corpus callosum. Patients with this deficit mostly do suffer from a stroke to the posterior cerebral artery. But they may be susceptible to pure alexia as a consequence of other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) as well. Anything that stops proper blood flow to the area necessary for normal reading abilities will cause a form of alexia. The posterior cerebral artery is a main local for the cause of this deficit because this artery is not just responsible for itself. It also supplies the anterior temporal branches, the posterior temporal branches, the calcarrine branch, and the parieto-occipital branch. What is important about these arteries is their location. All of them supply blood to the back outer parts of the brain. This part of the brain is also referred to as the posterior lateral part of the brain. In cases of pure alexia, locations are found in the section of the brain, specifically the temporo-occipital area. This is the area that is activated when people without any sort of alexia receive activation when undergoing orthographic processing. This area is known as the visual word form area due to this pattern of activation.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the posterior commissure {{is a set}} of fiber pathways that play a role in language processing between the right and left hemispheres of the brain. It connects the pretectal nuclei.A case study described recently in The Irish Medical Journal discussed the role the posterior commissure plays in the connection between the right occipital cortex and the language centers in the left hemisphere. This study explains how visual information from {{the left side of the}} visual field is received by the right visual cortex and then transferred to the word form system in the left hemisphere though the posterior commissure and the <b>splenium.</b> Disruption of the posterior commissure fiber pathway can cause alexia without agraphia. It is evident from this case study of alexia without agraphia that the posterior commissure plays a vital role in transferring information from the right occipital cortex to the language centers of the left hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|More recently, Geschwind et al. {{described}} {{the case of}} a woman who suffered severe coronary heart disease. One week after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, she noticed that her left hand started to [...] "live a life of its own". It would unbutton her gown, try to choke her while asleep and would automatically fight with the right hand to answer the phone. She had to physically restrain the affected hand with the right hand to prevent injury, a behavior which has been termed [...] "self-restriction". The left hand also showed signs of severe ideomotor apraxia. It was able to mimic actions but only with the help of mirror movements executed by the right hand (enabling synkinesis). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Geschwind et al. found damage to the posterior half of the callosal body, sparing the anterior half and the <b>splenium</b> extending slightly into the white matter underlying the right cingulate cortex.|$|E
50|$|The {{corpus callosum}} is a {{structure}} in the brain along the longitudinal fissure that facilitates much of the communication between the two hemispheres and its main function is in allowing for communication between the brain's right and left hemispheres. This structure is composed of white matter: millions of axons that have their dendrites and terminal buttons projecting in both {{the right and left}} hemisphere. However, there is evidence that the corpus callosum may also have some inhibitory functions. Post-mortem research on human and monkey brains show that the corpus callosum is functionally organized. It proves that the right hemisphere is superior for detecting faces. This organization results in modality-specific regions of the corpus callosum that are responsible for the transfer of different types of information. Research has revealed that the anterior midbody transfers motor information, the posterior midbody transfers somatosensory information, the isthmus transfers auditory information and the <b>splenium</b> transfers visual information. Although much of the interhemispheric transfer occurs at the corpus callosum, there are trace amounts of transfer via subcortical pathways.|$|E
5000|$|Pure, or phonologically-based, {{dyslexia}}, {{also known}} as agnosic dyslexia, dyslexia without agraphia, and pure word blindness, is dyslexia due to difficulty in recognizing written sequences of letters (such as words), or sometimes even letters. It is considered '"pure" [...] {{because it is not}} accompanied by other significant language-related impairments. Pure dyslexia does not affect speech, handwriting style, language or comprehension impairments. Pure dyslexia is caused by lesions on the visual word form area (VWFA). The VWFA is composed of the left lateral occipital sulcus and is activated during reading. A lesion in the VWFA stops transmission between the visual cortex and the left angular gyrus. It can also be caused by a lesion involving the left occipital lobe or the <b>splenium.</b> It is usually accompanied by a homonymous hemianopsia in {{the right side of the}} visual field. Multiple oral re-reading (MOR) is a treatment for pure dyslexia. It is considered a top-down processing technique in which affected individuals read and reread texts a predetermined number of times or until reading speed or accuracy improves a predetermined amount.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} {{in the structure of}} and in specific areas of the brain. On average, the SDN has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females. The volume of the SDN was 2.2 times as large in males as in females. On average, the BSTc is twice as large in men as in women. On average, the INAH-3 is significantly larger in males than in females regardless of age. Two studies found that men have larger parietal lobes, an area responsible for sensory input including spatial sense and navigation; though, another study failed to find any statistically significant difference. At the same time, females have larger Wernicke's and Broca's areas, areas responsible for language processing. Studies using MRI scanning have shown that the auditory and language-related regions in the left hemisphere are proportionally expanded in females versus in males. Conversely, the primary visual, and visuo-spatial association areas of the parietal lobes are proportionally larger in males. The corpus callous is located at the sagittal divide and is the primary commissure in the human brain. It connects the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex, which allows them to communicate with each other. With respect to language, males predominantly use their left hemisphere but females use both their right and left hemispheres. The right hemisphere controls emotion, so using the right hemisphere adds more prosody to speech. In males, the corpus callosum is larger than females. [...] However, the <b>splenium</b> and the isthmus subregions of the corpus callosum are larger in females. The genu subregion is larger in males. These subregions may {{serve as the basis for}} sex differences in language. However, a 1997 meta-study concluded that there is no relative size difference, and that the larger corpus callosum in males is due to generally larger brains in males on average.In total and on average, females have a higher percentage of grey matter in comparison to males, and males a higher percentage of white matter. However, some researchers maintain that as males have larger brains on average than females, when adjusted for total brain volume, the grey matter differences between sexes is small or nonexistent. Thus, the percentage of grey matter appears to be more related to brain size than it is to gender.|$|E
