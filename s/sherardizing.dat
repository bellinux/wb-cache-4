50|$|<b>Sherardizing</b> is {{a process}} of {{galvanization}} of ferrous metal surfaces, also called vapour galvanising and dry galvanizing. The process is named after the British metallurgist Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles (son of naval inventor Cowper Phipps Coles) who invented and patented the method ca. 1900. This process involves heating the steel parts up to ca. 500°C in a closed rotating drum that also contains metallic zinc dust and possibly an inert filler, such as sand. At temperatures above 300°C, zinc evaporates and diffuses into the steel substrate forming diffusion bonded Zn-Fe-phases.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal {{diffusion}} galvanizing, or <b>Sherardizing,</b> {{provides a}} zinc diffusion coating on iron- or copper-based materials. Parts and zinc powder are tumbled {{in a sealed}} rotating drum. Around , zinc will diffuse into the substrate to form a zinc alloy. The advance surface preparation of the goods {{can be carried out}} by shot blasting. The process is also known as [...] "dry galvanizing", because no liquids are involved; this can avoid possible problems caused by hydrogen embrittlement. The dull-grey crystal structure of the zinc diffusion coating has a good adhesion to paint, powder coatings, or rubber. It is a preferred method for coating small, complex-shaped metals, and for smoothing rough surfaces on items formed with sintered metal.|$|E
40|$|A novel Zn-Al co-cementation coating was {{obtained}} by a pack cementation method. This coating possesses a two-layered structure. The outer layer is mainly composed of Fe 2 Al 5 and FeAl intermetallics {{with a small amount}} of Zn, and the inner layer consists of Zn, Fe and a small amount of Al. The corrosion-erosion resistance of Zn-Al co-cementation coatings on carbon steel was studied by a rotary corrosion method in various NaCl and H 2 S containing solutions and relevant SiO 2 containing media. The experimental results are compared with those of carbon steels and the <b>sherardizing</b> and aluminizing coatings, showing that the Zn-Al co-cementation coatings have excellent corrosion-erosion resistance in various aqueous media...|$|E
