25|$|In 1886, a new section {{promoted}} by Richards, Sanitary Science, {{was established by}} the Society. This was {{at a time when}} household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.|$|E
25|$|Constitutions second {{lieutenant}} came aboard Cyane as prize master, and Constitution left her to pursue Levant. Levant returned to engage Constitution, but once <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Cyane had been defeated {{she turned and}} attempted escape. Constitution soon overtook her, and after several more broadsides, she too struck her colors. Out of her 115 men and 16 boys, Levant had six seamen and marines killed and one officer and 14 seamen and marines wounded.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{her career}} Franck, who was {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} feminist, was uncomfortable being {{in the shadow of}} her famous husband and wanted to be recognized for her own work. In 1970, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London planned to stage Franck's first solo exhibition: when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the invitations included her husband's name and said he would be present at the launch, she cancelled the show. Franck once said that she put her husband's career ahead of her own. In 2003 Franck and her daughter launched the Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation to promote Cartier-Bresson's photojournalism, and in 2004 Franck became its president.|$|E

25|$|As her {{children}} became adults, Victoria began to seek suitors for them. In 1878, Charlotte married her paternal second cousin Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, which delighted the Berlin court. Three years later, Victoria began negotiations to marry William to Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, provoking outrage in conservative German circles. Chancellor Bismarck criticised the project because the princess {{belonged to the}} family who was dethroned by Prussia with the annexation of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in 1864. As for the Hohenzollerns, they considered Augusta Victoria unworthy to marry the heir apparent to the German Empire because her family lacked sufficient rank. After several months of negotiations, Victoria got what she wanted, but soon became disappointed when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> her daughter-in-law {{did not have the}} liberal personality that she expected.|$|E
25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her back to the hotel, they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much <b>she</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>That</b> evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E

500|$|Kate {{made her}} own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was {{probably}} taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio {{doors at the}} back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as {{though there was a}} draught, which is when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming [...] "Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!" ...|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut. Described by her {{as one of the}} most troubling shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying in her wake. The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral. When she got closer, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E

500|$|... Yesterday, {{the woman}} {{went to the}} ala’s house with her child, the ala’s godchild. Upon {{entering}} the first room, she saw a poker and a broom fighting; in the second room, she saw human legs; in the fourth– human flesh; in the fifth– blood; in the sixth– <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the ala had taken off her head and was delousing it, while wearing a horse’s head in its place. After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and}} third rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat. That is the wine that I drink.” “How can I eat after I saw that you had taken your head off and were delousing it, having fixed a horse’s head on yourself?” The ala, after hearing that, ate both the woman and her child.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

2500|$|Biryukova {{later told}} a {{clinical}} psychologist <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> by this point she had learned that her boyfriend could be [...] "very controlling" [...] and she became emotionally dependent on him in turn. Nevertheless, in 2003, she married him in a brief ceremony in his mother's kitchen. Later she said his family gave her the choice of either doing so or never seeing him again, since they claimed he was facing imminent deportation, {{for reasons that are}} not known. Biryukova later claimed that she did not tell her family the real reason the two had wed until 2010.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her return}} to South Africa <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> her mission was to assist in healing the wounds inflicted by the war and to support efforts aimed at {{rehabilitation}} and reconciliation. [...] With this object in view, she visited South Africa again in 1903. She decided to set up Boer home industries and to teach young women spinning and weaving when she returned once more in 1905. Ill health, from which she never recovered, forced her to return to England in 1908. She traveled to South Africa again in 1913 for the inauguration of the National Women's Monument in Bloemfontein but had to stop at Beaufort West due to her failing health.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E

Furious, the Phantom vows to kill the [...] "drunken fool," [...] but Squelch informs him that he saw the Vicomte leave alone. The Phantom then suspects Madame Giry, because of her attitude towards him before Christine's number, and proceeds to threaten Giry when she is brought to him by Squelch and Gangle. Madame Giry confesses that she knew about Gustave's true parentage, but denies abducting the boy. Fleck reports that she was passing Meg's dressing room, where <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the mirror has shattered, and Meg is now nowhere to be found. Christine fears for her child's life, but Madame Giry assures her that Meg would never hurt Gustave. The Phantom believes he knows where Meg has gone ("Gustave, Gustave").|$|E
2500|$|According to Ovid, it was Jupiter (Zeus) {{who took}} the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno’s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was {{separated}} from Diana and the other nymphs. Callisto's subsequent pregnancy was discovered several months later while she was bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Diana became enraged when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Callisto was pregnant and expelled her from the group. [...] Callisto later gave birth to Arcas. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as Ursa Major and Minor, respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to Tethys that the two might never meet her waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their circumpolar positions in ancient times (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{as part of her}} spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E

And the Sages noted the {{parallel}} between [...] which says, [...] "and when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>that</b> he was good," [...] and [...] which says, [...] "And God <b>saw</b> the light <b>that</b> it was good," [...] and deduced from the similar use of the word [...] "good" [...] that when Moses was born, the whole house filled with light.|$|R
