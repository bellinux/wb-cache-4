40|$|AIMS: Coronary dissections left {{untreated}} after percutaneous coronary intervention {{are associated with}} unfavourable outcomes. However, their role after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is still undescribed. We assessed incidence, predictors, and outcomes of residual dissections in DES-treated lesions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients undergoing DES implantation were enrolled in four Italian centres, with baseline, procedural, and outcome data entered into a dedicated database. Residual dissections were classified according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute criteria. End-points of interest were in-hospital, 1 -month, and 6 -month {{major adverse cardiovascular events}} (MACE, i. e. death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization), and stent thrombosis (ST). Among the 2418 included patients (4630 lesions), a total of 77 (1. 7 %) final dissections occurred in 67 (2. 8 %) subjects. Dissections were more frequent in longer and complex lesions and in the left anterior descending, and were associated with increased rates of in-hospital (11. 9 vs. 5. 2 %, P= 0. 017) and 1 -month MACE (13. 4 vs. 6. 0 %, P= 0. 013), with similar 6 -month trends. Cumulative ST was also greater in patients with dissections (6. 3 vs. 1. 3 %, P= 0. 011).

40|$|Future {{reusable}} launch {{vehicles will}} require advanced structural seals. This includes propulsion seals along edges and hinge lines in hypersonic engines, and control surface <b>seals</b> for movable <b>flaps</b> and elevons on proposed reentry vehicles. Seals must remain in sealing engagement with opposing surfaces, for multiple missions, {{even though the}} seal gap may be opening and closing due to thermal and structural loads. To meet this requirement either the seals themselves must be resilient or {{there must be a}} resilient structural element behind the seals. Case Western Reserve University is working with NASA s Glenn Research Center to develop more resilient high temperature seal components and preloading devices. Results are presented for a finite element analysis of a canted coil spring that is being considered as a high temperature seal preloading device. This type of spring is a leading candidate due to its ability to provide nearly constant force over a large deflection. The finite element analyses were verified by comparing them to experimental results of canted coil springs of three different stiffnesses, measured at Glenn Research Center. Once validated the parameterized model was combined with a scripting algorithm to assess the effects of key spring design variables (wire diameter, coils per inch, cant amplitude, eccentricity, and spring width) on spring stiffness and maximum Von Mises stress to aid in subsequent design...|$|R
