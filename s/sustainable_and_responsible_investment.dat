40|$|Socially <b>responsible</b> <b>investments,</b> {{also often}} {{referred}} to as <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> (SRI) have been gaining importance for the last ten years. Climate change, severe environmental problems, raising ethical concerns across the globe led to the emergence of the question whether companies need to be both profitable <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> towards society <b>and</b> if yes, whether investing in companies which follow such principles, would be a profitable endeavor. For the last ten years, as a result of intensifying interest in SRI, seven types of strategies related to this activity have emerged, each of which proves to be gaining more and more assets under management. The aim of the current paper it to explain the essence of these strategies and to present their typology and the trends of their application. The author supports the belief that SRI strategies will be gaining more and more importance in the future considering climate change side effects, pollution, the growing importance of ethical issues, and the corresponding shifts in consumer preferences and legislation...|$|R

40|$|This study empirically {{analyzes}} barriers preventing {{private investors}} {{from participating in}} the market of <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> (SRI). Thereby, we link the strand of literature regarding participation costs of stockholding, i. e. information and transaction costs, to SRI market participation. The empirical analysis {{is based on a}} large online representative dataset for German financial decision makers containing data from a survey and a stated preferences discrete choice experiment, which refers to investment decisions between mutual funds. Contrary to most previous studies, we do not only differentiate between investors who are currently invested in SRI and those who are not invested. Instead we differentiate between four different investor groups, namely socially <b>responsible,</b> skeptical, interested, <b>and</b> conventional investors. We find that these groups face different barriers regarding SRI market participation. Particularly too high (perceived) information costs regarding SRI are a reason for private investors not to invest (more) in SRI. Having not received an offer by their bank seems to be a big hurdle especially for interested investors who seem to have problems overcoming the market entry barrier. Distrusting providers of SRI is an additional issue that especially hinders skeptical and conventional investors to invest (more) in SRI. Based on the experimental results, we see that information related barriers can be decreased by means of sustainability and/or transparency labels. Investor of all four groups have positive stated preferences for funds with transparency or sustainability labels. Hence, labels are an opportunity to decrease information costs of private investors and thus enhance individual demand for SRI...|$|R

According to the GIIN, the 2016 ’s total impact investment (114 billion US$ reported by 208 investors) registered an increase of 48 % from 2015 (77 billion US$ in total assets reported by 158 investors) and 90 % from 2014 (60 billion US$ in assets reported by 146 investors).

40|$|Over {{the last}} years, {{the theme of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) has continued to grow in importance and significance. This interest arises from the idea that firms engaging in socially responsible behaviour may gain competitive advantages, increasing their value. Although social reporting is not mandatory, investors are recognizing a great importance to environmental performance by choosing <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investments</b> (Middleton, 2015). As a consequence, {{a great number of}} companies pays greater attention at sustainability themes, promoting a better relationship with stakeholders and ethical investments. To measure the level of social and environmental responsibility stakeholders often use ethical rating. Unlike the traditional credit rating, it is based on non-financial ratios. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether investors take into consideration the social and environmental performance, as proxied by Standard Ethics Rating, in making investment decisions. More specifically, we test whether the reputation for good sustainability is reflected in the market value. To test the hypothesis we follow the accounting based valuation model developed by Ohlson (1995). To define the level of sustainability performance we use the Standard Ethic Rating, which is published by the European sustainability agency “Standard Ethics”. This rating “measures the level of adoption of international voluntary indications on corporate social responsibility and corporate governance, as well as the risk of corporate reputation”. The empirical analysis is based on a sample of European companies listed on German, Italian, French, UK, Swiss and Belgian markets. This study contributes to the extant literature in several ways. Firstly, we provide more evidence on the value relevance of reputation for sustainability, that is non-financial information. Secondly, we analyse the European context, differently from other works which examine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in USA (Lourenco et al., 2014; Lourenco et al. 2012).

40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{and protection of}} investment flows has become an increasingly indispensable pillar of economic integration. The objective {{of this study is}} to contribute to a better understanding of the ways in which RTAs achieve such {{liberalization and}} protection. To this end, we have surveyed the investment provisions contained in 260 RTAs notified to the WTO by 31 December 2015 and in force on that date. More than half of these RTAs contain investment chapters, though they vary in terms of their substantive scope and coverage. Given the unabated increase in the number of RTAs and the push towards greater economic integration we expect this figure to further increase.

40|$|Taxes {{have become}} an issue of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR), but the role of taxation is to some extent an ambiguous and controversial issue in the CSR framework. Similarly, another unclear question is what role investors {{who are committed to}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investment</b> (SRI) see taxes as having on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agenda. Corporate taxes have an inverse relationship with the return of the investors: taxes paid directly affect what is left on the bottom line, reducing the return of investors. However, investors are now more aware of tax-related risks, which can include different forms of reputation risk. Corporate tax planning may increase the returns, but those increased returns are riskier. This study focuses particularly on the relationship between SRI and taxation. We find that tax matters are considered to be on the ESG agenda, but their role and significance in the ESG analysis is unclear...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the implementation of environmental, social practices of property investors in Malaysia as revealed through published company material. Content analysis is used in this research. Analysis was conducted of potential SRPI (Socially Responsible Property Investment) or ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) initiatives of all (13) Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), together with a selection of property investment companies and key institutional investors using publicly available company literature. The websites and annual reports of these investors from 2007 - 2009 were examined in order to identify activities, strategies contributing to the progress of sustainable and responsible property investment. The progress made was also compared with progresses made in other countries including UK, USA and Australia.

40|$|In {{this age}} of {{economic}} globalisation, the agricultural sector requires more investment to meet the global need for food and fuel security, and greater development needs in rural areas in the global South. However, {{a sharp increase in}} land acquisition for agricultural investment has given rise to several economic, political, institutional, legal and social concerns. A <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investment</b> in the agricultural sector requires adequate government policies that ensure equitable benefits to all state and non-state actors, and involvement of government and local communities in the agricultural investment regime. In the absence of a comprehensive multilateral investment agreement, the foreign investment regime in the agriculture sector has focused on national law, investment contract and international investment agreements. Thus, the focus of this paper is the legal safeguards available in the investment contracts {{as well as in the}} national legal regime, and the responsibility of the state in providing adequate legal tools and market incentives to ensure sustainable agricultural investment. The chapter concludes that the sustainability agenda requires the state to provide effective legal safeguards to be included in national laws and argues for better incentive mechanisms as well as collaborative business practices to reduce governance gaps...|$|E
40|$|Investments in planted {{forests in}} {{emerging}} markets are increasing and investors {{are looking for}} <b>Sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>Responsible</b> <b>Investments</b> (SRI) to integrate Environmental, Social And Governance (ESG) into the investment process. This study is presenting a first attempt to develop a framework to evaluate the ESG performance of investments in planted forests and to identify relations {{between the use of}} SRI tools and the financial performance of investments in planted forests. The analysis of 121 investments in planted forests allowed the identification of 339 organizations and 50 SRI tools (e. g. : management and investment standards, investment rating) operating with investments in planted forests in emerging markets. The analysis of the 50 SRI tools resulted in the definition of a ESG Reference Document including 155 issues. These issues were organized into an ESG Risk Assessment and have been tested in 12 case studies evenly distributed between Uganda, Cambodia and Vietnam. The results suggest that the most common instruments are management standards (e. g. : FSC), bank investment policies (e. g. : ABN AMRO Forest and Plantation Policy) and investment rating systems (e. g. : FairForest). The majority of the SRI tools have a broad sectoral approach and are managed by business organizations. Investors are using more than 30 SRI tools but these are characterized by a low level of control such as signature and/or participation or at the most a conformity declaration. On the contrary plantation companies are using less instruments but with top level of control such conformity assessment and certification. Aspects related to “Legal and Institutional framework” and “Environment” are the most represented inside SRI tools. On the contrary aspects such as “Minimum percentage of protected areas”, “Poverty reduction” and “Prevention of encroachment” are not only the less frequent issues but also the less controlled issues by SRI tools. The Gold Standard and the Forest Stewardship Council are the SRI tools with the highest performance among the 50 SRI tools analysed. The ESG Risk Assessment allows to identify the most important 25 issues and reveals that SRI tools are focusing on issues that on-the-ground are not the major risk sources. This is the case of “Third party certification” and “High Conservation Value Forests” (HCVFs). Few exemptions where SRI tools are properly identifying the major risks are “Tenure rights”, “Health and safety of workers” and “Social impact assessment”. Climate change impacts, long term financial sustainability, poverty reduction and encroachment are ranked as the most dangerous sources of risk across the 12 case studies. SRI tools are positively influencing the risk mitigation, accounting for a percentage of risk mitigation that ranges from 34. 31 till 60. 63 %. FSC certification was often reported by projects’ stakeholders as a key instrument to mitigate risk of investments in planted forests...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{that allows us}} to obtain a portfolio made up of <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> socially <b>responsible</b> (SR) <b>investment</b> funds. This portfolio tracks the one that investors might have chosen if they had not taken into account social, ethical and ecological (SEE) issues in their investment decisions. Therefore, in the first stage, reference portfolio exclusively made up of conventional funds is obtained. For the construction of the conventional portfolio the Prospect Theory has been used: net profits as the financial objective and error function as the utility function. In the second stage, a portfolio consisting exclusively of SR-funds is built. To do so, the reference portfolio is used as an ideal point, with the objectives of the SR-investor being the relative wealth with respect to the reference portfolio and the SEE quality of the portfolio. The relative wealth will be manipulated by a downside-risk measure, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and the periodic values of the portfolio. The second objective is the SR Quality of the portfolio, taking into account the personal values of a particular investor. This is built using Fuzzy Set Theory tools. We are faced with a multi-objective problem which is solved by using Goal Programming methodology. The estimation of both conventional and SR markets has been carried out by a semi-parametric approach by using the Copula Theory for modeling the dependence structure of the assets’ returns. The approach has been applied to a set of 38 conventional and 12 ethical funds domiciled in Spain...|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 59). Green Banking is {{the operation of the}} financial sector with special focus on the environmental, ecological and social factors, targeting conservation of nature and natural resources. The term broadly encompasses awareness creation and promotion of environment-and-society-friendly projects and practices, and reduction of overall carbon footprint from both its financing and inhouse operations. Through Green Banking, the FIs are not only required to improve their own standards, but also play an active role in demanding the same from its stakeholders. The state of environment in Bangladesh is rapidly deteriorating. The key areas of environmental degradation cover air pollution, water pollution and scarcity, encroachment of rivers, improper disposal of industrial, medical and household waste, deforestation and loss of open space and loss of biodiversity. In addition, Bangladesh {{is one of the most}} climate change vulnerable countries. In line with global development and response to the environmental degradation, financial sector in Bangladesh should play important roles as one of the key stake holders. Although FIs are considered environment friendly and do not impact the environment greatly through their own internal operations, the external impact on the environment through their customers activities is substantial. The financial sector is one of the major sources of financing industrial projects such as steel, paper, cement, chemicals, fertilizers, power, textiles, etc., which cause maximum carbon emission. Therefore, FIs can play an intermediary role between economic development and environmental protection, for promoting environmentally <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> socially <b>responsible</b> <b>investment.</b> So, to aid the reduction of external carbon emission, like other FIs, ULC should finance green technology and pollution reducing projects. The approach of ULC to sustainability is based on a broad understanding of its duties as a provider of financial services, its responsibilities to society and the environment and also its role as an employer. Its approach also shows the importance the company gives to its dialogue with its stakeholders. ULC is seriously considering to adopt Green Banking with a view to enhancing CAMEL rating, getting approval from the central bank to open up new branches and becoming one of the top ten FIs in Bangladesh. The factors that have influenced ULC to adopt Green Banking are: economic factors, policy guidelines, loan demand, stakeholders’ pressure and environmental interest. ULC is trying to curb its usage of electricity, though on the other hand, the consumption of fuel is erratic. ULC needs serious steps to check its fuel consumption in an efficient manner. ULC has seen its success in reducing paper consumption. With the advent and implementation of latest technology in the operation, ULC is heading toward very less paper consumption. ULC has commendable achievement in noise reduction, decreasing CO 2 emission and electricity load reduction. This has been possible mainly because of ULC’s due diligence checklist and special environmental concern while investing. <b>Sustainable</b> development <b>and</b> preservation of environment are now recognized globally as overriding imperatives to protect our planet from the ravages inflicted on it by mankind. A common thread running across all these initiatives is the focus on reducing the demand for fossil fuels by implementing the 3 R's viz. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

An explanatory qualitative content analysis approach was used to identify from the annual integrated and sustainability reports of investee companies whether they conduct their business activities in a sustainable manner. Findings reveal bias in the choice of investable companies by institutional investors because of the profit expectations of investors and the lack of the standardised use of environmental, social and governance issues in investee companies’ reports on sustainable business practices. An implication of this study is that, because of the large pool of funds available to institutional investors in South Africa, consideration of environmental, social and governance criteria in investing decisions by institutional investors can be used to influence improved sustainable business practice in investee companies...|$|E

30|$|During {{the last}} two decades the area of {{socially}} responsible investments (SRI) has grown substantially. Between 1995 and 2012 SRI assets in the US rose more than 480  % to $ 3.74 trillion in 2012 (Forum for <b>Sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>Responsible</b> <b>Investment</b> (2013)). The German market grew about 9  % with respect to 2012 values. In 2013 it is estimated to have a value of € 79.9 billion (FNG (2014)). One possibility for private investors to participate in the SRI market is to invest in socially responsible (SR) funds. According to the FNG (2014), € 12.7 billion are invested in roughly 300 SR retail funds that are available in Germany. Currently, this corresponds to 1.8  % of the total volume of the German mutual retail fund market. Therefore, it has great potential to grow strongly in the following years, especially when Germany is compared to The Netherlands, the European frontrunner, where SR retail funds amount almost to a total of 15.4  % of the volume of the Dutch mutual retail fund market (see Vigeo Rating (2013)). SR funds in Germany mostly practice negative screening and/or follow a best in class investment approach (see FNG (2014)). When the performance of SR and conventional retail funds domiciled in Germany are compared, no significant underperformance of SR funds can be found (Cortez et al. 2009, 2012; Renneboog et al. 2008; Kreander et al. 2005; Bauer et al. 2005; Schröder 2004; Kreander et al. 2002)). Globally, there are more than 100 studies concerning the performance of SR funds (e.g., Chegut et al. 2011; Rathner 2013; von Wallis and Klein 2014). Capelle-Blancard and Monjon (2012) point out that “maybe too much {{attention has been paid to}} this issue”. Therefore, we want to add to the “few studies [which] examine the aspirations of SRI investors”.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{within the}} institutional framework settings how {{the concept of}} Sustainable and Responsible Property Investment (SRPI) has developed and to the extent SRPI has been adopted in a developing country, namely Malaysia. The question of Sustainable and Responsible Property Investment (SRPI) interpretation is important in this context given that developing countries represent the most rapidly expanding economies and most lucrative markets for property investment. Specifically the thesis examines the understandings of SRPI and the concept link with SRI, and the drivers and barriers to SRPI practice. Specifically, the thesis investigates how particular Malaysian Property Investment organisations (MPIOs) have interpreted the concept of SRPI, and whether the overall concept of SRPI has taken similar or different form than the practice in developed market. The study used a mixed-method approach. It uses triangulation of data collection methods and multiple techniques including content analysis and Delphi technique. The study used a modified institutional framework to aid in explaining, interpreting and understanding the divergence/convergence of SRPI in the developing country context. Content analysis of selected public listed property investment organisations in Malaysia i. e. real estate investment trusts (REITS), property companies and institutional investor reports from 2008 to 2011 proceeded through line-by-line analysis and coding according to inductively generated categories. The results from content analysis revealed a narrow representation of SRPI in the MPIOs reports. Despite the requirement by the Bursa Malaysia to report on CSR and sustainability activities, there were minimal disclosures on environmental and social impacts caused by their property management and investment activities, on most reports shows emphasis of MPIO’s on philanthropic activities. The Delphi study aims to explore, examine and build on the views of experts and influential people in SRPI. It was also felt necessary to combine local expertise and experts from developed countries. Overall, SRPI in Malaysia takes different form than SRPI in countries where is SRPI mainstreamed. The study points in the direction of SRPI “cross-vergence”, whereby global convergence and local divergence forces are interacting synergistically. The National and Cultural religious value in particular are two strong elements supporting the drivers of divergence of SRPI. Through the rigorous exploration this thesis contributes to the further understanding of <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investment</b> and the drivers. The proposed framework has provided the principles, whereas the empirical work translated the principles into practice. The results of the thesis contribute to the literature by providing new evidence on the drivers of SRPI in emerging market.

40|$|Sustainable and {{responsible}} investments (SRI) have grown strongly {{over the past}} two decades. While corresponding investment volumes are still rather small compared to those of conventional investments, almost every conventional investment product has a counterpart applying a <b>sustainable</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>investment</b> strategy (FNG 2016). In light of current developments, an increasing importance of SRI in the future can be assumed. By way of example, SRI can be an important instrument in order to achieve and implement the ambitious (long-term) goals resolved in recent climate negations like the 21 st Conference of the Parties in Paris. These goals require severe efforts and changes in many economic sectors and also in behaviors of market participants. Policy makers seem to agree that these actions and developments have to be framed and accompanied by corresponding financial flows (UNFCCC 2015). Accordingly, {{it is important to understand}} determinants of individual behavior in order to find efficient, well-targeted, and socially accepted solutions and policy measures to accelerate the transformation process (e. g., Schwirplies and Ziegler 2016). However, related empirical studies mainly concentrate on sustainable individual behaviors in context of consumption and transport decisions and only a few studies consider motives and barriers of individual investment decisions in context of SRI. The four papers of this cumulative thesis add on this limited research by focusing on the relevance of financial and non-financial motives (e. g., social norms, personal values and identity, with a special focus on religion and political orientation) for individual investment behavior and SRI, potential investment barriers, and the relationship between SRI and other sustainable activities. The empirical analyses in all four papers are mainly based on an online representative survey among financial decision makers in German households. The heart of the survey are two stated choice (SC) experiments on hypothetical investment decisions among sustainable and conventional investment products, which account for several potential drawbacks of pure questionnaire-based analysis. The first paper finds that psychological motives, personal values, and social norms (e. g., warm glow motives and expectations of the social environment) have strong significant effects on SRI and are even more relevant than the perceived financial performance of SRI. This suggests that SRI investors gain strong non-financial utility from SRI. On the basis of both SC experiments, the second paper shows that certain types of investors are willing to sacrifice return in order to invest in SRI. Investor groups with high feelings of warm glow from SRI, strong considerations of norms by the social environment with respect to SRI, strong environmental values, and an affinity to left-wing parties have a substantially higher estimated average willingness to pay for sustainable fixed-interest investment products. The third study shows (on the basis of both questionnaire and experimental data) that particularly too high (perceived) information costs regarding SRI prevent investors from investing (more) in SRI. It further reveals that different investor types face different barriers regarding SRI market participation: Receiving no offer by their bank is a big market entry hurdle especially for interested investors, while distrust in providers of SRI is a severe issue discouraging skeptical and conventional investors. Based on the experimental data, the analysis reveals that investors of all groups have positive preferences for funds with transparency or sustainability labels suggesting that these labels are an opportunity to decrease information costs thereby enhancing individual demand for SRI. The fourth paper merges the survey data and officially available information on regional religion and political preferences at the zip code level in order to consider the relationship between investments and other fields of individual behavior, but also to examine the relevance of religion and political orientation at the individual and regional level for these activities. The econometric analysis reveals positive effects and the importance of individual and regional measures for religion and political orientation on different kinds of sustainable activities independently of their degree of observability or irreversibility. Thereby, the results emphasize the importance of individual identity and social norms for individual behavior in general. Hence, besides its contribution to scientific discourse, this dissertation provides information for political decision makers as well as various relevant market players, such as banks or fund providers...|$|E
