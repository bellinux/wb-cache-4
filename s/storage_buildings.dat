5|$|The Maintenance Historic District {{includes}} four CCC-built structures. The storage {{building is a}} wood-frame structure with a gable roof, similar to military <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> built in the 1930s and 1940s. A three-bay garage of standard military design is included in this historic district. The Park Manager's residence is a -story gable-roofed house, with modern vinyl siding.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} to the south-west of the castle is a barracks block and associated <b>storage</b> <b>buildings,</b> constructed soon after 1718. Built to replace the original barrack accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped to convert it into a magazine, it has changed little externally in the last 300 years. It is a rare surviving example of an 18th-century building of this type {{and was one of}} the first distinct barracks to be built in England.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{steelmaking}} building, {{with the}} exception of the lime <b>storage</b> <b>building,</b> was demolished in 2005. The lime <b>storage</b> <b>building</b> was brought down with explosives on 18 April 2010.|$|R
50|$|On December 19, 1983, a fire {{completely}} destroyed the cart shed/club <b>storage</b> <b>building</b> located {{next to the}} Golf Pro Shop. Fortunately, the Golf Pro Shop itself sustained only minor damage. A modern and spacious cart shed/club <b>storage</b> <b>building</b> was constructed during 1984 with many fire-safety features.|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, {{all types of}} resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E
5|$|Naval and {{defensive}} technology continued to improve {{over the next}} few decades, rendering Tilbury Fort's bastion design out-moded. The government considered the defences further down the Thames to be sufficient and Tilbury was therefore not improved; it was largely redundant as a defensive fortification {{by the end of the}} century, although still in use as a strategic depot. From 1889 onwards it formed a mobilisation centre to support a mobile strike force in the event of an invasion, part of the wider London Defence Scheme, and large <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> were built across the site to store materiel.|$|E
5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large <b>storage</b> <b>buildings,</b> and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, Sheriff Porttens deputized {{two hundred}} men and they {{marched to the}} {{terminal}} building where they attempted to assist the strikebreakers in moving the streetcars from the street and vulnerable terminal building to the more easily protected carhouse across the street. Todd led the strikebeakers in the effort while the police provided protection. The police were able {{to hold back the}} crowd at first, using clubs to hit anyone who attempted to interfere. The rioters increased the intensity of their attack, and men on the rooftops began throwing stones and bricks. Todd was hit multiple times and {{was rushed to the hospital}} with severe injuries. The greatly outnumbered police began to abandon their posts and the strikebreakers fled into the <b>storage</b> <b>buildings.</b> People in the crowd opened fire on a storage building and killed one of the strikebreakers and injured others. By the end of November 3, after two days of protecting the cars, less than fifty policemen remained on duty in the city. Meanwhile, the strike degenerated into a riot encompassing the entire downtown.|$|E
5|$|Structural damage {{ranged from}} the {{superficial}} to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).|$|E
5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E

25|$|The {{lime kiln}} complex {{comprised}} the kiln itself, a pond for slaking the calcium oxide from the kiln {{to produce the}} slaked lime, hydrated lime, or pickling lime. Several cottages were built nearby for the lime-burners, shipbuilders and blacksmiths, etc. and <b>storage</b> <b>buildings.</b> The main set of cottages are neither evidenced on any maps nor in census returns until after 1851, indicating {{that they were not}} built until later and only one census return in the 19th century lists a lime-kiln worker. A small wharf on the river allowed for the unloading of sailing barges.|$|E

25|$|In 1814, {{the ground}} {{floors of the}} Rham Barracks, the Maria Theresa Barracks, and the riding barracks were renovated for use as stables. Out of the five <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> for grain and flour which had been built by 1795, {{the one in the}} upper town was used as a stable. Together, these had a {{capacity}} of 386 horses. By late 1819, the artillery required a new riding arena to train a large number of new horses that were being delivered. For this, they wanted to use the garden of an old monastery on the Saint-Esprit Plateau. By 1835, an indoor riding arena in the lower yard of the plateau had been completed. This had enough room to train a squadron, and in war time {{could be used as a}} livestock shed or as a fodder store.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{buildings}} at Lista Air Station were built during the Second World War. They were modernized by the RNoAF, but retained their original structure. Most of {{the buildings}} were of standard German design and were found both at other Norwegian and other Luftwaffe airports from the era. The operative headquarters were located at {{the eastern end of}} the wooden runway. Most {{of the buildings}} were located {{on the west side of}} the main runway. The facilities included offices, quarters, mess halls, <b>storage</b> <b>buildings,</b> a cinema and storage areas. The most elaborate building is the officer's mess, which remains today as a listed building. The two-story building features a roofed colonnade, a hipped roof and cob-worked log walls. The entire base consisted of about 300 buildings. The airbase and surrounding area were connected by a narrow-gauge railway, the Lunde Line.|$|E
25|$|The Inca state drew its taxes {{through both}} tax in kind and corvée labor drawn from {{lineages}} and administered through a bureaucracy composed largely of local nobility. The corvée labor force {{was used for}} military operations as well as public works projects, such as roads, aqueducts, and <b>storage</b> <b>buildings</b> known as tampu and qollqa. There were parallel institutions of lineage-based colonies known as mitmaqkuna, which produced goods for the state and provided strategic security in newly acquired areas, and yanakuna, which were retainers with labor obligations to higher members of the state. Lands belonging to the Sapa Inca, the state church, and to panaqas (lineages descending from individual Sapa Incas according {{to the principle of}} split inheritance) were often vertical arrayed to access a variety of resources. Indeed, it has been widely suggested that the terraces at Moray were testing grounds for determining which crops would grow under what conditions in order to more efficiently exploit ecozones. The terraces were apparently constructed so that different temperatures and humidities could be achieved through the creation of microclimates, and therefore produce different kinds of crops.|$|E
