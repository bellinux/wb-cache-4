The hot tensile tests revealed the conventional Nb-stabilized austenites to have the strongest susceptibility to intergranular liquation cracking followed by the unstabilized material A 304. The titanium stabilized qualities (conventional and optimized ones) exhibited no relevant susceptibility to intergranular liquation cracking. The optimized Nb-stabilized austenite showed no relevant susceptibility to intergranular liquation cracking. The weld simulation tests revealed {{with respect to the}} heat affected zone (HAZ) close to the fusion line the unstabilized austenite A 304 to be most sensitive to intergranular stress cor-rosion cracking (IGSCC) under Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) conditions. The titanium stabilized austenites (conventional and optimized ones) showed a significantly lower suscep-tibility to IGSCC. Furthermore, the conventional Nb-stabilized austenites proved to be less sensitive to IGSCC than the Ti-stabilized ones.

The following materials were selected for the presented study: 316 Ti <b>stabilized</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steel,</b> martensitic 9 - 12 %Cr steel P 92 and ferritic ODS steel MA 956. The main attention was focused on the long-term microstructural stability during high temperature exposure of heterogeneous joints of the austenite / ferrite type. The literature analysis critically evaluates the current state of knowledge {{in the field of}} microstructural stability of advanced creep-resistant steels weld joints. The practical experimental part was carried out in two directions. On the basis of the chemical composition phase equilibrium calculations were performed for each steel using the ThermoCalc software, giving the basic concepts about the dependence of the phase composition and the chemical composition of phases on temperature. In parallel with these calculations the laboratory joints 316 Ti/P 92 made by resistance welding and the MA 956 / 316 Ti electron beam weld joints were prepared, analyzed in as-weld state and further annealed at different temperature conditions. Exposed joints were subjected to microstructure and phase analysis. The stability of the weld interface was mainly observed. Attention was also focused on the agreement between the calculation and experimental data in comparison with data published in the literature. Based on the calculations, experimental results and published data the suitability of the combination of materials is discussed in the thesis and reasoning about the behavior of studied weld joints during long-term high temperature exposure was formulated. Based on the results the expected degree of microstructural stability of 316 Ti/P 92 joint was confirmed, while the joints MA 956 / 316 Ti were found to be unstable...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} was the {{comparison}} of corrosion resistance in an aqueous sulfuric acid solution of two high-manganese <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels</b> of the 0. 05 C- 25 Mn-Al-Si-Nb-Ti type in a plastically deformed state. Design/methodology/approach: Investigations were carried out on specimens obtained from a thermo-mechanically rolled sheet and then plastically deformed through bending and immersed in corrosive solutions (1 N H 2 SO 4) for 100 hours. The mass decrement was calculated by the gravimetric method, whereas the character of corrosion damages was observed in metallographic investigations using light and scanning electron microscopes both in the polished and etched states. Findings: It was found that after the thermo-mechanical processing one steel is characterized by an austenitic structure with numerous annealing twins, whereas in the second steel lamellar martensitic phases in an austenitic matrix occur. The investigations showed that the examined high-manganese steels have very low corrosion resistance in normal H 2 SO 4. Higher impact on the corrosion resistance than the phase composition has the chemical composition. The mass decrement of the steel with martensite plates is a bit higher than that witha single-phase austenitic matrix. The specimens were intensively dissolved due to general corrosion accompanying by pitting and hydrogen cracking. Research limitations/implications: To investigate in more detail the corrosion behaviour of high-manganese <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels,</b> the polarization tests and the analysis of corrosion products should be carried out.

The two fluxes considered are respectively used for the casting of a ferritic steel (type 409) and an <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel</b> (type 321). Concerning the titanium pick-up (expressed as Ti 02), the Ti 02 content of the flux stabilised at about 3 - 4 % for the mould flux of the ferritic steel and at about 6 % for the mould flux of the <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel</b> after 20 minutes of casting. At the same time due to the reduction of Si 02 in the molten flux by TiN and Ti in the steel the basicity of the mould flux of the ferritic steel increased from 0. 8 to 0. 9 while it increased from 0. 95 to 1. 2 for the mould flux of the <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel.</b> The SEM/EDS analysis of the sampled flux during casting showed only some spherical metallic droplets {{in the case of the}} mould flux of the ferritic steel but for the mould flux of the <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel</b> apart from the metallic droplets, some precipitates rich in Ca, Ti and O were identified in the glassy phases. Rotational viscometry carried out on the two fluxes showed that there is a decrease in the viscosity of the fluxes with the absorption of Ti 02, Ti 2 O 3 and Ti 3 O 5 in the range of 2 to 10 wt%, for temperatures from 1400 °C to 1200 °C.
