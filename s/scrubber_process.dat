50|$|In the {{circulating}} {{fluidized bed}} <b>scrubber</b> <b>process,</b> flue gas {{will enter the}} reactor {{from the bottom of}} the vessel. Simultaneously, hydrated lime will be injected into the circulating fluidized bed absorber for reaction to take place to convert SO2 and SO3 from the flue gas to calcium sulfate and calcium sulfite. Water will also be injected at the same time to control the operation temperature for maximum absorption capacity. The flue gas will then send to the bag house for further filtration. In the bag house, a series of air valves across the filters, will produce compressed air bursts to ensure a more efficient solid and dust collection. Lastly, clean flue gas will then be directed to the stack with the minimum pollutants in the flue gas stream. The schematic diagram of the process is shown in Figure 1.|$|E
40|$|Several {{bacteria}} {{from the}} ambient surroundingｓ were examined for biological removal of hydrogen sulifide. Dry pig feces {{was shown to}} be a good source of the bacteria removing hydrogen sulfide. The bacteria were cultivated in the presence of hydrogen sulfide, and then the capability of removing hydrogen sulfide was examined with apparatuses of aerating process and <b>scrubber</b> <b>process.</b> The aerating process showed a good result that about 13 ppm of hydrogen sulfide was almost completely removed at the flow rate of 940 mLmin- 1. At higher flow rate, the removal efficiency decreased. The <b>scrubber</b> <b>process</b> did not work well. The gas-liquid contact time {{was supposed to be the}} main reason of the low efficiency. In the aerating process, long time operation resulted in the decrease in the removal efficiency with the decrease in the amount of bacteria. Addition of nutrient recovered the efficiency as well as the amount of living bacteria. Thus, the bacteria removing hydrogen sulfide ware heterotrophic. Complete isolation of the bacteria has not been succeeded. Two types of bacterium were observed even after repeated streak on nutrient broth agar media. One of those was Gram-negative bacillus (0. 4 μm × 1. 3 μm) and the other was Gram-negative cocuss (0. 4 μm) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} {{of carbon dioxide}} caused by burning fossil fuels {{is one of the}} leading sources of global warming. Reducing the amount of CO 2 released into the atmosphere through carbon sequestration can mitigate this problem. One method of carbon sequestration is the use of a carbon dioxide scrubber. Once captured, CO 2 can be used to create a valuable chemical commodity such as calcium carbonate nanoparticles. To create CaCO 3 particles in the 50 - 100 nanometer range, a chemical additive is necessary to limit particle size. The study used a laboratory scale carbon dioxide scrubber to react CO 2 with calcium chloride and OH- ions to form calcium carbonate nanoparticles. Varying CaCl 2 concentrations were tested as well as two chemical additives (AOT and PEG) in varying amounts. The resulting CaCO 3 nanoparticles were analyzed to determine average particle size using dynamic light scattering. The study confirmed that the <b>scrubber</b> <b>process</b> effectively reduced CO 2 released from the system. In general, larger quantities of additive led to smaller particles, but while AOT and PEG both limit CaCO 3 particle size, AOT was the most effective. Unexpected results showed that larger concentrations of CaCl 2 reduce the formation of bubble build-up in the reactor. Future work can be done to explore this effect of CaCl 2 on sud formation by monitoring and recording bubble levels during the reaction...|$|E

40|$|Acid {{scrubbers}} and biotrickling filters {{have been}} developed for ammonia (NH 3) removal at pig and poultry houses in The Netherlands over the last 20 years to prevent acidification and eutrophication of soils. Because of growing suburbanization, odor removal is increasingly considered important as well. In this review, we report the results of the on-farm research on full-scale operated scrubbers for treatment of exhaust air from animal houses with regard to NH 3 and odor removal in The Netherlands. The NH 3 removal of acid scrubbers ranged from 40 % to 100 % with an overall average of 96 %. The NH 3 removal of biotrickling filters ranged from - 8 % to + 100 % with an overall average of 70 %. Minimum empty bed air residence times (EBRTs) were 0. 4 to 1. 1 s. For acid <b>scrubbers,</b> <b>process</b> control with pH measurement and automatic water discharge is sufficient to guarantee sufficient NH 3 removal. For biotrickling filters, however, improvement of process control is necessary to guarantee sufficient NH 3 removal. The odor removal of acid scrubbers ranged from 3 % to 51 % with an overall average of 27 %. The odor removal of biotrickling filters ranged from - 29 % to + 87 % with an overall average of 51 %. Minimum EBRTs were 0. 5 to 2. 3 s. Further research is necessary to explain this variation and to improve the odor removal efficiency of both acid scrubbers and biotrickling filters...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this Energy & Environmental Research Center project was to {{evaluate}} water capture technologies in a carbon capture and sequestration system and perform a complete systems analysis of the process to determine potential water minimization opportunities within the entire system. To achieve that goal, a pilot-scale liquid desiccant dehumidification system (LDDS) was fabricated and tested {{in conjunction with a}} coal-fired combustion test furnace outfitted with CO{sub 2 } mitigation technologies, including the options of oxy-fired operation and postcombustion CO{sub 2 } capture using an amine <b>scrubber.</b> The <b>process</b> gas stream for these tests was a coal-derived flue gas that had undergone conventional pollutant control (particulates, SO{sub 2 }) and CO{sub 2 } capture with an amine-based scrubber. The water balance data from the pilot-scale tests show that the packed-bed absorber design was very effective at capturing moisture down to levels that approach equilibrium conditions...|$|R
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a <b>scrubber).</b> The DIAMEX <b>process</b> is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|R
40|$|Summary of {{activities}} and key accomplishments are presented for the following tasks: NO{sub x} subsystem; SO{sub 2 } particulate/air toxics/solid by-product subsystem; boiler subsystem; balance of plant subsystem; and control and sensors subsystem. Combustion cases completed for the DRB-XCL{reg_sign} burner and the initial DRB- 4 Z{trademark} configuration were compared with measured furnace exit data and observed flame characteristics from the initial round of Subsystem Testing to baseline the models prior to parametric runs. A series of combustion models have been completed for the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} to evaluate the distributed introduction of secondary combustion air into the flame and key hardware components planned for the May Subsystem Testing campaign. On {{the basis of the}} results compiled during the concept selection process completed in Phase I, the Limestone Injection Dry <b>Scrubbers</b> (LIDS) <b>process</b> was selected for further development and evaluation. Through engineering analysis, experimental testing, and numerical modeling, a LIDS process is being developed that is capable of ultra-high SO{sub 2 } removal and superior particulate control while addressing the potential issues of air toxic emissions and solid byproduct utilization. The progress of the LIDS activities is discussed in this report...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} sustainable process for simultaneous removal of waste gases such as NO, NO 2, and SO 2 by an electrochemically generated Ag(I) /Ag(II) redox mediator system. High removal efficiency was achieved for NO and SO 2 by the wet scrubbing method at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This removal is achieved through oxidation and absorption by contacting the gaseous stream with redox mediator ions that offer specific or selective solubility for the solute gases to be recovered in a wet <b>scrubber.</b> The <b>process</b> parameters such as gas velocity, liquid velocity, Ag(I) concentration, and HNO 3 concentration were investigated to explore the possibility of complete removal of waste gases. The Ag(I) /Ag(II) -based mediated electrochemical oxidation process proved to be quite effective for simultaneous removal of NO, NOx, and SO 2 from the simulated flue gas mixtures containing NO and SO 2 over a wide concentration range of 100 - 400 ppm. Studies were carried out with individual gas components for the mixture, and the effect of input NO and input SO 2 concentrations on the NOx and SO 2 removal efficiencies at 20 °C was examined. Complete oxidation of NO to NO 2 with 100...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{provide the}} first process {{simulation}} able to depict a complete {{life cycle inventory}} of a biomass gasification {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant. The model predicts the detailed mass and energy balances, minor compounds emissions (such as NOx, SOx, aromatics,etc.). It is based on a phenomenological approach for dryer, reactors (gasification and combustion) and <b>scrubber</b> modeling. <b>Process</b> units are modeled with Aspen Plus models completed with dedicated Fortran sub-models when more details are required. The gasifier is a Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB). It is decomposed in three sections, describing the three main mechanisms occurring in the reactor: wood pyrolysis, secondary reactions and char combustion. At the outlet of the gasifier, the complete composition of the syngas is predicted, which includes water, permanent gases, inorganics, particles and tars (phenol, benzene, toluene, styrene, indene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene). Simulation results were validated against measurements from a pilot plant and other literature data. A wet conventional syngas cleaning system for gasification plant, including cyclone, catalytic tar cracker, syngas cooler, bag filters, water scrubber and wastewater treatment was considered and modeled. The complexity of tar composition allows a reliable determination of tar dew point. At the outlet of the cleaning system, syngas is burned in gas engines. Gaseous emissions (NOx, SOx, etc.) of the gas engines and the DFB combustor are also handled by the model as well as ashes and liquid waste. The predicted electrical and thermal efficiencies are 27 and 39 % respectively. ...|$|R
50|$|Bankside B had a {{flue-gas}} washing {{plant to}} mitigate air pollution at its central London location. Only two British power stations {{had previously been}} fitted with such equipment: Battersea power station and Fulham power station. At Bankside flue-gases from the boilers were washed with a three-pass counter-current/co-current flow of river water from the Thames (to which chalk was added) in cedar wood <b>scrubber</b> towers. This <b>process</b> produced a characteristic white plume from the chimney. The plant was effective at removing sulphur compounds from the flue-gases (over its operational life it achieved an overall average sulphur removal efficiency of 97.2%). However, the process cooled the gases which caused ‘plume-droop’ under certain atmospheric conditions, causing a fume nuisance at ground level. Contaminated water from the flue-gas washing plant was treated in tanks through which air was bubbled, this oxidised the sulphite to sulphate, the water was diluted with water from the condensers before being returned to the river. This pollution was insignificant in the 1950s but was detrimental to {{the recovery of the}} Thames after concerted efforts were made to clean-up the river from the late-1960s.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. mining {{industry}} produces over 7, 000, 000 tonnes/yr of process residue that may contain hazardous species {{as well as}} valuable by-products. Process residues are generated by (a) smelter off-gas cleaning― 5, 500, 000 tonnes/yr; and (b) bag house dust and wastewater treatment― 2, 100, 000 tonnes/yr (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1995). The right technology {{may be able to}} recover marketable by-products from this process residue to generate revenue and reduce disposal costs for the {{mining industry}}. In fact, such a technology was invented by a small U. S. business, SepraDyne®, and is being developed and has been commercialized at an Arizona copper mine to treat smelter off-gas <b>scrubber</b> sludge. The <b>process</b> separates mercury from lead, copper, gold, and silver, so the residue is either recycled to recover additional copper or sold to recover lead, bismuth, and trace gold and silver (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1991). The following paper reviews the processing steps used to mine and refine copper at this Arizona facility. This overview provides background for understanding the source of the process residue being treated by SepraDyne―smelter off-gas cleaning sludge, called “acid plant sludge. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. This {{carried out}} work is aimed {{enhancing}} {{the efficiency of}} the spray <b>scrubber</b> by combining <b>processes</b> and improving hydraulic conditions in the device. The problem of treating waste gases is often characterized by unique features and the significant factor that makes it difficult to find {{a solution to the problem}} of treatment is the low and/or variable concentration of the pollutant. With a removal efficiency of up to 98 %, wet treatment technology in scrubber type devices is the only practical method advantageous to the treatment of waste gases. The set objective is solved by developing a two-stage treatment system for pyrolysis gas based on ejector scrubbers. Their advantage - a central nozzle supply that allows the scrubber to operate on the principle of an ejector pump. A drift eliminator of the developed device is located on the case unit and a chain is suspended from a clamp mounted on the lower part of the tube neck by pins and two detachable joints. The operation of the scrubber was checked in compliance with the absorption gas treatment of sulfur dioxide. A chemical sorbent, calcium carbonate which is produced as a by-product in the manufacture of nitroammophos at JSC “Minudobrenia” factory is used. Preliminary results indicate that the stiochiometric inlet ratio of Ca/S equals about 2. 0 and SO 2 emissions reduce by 80 - 90 %, significantly larger than the planned 70 % and subsequently corresponds to the residue concentration of less than 30 mg/m 3. This is explained by the greater degree of capture and deposition of the sorbent on the chain curtain (not more than 20 mg/m 3). The proposed device for treating gases enables: improvement in the efficiency of gas treatment; increased reliability; increase in the degree of treatment of the gas flow without the use of additional equipment; reduction in metal and design complexity; reduction on the cost of the treatment process and simplification in the device design...|$|R
