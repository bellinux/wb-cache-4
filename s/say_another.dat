5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce <b>say</b> <b>another</b> {{effect of}} the case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community.

25|$|The {{statute of}} {{limitations}} applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, <b>say,</b> <b>another</b> disseisor who then left the property). However, if adverse possession is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, {{it may be possible}} for the second disseisor to claim adverse possession for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as tacking.|$|E
500|$|The film {{attracted}} 236,189 viewers at the French box office. Time Out gave a favourable review, {{calling the}} film a [...] "welcome {{addition to the}} post-holocaust barbarism [...] boom." [...] Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater Near You gave a moderately positive review, stating [...] "While the film’s heart is syrupy-sentimental (who’s shocked?), its surfaces are clean, incremental, reverently silent—appropriate, given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it [...] "a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs." [...] Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: [...] "The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, {{but it is also}} an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who really has nothing to <b>say.</b> <b>Another</b> John Carpenter is born, which {{is by no means a}} bad thing." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not <b>say</b> <b>another</b> word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E
2500|$|Socrates asks Hippias if Homer has not portrayed Achilles as a wily man. [...] Hippias {{counters}} that Achilles {{is the most}} straightforward of men, simple and true, and cites a passage where Achilles declares his hatred for men who think one thing and <b>say</b> <b>another,</b> or who do not do {{what they say they}} will do. [...] Socrates does not object to Hippias' literalism, and seems to abandon the literary question, saying that Homer is dead, and the thing cannot be resolved (365d). He tells Hippias that because he agrees with Homer that a simple and true man is better than a wily and cunning one, he will let him speak for Homer.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1966, local announcers {{exclusively}} {{called the}} World Series. Typically, the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC television would choose the announcers, who would represent {{each of the}} teams {{that were in the}} World Series for the respective year. For the 1966 World Series, Curt Gowdy called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in Los Angeles, and Chuck Thompson in Baltimore. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement as he said [...] "What about the road? My fans won't be able to hear me." [...] In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first 4½ innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to <b>say</b> <b>another</b> word.|$|E

2500|$|After {{arriving}} at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Chris Carroll, the first Las Vegas police officer to arrive on the scene, heard Shakur's last words, [...] "fuck you". Carroll reports that he refused to <b>say</b> <b>another</b> word to him or another officer. According to {{an interview with the}} music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, Shakur received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record company and threatened Shakur. Gobi informed the Las Vegas police but said that the police claimed to be understaffed. No attackers came. At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life-support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly {{trying to get out of}} the bed.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1997, {{during a}} pre-game interview, Gaston accused {{specific}} members of Toronto's sports media (Toronto Sun columnist Steve Simmons, Globe and Mail sports editor Dave Langford, and Fan 590 sports {{talk show host}} Bob McCown) of racism against him, stating [...] "There's a couple (of sports writers) who continue to take shots at me {{for no reason at}} all. I just wonder if they would take the same shot at me if I was white." [...] After the game against the Oakland A's on April 17, Gaston spoke briefly about his pre-game comments. [...] "I've got one statement that I'm going to say, and I'm not going to <b>say</b> <b>another</b> word", Gaston said. [...] "Whatever has been said, whatever has been written, if it has offended someone and it's unjustly offended them, I apologize. If it hasn't, then I don't apologize." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, <b>say,</b> <b>another</b> sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E
