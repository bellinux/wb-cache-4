In some workplaces, {{in this case is}} Pertamina gas station SPBU 74. 94205 Diponegoro, Palu, there is a circumstance where the distribution of operators’ workload is not equal.

This research is focused on identifying the current workload distribution and revising the work <b>shift</b> (7 -hour Morning <b>Shift,</b> 8 -hour Day <b>Shift,</b> 9 -hour Night <b>Shift),</b> which is one factor that impact workload distribution. Two alternatives of work <b>shift</b> model, based on Miller’s suggestion, are proposed to the company. The expected workload distributions of the proposed models are compared to the current work <b>shift’s</b> workload distribution. The result of analysis shows that the current work <b>shift</b> has unequal workload distribution, indicated by its standard deviation, which is higher than the standard deviation of two alternatives of work <b>shift</b> model that have been adjusted. The adjusted work <b>shift</b> model with the lowest standard deviation indicates that the expected workload assigned is more equally allocated.

40|$|Background. <b>Shift</b> work is {{associated}} with sleep and health problems. Tolerance to <b>shift</b> work is reported to decrease with age. <b>Shift</b> work tolerance {{should be considered in}} different <b>shift</b> work populations. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between age, <b>shift</b> work exposure, <b>shift</b> type, and morningness and sleep/health problems in oil rig <b>shift</b> workers. Material and methods. A total of 199 workers participated. They worked either two weeks of 12 -h day <b>shifts</b> (n = 96) or two weeks of swing <b>shifts</b> (n = 103) (one week of 12 -h night <b>shifts</b> followed by one week of 12 -h day <b>shifts),</b> followed by four weeks off work. The workers filled out questionnaires on demographics, work, sleep, and health. Results. We found no significant associations between age or years of <b>shift</b> work exposure and any of the sleep, sleepiness, or health parameters. There was a significant association between <b>shift</b> type and sleep duration, showing that swing <b>shift</b> workers had longer sleep duration than day <b>shift</b> workers. In addition, we found a significant association between the interaction age*, <b>shift</b> type, and sleep duration, where sleep duration was negatively associated with age for the swing <b>shift</b> workers and positively associated with age for the day <b>shift</b> workers. There were significant associations between morningness and sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and insomnia. Conclusions. Older workers may tolerate <b>shift</b> work well. Age, <b>shift</b> work exposure time, and <b>shift</b> type seemed not to affect <b>shift</b> work tolerance in this population. However, this may be due to a healthy worker effect and/or selection bias. </p...|$|R
