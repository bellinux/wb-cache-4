25|$|Sunspots {{number is}} {{correlated}} with the intensity of solar radiation over the period since 1979, when satellite measurements became available. The variation caused by the sunspot cycle to solar output is relatively small, {{on the order of}} 0.1% of the <b>solar</b> <b>constant</b> (a peak-to-trough range of 1.3W·m−2 compared with 1366W·m−2 for the average <b>solar</b> <b>constant).</b>|$|E
25|$|Abbot {{began his}} {{astrophysics}} research focusing on solar radiation before proceeding to chart cyclic patterns found in solar variations. With this research {{he hoped to}} track <b>solar</b> <b>constant</b> {{in order to make}} weather pattern predictions. He believed that the sun was a variable star which effected the weather on Earth, which was criticized by many contemporaries. In 1953, he discovered a connection between solar variations and planetary climate. This discovery allowed general climate patterns to be predicted 50 years in advance. He did field work at the Smithsonian Institution Shelter, which was built during his tenure as director at SAO, Lick Observatory, and Mount Wilson Observatory. At Lick, he worked with W.W. Campbell. To fight critics, Abbot would utilize balloons with pyrheliometers installed on them for measurements. He was the first scientist in America to do so, with the balloons reaching upwards of 25 kilometers. One balloon returned data that allowed Abbot to determine the <b>solar</b> <b>constant</b> at the highest point of the Earth's atmosphere. Later in his research career, he turned his focus on solar energy use.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{correlations}} {{of the solar}} radiation for the Athens area are provided, based on hourly measurements over the period 1955 - 1980. These correlations are of two kinds: The first, which provide the average total radiation incident on a horizontal surface in terms of hour, day, and month of the typical year, is suitable for solar energy collection applications. The correlations of the second kind provide the maximum radiation and are suitable {{for use in the}} design of air-conditioning installations or other applications requiring knowledge of maximum values. The correlations of this kind are based on the calculation of the <b>solar</b> <b>constants</b> A, B, and C, i. e. the ""apparent solar irradiation at zero air mass,"" the ""atmospheric extinction coefficient,"" and the ""diffuse radiation factor,"" respectively. These <b>solar</b> <b>constants</b> permit the calculation of the maximum direct normal radiation and of the maximum diffuse radiation {{as well as of the}} total radiation on surfaces of various orientations and inclinations.

25|$|Most of the world's {{high energy}} {{resources}} {{are from the}} conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter (see <b>solar</b> <b>constant),</b> though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of solar energy received by the planet; about half, 89,000TW, reaches the Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|One of Persinger's lifelong endeavors {{has been}} to {{establish}} a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations. The Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) developed by Persinger and John S. Derr predicted that luminous phenomena and associated physical effects were produced by manifestations of tectonic strain that often precedes by weeks to months seismic events within the region. Persinger argues that the labeling of these manifestations such as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) {{has changed over the}} centuries and reflects the characteristics of the culture. The support for the theory was primarily correlational. The temporal contiguity of reports of unidentified luminous phenomena preceding local seismicity due to injections of fluids was considered a quasi-experimental support for the hypothesis. Alternative models, developed by Persinger and David Vares, were quantified for interaction between quantum values and specific magnitude earthquakes, global climate variations, interactions with population densities, discrete energies as mediators of disease, and processes by which human cognition could be covertly affected by Schumann Resonances and geomagnetic activity. The hypothesis was recently criticized by a prominent blogger. Persinger has estimated that the total biomass of the planet was equivalent to the accumulated solar energy (<b>solar</b> <b>constant)</b> on the Earth’s surface. The shared photon origin was considered one source for “entanglement” between living systems.|$|E
500|$|The <b>solar</b> <b>constant</b> is {{the amount}} of power that the Sun {{deposits}} per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The <b>solar</b> <b>constant</b> is equal to approximately [...] (watts per square meter) at a distance of one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth). Sunlight on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere, so that less power arrives at the surface (closer to [...] ) in clear conditions when the Sun is near the zenith. Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light. The atmosphere in particular filters out over 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths. Solar ultraviolet radiation ionizes Earth's dayside upper atmosphere, creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.|$|E

40|$|A XeCl laser pumped iodine laser {{oscillator}} was developed {{which will be}} incorporated into the Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) system. The developed XeCl laser produces output energy of about 60 mJ per pulse. The pulse duration was about 10 nsec. The kinetic model for the solar-pumped laser was refined and the algorithm for the calculation of a set of rate equations was improved to increase the accuracy and the efficiency of the calculation. The improved algorithm was applied to explain the existing experimental data taken from a flashlamp pumped iodine laser for three kinds of lasants, i-C 3 F 7 I, n-C 4 F 9 I, and t-C 4 F 9 I. Various solid laser materials were evaluated for solar-pumping. The materials studied were Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, and Cr:Nd:GSGG crystals. The slope efficiency of 0. 17 percent was measured for the Nd:YLF near the threshold pump intensity which was 211 <b>solar</b> <b>constants</b> (29 W/sq cm). The threshold pump intensity of the Nd:YAG was measured to be 236 <b>solar</b> <b>constants</b> (32 W/sq cm) and the near-threshold slope efficiency was 0. 12 percent. True CW laser operation of Cr:Nd:GSGG was possible only at pump intensities {{less than or equal to}} 1, 500 <b>solar</b> <b>constants</b> (203 W/sq cm).
