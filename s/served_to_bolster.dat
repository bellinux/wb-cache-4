25|$|The six-track EP was {{released}} in 1997, and set them off on a small club tour around northeast America. Shortly before their first tour as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Brantley left the group {{and was replaced by}} John Fulton. During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances. Their performances were increasingly wild, and often violent. These elaborate performances, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of Relapse Records to offer the band a multi-record contract. The band agreed to the contract, and recorded their second EP with Relapse titled Under the Running Board. Shortly after its release, Fulton left the band over creative differences. The three-song EP release <b>served</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> anticipation for their 1999 full-length release, Calculating Infinity.|$|E

Accordingly, 49 U.S. fighter-bombers took off from the [...] and the [...] to attack North Vietnamese barracks in Đồng Hới, {{just north of the}} 17th Parallel. When informed of the strikes, Khánh reportedly opened a bottle of champagne to celebrate the occasion because it <b>served</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> the morale of the South Vietnamese military, and showed that the U.S. was now more determined to fight North Vietnam. The Viet Cong, however, were not deterred by those air strikes, as they launched another attack on a U.S. installation in Qui Nhơn [...] on 10 February 1965, which caused the death of a further 23 U.S. military personnel. In response, a combined force of about 160 U.S. and South Vietnamese fighter-bombers launched a larger attack against the North Vietnamese, targeting Chap Le and Chanh Hoa, also located just north of the 17th Parallel.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Yongle Emperor ordered {{episodes of}} bloody purges like his father—including the {{execution}} of Fang Xiaoru, who refused to draft the proclamation of his succession—the emperor had a different attitude about the scholar-officials. He had a selection of texts compiled from the Cheng-Zhu school of Confucianism—or Neo-Confucianism—in order to assist those who studied for the civil service examinations. The Yongle Emperor commissioned two thousand scholars to create a 50-million-word (22,938-chapter) long encyclopedia—the Yongle Encyclopedia—from seven thousand books. This surpassed all previous encyclopedias in scope and size, including the 11th-century compilation of the Four Great Books of Song. Yet the scholar-officials {{were not the only}} political group that the Yongle Emperor had to cooperate with and appease. Historian Michael Chang points out that the Yongle Emperor was an [...] "emperor on horseback" [...] who often traversed between two capitals like in the Mongol tradition and constantly led expeditions into Mongolia. This was opposed by the Confucian establishment while it <b>served</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> the importance of eunuchs and military officers whose power depended upon the emperor's favor.|$|E

50|$|Preterism {{holds that}} the {{contents}} of Revelation constitute a prophecy of events that were fulfilled in the 1st century. Preterists believe the dating {{of the book of}} Revelation is of vital importance and that it was written before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Preterism was first expounded by the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar during the Counter Reformation.

50|$|Thomas did not re-join the SaberCats at {{the start}} of the 2015 season, once again fueling {{speculation}} that he had retired. During the offseason, San Jose had acquired AFL superstar cornerback Virgil Gray; this <b>served</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> the belief that Thomas' career had reached its end. During a Week 3 contest against the Tampa Bay Storm, Gray suffered a season-ending knee injury; days later, the SaberCats announced Thomas' return to the team. Thomas continued to play well; in 15 games, he recorded 41 tackles (34 solo), 14 pass breakups, and 6 interceptions. In 2015, the SaberCats' defense was historically dominant (allowing just 36.8 points per game, the lowest such figure in modern AFL history); the SaberCats finished the regular season with 17-1 record (tied for the best in AFL history). Thomas' SaberCats won their first two playoff games to advance to ArenaBowl XXVIII, where they faced the Jacksonville Sharks. During the game, Thomas recovered a Michael Lindsay fumble deep in Jacksonville territory; the turnover resulted, shortly thereafter, in a key score for the SaberCats. San Jose would go on to win the game, 68-47, to claim the fourth championship in franchise history; it was also the fourth championship of Thomas' career.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} when the village’s ﬁrst school was {{established}} in Welchweiler. At ﬁrst, classes were only held at a winter school (a school geared towards an agricultural community’s practical needs, held in the winter, when farm families had a bit more time to spare). In 1784, the 27-year-old teacher Johann Geibel from Erzweiler (a now vanished village near Ulmet forsaken by its last few inhabitants in 1974 after having been incorporated into the Baumholder Troop Drilling Ground by the Nazis in 1933) <b>served</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> the teaching staff at the winter school in Welchweiler. The local school was thereby subject to the Ulmet “main school”, to which the municipality had to send 5 barrels and 2 Sester of corn, and also money: 3 Gulden, 5 Batzen and 12 Pfennige. During the 19th century, the village acquired its own school building, and thereafter, classes were held in a single room. In 1962, the local school was closed, and then all Hauptschule students attended school at the Zentralschule Sankt Julian (as of 1969 Hauptschule Offenbach-St. Julian), while the primary school pupils went to the Elzweiler schoolhouse along with schoolchildren from that neighbouring village. Between 1964 and 1966, the Welchweiler schoolhouse underwent a conversion into a community centre. Even the Elzweiler school did not last much longer, and {{with the establishment of}} Verbandsgemeinden came a thoroughly new school organization. Since 1974, Hauptschule students have been attending the Hauptschule (now Regionale Schule) Altenglan, while the primary school pupils have been attending the Grundschule Altenglan in Rammelsbach.|$|E

Macro and micro aspects of China's investment- and export-led growth strategy are discussed along with the problems that the focused pursuit of such a strategy has raised.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{importance}} of social bonds in facilitating an investment in prosocial behavior amongst female prisoners working as HIV peer educators. Female prisoners can lack strong prosocial attachments to both individuals and institutions prior to incarceration. Absent this bond, little prevents the female prisoner from recidivating. Prison provides an opportunity to fashion new attachments that will assist in the reintegrative process. One way to create strong bonds of attachment, particularly for women, is through working as an HIV peer educator while incarcerated. In order to measure attachment levels, interviews were conducted with 49 female prisoners who worked in two HIV prison-based peer programs during their incarceration. Female peers developed strong attachments to one another. Such attachments were formed while incarcerated and were maintained upon release, thus <b>serving</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> support for newfound prosocial identities...|$|R

40|$|The {{ending of}} the war in Sri Lanka in 2009 led to {{significant}} changes in the political strategies pursued by Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora groups in the UK. One contentious feature of these groups’ campaigns has been their use of the ‘genocide’ frame to describe the actions of the Sri Lankan state, which has been predominantly viewed either as a signal of these groups’ strategic naivety or as a coded expression of a wider nationalist agenda. In this article I argue that its growing use in the post-war period is more complex and is best understood in relation to these organizations’ strategies of legitimation. Deploying the genocide frame has served two key functions: to demonstrate groups’ responsiveness to popular demands, and to challenge dominant international approaches to post-war Sri Lanka. Together these functions <b>served</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolster</b> groups’ legitimacy in an environment characterized by political change and high levels of inter-organizational competition...|$|E

40|$|International gender norms {{positively}} influence women's rights organisations' {{capacity to}} lobby, leverage and campaign {{vis a vis}} the state. These norms also influence a state's role, reputation and involvement in the international society of states. Partaking in gender norm discussions, networks and institutions provide opportunities and momentum for women's organisations to demand gender-equal outcomes. With respect to Jordan, this thesis argues that women's organisations recognise the political opportunities afforded them through international society and transnational advocacy networks (TANs) and use these opportunities to their advantage. The fact that Jordan is Western-oriented and dependent on international aid and thus, vulnerable to hierarchical pressures and international norms (some relating <b>to</b> gender) only <b>serves</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolsters</b> the political openings for these organisations. The thesis illustrates this argument by examining the diffusion and localisation of international norms through the participation of 17 Jordanian women's organisations.

In the Catalogue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer (COSMIC) database, approximately 1 % to 2 % {{of the more}} than 5, 000 unique human cancer samples contain nonsynonymous mutations in Lats 1 or Lats 2 [94, 96].

Homozygous deletions of the FAT 1 gene, a putative upstream negative regulator of Hippo signaling, were discovered in 23 % of oral cancer cell lines and 80 % of primary oral cancers [95]. However, given the disproportionately large size of the FAT genes, it is still unclear if FAT gene mutations are ‘passenger’ or ‘driver’ mutations in cancer.|$|R
