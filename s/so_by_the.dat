5|$|Aged 17, Braham {{applied for}} a short service {{commission}} in the RAF, a course that lasted for five years. The commission was designed to find young aviation enthusiasts with the right physical and academic qualities to become flying officers. To Braham's surprise, his application was accepted. His commission was dated 7 March 1937. His service number was 40667. The commission enabled Braham to enter at the rank of pilot officer. His training mainly consisted of an introduction to flying by civilian organisations contracted to do <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> RAF. Successful candidates advanced to military training.|$|E

He decides to jump off the George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after {{catching}} her fiancé Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheating on her. Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E

It became his fourth number-one on the Top Latin Albums chart the week ending 22 October 2011; {{and within a}} week went Gold in Chile, United States and Mexico; and Platinum in Venezuela and Argentina. Independiente was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created to refocus his career. The album was distributed by Warner. Billboard noted that although other groups have decided to go independent after working with major record labels, Arjona {{was by far the}} most important artist in Latin pop to do <b>so.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of 2012, the album sold more than 75,000 copies in the United States and 400,000 copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' {{operating}} hours were decreased due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. This meant that less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe.

5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, McNair took an axe to {{the armored}} {{division}} organization, dramatically downsizing it.

The surplus armored battalions were utilized as separate armored battalions, <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of 1943 there were 54 armored battalions in armored divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By this time, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been dramatically cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten armored divisions were required, and he suggested that six of the sixteen armored divisions already active be broken up. This proposal was not accepted, {{and the number of}} armored divisions was frozen at sixteen.|$|E

5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented from doing <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ewe require aid {{in order to}} live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom {{he and the others}} in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.|$|E
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing <b>so</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E
