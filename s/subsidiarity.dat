5|$|The <b>subsidiarity</b> {{principle}} resolves some {{of these}} issues. The term originates from social thought within the Catholic Church and states that no larger organ shall resolve an issue that can be resolved at a more local level. It {{can be compared to}} federalist principles where entities of the union retain some aspects of sovereignty. Only when two or more members of the federation are affected by any given act does the federal government have the authority to intervene. Giving a reformed UN more powers but enshrining the <b>subsidiarity</b> principle in its Charter would guarantee that the UN does not evolve into a world autocracy that can arbitrarily dictate policy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} <b>subsidiarity</b> means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (<b>subsidiarity),</b> such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
25|$|The {{sovereign}} {{integrity of}} the nation state, opposition to EU federalism and a renewed respect for true <b>subsidiarity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Lisbon allows {{national}} parliaments eight weeks to study legislative proposals {{made by the}} European Commission and decide whether to send a reasoned opinion stating why the national parliament considers it to be incompatible with the principle of <b>subsidiarity.</b> National parliaments may vote to have the measure reviewed. If one third (or one quarter, where the proposed EU measure concerns freedom, justice and security) of {{national parliaments}} are in favour of a review, the Commission would have to review the measure and if it decides to maintain it, must give a reasoned opinion to the Union legislator as to why it considers the measure to be compatible with <b>subsidiarity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Administratively, Portugal is {{a unitary}} and {{decentralized}} State. Nonetheless, operationally, {{it is highly}} centralized system with administrative divisions organized into three tiers. The State is organized under the principles of <b>subsidiarity,</b> local government autonomy, and democratic decentralization of the public service.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Federalism {{is another}} key aspect of paleoconservatism, which adherents see as an antitype to the {{managerial}} state. The paleocon flavor urges honoring the principle of <b>subsidiarity,</b> that is, decentralized government, local rule, private property and minimal bureaucracy. In an international context, this view would be known as federalism and paleocons often look to John C. Calhoun for inspiration.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooperative}} model inverted this method, instead {{scaling up}} one of its founding principles: individual cooperation between members. Individual credit unions delegated specific powers for specific purposes to a federal body, with residual powers remaining in local hands. By respecting the principles of democratic control and <b>subsidiarity</b> credit union leaders were able to achieve vast economies of scale without surrendering local autonomy.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{approach to}} development aid {{would be to}} apply effectively {{what is known as}} fiscal <b>subsidiarity,</b> allowing citizens to decide how to allocate a portion of the taxes they pay to the State. Provided it does not degenerate into the promotion of special interests, this can help to stimulate forms of welfare solidarity from below, with obvious benefits in the area of solidarity for development as well.|$|E
25|$|The European Union (EU) {{consists}} of 28 member states. Each member state is {{party to the}} founding treaties of the union and thereby subject to the privileges and obligations of membership. Unlike members of most international organisations, the member states of the EU are subjected to binding laws in exchange for representation within the common legislative and judicial institutions. Member states must agree unanimously for the EU to adopt policies concerning defence and foreign affairs. <b>Subsidiarity</b> is a founding principle of the EU.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 2011, {{the code}} of ethics was introduced. This {{document}} contains the values that characterize the Cattolica and the rules of conduct. Each student must sign the code before enrolling. The code is based on principles such as integrity, honesty, legality, solidarity, <b>subsidiarity,</b> hospitality, dialogue, excellence, dignity, the promotion of merit, and individual skills, {{as well as the}} prevention and rejection of any unjust discrimination, violence, abuse and improper treatment. The code is formulated to implement the Treaty of Lisbon.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{operates}} {{according to}} the principles of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of <b>subsidiarity</b> (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} {{application}} of the <b>subsidiarity</b> principle to the CFP lies within the argument for its decentralisation. De-centralisation featured prominently in discussions related to the 2002 CFP reform, but the reform itself actually increased centralisation within the CFP, removing the right of Member States to block quota proposals and increasing the EU's role in enforcement. This increasing monopoly and disregard for {{the wishes of the}} fisheries industry led to alienation of stakeholders and resulted in reduced compliance. The failure of this increasingly centralised reform has proved to de-centralisation advocates that stakeholder participation in the governance process is crucial to the future success of fisheries governance.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, it is {{suggested}} that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of subsidiarity—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level. The <b>subsidiarity</b> principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the Community retains exclusive competence. A partial devolution of authority, for example involving Member States in the decision-making process and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.|$|E
25|$|International {{cooperation}} {{is an important}} theme for the party. This includes development cooperation with underdeveloped countries. GreenLeft wants to increase spending on development aid to 0.8% of the gross national product. It wants to open the European markets to goods from Third World countries, under conditions of fair trade. In order to ensure free and fair trade, it wants to increase and democratise international economic organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The party also favours greater international control over financial markets. GreenLeft favours European integration, but is critical about the current policies of the European Commission. It favoured the European Constitution, but after it was voted down in the 2005 referendum, GreenLeft advocated a new treaty which emphasised democracy and <b>subsidiarity.</b> The party is critical about the war against terrorism. It wants to strengthen the peacekeeping powers of the United Nations and reform the Dutch armed forces into a peace force, with the functions of NATO to {{be taken over by}} the European Union and the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Laws in Luxembourg {{specifically}} {{distinguish between}} coercion and {{force in the}} 1973 Act on Regulating the Use of Force. This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers {{such as the use}} of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, <b>subsidiarity,</b> reasonability and measure in order to use force. To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (which is the term for an everyday officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station. By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training. The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg. This report suggests the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of <b>subsidiarity,</b> President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act and the Consumer Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E
500|$|Senate (…) (2) {{points out}} that the Commission’s {{directive}} proposal should be primarily aimed at illegal acquisition and possession of firearms, their proper deactivation and illegal firearms trade, as it is illegal firearms that are used during terror attacks, not firearms possessed in line with law of Member States and thus (3) disagrees with measures proposed in the directive that would lead to limitation of legal firearms owners and to disruption of internal security of the Czech Republic without having any clear preventive or repressive impact on persons possessing firearms illegally; such measures are contrary to the principles of <b>subsidiarity</b> and proportionality (...) ...|$|E
500|$|Historian LeeH. Cheek, Jr., {{distinguishes between}} two strands of American republicanism: the puritan {{tradition}}, based in New England, and the agrarian or South Atlantic tradition, which Cheek argues was espoused by Calhoun. While the New England tradition stressed a politically centralized enforcement {{of moral and}} religious norms to secure civic virtue, the South Atlantic tradition relied on a decentralized moral and religious order {{based on the idea}} of <b>subsidiarity</b> (or localism). Cheek maintains that the [...] "Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions" [...] (1798), written by Jefferson and Madison, were the cornerstone of Calhoun's republicanism. Calhoun emphasized the primacy of subsidiarity——holding that popular rule is best expressed in local communities that are nearly autonomous while serving as units of a larger society.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} argue that {{applying}} the <b>subsidiarity</b> principle to the CFP may not improve the policy's effectiveness, as it may lead to what de Vivero et al. term the [...] "participation paradox"—the theory that the greater the number of actors involved in the decision-making process, the less significant the contribution made by each actor, and the smaller the participatory role played in the policy process. Greater devolution within CFP decision-making may therefore silence {{the voice of the}} fisheries industry as it competes with other state, private and civil actors to whom authority is also granted. Thus, although the <b>subsidiarity</b> principle can facilitate the government-to-governance transition advocated by many in relation to reform of the CFP, the participatory role of key stakeholders affected by the policy must be maximised to ensure the development of an effective and equitable Common Fisheries Policy.|$|E
2500|$|Quadragesimo anno {{was issued}} by Pope Pius XI, on 15 May 1931, 40 years after Rerum novarum. Unlike Leo, who {{addressed}} mainly {{the condition of}} workers, Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications {{of the social and}} economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of [...] and <b>subsidiarity.</b> He noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity, arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism.|$|E
2500|$|A former {{practitioner}} of Zen meditation, and a nominal orthodox Roman Catholic, Bannon's political thinking has {{been influenced by}} the politics of American populism exemplified by Andrew Jackson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, James K. Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, and Trump; by Pope Pius XI’s socio-political philosophy of <b>subsidiarity,</b> as expressed in the 1931 papal encyclical, Quadragesimo anno; and by René Guénon's Traditionalism, extolling the social efficacy of [...] "primordial" [...] faith traditions such as Vedanta, Buddhism, Sufism, and medieval Christianity. Bannon has also cited Alexander Dugin's variant of Traditionalism called Eurasianism. Bannon {{has been described as a}} [...] "policy intellectual".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike nationalists, who esteem {{the role}} of the State or nation over the local or {{regional}} community, traditionalists hold up patriotism as a key principle. Traditionalist conservatives think that loyalty to a locality or region is more central than any commitment to a larger political entity. Traditionalists also welcome the value of <b>subsidiarity</b> and the intimacy of one's community, preferring the Civil Society of Burke's [...] "little platoons" [...] over the expanded state. Alternately, nationalism leads to jingoism and views the state as abstract from the local community and family structure rather than as an outgrowth of these local realities.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, the Southern Agrarians, John T. Flynn, Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Robert R. McCormick, Felix Morley, and Richard M. Weaver among others, {{articulated}} {{positions that}} have proved influential among contemporary paleoconservatives. Some paleocons enthusiastically embrace the decentralizing {{tenets of the}} Anti-Federalists, such as John Dickinson and George Mason. [...] Neoconservative critic David Brooks lists William Jennings Bryan, T. S. Eliot, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Cleanth Brooks, and Walker Percy as major paleo influences. [...] The German-born and Calvinist political philosopher Johannes Althusius and his tract Politica, with its core emphasis {{on the principle of}} <b>subsidiarity,</b> has proven influential as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} parliaments of EU member states have an [...] "early warning mechanism" [...] whereby if one third {{raise an objection}} – a [...] "yellow card" [...] – {{on the basis that}} the principle of <b>subsidiarity</b> has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so – an [...] "orange card" [...] – then the Council or Parliament can vote it down immediately. If the logistical problems of putting this into practice are overcome, then the power of the {{national parliaments}} could be decried as an extra legislature, without a common debate or physical location: dubbed by EU Observer a [...] "virtual third chamber".|$|E

Most [...] are subsidised by the community councils, with the fees depending on the income of the parents.|$|E
2500|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{expanded}} {{the role of}} Member States' parliaments in the legislative processes of the EU by giving them a prior scrutiny of legislative proposals before the Council and the Parliament can take a position. The Treaty of Lisbon provides for national parliaments [...] "to contribute to the good functioning of the Union" [...] through receiving draft EU legislation, seeing {{to it that the}} principle of <b>subsidiarity</b> is respected, taking part in the evaluation mechanisms for the implementation of the Union policies in the area of freedom, security and justice, being involved in the political monitoring of Europol and the evaluation of Eurojust's activities, being notified of applications for EU accession, taking part in the inter-parliamentary cooperation between national parliaments and with the European Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|In the Brussels {{declaration}} of 2000 the EFA codified its political principles. The EFA stands for [...] "a Europe of Free Peoples {{based on the}} principle of <b>subsidiarity,</b> which believe in solidarity with each other and the peoples of the world." [...] The EFA sees itself as an alliance of stateless peoples, striving towards recognition, autonomy, independence or wanting a proper voice in Europe. It supports European integration on basis of the subsidiarity-principle. It believes also that Europe should move away from further centralisation and works towards the formation of a [...] "Europe of regions". It believes that regions should have more power in Europe, for instance participating in the Council of the European Union, when matters within their competence are discussed. It also wants to protect the linguistic and cultural diversity within the EU.|$|E
2500|$|The social {{teachings of}} Pope Pius XII repeat these teachings, and apply them {{in greater detail}} not only to workers and owners of capital, but also to other professions such as politicians, educators, house-wives, farmers bookkeepers, {{international}} organizations, and all aspects of life including the military. Going beyond Pius XI, he also defined social teachings {{in the areas of}} medicine, psychology, sport, TV, science, law and education. Pius XII was called [...] "the Pope of Technology for his willingness and ability to examine the social implications of technological advances. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the space age {{at the end of his}} pontificate, Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites on the social fabric of humanity asking for a new sense of community and solidarity in light of existing papal teachings on <b>subsidiarity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, traditionalist {{conservatism}} found its defenders {{through the efforts}} of Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and other proponents of the socioeconomic system they advocated: distributism. Originating in the papal encyclical Rerum novarum, distributism employed the concept of <b>subsidiarity</b> as a [...] "third way" [...] solution to the twin evils of socialism and capitalism. It favors local economies, small business, the agrarian way of life and craftsmen and artists. In such books as Belloc's The Servile State (1912), Economics for Helen (1924) and An Essay on the Restoration of Property (1936) and Chesterton's The Outline of Sanity (1926), traditional communities that echoed those found in the Middle Ages were advocated and big business and big government condemned. In the United States, distributist ideas were embraced by the journalist Herbert Agar, Catholic activist Dorothy Day and through the influence of the German-born British economist E. F. Schumacher and were comparable to the work of Wilhelm Roepke.|$|E
5000|$|Since its {{founding}} by Hilaire Belloc and Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Distributism, {{a third way}} economic philosophy based on Catholic Social teaching, upholds the importance of <b>subsidiarity.</b> As Christian Democratic political parties were formed, they adopted the Catholic social teaching of <b>subsidiarity,</b> {{as well as the}} neo-Calvinist theological teaching of sphere sovereignty, with both Protestants and Roman Catholics agreeing [...] "that the principles of sphere sovereignty and <b>subsidiarity</b> boiled down to the same thing." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Subsidiarity</b> {{as social}} {{organization}} rule. <b>Subsidiarity</b> principle states that superior social institutions - {{such as the}} State or the European Union - should not take care of activities that lower social layers - such as individuals, families, clubs, companies, etc. - can manage efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Gregory Beabout {{suggests}} that <b>subsidiarity</b> draws upon a far older concept as well: the Roman military term subsidium. He writes that “the {{role of the}} ‘subsidium’ (literally, to sit behind) is to lend help and support in case of need.” Employing Beabout’s etymology, <b>subsidiarity</b> indicates that the higher social unit ought to “sit behind” the lower ones to lend help and support in case of need. Another etymological interpretation states that <b>subsidiarity</b> literally means “to ‘seat’ (‘sid’) a service down (‘sub’) {{as close to the}} need for that service as is feasible.” Either interpretation indicates a hermeneutic of <b>subsidiarity</b> in which the higher social body’s rights and responsibilities for action are predicated upon their assistance to and empowerment of the lower.|$|E
