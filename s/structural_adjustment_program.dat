5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Program</b> (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1970s, Sudan's {{agricultural}} output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and {{made plans to}} export food and cash crops. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose.

The crisis peaked in 1990 when the first measures of an IMF <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> were carried out. While the program was not fully implemented before the war, key measures such as two large devaluations and the removal of official prices were enacted. The consequences on salaries and purchasing power were rapid and dramatic. This crisis particularly affected the educated elite, most of whom were employed in civil service or state-owned enterprises.|$|E
500|$|Kirchner and Lavagna {{negotiated}} a swap of defaulted national debt in 2005, a write-down to {{one-third of the}} original debt. Kirchner refused a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>program,</b> and instead made a single payment to the IMF with Central Bank reserves. Although the economy grew at an eight-percent annual rate during Kirchner's term, much of its growth was due to favorable international conditions rather than Argentine policies. Argentina was benefited by the increase of the international price of soybean and other foods[...] However, some argued that this economic growth can also be attributed to Kirchners policies to increase domestic demand. [...] Foreign investment remained low because of the Argentine hostility towards the IMF, the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the re-nationalization of privatized companies (such as the water supply, managed by the French company Suez), diplomatic isolation and state interventionism. The energy sector suffered, and lack of investment reduced energy reserves during the 2000s.|$|E

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{policies}} are recommended and financially {{supported by the}} World Bank and the International Monetary Fund {{as part of an}} effort to solve the external account crisis prevailing in many developing countries, including some African countries. <b>Structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programs</b> include policy reforms implemented in various sectors and pursue, almost without exception, outward-oriented trade strategies. One aspect of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programs</b> is the potential for expanded product ion of agricultural tradables in SubSaharan Africa. Much of this expansion is expected to increase the volume of agricultural exports. Although the expanded production of importables, particularly food, could be significant, the situation in African countries deserves particular attention because their production is highly concentrated on a few export commodities. If most African countries promoted and expanded their exports at the same time, world prices would. decrease. Is there a risk that, at least in the short or medium term, the <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>programs</b> could worsen the economic situation in Sub-Saharan Africa?
