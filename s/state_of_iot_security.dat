40|$|Invited PaperInternational audienceThe Internet <b>of</b> Things (<b>IoT)</b> {{will enable}} objects to become active {{participants}} of everyday activities. Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes <b>IoT</b> <b>security</b> {{very difficult to}} address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions <b>of</b> these four <b>IoT</b> components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the <b>IoT.</b> The interaction <b>of</b> people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives {{for which they are}} designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, <b>IoT</b> <b>security</b> should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in <b>IoT</b> <b>security</b> and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision <b>of</b> <b>IoT</b> <b>security...</b>|$|R

In addition, IoT devices must operate in a dynamic environment in terms of communication interfaces and fast upgrade cycle (e. g., patching), which imposes severe requirements to designer and developers in terms of security. Privacy aspects are also relevant because of the large amount of data collected by <b>IoT</b> sensors. The <b>security</b> certification <b>of</b> <b>IoT</b> devices is an important element to support the development and deployment <b>of</b> <b>IoT</b> systems and trusted applications. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the <b>security</b> certification <b>of</b> <b>IoT</b> taking in consideration the current security certification frameworks and standards and the related limitations identified by the industry and research communities. This paper proposes a new approach for <b>security</b> certification in <b>IoT,</b> which addresses the identified limitations and links formal models to testing and certificationJRC.
