5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> astrology fell away, {{leaving only}} a popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the Belgian civilian population along their route of advance. These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against the German army. Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as The Rape of Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by the German army between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> the Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> the plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} fight for Warsaw {{became one of the}} icons of Polish culture, {{described}} by, among others, Polish romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. It was also the main inspiration behind Chopin's Revolutionary Étude, initially called the Étude on the Bombardment of Warsaw. The fall of Warsaw also garnered <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> the Poles and their quest for independence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} years {{following}} Anarky's creation, Grant rarely incorporated the character into Batman stories, being reserved for stories {{in which the}} author wished to make a philosophical point. Originally, Grant created Anarky as an anarchist with socialist and populist leanings. In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> anarchism.|$|E
5|$|Lance Reddick as Phillip Broyles (seasons 1–4; {{recurring}} season 5): a Homeland Security {{agent and}} Senior-Agent-in-Charge (SAC) who runs Fringe Division. Reddick also portrays Broyles' alternate (known as Colonel Broyles), who finds <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> Olivia and sacrifices himself {{during the third}} season {{to allow her to}} escape the parallel universe. In the fourth season, in the alternate timeline, Colonel Broyles remains alive.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E

5|$|The White Stripes' third album, White Blood Cells, was {{released}} on July 3, 2001 on <b>Sympathy</b> <b>for</b> the Record Industry. The band enjoyed its first significant success the following year with the major label re-release of the album on V2 Records. Its stripped-down garage rock sound drew critical acclaim in the UK, and in the US soon afterward, making The White Stripes {{one of the most}} acclaimed bands of 2002.|$|E
5|$|Tyndall also {{engaged in}} Holocaust denial, {{declaring that the}} Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> {{themselves}} and thus aid their plot for world domination. In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{refused to}} negotiate, gained {{the backing of}} Salibi, and the two {{defeated}} their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes were put to rest for several years (until 1774–75), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.|$|E

5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Finnish-German {{relations}} cooled {{after the}} National Socialists rose {{to power in}} 1933—Finns admired Imperial Germany, not the radical and anti-democratic Nazi regime. Finnish conservatives did not accept the state violence and anti-church policies of the Nazis. Still, there was <b>sympathy</b> <b>for</b> German aims to revise the Treaty of Versailles, although the official Finnish policy was reserved, especially after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finland even recalled its ambassador for a short period. Finnish Nazis and ultranationalist parties such as the IKL achieved only minor support in several elections, especially {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Mäntsälä rebellion in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Having {{established}} {{herself as}} a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in Robert Anderson's Tea and <b>Sympathy,</b> <b>for</b> which she received a Tony Award nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner John Kerr (no relation) in Vincente Minnelli's film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with Tea and Sympathy. In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Seascape.|$|E

50|$|To a Young Ass was {{composed}} by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1794. The poem describes Coleridge's <b>sympathies</b> <b>for</b> {{animals and the}} connection to nature he felt {{as part of his}} idea of Pantisocracy. It was later used as a means to mock him.|$|R
