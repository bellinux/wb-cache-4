5|$|Juvenile magpies begin {{foraging}} {{on their}} own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>old.</b> Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 163 pigs from nine farrow-to-finish herds {{representing}} {{various levels of}} atrophic rhinitis (AR) were selected for postslaughter examination of AR and pneumonia. Nasal swabs and lungs were cultured for detection of Bordetella bronchiseptica and Pasteurella multocida. Seventy-three pigs were examined at eight weeks of age and 90 contemporaries at <b>six</b> <b>months</b> of age. Mean AR scores were 1. 21 and 1. 11 for the eight week and <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> pigs, respectively (0 = normal, 3 = severe). In individual pigs increasing AR score was related to increasing pneumonia score in eight week old pigs but not in <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> hogs. In eight week old pigs, B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida were isolated more frequently from pigs with higher AR scores. From nasal swabs of <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> hogs, Bordetella was almost never recovered while Pasteurella was frequently isolated score. Toxigenic type DP. multocida was isolated from nasal cultures of only seven (4 %) pigs and from lung cultures of only one pig. Pasteurella was never isolated from lungs of the eight week old pigs and Bordetella never from the <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> hogs. The isolation rate of P. multocida, predominantly type A, from lungs of <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> pigs increased from 11 % in grossly normal lungs to 86 % in lungs with severe pneumonia. Pigs from one herd free from lesions of AR and pneumonia were also examined; type AP. multocida was isolated from nasal cultures of one of six eight week old pigs. Somatic antigens of P. multocida were determined for 94 nasal and 20 lung isolates. Somatic serovar 3 was found in 93 % of the nasal isolates and in all lung isolates.

5|$|The {{process of}} {{integrating}} is easiest with two rats of young age, generally less than <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>old.</b> The process of integrating is most difficult {{with two or}} more adult male rats, as adult males are {{the least likely to}} accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always keep them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.|$|E

His father was an alcoholic who relentlessly abused his family, including slashing Donald with belts and electrical cords. On one occasion, when Donald was only <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>old,</b> he picked him up and hurled him through a window. Nicole, afraid that Johnny might kill her, left the family and returned to Canada. Later, {{she came back to}} take the children, but left Donald to live with his father for another four years, until Donald's paternal grandmother sent him to Canada. Donald's mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and wanted to avoid having another mixed-race child in the house.|$|E

Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer.

5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>old</b> at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E

40|$|These studies {{examined}} the effects of corticosterone on the reproductive system, investigated the relationship between plasma and faecal corticosterone levels and defined corticosterones response to handling in the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Six days of daily corticosterone injections decreased the area of the cloacal protuberance in both seven week <b>old</b> and <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> male quail. However, plasma testosterone levels 24 hours after an injection were only decreased in the <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> birds. There was a strong correlation between basal plasma and faecal corticosterone concentrations in the <b>six</b> <b>month</b> <b>old</b> birds. The effects of corticosterone during the 24 hours after an injection were then examined before and after six days of corticosterone injections in male quail. Corticosterone injections decreased plasma testosterone levels three-fold for 6 - 12 hours both after a single corticosterone injection and after six days of treatment. However, there were no changes in plasma luteinising hormone levels during the 24 hours after an injection. This result is consistent with corticosterone acting directly on the testes to decrease testosterone release. The rate of corticosterone removal from the blood after an injection increased after six days of corticosterone injections. Handling female Japanese quail for 15 minutes resulted in increased plasma corticosterone levels for less than 30 minutes. Mean corticosterone response curves were almost identical when the same birds were handled on three occasions. Although corticosterone response curves were similar during the early afternoon and during the night, basal corticosterone levels and the area under the corticosterone response curves were lower at night. Plasma corticosterone levels 0 and 15 minutes after the initiation of handling were more than twice as high in birds with large gonads than birds with small gonads. This study provides the first information in birds of a decrease in plasma testosterone levels within three hours of a corticosterone injection, independent of changes in plasma LH levels. It is also the first study in a domestic species to show larger corticosterone responses in female birds with large gonads than in birds with small gonads...|$|R
