25|$|The first {{recognized}} {{specimens of}} Philcoxia (P. bahiensis) {{were collected by}} local resident Wilson Ganev in August 1992 from the Serra do Atalho in the municipality of Piatã of Bahia.

Material of this specimen had been sent to Vinícius Souza, who was working on the Scrophulariaceae of Brazil. Souza recognized the material as congeneric with a plant collected in 1981 from the Serra do Cabral of the Brazilian state Minas Gerais.

25|$|The {{museum has}} also {{carried out a}} number of {{excavations}} in Beirut Central District under the directorship of Leila Badre. These have included the ancient tell of Beirut, site BEY 003. The purpose of this excavation was to discover the “Biruta” of the Amarna Letters. Evidence was found of a fortification system that was constructed in the second millennium BC up to the Hellenistic period, along with the remains of a building dating back into the third millennium BC and a hoard of Egyptian objects. Another site the museum has been involved with is BEY 012, Saint Georges Cathedral of the Greek Orthodox, where excavations were carried out in 2001. Eight layers showed occupation from the Hellenistic period onwards and the remains of five, possibly six, successive churches. Another site investigated was BEY 215, the An-Nahar building, revealing six levels of occupation dating from the Persian to Byzantine eras, showing continuous inhabitation since the 4th century BC. Tell Kazel in Syria has also been excavated and studied by Leila Badre since 1985. Likely the ancient Simyra, levels from the Mameluk Period to the Bronze Age were discovered. Finds included a temple and rooms with sea shell-paved floors. Visitors to the museum can view relics such as cylinder seals, necklaces, pottery and temple offerings organized according to their <b>site</b> <b>location.</b> The museum has also embarked on the restoration of the wall paintings of Mar Sarkis and Bakhos in Kaftoun with the University of Warsaw.|$|E

A new trial began in January 2013 after Mr Jones rejected 2 plea offers of 15 to 22 years with credit for time served. In March 2013, a mistrial was declared with the jury evenly split.

2500|$|However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court {{struck down}} even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still {{not engage in}} {{meaningful}} judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, [...] "extreme and overly broad," [...] affirming that [...] "courts consistent with the First Amendment, simple accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk." [...] He {{also found that the}} FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill [...] "implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people." [...] Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action, but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed {{for the first time the}} extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of a NSL, it can obtain cell <b>site</b> <b>location</b> information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information.|$|E
