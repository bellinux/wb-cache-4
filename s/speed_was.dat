5|$|He was {{described}} by sportswriters of the time {{as one of the}} fastest pitchers in the league, comparable to Amos Rusie and Ted Breitenstein. Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> as fast as Rusie, and could have extended his career much longer had he taken better care of his body. Baseball writer O. P. Caylor wrote that Stivetts' issues were entirely his own, blaming his hard-drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain in good condition.|$|E
5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was much improved. The climb rate was higher and the machine could reach a slightly higher ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) the maximum <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E

5|$|Still unfinished, {{the vehicle}} was entered in an SPL {{competition}} in 1997 {{at which a}} complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor. Instead of using the controller, two leads were touched together {{in the hope that}} the motor <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> set correctly. The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162dB. The Concept Design 60-inch was not shown in public after 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} single tracked between Appledore and Ore on 1 October 1979, leaving a passing loop at Rye. At Winchelsea, the down {{platform}} was removed; trains {{in both directions}} now stop on the former up platform. Line <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> reduced from 85mph to 60mph, but there are additional long term speed restrictions in place, including 40mph between Doleham and Ore and 20mph across a half barrier level crossing at Winchelsea.|$|E
5|$|The reduced length while {{retaining}} the same beam as the prior Connecticut class {{resulted in a}} disadvantageous length-to-beam ratio, causing reduced performance relative to that class. Not only was their top speed a knot slower, but also their economical <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> reduced by one and half knots. They also had 25% less coal storage, further reducing their operating range.|$|E

5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the faults lay in Siemen's 1992 take-over of MaK, in which {{a large number of}} veteran employees, who had the necessary competence to build diesel-locomotives, were retired. In 1998, Siemens sold the Kiel facilities to Vossloh. Following the return to Germany, the locomotives were modified to meet German standards and designed ME26. They were made narrower by removing outside stairs and railings, and moving lights to meet International Union of Railways standards. There were also changes to the cab walls, with internal railings added and the toilets removed. The <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> also reduced to , although this has later been reverted. Number 664 was rebuilt in Kiel, but {{because of the lack of}} capacity at MaK, the remaining units were rebuilt by DSB in Copenhagen. After the upgrades, ownership was transferred to Dispolok, a leasing pool originally owned by Siemens.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> {{the same as that}} of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E

Takuma Sato, once again out-qualified the two Honda cars, just missing out on the top ten, in front of Vitantonio Liuzzi. He made it through to the second session of qualifying by 94 hundredths of a second, where he qualified in 14th. Scott <b>Speed</b> <b>was</b> the slowest car in the second session of qualifying putting him in 16th position.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it harder to learn how to play the game. The in-game <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic {{to take over the}} American market. Sonic's default <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team then noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, the game was slowed down.|$|E
5|$|During her career, Haruna {{underwent}} {{two major}} reconstructions.

In 1933, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, her <b>speed</b> <b>was</b> increased, and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now fast enough to accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, Haruna was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Haruna transported Imperial Japanese Army troops to mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941.
