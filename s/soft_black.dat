25|$|Abraham Gottlob Werner {{coined the}} name {{graphite}} ("writing stone") in 1789. He attempted {{to clear up}} the confusion between molybdena, plumbago and black lead after Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1778 proved that {{there are at least}} three different minerals. Scheele's analysis showed that the chemical compounds molybdenum sulfide (molybdenite), lead(II) sulfide (galena) and graphite were three different <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> minerals.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for {{the landing}} force, the {{planners}} at Pearl Harbor had completely misjudged {{the situation that}} would face Gen. Schmidt's Marines. The beaches had been described as [...] "excellent" [...] and the thrust inland {{was expected to be}} [...] "easy." [...] In reality, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> volcanic ash. This ash allowed for neither a secure footing nor the construction of foxholes to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the fragments from Japanese artillery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{production}} proved to be unsustainable. Development work of new reserves could not {{keep pace with the}} production of 6,000 tons of crude ore per month. In January 1943 production had to be scaled down, and the ore dressing mill reduced to a single shift per day. But a bigger blow was to follow. In May 1943, as one of the shafts was being deepened, the miners encountered bands of <b>soft,</b> <b>black</b> shale. The Ministry sent in a team of Canadian Engineers with diamond drilling equipment, and this confirmed that the Skiddaw Group of rocks lay at about [...] below the main entrance to the mine (The Lucy Level), not at [...] as the geologists had predicted. The rich bonanza of ore the company had expected was not there.|$|E

5000|$|Ben Yusuf {{never had}} {{his left eye}} scarred. His {{appearance}} in reality was [...] "Brown color, middle height, thin, little beard, <b>soft</b> voice, <b>black</b> eyes, straight nose, lock of Muhammad falling {{on the top of}} his ear, eyebrow joined, wooly hair".|$|R

50|$|Butternut wood {{is light}} in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much <b>softer</b> than <b>black</b> walnut wood. Oiled, {{the grain of}} the wood usually shows much light. It is often used to make furniture, and is a {{favorite}} of woodcarvers.|$|R

"Then I {{produced}} some Nocturnes {{in imitation of}} Mr Whistler, with mushrooms, truffles, grilled meat, pickled walnuts, black pudding, French plums, porter--a dinner in <b>soft</b> velvety <b>black,</b> eaten in a starlight of small scattered candles. That, too, led to a resignation: Art will ever demand its martyrs." ...|$|R

60|$|Without {{changing}} his bland expression, Senor Perkins apparently allowed his <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> eyes to rest, as if fondly, on the angry pupils of the Peruvian. The {{eyes of the}} latter presently sought the ground.|$|E
60|$|Senor Perkins' <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> eyes {{fell for}} an instant, as if accidentally, {{on the third}} mate, but the next moment he laughed, and, {{throwing}} back his head, inhaled, with evident relish, a long breath of the sharp, salt air.|$|E

60|$|The {{females were}} more symmetrically {{proportioned}} than the males, their features {{were much more}} perfect, the shapes of their heads and their large, <b>soft,</b> <b>black</b> eyes denoting far greater intelligence and humanity than was possessed by their lords and masters.|$|E

5000|$|Silsbee {{could draw}} with amazing ease. He drew with <b>soft,</b> deep <b>black</b> lead-pencil strokes {{and he would}} make {{remarkable}} free-hand sketches of that type of dwelling peculiarly his own at the time. His superior talent in design had made him respected in Chicago. His work was a picturesque combination of gable turret and hip with broad porches quietly domestic and gracefully picturesque. A contrast to the awkward stupidities and brutalities of the period elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|One day as they paddled {{across a}} mile-long pool, they saw three bears prowling {{in single file}} {{high up on the}} hillside. [...] "Look," [...] said the man, and pointed with his paddle at the big, <b>soft,</b> furry <b>black</b> shapes, {{magnified}} and startling in the clear air. All the canoes rippled to a stop, the men, at first still, whispered softly. One passed a gun to Trafford, who hesitated and looked at Marjorie.|$|R
60|$|Mazzini Dunn enters {{from the}} hall. He {{is a little}} elderly man with bulging credulous eyes and earnest manners. He {{is dressed in a}} blue serge jacket suit with an unbuttoned mackintosh over it, and carries a <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> hat of {{clerical}} cut.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly his eye {{caught a}} dark figure {{emerging}} from the Avenue gates and striding up the winding road. A few minutes brought him near enough to show a familiar face looking over the stiff collar and from under the <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> hat of an English clergyman.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must go to}} {{bed early}} tonight,' she said, turning aside her face, ruffling his <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> hair. He {{stretched}} slightly, stiffening his arms, and smiled without answering. It was a very keen pleasure to be thus alone with her and in her charge. He rose, bidding her wrap herself up against the fog.|$|E
50|$|The posse swells in number. Believing that James Carrier held {{information}} about the escaped convict, they seek him out. After making an unsuccessful attempt to intervene on James' behalf, Wright reluctantly allows Sheriff Walker take Carrier into custody because the officer said he only wanted to question him. When Carrier says he doesn't have any information, he is immediately shot {{by one of the}} mob. Wright gets upset and the mob accuses him of being <b>soft</b> on <b>blacks.</b>|$|R
60|$|Only two {{came up to}} her; {{those she}} called Night and Black Star. Venters never looked at them without delight. The first was <b>soft</b> dead <b>black,</b> the other {{glittering}} black, and they were perfectly matched in size, both being high and long-bodied, wide through the shoulders, with lithe, powerful legs. That they were a woman's pets showed in the gloss of skin, the fineness of mane. It showed, too, {{in the light of}} big eyes and the gentle reach of eagerness.|$|R
50|$|The olive-shaped yellow fruits are wood shelled, about 1 inch in diameter, {{and look}} like small loquats. They can be easily crushed when chewed. The fruit {{contains}} two cells with small flat seeds surrounded by sweet, <b>black,</b> <b>soft</b> pulp that tastes like blackberry jam.|$|R

60|$|Soon {{he came to}} a cool spot {{under the}} alders, which was {{probably}} what he was looking for. A small brook made an eddy there, and a lot of driftweed had collected over a bed of <b>soft</b> <b>black</b> mud. The stump of a huge cedar leaned out over it, some four or five feet above the water.|$|E
50|$|Compressed {{charcoal}} (also {{referred as}} charcoal sticks) is shaped into {{a block or}} a stick. Intensity of the shade is determined by hardness.

40|$|Abstract. The {{black hole}} {{candidate}} LMC X- 3 varies {{by a factor}} of four in the soft X-rays on a timescale of 200 or 100 days (Cowley et al., 1991). We have monitored LMC X- 3 with RXTE in three to four week intervals starting in December 1996, obtaining a large observational database that sheds light {{on the nature of the}} long term X-ray variability in this source. In this paper we present the results of this monitoring campaign, focusing on evidence of recurring hard states in this canonical <b>soft</b> state <b>black</b> hole candidate...|$|R
