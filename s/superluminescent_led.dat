50|$|LS in {{this case}} stands for LASER-servo, which uses a very {{low-power}} <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LED</b> that generates light with a small focal spot. This allows the drive to align its rotation to precisely the same point each time, allowing far more data to be written due {{to the absence of}} conventional magnetic alignment marks. The alignment is based on hard-coded optical alignment marks, which meant that a complete format can safely be done. This worked very well at the time and as a result failures associated with magnetic fields wiping the Zip drive alignment Z tracks were less of a problem.|$|E
40|$|A blue <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LED</b> (SLED) {{with power}} above 100 mW was fabricated. These SLED shows promise for focus-free {{pico-projection}} due to reduced interference and improved image quality. We compared different straight and curved waveguide designs {{with and without}} tilted facets. Internal and mirror losses were determined by the Hakki-Paoli method...|$|E
40|$|Microscopic {{interferometry}} is {{a powerful}} technique for the static and dynamic characterization of micromechanical devices. In this paper we emphasize its capabilities for 3 D vibration mode shapes profiling of Al cantilever microbeams and Cr micromachined membranes. It is demonstrated that time-resolved measurements up to 800 kHz can be performed with a lateral resolution in the micrometer range and a detection limit of 3 - 5 nm. In addition, with reduced image sizes (256 x 256), quasi real time (150 - 500 ms) visualisation of the vibration mode 3 D profiles becomes possible. These performances were obtained by using stroboscopic illumination {{with an array of}} <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LED</b> and an optimised automatic Fast Fourier Transform phase demodulation of the interferograms. The results are compared with theoretical shapes of the vibration modes and with point measurements of the vibration spectra...|$|E
50|$|In 1986 Dr. Gerard A. Alphonse at RCA Laboratories (now SRI International), {{invented the}} superluminescent diode. This light source was {{developed}} as a key component in the next generations of fibre optic gyroscopes, low coherence tomography for medical imaging, and external cavity tunable lasers with applications to fiber-optic communications. In 1989 the technology was transferred to GE-RCA in Canada, which became a division of EG&G. Superluminescent light emitting diodes are also called sometimes superluminescent diodes, superluminescence diodes or <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LEDs.</b>|$|R
40|$|For an {{employment}} of laser diodes as <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LEDs</b> (SLDs) or amplifiers, the {{facets of the}} diodes must be coated with antireflection films. In the work reported, scandium oxide was evaporated from an e-beam source onto Supersil II fused silica substrates. The obtained samples were used for measurements of absorption and reflectivity. Results of index measurements on e-beam evaporated films are presented. It is shown that excellent coatings with reflectivities of 0. 00025 can be obtained using these films. Attention {{is given to the}} refractive indices for scandium oxide films as a function of wavelength, the power output vs current for laser before coating and after coating with Sc 2 O 3...|$|R
50|$|IBBCEAS {{has been}} used in {{conjunction}} with <b>LEDs</b> and <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LEDs</b> in a number of gas phase and liquid analyte studies. Simultaneous concentration measurements of NO2 and NO3 have been achieved using LED based IBBCEAS within the ppbv detection limit. The advantages of using LEDs as light source are their compactness, long life, power efficiency and price. Also, due to the small area emission, the emitted power per unit area at the peak wavelength can approach that of Xe arc lamps. However, the LED output is often temperature dependent; hence they require temperature stabilization for IBBCEAS applications. More recently, LED-IBBCEAS has been applied to simultaneous open path measurements of HONO and NO2 in the UV region with detection limits of 430 pptv and 1 ppbv respectively and acquisition times in the order of a few seconds.|$|R
40|$|III-Nitride based {{materials}} have gained prominence for various applications, {{especially in the}} field of optoelectronics research for their many attractive properties like a direct and wide band-gap. Further spintronics has been a key component of the research roadmap in recent times along with nanostructured semiconductors for possible performance enhancements. Therefore, we have used the III-Nitride based semiconductor for preparing the Cr-doped dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS) and subsequently the spin-LED to verify spin injection till 200 K with the DMS. We could make a <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LED</b> with a InGaN-based nanowire device as well as a room temperature nano-laser by incorporating external reflecting elements, wherein the nanowires were prepared by a novel method. In future, work in the direction of studying the transient electron and spin dynamics in the 1 -D nanostructures and integrating the DMS to inject spin polarized carriers into the nanowire laser would be interesting and fruitful with many practical applications.

40|$|Stripe contact (edgeemitting) LEDs {{have been}} found to be {{suitable}} for many applications in present day optical/photonics devices and systems. Polarised light (i. e., light with dominantly a single polarisation direction) is required for various applications. Semiconductor LASERs generate polarized light but such sources may not be suitable due to other reasons such as the ‘speckle’ effect that occurs due to the highly coherent LASER light; also, if the source is to be part of a monolithically integrated optical circuit it will be expensive to produce the two reflective planes needed for the LASER to operate. Unlike semiconductor Lasers, however, stripecontact TM ASE, and yet be easy to fabricate. Rays and Rate Equations analysis is used to model the device. A computationally efficient model for stripe contact semiconductor optical devices is designed and used to obtain design guidelines for the “V”geometry device, which is taking benefits and advantages to design a polarisationselective eeLED device. Simulation results from the model are shown. edgeemitting LEDs in bulk active layer semiconductor material tend to produce nearly unpolarised light. LED sources but with polarised output are attractive for various applications such as in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The objective of this project is to design a simple, inexpensive device structure to achieve polarisation enhanced output by using stripecontact edgeemitting LEDs in bulk active layer semiconductor material, with multilayer, DoubleHeterostructure (DH), as commonly used for semiconductor Lasers and LEDs. As is well known light in the material is primarily generated by spontaneous emission. If the material is ‘pumped’ sufficiently then there will be net stimulated emission which corresponds to having optical gain; in that case the spontaneously emitted light will experience optical emission as it progresses through the material resulting in Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE). In this condition of operation the eeLED is often referred to as the <b>Superluminescent</b> <b>LED</b> (SLED). It is also well known that in bulk active layer semiconductors spontaneous emission occurs uniformly in all polarisations and that the material gain is also polarisation independent. Hence the generated ASE is equally distributed in TE & TM polarisations. The challenge, therefore, is to find a scheme which that would generate dominantly TE or dominantl...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} novel semiconductor {{sources for}} optical low coherence reflectometry (OLCR), a measurement technique for characterizing device and fiber reflections with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution. Lasers and conventional <b>superluminescent</b> <b>LEDs</b> are {{not suitable for}} OLCR because strong reflections from the back facets mask weak reflection signals from the device or fiber under test. Even standard edge emitting LEDs (EELEDs) show significant reflections, which have limited the dynamic range of previous measurements. Low source output powers have also limited sensitivity. In order to obtain high power while minimizing internal reflections, a high single pass gain device is required. The record combination of high power and low internal reflections of the InGaAsP EELEDs reported here significantly expands the dynamic range and sensitivity of LED based reflectometry at 1. 5 μm. This work also compares the characteristics of quantum well and bulk EELEDs...|$|R
50|$|Light sources used in {{photonics}} {{are usually}} far {{more sophisticated than}} light bulbs. Photonics commonly uses semiconductor light sources like light-emitting diodes (<b>LEDs),</b> <b>superluminescent</b> diodes, and lasers. Other light sources include single photon sources, fluorescent lamps, cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and plasma screens. Note that while CRTs, plasma screens, and organic light-emitting diode displays generate their own light, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) like TFT screens require a backlight of either cold cathode fluorescent lamps or, more often today, LEDs.|$|R
40|$|Many imaging {{applications}} require increasingly bright illumination sources, motivating {{the replacement}} of conventional thermal light sources with light emitting diodes (<b>LEDs),</b> <b>superluminescent</b> diodes (SLDs) and lasers. Despite their brightness, lasers and SLDs are poorly suited for full-field imaging applications because their high spatial coherence leads to coherent artifacts known as speckle that corrupt image formation. We recently demonstrated that random lasers can be engineered to provide low spatial coherence. Here, we exploit the low spatial coherence of specifically-designed random lasers to perform speckle-free full-field imaging {{in the setting of}} significant optical scattering. We quantitatively demonstrate that images generated with random laser illumination exhibit higher resolution than images generated with spatially coherent illumination. By providing intense laser illumination without the drawback of coherent artifacts, random lasers are well suited for a host of full-field imaging applications from full-field microscopy to digital light projector systems.
