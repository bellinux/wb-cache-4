We discuss the matching of WH prototype signals to important nonstationary environments. The <b>statistical</b> <b>window</b> opti-mization for the STFT/Gabor expansion of nonstationary processes is shown to be formally equivalent to optimal sig-nal design for narrowband WSSUS channels. For the case of underspread channels/processes we derive approximate solutions to the optimization problem. ...|$|E

We assert that with present-day data sets, the slope of the matter power spectrum is a much stronger indicator of a theory's validity.

40|$|A motion texture is the {{instantaneous}} scalar map {{of apparent}} motion values extracted from a dynamic or temporal texture. It is mostly displayed by natural scene elements (fire, smoke, water) but also involves more general textured motion patterns (eg. {{a crowd of}} people, a flock). In this work {{we are interested in}} the modeling and tracking of motion textures. Experimentally we observe that such motion maps exhibit values of a mixed type: a discrete component at zero and a continuous component of non-null motion values. Thus, we propose a statistical characterization of motion textures based on a mixed-state causal modeling. Next, the problem of tracking is considered. A set of mixed-state model parameters is learned as a descriptive feature of the motion texture to track and displacement estimation is solved using the conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence for <b>statistical</b> <b>window</b> matching.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} whether principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to process latitude-time ionospheric TEC data on a monthly basis to identify earthquake associated TEC anomalies. PCA is applied to latitude-time (mean-of-a-month) ionospheric total electron content (TEC) records collected from the Japan GEONET network to detect TEC anomalies associated with 18 earthquakes in Japan (M≥ 6. 0) from 2000 to 2005. According to the results, PCA was able to discriminate clear TEC anomalies in the months when all 18 earthquakes occurred. After reviewing months when no M≥ 6. 0 earthquakes occurred but geomagnetic storm activity was present, it is possible that the maximal principal eigenvalues PCA returned for these 18 earthquakes indicate earthquake associated TEC anomalies. Previously PCA has been used to discriminate earthquake-associated TEC anomalies recognized by other researchers, who found that statistical association between large earthquakes and TEC anomalies could be established in the 5 days before earthquake nucleation; however, since PCA uses the characteristics of principal eigenvalues to determine earthquake related TEC anomalies, it is possible to show that such anomalies existed earlier than this 5 -day <b>statistical</b> <b>window...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} {{process in}} grinding involves rubbing, ploughing and cutting.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have applied}} {{two-dimensional}} infrared (2 D IR) and βν correlation spectroscopy to in-situ IR spectroscopy of pulmonary surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C in lipid–protein monolayers at the air—water interface. For both SP-B and SP-C, a <b>statistical</b> <b>windowed</b> autocorrelation method identified two separate surface pressure regions that contained maximum amide I intensity changes: 4 – 25 mN/m and 25 – 40 mN/m. For SP-C, 2 D IR and βν correlation analyses of these regions indicated that SP-C adopts {{a variety of}} secondary structure conformations, including α-helix, β-sheet, and an intermolecular aggregation of extended β-sheet structure. The main α-helix band split into two peaks at high surface pressures, indicative of two different helix conformations. At low surface pressures, all conformations of the SP-C molecule reacted identically to increasing surface pressure and reoriented in phase with each other. Above 25 mN/m, however, the increasing surface pressure selectively affected the coexisting protein conformations, leading to an independent reorientation of the protein conformations. The asynchronous 2 D IR spectrum of SP-B showed the presence of two α-helix components, consistent with two separate populations of α-helix in SP-B—a hydrophobic fraction associated with the lipid chains and a hydrophilic fraction parallel to the membrane surface. The distribution of correlation intensity between the two α-helix cross peaks indicated that the more hydrophobic helix fraction predominates at low surface pressures whereas the more hydrophilic helix fraction predominates at high surface pressures. The different SP-B secondary structures reacted identically to increasing surface pressure, leading to a reorientation of all SP-B subunits in phase with one another...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to quantify the drilling and recompletion potential in producing gas fields, due to large variability in rock quality, well spacing, well completion practices, and the large number of wells involved. Given the marginal nature of many of these fields, it is often prohibitively expensive to conduct conventional reservoir characterization and simulation studies to determine infill potential. There is a need for rapid, cost-efficient technology to evaluate infill potential in gas reservoirs, particularly tight gas reservoirs. Some authors have used moving <b>window</b> <b>statistical</b> methods, which are useful screening tools for identifying potential areas or groups of wells for further study. But the accuracy of the moving window method in very heterogeneous reservoirs is limited, based on the analysis of some authors. This study presents a new simulation-based inversion approach for rapid assessment of infill well potential. It differs from typical simulation inversion applications in that, instead of focusing on small-scale, high-resolution problems, it focuses on large-scale, coarse-resolution studies consisting of hundreds or, potentially thousands, of wells. In an initial application, the method employs well locations, production data, an approximate reservoir description and, accordingly, is able to identify potential areas or groups of wells for infill development quickly and inexpensively. Prediction accuracy can be increased commensurate with reservoir characterization effort, time and costs. Thus, the method provides a consistent basis for transition from screening studies to conventional reservoir studies. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be more accurate than moving <b>window</b> <b>statistical</b> methods in synthetic cases, with comparable analysis times and costs. In a bind validation study of a field case with 40 years of production history, the method was able to accurately predict performance for a group of 19 infill wells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The power-saving {{class of}} type I (PSC I), {{which is one}} of the sleep-mode {{operations}} specified in the IEEE 802. 16 e standard, is designed to reduce power consumption for nonreal-time traffic. However, the inefficiency of the PSC I comes from the configuration of its operation and the utilized mechanism of binary-exponential traffic detection. Based on the concepts of IEEE 802. 16 m sleep-mode operation, a <b>statistical</b> sleep <b>window</b> control (SSWC) approach is proposed to improve the energy effi-ciency of a mobile station (MS) with nonreal-time downlink traffic in this paper. The SSWC approach constructs a discrete-time Markov-modulated Poisson process (dMMPP) for representing the states of nonreal-time traffic. Furthermore, a partially observ-able Markov decision process (POMDP) is exploited within the SSWC approach to conjecture the present traffic state. Based on the estimated traffic state and the considerations of tolerable delay and/or queue size, two suboptimal policies, including the sleep ratio-based (SR) and energy cost-based (EC) policies, are proposed within the SSWC approach. The efficiency of the proposed SSWC approach is evaluated and compared via simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed SSWC approach outperforms the conventional IEEE 802. 16 e PSC I and the evolutional PSC I of the IEEE 802. 16 m system in terms of both energy conservation and packet delay.
