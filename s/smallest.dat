5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the <b>smallest</b> such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its <b>smallest</b> feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
