40|$|Primary ciliary {{dyskinesia}} is {{a genetic}} disease of ciliary function leading to chronic {{upper and lower}} respiratory tract symptoms. The diagnosis is frequently overlooked because the symptoms are nonspecific and the knowledge about the disease in the primary care setting is poor. Additionally, none of the available tests is accurate enough {{to be used in}} isolation. These tests are expensive, and need sophisticated equipment and expertise to analyse and interpret results; diagnosis is therefore only available at highly <b>specialised</b> <b>centres.</b> The diagnosis is particularly challenging in countries with limited resources {{due to the lack of}} such costly equipment and expertise. In this review, we discuss the importance of early and accurate diagnosis especially for countries where the disease is clinically prevalent but diagnostic tests are lacking. We review the diagnostic tests available in <b>specialised</b> <b>centres</b> (nasal nitric oxide, high-speed video microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and genetics). We then consider modifications that might be considered in less well-resourced countries whilst maintaining acceptable accuracy...|$|R

Significantly, if such answers are provided early, this may result in cost-saving and rational drug development.|$|R

This surprisingly high rate {{of conversion}} is probably more representative of the reality, without the bias of a <b>specialised</b> <b>centre.</b> However, it may be influenced by the higher prevalence of obesity among women in the USA compared with Europe [50] and the need for comprehensive surgical staging (including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy) to meet the study protocol [32].|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) is {{a severe}} complication of sarcoidosis, with an unknown prevalence. The aetiology is multifactorial, and the exact mechanism of PH {{in the individual}} patient {{is often difficult to}} establish. The diagnostic work-up and treatment of PH in sarcoidosis is complex, and should therefore be determined by a multidisciplinary expert team in a <b>specialised</b> <b>centre.</b> It is still a major challenge to identify sarcoidosis patients at risk for developing PH. There is no validated algorithm when to refer a patient suspected for PH, and PH analysis itself is difficult. Until present, there is no established therapy for PH in sarcoidosis. Besides optimal treatment for sarcoidosis, case series evaluating new therapeutic options involving PH-targeted therapy are arising for a subgroup of patients. This review summarises the current knowledge regarding the aetiology, diagnosis and possible treatment options for PH in sarcoidosis...|$|E

40|$|Hereditary diffuse gastric cancers are rare, {{accounting}} for at most 1 - 3 % of gastric cancers. It {{can be caused}} by a mutation in the tumour-suppressor gene CDH 1. A healthy person carrying a CDH 1 mutation has a cumulative risk of developing gastric cancer of 70 - 80 %. In most cases, gastric cancer is detected before the age of 40 years. The effectiveness of screening for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer or early detection with twice-yearly upper GI endoscopy with blind biopsies is highly questionable. Given the poor prognosis of patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, prophylactic gastrectomy can be considered an option for patients with a CDH 1 mutation. It is recommended that the supervision, screening and possible preventative gastrectomy for hereditary diffuse gastric cancers are handled by a multidisciplinary team in a <b>specialised</b> <b>centre...</b>|$|E
