He {{referred}} to the forming of groups within a city or a rural area in the manner of hermitage life, among members who do not desire to become renunciants, or cannot do so because of certain obligations. Such a life would enable each one to be in daily association with those who share the same spiritual goal.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on the promenade, {{in order}} to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since {{received a letter from}} the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

[...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E

[...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E

In a season disrupted by injuries, Mendes only played in one more match for Braga, against his old club Vitória Guimarães.

He made two more appearances that season as the club finished 12th in the table. Having fractured his foot in July 2003, he was used sparingly during the 2003–04 season by manager Manuel Machado. He made four league appearances in an injury-plagued season, as the club finished 9th in the Primeira Liga. Mendes dropped down a division in June 2004 after signing a one-year contract with Santa Clara. [...] "This project is attractive," [...] he said. [...] "The coach, Jose Morais, <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and showed willingness in {{me to go to}} the Azores and that's important.

[...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences.
