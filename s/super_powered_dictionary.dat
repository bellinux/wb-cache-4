50|$|In 1984, Super Friends revamped its format (first as Super Friends: The Legendary <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> Show {{and then}} as The <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> Team: Galactic Guardians) {{to serve as a}} tie-in to Kenner's <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> Collection.|$|R
50|$|DC Universe Classics takes {{much of its}} {{inspiration}} from Kenner's <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> toyline from the 1980s, from character choices to their general design. All of the characters {{who were in the}} <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line have appeared in DC Universe Classics and DC Superheroes, although four of them (Kalibak, the Penguin, Orion, and Mr. Freeze) are very different from how they looked in <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> (though Freeze would be re-released later with his <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> color scheme, and Penguin will be re-released in a more Super Powers-accurate version). Some characters who were redesigned for the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line (Parademon, Mantis, and Steppenwolf) were released in two versions—a comic-accurate version and a <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> version. Even the characters Cyclotron and Golden Pharaoh - created specifically for the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line—were released in DC Universe Classics. Further, figures that were going to be produced later in the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line were created as part of DC Universe Classics (including characters from Super Friends like El Dorado and the Wonder Twins).|$|R

50|$|Mattel's DC Universe Classics line also draws {{inspiration}} from the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> figures. Several figures that were redesigned for the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line (Mantis, Parademon, Steppenwolf, and Mister Freeze) were produced for DC Universe Classics in both comic-accurate and Super Powers-accurate versions. In addition, figures for Cyclotron and Golden Pharaoh were released as part of DC Universe Classics, even though both characters only appeared {{as part of the}} <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> line. The Penguin released in the first wave is set to be re-released with a new head sculpt and repaint matching the <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> figure. In total, every figure produced for <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> has also been produced for DC Universe Classics and associate lines and much of the figures set to be produced for <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> prior to the line's cancellation has also been produced for DC Universe Classics (save Mr. Mxyzptlk, Shockwave, Black Racer, Atomic Knight, and original <b>Super</b> <b>Powers</b> characters).|$|R
