However, the charging of these vehicles is often shiftable {{in time to}} off-peak hours due to long parking times at a fixed location during the night. This implies that these vehicles offer great potential for use in demand side management. For scalability reasons, demand side management methodologies often apply <b>steering</b> <b>signals</b> to control appliances. These <b>steering</b> <b>signals</b> are used locally to generate a schedule for these appliances. In this paper we consider the problem of generating an optimal schedule for electrical vehicles based upon two types of steering signals; time-varying prices and a target profile. The local objective, to be minimized at the appliance side, is a weighted sum of the consumption cost implied by the prices and the squared deviation from the target profile. We show that, using {{the structure of the}} problem, an efficient algorithm of time complexity O(n n) can be derived to solve the minimization problem to optimality. We implemented the algorithm in Matlab and tested it against a traditional convex optimization solver to verify its validity and efficiency. The resulting algorithm outperformed the convex solver by roughly four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the very low computational time of the algorithm implies that it is suitable for being implemented on a low-cost local controller within a household or EV charging station...|$|R

Two tilting systems are available; Direct and Steering Tilt Control, the combined action of these two systems being certainly the key to improve considerably NTV dynamic performances.

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that the Steer-by-Wire (SBW) technology has been applied in the flight area, and it could be used in motor vehicles in the near future. The vehicle SBW system has been recently proposed to replace the traditional vehicle steering system by moving the mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and the front wheel. It has many advantages, including providing vehicle design freedom and improving vehicle handling. Two of the most challenging problems faced by the vehicle SBW system are 1) how to establish the effective force feedback between driver and the wheel so that the driver’s <b>steering</b> <b>signal</b> can be accurately followed by the wheels so the road condition can be felt by the driver, and 2) how to design and choose the available hardware so that a reliable transmission with high speed can guarantee the reliability and stability of the SBW system. It is therefore necessary to develop advanced SBW control systems and to design advanced architectures for the SBW system. In this thesis, a new SBW control system with the consideration of the variable gear-ratio is presented and the hardware in-the-loop is designed. This SBW system includes two control loops, which are called upper control loop and lower control loop, to achieve bilateral control. The force feedback motor, which is installed with the steering wheel, and the steering motor, which is installed in the front wheel, are adopted in these two loops, and two PID controllers are designed for them, respectively, so that <b>steering</b> <b>signal</b> and road feeling can be tracked.

40|$|With the {{development}} of diverse wireless communication technologies, interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although {{there have been numerous}} IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various network deployments and dynamic channel conditions. We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the <b>steering</b> <b>signal,</b> DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to robust adaptive beamforming in the presence of <b>signal</b> <b>steering</b> vector errors. Since the <b>signal</b> <b>steering</b> vector is known imprecisely, its presumed (prior) value is used to find a more accurate estimate of the actual steering vector, which then is used for obtaining the optimal beamforming weight vector. The objective for finding such an estimate of the actual <b>signal</b> <b>steering</b> vector is the maximization of the beamformer output power, while the constraints are the normalization condition and the requirement that the estimate of the steering vector does not converge to an interference steering vector. Our objective and constraints are free of any design parameters of non-unique choice. The resulting optimization problem is a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program, which is NP hard in general. However, for our problem we show that an efficient solution can be found using the semi-definite relaxation technique. Moreover, the strong duality holds for the proposed problem and can also be used for finding the optimal solution efficiently and at low complexity. In some special cases, the solution can be even found in closed-form.
