50|$|The inwards-facing lips on {{the open}} side of <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> are {{routinely}} used to mount special nuts, braces, connecting angles, {{and other types of}} interconnection mechanism or device to join lengths of <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> together or connect pipes, wire, other structures, threaded rod, bolts, or walls into the <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> structural system.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> in construction {{is that there}} are many options available for rapidly and easily connecting lengths together and other items to the <b>strut</b> <b>channel,</b> using various specialized strut-specific fasteners and bolts. It can be assembled very rapidly with minimal tools and only moderately trained labor, which reduces costs significantly in many applications. A <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> installation also can often be modified or added-to relatively easily if needed. The only alternative to <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> for most applications is custom fabrication using steel bar stock and other commodity components, requiring welding or extensive drilling and bolting, which has none of the above advantages.|$|E

50|$|<b>Strut</b> <b>channel</b> {{is used to}} mount, brace, support, {{and connect}} {{lightweight}} structural loads in building construction. These include pipes, electrical and data wire, mechanical systems such as ventilation, air conditioning, and other mechanical systems. <b>Strut</b> <b>channel</b> is also used for other applications that require a strong framework, such as workbenches, shelving systems, equipment racks, etc.Specially made sockets are available to tighten nuts,bolts etc. inside the channel,normal sockets are unable to fit through the opening.|$|E

50|$|<b>Strut</b> <b>channel</b> {{made from}} steel, aluminium, or fibre-reinforced plastic is used {{heavily in the}} {{building}} industry and is often used in the support of cable trays {{and other forms of}} cable management, and pipes support systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>Strut</b> <b>channel</b> is also {{manufactured}} from {{stainless steel}} for use where rusting {{might become a}} problem (e.g., outdoors, facilities with corrosive materials), from aluminium alloy when weight is an issue or from fiberglass for very corrosive environments.|$|E
50|$|In US units, {{the basic}} typical <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> forms a box 1 5/8 inch by 1 5/8 inch. In metric units, {{this is a}} 41 mm by 41 mm unit. There are several {{additional}} sizes and combined shapes manufactured.|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>strut</b> <b>channel</b> {{comes in}} the open box section, 1 5/8 by 1 5/8 inch square cross section. A half height (1 5/8 inch wide, 13/16 inch tall) cross section version is also available, used mostly where mounted {{directly}} to a wall as it has significantly less stiffness and ability to carry loads across an open space or brace. A deep channel 2 7/16 inches tall and 1 5/8 inch wide is also manufactured.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Strut</b> <b>channel,</b> often {{referred}} to colloquially by one of several manufacturer trade names,(e.g. [...] "G-STRUT", [...] "Kindorf", [...] "Unistrut", [...] "Superstrut", [...] "UltraSTRUT", [...] "Strut", [...] "Metstrut", [...] "Flexstrut", [...] "JIKAstrut", [...] "Nu-Strut", [...] "Cantruss", [...] "C-Channel", [...] "Canstrut", [...] "Hilti Strut"), [...] "ChampionStrut"), is a standardized formed structural system used in the construction and electrical industries for light structural support, often for supporting wiring, plumbing, or mechanical components such as air conditioning or ventilation systems.|$|E
