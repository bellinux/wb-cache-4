40|$|Outdoor aquatic ditch mesocosms {{were treated}} {{with a range of}} {{pesticides}} to simulate various spray drift rates resulting from a typical crop protection program used in the cultivation of potatoes in The Netherlands. The main experimental aims of the present study were to provide information on the fate and ecological effects of drift of the pesticides into surface water and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} drift-reduction measures in mitigating risks. The pesticides selected and the dosage, frequency, and timing of application were based on normal agricultural practices in the potato crop. Applications of prosulfocarb, metribuzin (both herbicides), lambda-cyhalothrin (insecticide), chlorothalonil, and fluazinam (both fungicides) were made in the sequence typical of the <b>spray</b> <b>calendar</b> for potatoes. A total of 15 treatments with the various compounds were made by spray application to the water surface at 0. 2 %, 1 %, and 5 % of the recommended label rates. Chemical fate and effects on ecosystem function and structure (phytoplankton, zooplankton, chlorophyll-¿, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, breakdown of plant litter) were investigated. To interpret the observed effects, treatment concentrations were also expressed in toxic units (TU), which describe the relative toxicity of the compounds with standard toxicity test organisms (Daphnia and algae). After treatment, each compound disappeared from the water phase within 2 d, with the exception of prosulfocarb, for which 50 % dissipation time (DT 50) values ranged between 6 and 7 d. At the 5 % treatment level, an exposure peak of 0. 9 TUalgae was observed, which resulted in short-term responses of pH, oxygen, and phytoplankton. At the 5 % treatment level, exposure concentrations also exceeded 0. 1 TUDaphnia, and this resulted in long-term effects on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, some of which did not fully recover by the end of the present study. At the 1 % treatment level, only slight transient effects were observed on a limited number of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate species and on pH. At the 0. 2 % level, no consistent treatment-related effects were observed. Most of the observed effects were consistent with the results from higher-tier and mesocosm studies with the individual compounds. Multi and repeated stress played a small role within the applied pesticide package, because of rapid dissipation of most substances and the absence of many simultaneous applications. This suggests that risk assessments based on the individual compounds would in this case have been sufficiently protective for their uses in a crop protection progra...|$|E

40|$|Três experimentos foram conduzidos utilizando-se o híbrido de tomateiro {{industrial}} H 7155 N, em 2003 e 2004 visando adequar um sistema de previsão modificado para o uso de fungicidas no manejo da requeima causada por Phytophthora infestans. Os experimentos foram conduzidos num delineamento em blocos ao acaso com dez tratamentos e três repetições. Os fungicidas sistêmicos foram aplicados quando o valor de severidade da doença (VSD) alcançou oito, dez ou doze pontos. A alternância dos fungicidas sistêmicos com o metiram ocorreu na semana em que não foram alcançados os VSD´s. O tratamento calendário de pulverização para o controle da requeima consistiu da aplicação semanal de fungicidas após o aparecimento dos primeiros sintomas e aqueles definidos pelo sistema de previsão foram baseados nos VSD acumulados durante o experimento. A avaliação da requeima foi feita semanalmente com auxílio de uma escala descritiva de severidade e uma chave diagramática. A eficiência dos tratamentos foi comparada calculando-se a área abaixo da curva do progresso da doença, a taxa de progresso da doença (r) e produtividade de tomate. Os valores de r do melhor tratamento (dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil (VSD = 10) alternado com metiram variaram de 0, 03 a 0, 07, enquanto para o tratamento calendário semanal foi de 0, 05 a 0, 09 e para testemunha de 0, 24 a 0, 39. Dimetomorfe + clorotalonil (VSD = 10) alternado com metiram produziu em média 15, 7 toneladas a mais de tomate, comparado ao tratamento calendário semanal de fungicidas. Dimetomorfe ou metalaxil-M misturado com clorotalonil (VSD = 10) baseado no sistema de previsão sem a alternância com metiram diferiu do calendário semanal baseado na severidade da doença e na produção de tomate. Os tratamentos piraclostrobina misturado com metiram (VSD = 8; VSD = 10) alternado com metiram; dimetomorfe misturado com mancozeb (VSD = 8; VSD = 10) alternado com metiram proporcionaram controle intermediário da requeima. O sistema de previsão baseado no uso de dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil alternado com metiram (VSD = 10) permitiu redução de uma aplicação da mistura dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil pulverização em dois dos três experimentos, comparados ao tratamento calendário semanal de aplicação de fungicidas, sem afetar a produção. Three {{experiments were}} carried out using an industrial tomato hybrid H 7155 N crop, in 2003 and 2004 seasons to fit a modified prediction system, which allows the criterious use of fungicides for the control of late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans. Trials were conducted in a randomized complete block design with ten treatments and three replications. The formulated systemic fungicides were applied when the disease severity values (DSV) reached eight, ten or twelve points. On weeks where DSV's values were lower than eight, ten or twelve, metiram was applied. The traditional late blight control consisted of weekly application of fungicides after the first symptoms disease, and those defined by the prediction system {{were carried out}} based on the DSV's accumulated throughout the experiment. Late blight severity was assessed weekly by using a descriptive key and diagrammatic scale. The efficiency of the control treatments was compared by the area under the disease progress curve, disease progress rate (r) and tomato yield. The r values of the best treatment (dimethomorph + chlorothalonil, DSV = 10, alternated with metiram), weekly application calendar fungicides and the check treatment varied from 0. 03 to 0. 07, 0. 05 to 0. 09 and 0. 24 to 0. 39, respectively. Dimethomorph + chlorothalonil DSV = 10 alternated with metiram was the most efficient and yielded more than 15, 7 ton of tomato in average, above the weekly <b>spraying</b> <b>calendar</b> fungicides. Dimethomorph or metalaxyl-M mixtured with chlorothalonil (DSV = 10) based on the prediction scheme without alternation with metiram differed from the weekly <b>spraying</b> <b>calendar</b> fungicide based on disease severity and tomato yield. The treatments pyraclostrobim + metiram (DSV = 8; DSV = 10) alternated with metiram; dimethomorph + mancozeb (DSV = 8; DSV = 10) alternated with metiram gave intermediate control of late blight and tomato yield. The prediction scheme that used dimethomorph + chlorothalonil alternated with metiram (DSV = 10) allowed the reduction in one spray in two trials of the mixture dimethomorph + chlorothalonil compared to the weekly <b>spraying</b> <b>calendar</b> fungicide without any yield loss...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} natural enemies on {{immature}} {{stages of the}} diamondback moth was quantitatively assessed in commercial cabbage crops in southeast Queensland, Australia, in 2000 and 2001. The survivorship of Plutella xylostella (L.) eggs, larvae and pupae on cabbage plants caged to exclude predators and larval and pupal parasitoids was compared with survivorship on cabbage plants which were caged to simulate the ambient conditions created by the exclusion cages, but which allowed natural enemy access. In 2000, six cohorts of P. xylostella were studied on three commercial Brassica farms which adopted an integrated approach to pest management and six cohorts were studied on three farms which adopted a <b>calendar</b> <b>spray</b> approach to pest management; a further two cohorts were followed in cabbage plots at Gatton Research Station. In 2001, two cohorts were followed on a farm adopting IPM and two cohorts were followed on a farm practising <b>calendar</b> <b>spraying.</b> Estimated losses due to predation ranged from 2 - 85 % in 2000 and from 22 - 77 % in 2001.

5000|$|Cultural {{controls}} help {{to delay}} the onset and development of symptoms, and reduce {{the level of the}} primary inoculum present. The primary inoculum that causes the onset of symptoms is induced by the production of microscopic spores called conidia in soil residue. Large amounts of peanut residue in fields where peanuts are cropped seasonally usually results in the progression of late leaf spot. Therefore, crop rotation, along with tillage practices are advised. Since longer periods of leaf wetness is required for disease development, frequent irrigation can increase the chances of high humidity and increased leaf wetness. [...] As opposed to irrigation systems, growers are encouraged to apply small amounts of water regularly in order to maintain a drier canopy. When planting new crops, plant as far away as possible, since late leaf spot spores travel far distances through wind dispersal. Try to avoid planting crops downwind from one another due to spore’s ability to travel between neighboring crop fields. Different varieties of peanut differ in their reaction to the pathogen, but none have proven to be resistant, and are able {{to be used as a}} control method. Spanish varieties are most susceptible, Virginia varieties are intermediates, and runner varieties are partially resistant. Very specific chemical controls are used to prevent yield loss, and are required in a very narrow, specific time period in order to be most effective. To be most successful, spray chemical controls as soon as the onset of symptom development. [...] Fungicide application is recommended on a 14-day set calendar schedule, or according to weather based leaf spot advisory. In fields that utilize crop rotation, fungicides should be sprayed during the early pod stage (R3), which typically occurs during July, but can vary according to environment. After the first spray, the grower should continue to apply fungicides every 14 days or according to the leaf spot advisory. Chlorothalonil (Bravo; various generic brands), are the most successful fungicides, and have reduced risk of host resistance. An alternative approach to <b>calendar</b> <b>sprays</b> are to spray crops based on weather patterns. However, this method has proven to be less effective than calendar treatment approaches. Following a harvesting season, growers should collect, burn, or bury the remains of the crops to prevent the soil-borne pathogen from surviving and causing future disease outbreaks.|$|R
