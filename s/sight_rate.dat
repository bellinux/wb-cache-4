40|$|We are now {{entering}} {{a time of}} immense environmental upheaval in which, increasingly, experts are required to provide conservation assessments. Quantitative assessment of trends in species' range and abundance is costly, requiring extensive field studies {{over a long period}} of time. Unfortunately, many species are only known through a few "chance" sightings or a handful of specimens, and therefore extinction may be even harder to ascertain. Several methods have been proposed for estimating the probability of extinction. However, comparison within and between species is difficult because of variations in <b>sighting</b> <b>rates.</b> We applied a probabilistic method that incorporates <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> to the <b>sighting</b> record of Vietnamese slipper orchids (Paphiopedilum). The method generates a probability that another sighting will occur given the previous <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> and the time since last observation. This allows greater comparability between species discovered at different times. Its predictions were more highly correlated with the World Conservation Union criteria than previous methods. Trends in data collection and the political climate of a country, which affects access to material, are important potential sources of variation that affect <b>sighting</b> <b>rates.</b> A lack of understanding of the process by which data are generated makes inferring extinction from sighting records difficult because extinction status depends on how the <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> varies.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{cetacean}} species {{make use of}} the bays along the South African coast for different purposes, including feeding, mating and calving. Sightings of five species of cetaceans were recorded from shore based locations between February 2010 and August 2014 in Mossel Bay, Western Cape. In this study, we aimed to examine the underlying environmental variables: sea surface temperature (°C), chlorophyll a concentration (mg. m- 3) and moon brightness (as % of full) that potentially affect presence patterns within the bay, and several temporal scales (diurnal, monthly, seasonal, annual). The study focused on three whale species: the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei); and two dolphin species: the Indo- Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), and the Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea). Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to model the <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> of the common cetacean species in the area, by relating <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> to the environmental variables. Cow-calf groups and adults-only groups were modelled separately for humpback and southern right whales. Chlorophyll a concentration is commonly indicative of high trophic productivity, and sea surface temperature is indicative of biophysical processes that influence cetacean distribution, as well as cetacean migration preferences. Change in sea surface temperature (over the study period) was a significant contributing factor to the <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> of cow-calf paired groups and adults-only groups of both right whales and humpback whales, underlying their greater <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> during the winter and spring months annually; thus, conforming to the seasonal migration from Antarctica for breeding and calving. Chlorophyll a concentration was a significant factor contributing to Bryde's whale, bottlenose and humpback dolphin distribution. These species reside along the South African coast all year round, but are more frequently seen when trophic productivity is high. During 2011, sea surface temperature values were lower and chlorophyll a concentrations greater than average in Mossel Bay, due to the La Niña effect. This was found to positively correlate with the use of Mossel Bay by the cetacean species in the area.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors explaining the distribution and behaviour of coastal marine mammals are tides. Tidal forces drive a large number of primary and secondary processes, such as changes in water depth, salinity, temperature, current velocity and direction. Unravelling which tidal process is the most influential for a certain species is often challenging, {{due to a lack of}} observations of all tide related covariates, strong correlation between them, and the elusive nature of most marine organisms which often hampers their detection. In the Marsdiep area, a tidal inlet between the North Sea and the Dutch Wadden Sea, the presence of harbour porpoises (. Phocoena phocoena) was studied as a function of tide related covariates. Observations were carried out in early spring from a ferry crossing the inlet on a half hourly basis. Environmental and sightings data were collected by one observer, while an on-board Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and temperature sensor continuously recorded current velocity profiles and temperature, respectively. Sea surface temperature and salinity were measured at a nearby jetty. Sightings (. n=. 134) were linked to tidal elevation, geographical position, local depth-averaged current velocity, water temperature (with and without trend correction) and salinity. Variation in <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> was best described by salinity, with highest <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> at high levels of salinity (> 30 gkg - 1), indicating that porpoises enter the area in bodies of (more saline) North Sea water. Second best variable was time of day, with the highest <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> early morning, and decreasing during the day. However, surveys in the morning happened to coincide more often with high water and hence, the apparent time of day effect could be due to collinearity. Most porpoises were present in the northern part of the Marsdiep, particularly during high tide. Tide dependent <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> confirmed that porpoises reside in the North Sea, and enter the western Wadden Sea during the flood and leave during ebb.

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Blue whale {{locations in}} the Southern Hemisphere and northern Indian Ocean were obtained from catches (303 239), sightings (4383 records of 8058 whales), strandings (103), Discovery marks (2191) and recoveries (95), and acoustic recordings. 2. Sighting surveys included 7 480 450 km of effort plus 14 676 days with unmeasured effort. Groups usually consisted of solitary whales (65. 2 %) or pairs (24. 6 %); larger feeding aggregations of unassociated individuals were only rarely observed. <b>Sighting</b> <b>rates</b> (groups per 1000 km from many platform types) varied by four orders of magnitude and were lowest {{in the waters of}} Brazil, South Africa, the eastern tropical Pacific, Antarctica and South Georgia; higher in the Subantarctic and Peru; and highest around Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Chile, southern Australia and south of Madagascar. 3. Blue whales avoid the oligotrophic central gyres of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but are more common where phytoplankton densities are high, and where there are dynamic oceanographic processes like upwelling and frontal meandering. 4. Compared with historical catches, the Antarctic (‘true') subspecies is exceedingly rare and usually concentrated closer to the summer pack ice. In summer they are found throughout the Antarctic; in winter they migrate to southern Africa (although recent sightings there are rare) and to other northerly locations (based on acoustics), although some overwinter in the Antarctic. 5. Pygmy blue whales are found around the Indian Ocean and from southern Australia to New Zealand. At least four groupings are evident: northern Indian Ocean, from Madagascar to the Subantarctic, Indonesia to western and southern Australia, and from New Zealand northwards to the equator. <b>Sighting</b> <b>rates</b> are typically much higher than for Antarctic blue whales. 6.

In this study we investigated the ability of observers in fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft to sight 2. 5 m artificial shark analogues placed at known depths and positions. Initial tests revealed that the shark analogues could only be detected at shallow depths, averaging only 2. 5 m and 2. 7 m below the water surface for observers in fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft, respectively. We then deployed analogues at shallower depths along a 5 km-long grid, and assessed their sightability to aircraft observers {{through a series of}} transects flown within 500 m. Analogues were seen infrequently from all distances, with overall <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> of only 12. 5 % and 17. 1 % for fixed-wing and helicopter observers, respectively.

Modelling of <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> against environmental and experimental variables indicated that observations were affected by distance, aircraft type, sun glare and sea conditions, while the range of water turbidities observed had no effect. We conclude that aerial observers have limited ability to detect the presence of submerged animals such as sharks, particularly when the sharks are deeper than ∼ 2. 6 m, or over 300 m distant from the aircraft's flight path, especially during sunny or windy days. The low rates of detections found in this study cast serious doubts on the use of aerial beach patrols as an effective early-warning system to prevent shark attacks...|$|R

The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the possible effects of seismic exploration sounds on distribution of cetaceans in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The study consisted of ten Gulfier research cruises, surveying the Northern Gulf of Mexico from 1992 to 1997. Cetacean <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> (sightings per hour) were examined in relation to the low frequency sounds originating from oil exploration. Recordings of seismic pulses were collected via a towed passive hydrophone array, and grouped according to the signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) into levels of 12 do above ambient. Visual observations of cetaceans utilized 'big eye' binoculars to identify animals. Five hydrographic features were determined by analyzing sea surface height measurements obtained from satellite altimeter and by analysis of shipboard hydrographic measurements. The five defined hydrographic regions were: cold core rings (CCR), warm core rings (WCR), ring peripheries (PER), confluence zones (CON), and other (OTHER). Over 514 hours of recordings were analyzed, with seismic exploration pulses present 21 % of the overall time, with a high of 49 % in the last cruise. The <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> for Stenella attenuate were significantly higher in the > 12 dB above ambient region of "OTHER'' (x?= 10. 26, p= 0. 005); this was the only significant according to hydrographic feature for the overall sightings (x?= 8. 46, p= 0. 07), and for Physeter microcephalus (x?= 12. 13,p= 0. 016). <b>Sighting</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly higher in the CCR and the PER for these groups. It appears that cetacean distributions are related to environmental conditions and not to sound intensity level of seismic exploration. The CCR often occur on the continental margin of the mouth of the Mississippi River, an area of great oil exploitation. Tolerance of noise by cetaceans in this important cetacean habitat may impact these findings. Displacement of cetaceans away from immediate source of sound into regions of moderate sound intensity may also influence our ability to observe a change in cetacean distribution associated with seismic exploration...|$|R

The development of methods of collecting and interpreting sighting and catch data was intimately interwoven with the development of the management of whaling and cetacean by-catches in fisheries throughout the world, but especially within the context of the Scientific Committees of the IWC and the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO). Although overfishing of whales was initially identified through the use of <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> data, catch rate data provided the IWC’s Committee its first firm footing for management advice. However, it was <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> data that ultimately became the basis for the scientific advice on whaling and for management advice in other settings. This led to the development of large scale cetacean sighting programmes, such as the IWC’s International Decade of Cetacean Research surveys in Antarctic aboard Japanese ships, the North Atlantic Sighting Surveys (NASS) aboard Norwegian, Icelandic, Spanish, Greenlandic and Faroese vessels and aircraft (coordinated by NAMMCO through its Scientific Committee from 1995), and surveys under the US’s Marine Mammal Protection Act and the European Union’s Small Cetacean Abundance in the North Sea (SCANS) programme.

40|$|Methods {{are needed}} to {{estimate}} {{the probability that a}} population is extinct, whether to underpin decisions regarding the continuation of a invasive species eradication program, or to decide whether further searches for a rare and endangered species could be warranted. Current models for inferring extinction probability based on sighting data typically assume a constant or declining <b>sighting</b> <b>rate.</b> We develop methods to analyse these models in a Bayesian framework to estimate detection and survival probabilities of a population conditional on sighting data. We note, however, that the assumption of a constant or declining <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> may be hard to justify, especially for incursions of invasive species with potentially positive population growth rates. We therefore explored introducing additional process complexity via density-dependent survival and detection probabilities, with population density no longer constrained to be constant or decreasing. These models were applied to sparse carcass discoveries associated with the recent incursion of the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) into Tasmania, Australia. While a simple model provided apparently precise estimates of parameters and extinction probability, estimates arising from the more complex model were much more uncertain, with the sparse data unable to clearly resolve the underlying population processes. The outcome of this analysis was a much higher possibility of population persistence. We conclude that if it is safe to assume detection and survival parameters are constant, then existing models can be readily applied to sighting data to estimate extinction probability. If not, methods reliant on these simple assumptions are likely overstating their accuracy, and their use to underpin decision-making potentially fraught.

First, I analysed <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> of {{harbour porpoise}} on seabird surveys in the North Sea during 1980 - 2003 to determine whether these data could provide informative time-series of relative abundance. Some general patterns and trends in <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> were consistent with previous studies. However, the standardised indices of abundance were relatively imprecise and thus have limited value for a monitoring framework that relies on statistical detection of trends. Second, I used a population model to integrate available data on harbour porpoise in the North Sea and to assess {{the dynamics of the}} population during 1987 - 2005. There was a high probability that bycatch resulted in a decrease in abundance. The estimated life history parameters suggested a limited scope for population growth {{even in the absence of}} bycatch. The model and data were not informative about maximum population growth rate or carrying capacity. The model suggested that dispersal was the most plausible explanation for observed changes in distribution within the North Sea. Third, I considered management procedures for calculating bycatch limits. I performed simulations to compare the behaviour of the procedures, to tune the procedures to specific conservation objectives and to test the robustness of the procedures to a range of uncertainties regarding population dynamics and structure, the environment, observation and implementation. Preliminary annual bycatch limits for harbour porpoise in the North Sea ranged from 187 - 1685 depending on the procedure, tuning and management areas used.

40|$|A dorsal-fin photo-identification {{technique}} {{paired with}} a non-invasive parallel laser photogrammetry technique was used to non-invasively identify individual Sphyrna mokarran over time. Based on the data collected over a duration of 59 days, 16 different S. mokarran (mean ± s. d. pre-caudal length: 220 · 82 ± 13 · 66 cm; mean ± s. d. cephalofoil width: 71 · 38 ± 7 · 94 cm) were identified using dorsal-fin photo-identification, with a mean ± s. d. shark re-sighting frequency of 4 · 05 ± 3 · 06 at-sea days. The results illustrate a high S. mokarran <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> and therefore, the utilization of parallel laser photogrammetry and dorsal-fin photo-identification may be a plausible multi-year approach to aid in non-invasively determining the growth rate and inter-annual site fidelity of these animals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) {{are widely}} distributed, ecologically {{important}} marine apex predators {{that are considered}} to be vulnerable to extinction. Given their crucial roles in structuring marine ecosystems, their populations need to be effectively monitored. Photo-identification provides a standardised, non-lethal method of assessing the population dynamics of extant species and provides live-encounter mark-recapture and data that are essential for management and conversation. White sharks occur throughout South African coastal waters but their centre of abundance is the Western Cape, where large sharks predominate at aggregation sites like Seal Island, False Bay. This study documents inter- and intra-seasonal trends in mean <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> and sex ratios of white sharks at Seal Island, and provides mark-recapture data that are used to estimate proportions of "resident" and "transient" white sharks, their size-distribution and maturity composition...|$|R
40|$|Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} (Orcaella brevirostris) {{have previously}} {{been reported to}} occur in Songkhla Lake, {{but there have been}} no surveys undertaken and little information has been gathered on the status of the population. Boat, aerial and interview surveys were conducted in the Lake, which revealed a low <b>sighting</b> <b>rate</b> and high levels of mortality. It appears that the population is now restricted to the upper freshwater portion of Songkhla Lake, with no movement between the lake and coastal marine waters. Due to the high number of strandings in the area, a local dolphin conservation group was formed in 1996, in an effort to publicise the importance of conserving dolphins in the Lake. However, conservation efforts are difficult to implement and enforce, due to the importance of the Lake to the local community for subsistence fisheries and agriculture. Effective conservation measures are urgently required to ensure the survival of Irrawaddy Dolphins which inhabit this freshwater environment...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Seasonal {{movements}} of 14 belugas in Cook Inlet, Alaska, were monitored by satellite telemetry between July and March in 2000 – 03. Whales used {{waters in the}} upper Cook Inlet intensively between summer and late autumn and dispersed to mid-inlet offshore waters during winter months. All whales remained in Cook Inlet the entire time they were tracked, and several whales were tracked through March. During summer and early fall, movements were clearly concentrated in specific areas, generally river mouths or bays, where whales were likely feeding on fish runs. Average daily travel distances ranged from 11 to 30 km per day. Monthly home ranges, estimated using the 95 % kernel probability distribution of average daily positions, were smallest in August (982 km 2), increased throughout autumn, and peaked in winter (reaching approximately 5000 km 2). The seasonal variation in distribution and movement patterns displayed by belugas in Cook Inlet affect the <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> and seasonal abundance estimates obtained for this depleted population...|$|R
40|$|The Spoonbill {{populations in}} Europe are {{fragmented}} and threatened. The {{dynamics of the}} species is poorly known but ringing and observation programmes are under way. Here we estimated the local survival of two colour-ringed populations of Spoonbills in the Netherlands. Adult survival and <b>sighting</b> <b>rates,</b> estimated with the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, were high and constant over a 10 -year period (1986 - 1996) and no differences could be detected between the two populations. Juvenile survival, estimated from the observed return rate, did not vary over a 5 -year period (cohorts 1986 - 1990). However, at least {{in one of the}} two populations, the proportion of birds returning by two years of age increased over a 9 -year period (cohorts 1986 - 1994). Thus there is only weak support for the idea that the recent increase in population size was driven by an increase in local survival. Our work on survival provide a first step towards a larger appreciation of the population dynamics and life-history of the Spoonbill. ...|$|R

40|$|The annual {{movement}} of South African sardine Sardinops sagax up {{the east coast}} of South Africa, known as the 'sardine run', was investigated using data from aerial surveys for the period 1988 - 2005 and compared with remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a data. Sardine <b>sighting</b> <b>rates</b> were highest within the Waterfall Bluff Bight off the Eastern Cape Coast, where conditions appeared to be most favourable. Sardine and predator sightings decreased significantly northwards of Mdoni on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast, whereas the proportion of nearshore sightings increased. The causal mechanism for this inshore concentration is suggested to be the influx of warm Agulhas Current water from the Durban Eddy that forces sardine shoreward. Cape gannet Morus capensis, common dolphin Delphinus capensis and sardine distributions were associated, and there was an association between SST and sardine and predator distributions. There was a marked increase in bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus sightings upon commencement of the sardine run, with these dolphins being considered to be a 'migratory' stock that enters KZN waters every winter...|$|R
