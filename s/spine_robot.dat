40|$|Background: There is {{much more}} {{radiation}} exposure to the surgeons during minimally invasive pedicle screws placement. In order to ease the surgeon&# 39;s hand-eye coordination and to reduce the iatrogenic radiation injury to the surgeons, a robot assisted percutaneous pedicle screw placement is useful. This study assesses the feasibility and clinical value of robot assisted navigated drilling for pedicle screw placement and the results thus achieved {{formed the basis for}} the development of a new robot for pedicle screw fixation surgery. Materials and Methods: Preoperative computed tomography (CT) of eight bovine lumbar spines (L 1 -L 5) in axial plane were captured for each vertebra, the entry points and trajectories of the screws were preoperatively planned. On the basis of preoperative CT scans and intraoperative fluoroscopy, we aligned the robot drill to the desired entry point and trajectory, as dictated by the surgeon&# 39;s preoperative plan. Eight bovine lumbar spines were inserted 80 K-wires using the <b>spine</b> <b>robot</b> system. The time for system registration and pedicle drilling, fluoroscopy times were measured and recorded. Postoperative CT scans were used to assess the position of the K-wires. Results: Assisted by <b>spine</b> <b>robot</b> system, the average time for system registration was (343. 4 +/- 18. 4) s, the average time for procedure of drilling one pedicle screw trajectory was (89. 5 +/- 6. 1) s, times of fluoroscopy for drilling one pedicle screw were (2. 9 +/- 0. 8) times. Overall, 12 (15. 0 %) of the 80 K-wires violated the pedicle wall. Four screws (5. 0 %) were medial to the pedicle and 8 (10. 5 %) were lateral. The number of K-wires wholly within the pedicle were 68 (85 %). Conclusions: The preliminary study supports the view that computer assisted pedicle screw fixation using spinal robot is feasible and the robot can decrease the intraoperative fluoroscopy time during the minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation surgery. As spine robotic surgery is still in its infancy, further research in this field is worthwhile especially the accuracy of <b>spine</b> <b>robot</b> system should be improved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} neural {{architecture}} capable to control syn-ergistically a flexible robotic {{model of the}} human vertebral column toward balance and upward posture. The neural controller is composed of non-linear oscillators that control each vertebre of the column constructed {{on the principle of}} tensegrity. They play the role of the central pattern generators in the spinal cords to generate rhythmical patterns and to be entrained to the resonant modes of the tensegrity system. After exploration of the different coordination regimes for different coupling parameters, the top-down controller is able to dynamically select, amplify or inhibit each motor synergy for upward postural balance even with respect to external perturbations. 2 Introduction Animal's musculo-skeletal system is based on a complex network of muscles, bones, nerves, tissues and soft-bodies, which are hard to replicate accurately in robots and to control. The animal's biomechanics are however well-ordered so that the neural control done in the spinal cords can fit its organization and generate the dynamical grouping of the muscles for compliant motion. The hierarchical organization of the motor control a. k. a. the motor synergies has been suggested to diminish the curse of dimensionality of control as enounced by Bernstein. Therefore, the design principles of both the body structure and of the neural model are complementary and have to be considered jointly in order to generate complex motion dynamics. Considering the body, the musculo-skeletal system is always soft and elastic and positioned in a stable or neutral posture. This property is specific to tensile structures, which most biological systems possess as attribute. Eventhough the redundancy and nonlinearity within such dynamical system might be considered as an obstacle for control, the symmetries of the overall structure and the many resonant modes generated can serve to reduce the dimensionality of the control problem. For instance, the control and discovery of the motor synergies may be easier to find by applying synchronization and resonance to these resonant modes. In previous works, we presented a framework based on feedback resonance of chaotic controllers to excite the passive dynam-Figure 1 : Vertebral column robot. This tensegrity-based robot is compliant and lightweight, mounted with springs in opposition. The motors are mounted in pairs to produce co-contractions. An IMU is placed {{at the top of the}} structure for feedback. ics of several robotic devices and to tune them dynamically to their resonant modes. The control was done indirectly through the coupling parameters between the robot and the oscillators per se. By doing so, we decreased significantly the dimensionality of the control space. We suggested that the coupling parameters are playing the role of the neuro-modulators in the spinal cords, which dynamically trigger the different motor synergies [1]. As our aim is of integrating the structure and the control, we expand our framework to the control of a dorsal <b>spine</b> <b>robot</b> based on tensegrity, see Fig. 1. The homepage of the project is given at 1 with videos of the vertebral column in different configurations. After exploration and cat-egorization of its resonant modes and of its behavioral patterns within the parameters space for different coupling values, we control the spinal cord robot to return back to its rhythmical modes or to its postural configuration based on external feedback perturbations received...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explain the {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} robot herring that we have developed. The use of mechanical accumulators is a fundamental issue {{in the design of}} this robot. Two different types of mechanical accumulators are implemented and tested as a <b>spine</b> on the <b>robot.</b> We argue that using an Euler buckled <b>spine,</b> on a <b>robot</b> fish, will give more efficient robots and a naturally occurring biomimetic carangiform swimming style. Furthermore we argue that mechanical accumulators should be an essential part of every coming robot fish. The robot herring is a low cost project where a minimalistic approach has been used to develop a biomimetic robot fish. ...|$|R

30|$|Several tetrahedron-based robots {{have been}} designed, and the {{emphasis}} mainly on building novel structures to produce feasible gait patterns. Based on the mathematical models of 4 -TET, 8 -TET, 12 -TET Walkers and tetrahedron worm built by Abrahantes et al. [4, 8], the choreographed gaits of these robots were designed according to the geometric relationships of the struts. For a novel tensegrity duct robot constructed with two linked tetrahedrons [9, 10], the main focus {{is also on the}} design of climbing gaits. Through the structure design and kinematic analysis of a steering crawling tetrahedron robot which links a pushing element on one of its four nodes [11], the slope crawling gait was presented. However, the research on successive path planning of such linkage-based mobile mechanism is relatively rare. And its successive motion much depends on complex control system. A light source tracking 1 -TET designed by Yu and Nagpal [12] realize its rolling motion by control the self-adapting system contains amounts of sensors. And a <b>spine</b> tensegrity <b>robot</b> simulated its successive rolling by using central pattern generators (CPGs) [13].|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} the biomechatronic {{design of a}} legged rat robot, {{to be used in}} experiments on rat behavior. The rat robot has been designed so as to possess leg and body motion similar to those of real rats and to show the capability of rat-like simple behaviors, like walking and pushing a lever. The rat robot has 4 legs with 3 DOF (2 active and 1 passive) for each leg and 1 additional DOF allowing <b>robot</b> <b>spine</b> torsion. A cable and pulley mechanism allows the two front legs of the robot to perform manipulation tasks like pushing levers and buttons in a smooth and natural way, as not only the geometry and mass of the legs {{are similar to those of}} real rats, but also because the cables act, from an anatomical and physiological point of view, like the triceps muscle with the knee tendon structure. An interaction experiment, using our rat robot and two different real rats (control and experimental subject) has been conducted to verify the capability of the robotic rat to interact and teach simple tasks to the real rat.

40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of evolution, vertebrates first accomplished locomotionvia motion of the spine. Legs evolved later, to enhance mobility, but the spine remainscentral. Contrary to this, most robots have rigid torsos and rely primarily on movementof the legs for mobility. The force distributing properties of tensegrity structures presentsa potential means of developing compliant <b>spines</b> for legged <b>robots,</b> with the goal ofdriving motion from the robots core. In addition, the increasing complexity of soft andhybrid-soft robots highlights {{the need for more}} efficient methods of minimizing machinelearning solution spaces, and creative ways to ease the process of rapid prototyping. In this thesis I present the process of morphological design for a tensegrityquadruped robot, the first to the author's knowledge, which I call MountainGoat, andits impact on controllable locomotion. All parts of the robot, including legs and spine,are compliant. Control is initially demonstrated with three variations of MountainGoat,focusing on actuation of the spine as central to the locomotion process. Following thegeneral pattern of biological evolution, leg actuation is developed next. Additionally,to reduce the overall machine learning space, I present four different choices of mus-cle groups to actuate: three for a primarily spine-driven morphology of a tensegrity quadruped, called MountainGoat, and one for a primarily leg-driven variation of this quadruped, and compare the resulting differences in locomotion speed. Each iterationof design seeks to reduce the total number of active muscles, and consequently reducethe dimensionality of the problem for machine learning, while still producing effectivelocomotion. The reduction in active muscles seeks to simplify future rapid prototypingof the robot. For this portion of the thesis, two separate approaches to actuation, oneprimarily spine-driven and the other primarily leg-driven, are explored. Locomotion for all models is aided by the use of central pattern generators,feedback control via a neural network, and a two-tiered machine learning approach in-volving the Monte Carlo method as well as genetic evolution for parameter optimization...|$|R
