5|$|El Sol {{returned}} to the Morgan Line in 1919 and sailed with them until March 1927, when she <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> New York Harbor after colliding with Sac City of the American Diamond Line. A portion of the ship's cargo was salvaged but the ship was scrapped later in the year.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Wien {{was struck}} by Italian torpedoes and <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> her home port of Trieste. The {{remaining}} two ships were ceded to Great Britain {{following the end of}} the war and were scrapped between 1920 and 1922.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the twelve}} ships that <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> the storm, three {{have never been}} found: Leafield, James Carruthers, and Plymouth. The most recent {{discovery}} is Hydrus, which was located {{in the summer of}} 2015. The last wreck found previous to Hydrus was Henry B. Smith in 2013.|$|E
5|$|SS Edmund Fitzgerald was an American Great Lakes {{freighter}} that <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> a Lake Superior {{storm on}} November 10, 1975, {{with the loss}} of the entire crew of 29. When launched on June 7, 1958, she was the largest ship on North America's Great Lakes, and she remains the largest to have sunk there.|$|E

5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Italian fleet {{for the first}} decade of their careers. They saw action in the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912, where they participated in the seizure of Cyrenaica in North Africa and operations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They were reduced to training ships by World War I, and both ships were lost with heavy death tolls during the conflict. Benedetto Brin exploded in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita struck a mine and <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> December 1916.|$|E
5|$|Bouvet capsized and <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> {{about two}} minutes. The ship was in poor {{condition}} {{at the time}} due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded. The destruction of the ship caught the Allies by surprise; her loss came {{during the height of}} the bombardment. Torpedo boats and other smaller vessels rushed to pick up survivors, but they rescued only a handful of men. From her complement of 710 men, some 660 were killed in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Fritz Joubert Duquesne, a Boer and German spy, {{claimed to}} have assumed the {{identity}} of Russian Count Boris Zakrevsky and joined Kitchener in Scotland. Duquesne supposedly signalled a German U-boat shortly after departing Scapa Flow to alert them that Kitchener’s ship was approaching. He was then rescued by the submarine as Hampshire <b>sank.</b> <b>In</b> the 1930s and '40s, he ran the Duquesne Spy Ring and was captured by the FBI along with 32 other Nazi agents in the largest espionage conviction in U.S. history.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Allen {{along with}} his {{research}} team and the Royal Navy attempted to retrieve the bell from , which <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> the Denmark Strait during World War II, but the attempt failed due to poor weather. On August 7, 2015, they tried again and recovered the bell in very good condition. It was further restored and put on display in May 2016 in the National Museum of the Royal Navy in remembrance to the 1,415 men lost at sea.|$|E
5|$|Moltke was {{surrendered}} {{with the}} rest of the High Seas Fleet on 24 November 1918 and interned at Scapa Flow, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Wollante. Believing that the Treaty of Versailles had been signed and his fleet was about to be seized by the British, Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet on 21 June 1919, while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises. The ship <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> two hours and fifteen minutes. Moltke was raised in 1927 and scrapped at Rosyth in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{southern}} waterfront, {{away from}} the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.|$|E

5|$|The {{crew was}} ordered to abandon ship after about forty minutes of the {{bombardment}} using the only remaining operable motor lifeboat of the three stowed on board. One officer and four enlisted men were injured, {{but no one was}} killed. The Turks continued their bombardment for five hours until Ben-my-Chree listed to starboard and <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> shallow water. Later in the day, the captain and the chief engineer returned to the wreck to rescue the ship's mascots, a cat and dog which had both survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{sisters were}} attacked, but not hit, during the American aerial attack on Kure in July 1945. However, the shockwaves from near misses caused {{extensive}} flooding in both ships. Iwate <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> shallow water on 25 July and Izumo capsized three days later. Both ships {{were removed from}} the navy list on 20 November and their wrecks were raised and scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{affected}} region, eight {{people were killed}} by the storm. Extensive property damage was reported in the region, including the complete collapse of the local baseball stadium. Power lines and telegraph wires were downed throughout the region and high winds reportedly tossed vehicles into buildings. Many shrimp trawlers <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> the storm, leaving substantial losses in Mexico's shrimping industry.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months later}} a second {{opportunity}} presented itself.

The 2nd Bombardment Group redeemed itself by completely destroying the derelict from the air, even though their only visible target was a ten-foot-square float marker.

5|$|An {{accident}} occurred aboard K-152 Nerpa at 8:30 PM {{local time}} on 8 November 2008, during an underwater test {{run in the}} Pacific Ocean. A total of 208 people – 81 military personnel and 127 civilians – were on board {{at the time of}} the accident. At least 20 people were killed by asphyxiation and at least 21 more were injured, making it the worst Russian submarine disaster since Kursk <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> 2000. Three of the dead were military personnel and the rest were civilians from the Vostok, Zvezda, Era and Amur shipbuilding yards who were members of the acceptance team.|$|E
5|$|As the Flames <b>sank</b> <b>in</b> the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States. The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E
