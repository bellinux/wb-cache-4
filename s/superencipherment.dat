5000|$|Naval Cypher No 1 - A four-digit {{code group}} book, in force since 1934, {{for use by}} naval units. Naval Cypher was always used reciphered or in the {{language}} of the day super-enciphered. Reciphering or <b>superencipherment</b> consisted of adding to the cypher random seeming numbers from tables of 5000 number groups, but depending on the cypher could be as many as 20000 number groups. Naval Cypher <b>superencipherment</b> tables at that time were limited to five; Commander in Chiefs Table, Flag Officers Table, General Table held by all ships below destroyers, Small Ships Tables and China Gunboats Tables.|$|E
50|$|The {{outer ring}} {{contains}} one uppercase alphabet for plaintext {{and the inner}} ring has a lowercase mixed alphabet for ciphertext. The outer ring also includes the numbers 1 to 4 for the <b>superencipherment</b> of a codebook containing 336 phrases with assigned numerical values.|$|E
5000|$|The section {{had its own}} IBM Hollerith (Herman Hollerith) {{machinery}} since 1942. The {{tabulating machinery}} was used in solving the solution of difficult additives and <b>superencipherment</b> (double encryption or Multiple encryption). At {{the end of the}} World War II, the machinery installation had: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{outer ring}} also {{includes}} the numbers 1 to 4 for the <b>superencipherment</b> of a codebook containing 336 phrases with assigned numerical values. This is a very effective method of concealing the code-numbers, since their equivalents cannot be distinguished from the other garbled letters.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{encryption}} is {{the process}} of encrypting an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or a different algorithm. It is also known as cascade encryption, cascade ciphering, multiple encryption, and <b>superencipherment.</b> Superencryption refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.|$|E
50|$|This {{pseudo-random}} number system is much weaker {{than the usual}} system of <b>superencipherment</b> but as an emergency backup system {{it would have been}} adequate and certainly better than using a transposition or simple substitution cipher. Like any other cipher system, breaking a {{pseudo-random number}} system just requires a sufficient amount of intercepted ciphertext.|$|E
5000|$|The Black Code was a US secret code used by US {{military}} attach√©s in {{the early}} period of World War II prior to the entry of the United States. The name derived from the colour of the <b>superencipherment</b> tables/codebook binding. [...] The code was compromised by Axis intelligence, the information leak costing a great many British lives.|$|E
50|$|Ciphers, on {{the other}} hand, work at a lower level: the level of {{individual}} letters, small groups of letters, or, in modern schemes, individual bits and blocks of bits. Some systems used both codes and ciphers in one system, using <b>superencipherment</b> to increase the security. In some cases the terms codes and ciphers are also used synonymously to substitution and transposition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Superencipherment</b> {{is fairly}} strong. It can be, and was, broken, {{but it is}} very hard to do. With the {{exception}} of the one-time pad, which will keep its secrets until the end of time, any code or cipher can be broken. All that is required is sufficient material. All that can be expected of a code or cipher system is that by the time the enemy breaks it, the information in the message is no longer useful. This is just a cryptographic fact of life.|$|E
5000|$|British, Australian, Dutch and American {{workers were}} {{cooperating}} in attacks on JN-25 well before Pearl Harbor, {{but because the}} Japanese Navy was not engaged in significant battle operations before then, there was little traffic available to act as raw material. Before then, IJN discussions and orders could generally travel by routes more secure than broadcast, such as courier or direct delivery by an IJN vessel. Publicly available accounts differ, but the most credible agree that the JN-25 version in use before December 1941 was not more than perhaps 10% broken {{at the time of}} the attack, and that primarily in stripping away its <b>superencipherment.</b> JN-25 traffic increased immensely with the outbreak of naval warfare at the end of 1941 and provided the cryptographic [...] "depth" [...] needed to succeed in substantially breaking the existing and subsequent versions of JN-25.|$|E
