5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the cave of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in the <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> {{significantly more likely to}} meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E

30|$|Twenty <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from different sandstone sources (Missouri sandstone, Roubidoux sandstone, and Berea sandstone). The length (L) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm) and the diameter (d) of all <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> 1.5 in. (3.7  cm). To {{make sure that}} the dimensions of all <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> exact, a caliper was used to measure the core length and diameter. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed in an oven at 120  °C for 24  h. After that, the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> evacuated and then saturated to 100  % with brines of chosen concentrations.|$|R
30|$|Twenty-six {{brown algae}} <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} during October and November, 2014. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from the}} fringing reefs area with transect at c. 50  m and depth {{in the range of}} 50 – 150  cm. Four species including Turbinaria sp., Sargassum sp., Cystoseira sp. and Padina sp. <b>were</b> identified. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in polyethylene bottles until transferring to laboratory. <b>Samples</b> <b>were</b> then flushed by seawater that was collected from the relevant locations. The soft parts in algae <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> separated and oven-dried at 105  °C. Dried <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> crushed to fine powder for treatment.|$|R
30|$|In Oman, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from 4 governorates: Musandam, Batinah North, Dakhilya, and Dhahira (Fig.  6). At least 15 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} 5 farms in each governorate. Lime leaf <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> also collected from 6 farms in Al-Ain (UAE) in March 2013. In addition, <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from Hormozgan and Kerman (Iran) (Fig.  6). At least 20 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected from each country.

25|$|As in any {{longitudinal}} study, it {{is possible}} that the characteristics and behaviors of the sample are a partial result of the era they lived in. Indeed, many members of the sample could not attend college, due to the Great Depression and World War II. Almost half of women in the <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> homemakers for most of their lives. Despite these shortcomings, the data from the sample is often used for studies because there is no other group of people who have been followed for so long.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, Egypt's Baseera, the Centre for Public Opinion Research, {{said in a}} poll {{result that}} only eight percent of the <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> unhappy with El-Sisi's {{performance}} and {{ten percent of the}} sample said they could not identify their position. The poll showed that 78 percent of the sample said they would vote for Sisi should the presidential elections be held again the next day while 11 percent said they would not. Eighty-nine percent said that there was improvement in the security situation after Sisi's taking office. Seventy-three percent said that fuel has become regularly available since Sisi's election. Meanwhile, 35 percent of respondents believed price controls had improved, while 32 percent believed that they have become worse. Twenty-nine percent of the respondents did not see any change, and three percent were undecided.|$|E

30|$|At 4 tile {{drainage}} (TD) and 5 river sites (Ri), <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken weekly or biweekly from March to July 2013. A total of 40 {{tile drainage}} and 63 river <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed. At each site and on every sampling date, {{the volume of}} diatom <b>samples</b> <b>was</b> determined and <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> filtered through a 20 -µm plankton net. The retained organisms were transferred into 50 -mL glass bottles and fixed in 5 ‰ non-acetic Lugol’s iodine solution [42]. After 48  h, the supernatant liquid of undisturbed <b>samples</b> <b>is</b> carefully removed and <b>samples</b> <b>are</b> thus concentrated to 30  mL for further processing.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sampling</b> <b>was</b> {{done during}} two periods in April/May 2014 (on-set of rainy season) and November/December 2014 (on-set of dry season) {{from the various}} {{locations}} indicated above. Depth integrated water <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected over bridges and preserved at about pH 2 with conc. HNO 3, whilst sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected through coring with a PVC tube. Two water and sediment <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> taken from each location. The fish <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> collected using dragnet and stored in an ice chest at 4  °C and transported to the laboratory. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> later identified in the laboratory and prepared for analysis.|$|R
500|$|Before {{the writing}} of [...] "S.R. 819", the writers for The X-Files felt that the {{character}} of Walter Skinner was becoming too [...] "expendable". John Shiban, the writer of the episode, decided to re-work Skinner back into the series' mythology by crafting the episode around him. Mitch Pileggi had to endure long bouts of make-up application, a process that he admitted he [...] "hated". The nanobots in the blood <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> designed on a computer and then rendered for the final footage.|$|E
500|$|The {{array of}} {{equipment}} needed to measure light energy reaching beyond the visible spectrum towards the ultraviolet could cost a laboratory {{as much as}} $3,000, a huge amount in 1940. Repeated readings of a <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> taken to produce photographic plates showing [...] the absorption spectrum of a material at different wavelengths. An experienced human could compare these to the known images to identify a match. Then information from the plates had to be combined to create a graph showing the spectrum as a whole. Ultimately, the accuracy of such approaches was dependent on accurate, consistent development of the photographic plates, and on human visual acuity and practice in reading the wavelengths.|$|E

Hipposideros, the genus to which H.besaoka is assigned, contains the living species Hipposideros commersoni from Madagascar, among many others. The specific name besaoka is the Malagasy for [...] "big chin". The material of H.besaoka is from locality TW-10 within the cave and is about 10,000 years old or younger. A cladistic analysis using morphological data suggests that H.besaoka is most closely related to the mainland African H.gigas and H.vittatus, previously included in H.commersoni, and somewhat more distantly to H.commersoni itself.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{contaminated}} pistachio <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared in}} closed package. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> analyzed before treatment. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> placed between the electrodes and then {{exposed to the}} plasma at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18  min. After plasma exposure, the treated <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> transferred for fungal analysis, each treatment was repeated thrice.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} six and half years, 862 {{different}} clinical samples [sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, thorax puncture, cerebrospinal fluid and skin samples] were tested by Gen-probe amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test (MTD) or ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 239 parallel clinical <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> cultivated, and some <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> stained with Ziehl-Neelsen staining. 1 - 4 <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> tested per patient. 29 (12. 13 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive and 177 (74. 05 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> negative with both cultivation and molecular genetic methods. 2 (0. 83 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only on cultivation, and 31 (12. 97 %) <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> positive only with the molecular diagnostic methods. The differences are undoubtedly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} molecular diagnostic methods...|$|R
30|$|The PVC biofilm <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} from four different regions located {{in and around}} Tirupati (Chittoor District), Andhra Pradesh, India. The <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> {{collected from}} drinking water supply PVC pipelines and stored in plastic bottles. The collected <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> in amorphous form. These <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> stored in an ice box and transported for further microbiological characterization analysis.|$|R
500|$|The {{sample holder}} {{held up to}} 4 cells. Cells could be moved into the light path via an {{external}} control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment. As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> made in comparison to a blank, or standard, [...] "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent." [...] The standard could be a cell filled with a solvent such as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration. At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, transmittance, to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to absorbance which {{is proportional to the}} solute concentration according to Beer's law. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.|$|E
500|$|Pileggi had {{to endure}} long bouts of make-up application. To create the {{principal}} illusion of monstrous veins, long black faux-veins were glued onto his face, arms, and torso. Pileggi, who had {{had to endure}} little to no make-up during the early seasons, noted that, [...] "They did a beautiful job and [...] looked awesome, but man, I hated it! I really don't know how those guys on Star Trek or Babylon 5 can stand having that done to them every day. I just wouldn't work if that's what it took". To show the nanobot infection progressing, special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich used two different make-up sets. The two sets were then mixed together electronically in post-production to give the effect of disease progression. The nanobots in the blood <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> designed on a computer and then cloned with an animation program. Composer Mark Snow's score for the episode was inspired by Daniel Sackheim's [...] "big-time feature-like action".|$|E
500|$|Carey {{worked with}} {{producer}} Puff Daddy {{to create the}} official remix, the Bad Boy remix of [...] "Fantasy". While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy." [...] They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. Finally, the Bad Boy remix used guest raps from O.D.B and background vocals by Puff Daddy. Some of the song's R elements were removed for the remix, while the bassline and [...] "Genius of Love" [...] <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> emphasized & the bridge from the original version {{was used as the}} chorus. There is a version omitting Ol' Dirty Bastard's verses. The [...] "Bad Boy Fantasy Remix", combines the chorus from the original version and the chorus of the Bad Boy Remix together, removing Ol' Dirty Bastard's vocals from his 2nd verse. Carey re-recorded vocals for club remixes of the song by David Morales, titled [...] "Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix)." [...] The Bad Boy remix garnered positive reviews from music critics. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised the song, claiming its one of the few tracks where Carey [...] "defines herself." [...] Additionally, he complimented the song, writing [...] "At her best, as she is on this clipped, spunky track, Carey is a disco diva for the '90s, a worthy successor to trailblazing women like Donna Summer and Vicki Sue Robinson, R singers with an affinity for the endless groove. Disco? No wonder most rock critics can't get behind her. Party on, Mariah." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 178m2Hf has {{the highest}} {{excitation}} energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One gram of pure 178m2Hf contains approximately 1330 megajoules of energy, the equivalent in about 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of the explosive TNT. The half-life of 178m2Hf is 31 years or 1 Gs (gigasecond, 1,000,000,000 seconds) so that a gram's natural radioactivity is 1.6 TBq (terabecquerels) or roughly 40 Ci (curies). The activity is in a cascade of penetrating gamma rays, the most energetic of which is 0.574 MeV. Substantial shielding would be needed for human safety if the <b>sample</b> <b>were</b> to be 1 gram of the pure isomer. However, so far the nuclear isomer exists only at low concentrations (<0.1%), within multi-isotopic hafnium.

One is a discussion of a news article about a U.S. drone strike operation. The second, he said, either referred to classified material or else was [...] "parallel reporting" [...] of open-source intelligence, which would also be classified. Clinton's presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the letter, and questioned whether the emails had been over-classified by an arbitrary process. According to an unnamed source, a secondary review by the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency endorsed the earlier inspectors general findings concluding that the emails (one of which concerned North Korea's nuclear weapons program) were [...] "Top Secret" [...] when received by Clinton through her private server in 2009 and 2011, a conclusion also disputed by the Clinton campaign.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between cluster sampling and stratified <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> that in cluster <b>sampling</b> the cluster <b>is</b> treated as the sampling unit so <b>sampling</b> <b>is</b> {{done on a}} population of clusters (at least in the first stage).
