Announced in December 1956 and released around March 1957, the Eldorado Brougham was a hand-built, limited car derived from the Park Avenue and Orleans show cars of 1953-54. Designed by Ed Glowacke, it featured the first appearance of quad headlights and totally unique trim.

Tail styling treatments followed the Eldorado pattern. This four-door hardtop with rear-hinged rear doors was an ultra-luxury car that cost an astonishing $13,074—twice the price of any other 1957 Eldorado and more than the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud of the same year.

40|$|In Hong Kong, high {{strength}} concrete {{has been in}} use {{for several years and}} the highest strength concrete used in actual construction has already reached Grade 100. Nowadays, the production of {{high strength}} concrete no longer presents much difficulties. However, there is the common problem that the high strength concretes are generally more difficult to compact. It is, therefore, desirable to have high strength concretes which have not only high strength but also high workability. In the present study, several high strength concrete mixes, which are so workable that they are in effect <b>self</b> <b>leveling,</b> are developed. Only locally available materials are used in the trial mixing and thus the mixes are specifically developed for use in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the mixes may also be used as starting points for development of high strength <b>self</b> <b>leveling</b> concrete in other places. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} low {{bleed water}} CLSM mix was field tested on May 13, 1997 at the Throop portable auger batching plant. Production and pumping tests were very successful.

40|$|Concrete floors {{can develop}} faults over time {{which can cause}} damage thus {{hindering}} smooth transportation, industrial aspects and some residential drawbacks. In addition, flaws and cracks are known to progress into more serious damage with time and use. <b>Self</b> <b>leveling</b> mortar has been used on a relatively limited scale worldwide to allow for more even, higher performance and easy-to-apply flooring. However, {{there has been little}} information available with respect to their use and best practices. The primary focus of this work is to prepare mortar that possesses self-levelling flow characteristics. Hence, several mixtures have been designed using various constituents with moderate 28 -day strength of 35 MPa. Chemical and mineral admixtures have been incorporated together with limestone to enhance the flow and cohesiveness as well as improve performance. The results reveal that self-levelling mortar can be successfully produced with comparable properties to ready-to-use market product. These mixtures were evaluated to have both performance and economic merits...|$|E
40|$|Foamed {{aggregate}} {{is a novel}} controlled density material {{developed for}} road construction on peat. This paper reports recent findings of the mix design and test method of pervious concrete. The high porosity allows water to pass through it, thereby allowing the recharging of water into designated retention ponds. Road on peat {{are designed to be}} above the most frequent flood levels. The water permeability of the concrete was determined with constant head water permeability test. The study is to establish an economical method for construction on problematic soils. The proprietary foamed aggregate of density between 900 kg/m 3 - 1200 kg/m 3 was experimented. Since controlled density foamed aggregate is designed to co-exist with peat, a more durable road with less maintenance is expected. The <b>self</b> <b>leveling</b> foamed concrete of density about 1200 kg/m 3 is to be placed on the foamed aggregate with tyres and geosynthetics as a special provision for lateral restraint. It is hoped that more intensified research into the exploitation of used tyres for sustainable construction on problematic soil will lead to improved quality of life and conservation of the environment...|$|E
40|$|Joint seismologi al and {{deformation}} {{studies are}} a mighty tool {{to study the}} dynami s of mag-mati systems at a tive vol anoes. While GPS measurements and InSAR are su essfully applied at onshore vol anoes, the monitoring of submarine vol anoes is mostly restri ted to island based or temporary seismologi al measurements. We therefor developed a free fall, <b>self</b> <b>leveling</b> O ean Bottom Tiltmeter (OBT) to observe ground deformation on the seaoor, using a two omponent tilt sensor with a resolution of about 15 nrad.

40|$|A growing {{population}} is driving automatization in agricultural industry {{to strive for}} more productive arable land. Being part of this process, this work is aimed to investigate the possibility to implement sensor-based automation in a particular system called Front End Loader, which is a lifting arms that is commonly mounted {{on the front of}} a tractor. Two main tasks are considered here, namely Electronic <b>Self</b> <b>Leveling</b> (ESL) and payload estimation. To propose commercially implementable solutions for these tasks, specific objectives are set, which are: 1) to propose a controller to perform ESL under typical disturbances 2) to propose a methodology for payload estimation considering realistic estimation conditions. Lastly, aligned with these goals, 3) to propose models for the Front End Loader under consideration for derivation of solutions of the specified tasks. The self-leveling task assists farmers in maintaining the angular position of the mounted implements, e. g. a bale handler or a bucket, with respect to the ground when the loader is manually lifted or lowered. Experimental results show that different controllers are required in lifting and lowering motions to maintain the implement's angular position with a required accuracy due to principle differences in gravity impact. The gravity helps the necessary correction in lifting motion, but works against the correction in lowering motions. This led us to propose a controller with a proportional term, a discontinuous term and an on-line disturbance estimation and compensation as well as the tuning procedure to achieve a 2 degrees tracking error for lowering motions in steady state. The proposed controller shows less sensitive performance to lowering velocity, as the main disturbance, in comparison to a linear controller. The second task, payload estimation, assists farmers to work within safety range as well as to work with a weight measurement tool. A mechanical model derived based on equations of motion is improved by a pressure based friction to sufficiently accurately represent the motion of the front end loader under consideration. The proposed model satisfies the desired estimation accuracy of 2 % full scale error in a certain estimation condition domain in constant velocity regions, with off-line calibration step and off-line payload estimation step. An on-line version of the estimation based on Recursive Least Squares also fulfills the desired accuracy, while keeping the calibration step off-line...|$|E
