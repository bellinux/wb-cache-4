5|$|Johnson offered Wollstonecraft {{work as a}} translator, {{prompting}} her {{to learn}} French and German. More importantly, Johnson provided encouragement at crucial moments during the writing of her <b>seminal</b> political treatises A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).|$|E
5|$|On stage, Dodd {{performed}} {{the role of}} Darky Morris in a 1966 J.C. Williamson stage production of Desire of the Moth, with a season of nearly three months in Melbourne and Sydney. In 1971, he appeared in an early Sydney production of Kevin Gilbert's <b>seminal</b> work, The Cherry Pickers.|$|E
5|$|The {{book is a}} {{landscape}} history of England and a <b>seminal</b> text in that discipline and in local history. The brief history of some one thousand years is widely used in local and environmental history courses.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} on black migrant workers were dramatized in African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 <b>seminal</b> novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God, her best known work and a selection on TIME magazine's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.|$|E
5|$|The self-titled debut was {{produced}} by Jack and engineered by Jim Diamond at his Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit. The album was dedicated to the <b>seminal</b> Mississippi Delta blues musician, Son House—an artist who greatly influenced Jack.|$|E
5|$|A {{scholar and}} teacher {{throughout}} his life, Priestley also {{made significant contributions}} to pedagogy, including the publication of a <b>seminal</b> work on English grammar and books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines. These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|A <b>seminal</b> work by Adam Hardy (1995) {{examined}} the Karnataka temple-building tradition {{over a period}} of 700years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Western Chalukya and Hoysala. The study covered dravida and nagara style monuments and the differences between the dravida tradition in modern Karnataka and that of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and made it possible to interpret the many architectural details {{as part of a larger}} scheme.|$|E
5|$|After this incident, Magoon {{remained}} with the Department of War. In 1902, {{his work on}} the legal foundations of the new civil governments was released to the public as a book, Reports on The Law of Civil Government in Territory Subject to Military Occupation by the Military Forces of the United States, etc. It was reprinted several times and was considered the <b>seminal</b> text on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Antestor (then called Crush Evil) existed {{prior to}} the release of Hellig Usvart but their music was a death/doom style, and was not yet musically {{considered}} black metal. During the early 1990s when the band was known as Crush Evil, Euronymous, guitarist for the <b>seminal</b> black metal band Mayhem, was planning to stop Crush Evil from continuing. However, this never took place.|$|E
5|$|As a {{legal advisor}} {{working for the}} United States Department of War, he drafted {{recommendations}} and reports that were used by Congress and the executive branch in governing the United States' new territories following the Spanish–American War. These reports were collected as a published book in 1902, then considered the <b>seminal</b> work on the subject. During his time as a governor, Magoon worked to put these recommendations into practice.|$|E
5|$|Colt set up {{libraries}} and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were <b>seminal</b> training grounds for {{several generations of}} toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century. Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt, Amos Whitney, Henry Leland, Edward Bullard, Worcester R. Warner, Charles Brinckerhoff Richards, William Mason and Ambrose Swasey.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Italian {{director}} Luchino Visconti adapted Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Ossessione (1943), regarded both {{as one of}} {{the great}} noirs and a <b>seminal</b> film in the development of neorealism. (This was not even the first screen version of Cain's novel, having been preceded by the French Le Dernier Tournant in 1939.) In Japan, the celebrated Akira Kurosawa directed several films recognizable as film noirs, including Drunken Angel (1948), Stray Dog (1949), The Bad Sleep Well (1960), and High and Low (1963).|$|E
5|$|Euler {{worked in}} almost all areas of mathematics, such as geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory, as well as {{continuum}} physics, lunar theory and other areas of physics. He is a <b>seminal</b> figure {{in the history of}} mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes. Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the <b>seminal</b> vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The <b>seminal</b> vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|He was {{included}} in the <b>seminal</b> volume of poetry of the Négritude movement, Léopold Senghor's Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie negre et malgache ("Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry"), published in 1948. He has inspired many Malagasy writers and poets after him, including Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 and 1997, he and {{his wife}} Ann Shulgin {{authored}} the books PIHKAL and TIHKAL (standing for Phenethylamines and Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved), which extensively described their work and personal experiences with these two classes of psychoactive drugs. Shulgin performed <b>seminal</b> work into the descriptive synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of Shulgin's noteworthy discoveries include compounds of the 2C* family (such as 2C-B) and compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM).|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of humanities, arts, and social sciences, MIT economists have been awarded five Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals. Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle {{authored}} <b>seminal</b> texts on generative grammar and phonology. The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research, has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} epoch (1907–19), Noether dealt {{primarily}} with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, {{and her work}} became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted {{with the work of}} David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her <b>seminal</b> work for physics, the two Noether's theorems.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, J. D. Salinger {{was himself}} drawn to Sufi mysticism through {{the writer and}} thinker Idries Shah's <b>seminal</b> work The Sufis, as were others writers such as Doris Lessing and Geoffrey Grigson, and the poets Robert Graves and Ted Hughes. As well as Idries Shah, Salinger also read the Taoist philosopher Lao Tse and the Hindu Swami Vivekananda who {{introduced}} the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, Mary Anne Hobbs invited Cyrus, Starkey, Oneman, DJ Chef, Silkie, Quest, Joker, Nomad, Kulture and MC Sgt Pokes to the BBC's Maida Vale studios for a show called Generation Bass. The show was the {{evolution}} from her <b>seminal</b> BBC Radio 1 Dubstepwarz Show in 2006, and further documented another set of dubstep's producers.|$|E
5|$|Professor Bernard Quatermass {{was created}} by Manx writer Nigel Kneale in 1953 for the serial The Quatermass Experiment. Its success led to two sequels, Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958). These three Quatermass serials are seen today as <b>seminal</b> nineteen-fifties {{television}} productions. Kneale, however, became disenchanted with the BBC and went freelance in the late nineteen-fifties, producing scripts for Hammer Films and Associated Television.|$|E
5|$|Soundgarden {{was one of}} the <b>seminal</b> {{creators of}} grunge, a style of {{alternative}} rock that developed in Seattle, and was {{one of a number of}} grunge bands signed to the record label Sub Pop. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label (A Records in 1989), though the band did not achieve commercial success until they popularized the genre in the early 1990s with Seattle contemporaries Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice in Chains.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{of mammals}} in Canada hearken {{back to the}} 1795 {{northern}} explorations of Samuel Hearne, whose account is considered surprisingly accurate. The first <b>seminal</b> work on Canadian mammals, however, was John Richardson's 1829 Fauna Boreali-Americana. Joseph Burr Tyrrell {{was the first to}} attempt to produce, in 1888, a comprehensive list of Canadian mammalian species. Ernest Thompson Seton and Charles-Eusèbe Dionne's work were also important. Modern Canadian publications with interest in mammalogy include The Canadian Field Naturalist, the Canadian Journal of Zoology and the French-language Le Naturaliste Canadien.|$|E
5|$|The case {{became known}} as Pierce v. Society of Sisters, a <b>seminal</b> United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that significantly expanded coverage of the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, {{had the authority to}} educate children as they thought best. It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} plant genera vary widely from those {{containing}} {{a single species}} to genera containing thousands of species, and this disparity became clear early {{in the history of}} plant classification. The largest genus in Carl Linnaeus' <b>seminal</b> Species Plantarum was Euphorbia, with 56 species; Linnaeus believed that no genus should contain more than 100 species.|$|E
5|$|This passage {{was used}} in Britain by Lord Atkin in his dissenting {{judgement}} in the <b>seminal</b> case Liversidge v. Anderson (1942), where he protested about the distortion of a statute {{by the majority of}} the House of Lords. It also became a popular citation in United States legal opinions, appearing in 250 judicial decisions in the Westlaw database , including two Supreme Court cases (TVA v. Hill and Zschernig v. Miller).|$|E
5|$|With {{the repeal}} of Prohibition, the Black Cat re-opened in 1933 at 710 Montgomery Street, again under Ridley's proprietorship. Sol Stoumen bought the bar in the 1940s. In {{the early years of}} Stoumen's ownership, the Black Cat was a center for the bohemian and Beat crowd. William Saroyan and John Steinbeck were known to {{frequent}} the establishment, and part of Jack Kerouac's <b>seminal</b> Beat novel On the Road is set in the bar.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a <b>seminal</b> paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Canon William Lummis, MC, was a {{military}} historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders. This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an authoritative source on these matters. However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged David Harvey to continue it. The result was Harvey's <b>seminal</b> book Monuments to Courage. In 2007 the Royal Mail used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross recipients.|$|E
5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, a <b>seminal</b> {{document}} on {{the ethics}} of medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E
5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes are closed, his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of <b>seminal</b> importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seminal</b> vesiculitis (also {{known as}} spermatocystitis) is an {{inflammation}} of the <b>seminal</b> vesicles, most often caused by bacterial infection. Symptoms of <b>seminal</b> vesiculitis can include vague back or lower abdominal pain; penile, scrotal, or perineal pain; painful ejaculation; hematospermia; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.|$|E
25|$|Disorders of the <b>seminal</b> vesicles include <b>seminal</b> vesiculitis, {{acquired}} cysts, abscess, congenital anomalies (such as agenesis, hypoplasia and cysts), amyloidosis, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, hydatid cyst, calculi (stones) and tumours.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{and maintenance of}} the <b>seminal</b> vesicles, {{as well as their}} secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. The <b>seminal</b> vesicles contain 5α-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The <b>seminal</b> vesicles have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{adenocarcinoma}} of the <b>seminal</b> vesicles, although rare, {{constitutes the}} most common neoplasm of the <b>seminal</b> vesicles; even rarer neoplasms include sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, neuroendocrine carcinoma, paraganglioma, epithelial stromal tumors and lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that sperm {{expelled}} together with <b>seminal</b> vesicular fluid show poor motility and survival, and the sperm chromatin is less protected. Therefore, the exact physiological importance of <b>seminal</b> vesicular fluid is not clear.|$|E
