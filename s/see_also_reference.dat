40|$|Recent {{studies of}} two {{newcomers}} to the TNF cytokine family have revealed an unsuspected link between autoimmunity and cancer. In this issue, Rennert et. al. (1) define the specific receptors for the orphan ligand known as APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), which was previously recognized for its growth stimulating activity for tumors of lymphoid, colon, and thyroid origin (2). APRIL binds cell surface receptors B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>reference</b> 3); a soluble decoy form of BCMA that antagonizes APRIL’s activity inhibits the growth of tumors that naturally overexpress APRIL. What makes this observation biologically intriguing {{is that the two}} receptors, BCMA and TACI, were just very recently recognized as receptors for another TNF family member...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Using an {{antibody}} specific for {{creatine phosphokinase}} (CPK), {{we have discovered}} an association between that enzyme and the cytoskeleton. Immunofluorescence observations show that CPK is associated with intermediate filaments in PTK cells and BALB/ 3 T 3 cells. The CPK distribution also follows intermediate filaments when cells are treated with colchicine. Intermediate (10 -nm) filaments, microtubules, and actin filaments in the cytoplasm of cells contribute to a fibrous network known as the cytoskeleton. The role of microtubules in maintaining cell shape (10) and in organizing components of the cytoplasm (3, 7, 23) has been demonstrated in many systems (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>reference</b> 28 for review). Intermediate filaments have been receiving increasing attention recently and {{are considered to be}} an integral part of the cytoskeleton as well. The distribution of these filaments has been determined in cultured cells by immunocytochemical methods (19) as well as in cytoskeleton models prepared by extraction with Triton X- 100 (2, 25) ...|$|E
40|$|The human NADPH oxidase {{is a very}} {{intriguing}} enzyme; {{although its}} catalytic unit is retained within cytochrome b 558, various additional proteins are required for activity of the NADPH oxidase. In {{the past few years}} substantial progress has been made to elucidate the protein-protein interactions and the activation events involved. The following facts have become evident: (1) activation of rac and subsequent interaction with p 67 -phox is crucial for the interaction of p 67 -phox with cytochrome b 558, and probably with gp 91 -phox; (2) p 47 -phox interacts with p 22 -phox, and phosphorylation of 379 Ser of p 47 -phox is obligatory for this event; (3) p 47 -phox and p 67 -phox regulate each other's translocation in a positive sense (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>reference</b> 71). To put it differently: it is vital to gain insight in the intrigues within the phox family and associated characters to fully understand NADPH oxidase activatio...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a simplistic model of spacetime foam (a gas of wormholes) and explicitly demonstrate {{the origin of}} the topological bias. In particular, we demonstrate how the gas of wormholes generates dark matter. As it was demonstrated in Ref. [1] (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>reference</b> therein) all the variety of dark matter phenomena can be easily attributed to a foam-like topological structure of space. A general foamed Universe can be viewed as the standard Friedman model filled with a gas of wormholes. In the present paper we consider the most simple example of a single wormhole and demonstrate how it produces DM effects. We note that exact models of the spacetime foam have been already considered in the literature (e. g., see Ref. [2] and references therein where also other topological defects were considered). However the primary interest was there focused on setting observational bounds on the foam-like structure at extremely small scales � 103 Lpl(where Lpl is the Planck length), while DM phenomena suggest that the characteristic scale of the spacetime foam (and respectivel...|$|E
40|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of infectious disease precipitin and agglutinin reactions have assisted {{in the identification of}} the invading organism, when the patient's serum has been tested with suspected organisms or when antigenic material from the patient (1) has been tested against antisera. Agglutination has been used also in the quantitative determination of the antibody in antityphoid and antimeningococcus sera. For the standardization of diphtheria antitoxin Ramon (2; <b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>reference</b> 3) suggested a test-tube method based on the formation of a floceulent precipitate when toxin and antitoxin were combined in definite proportions. The present paper records investigations concerning the parallelism of the precipitin with the protective antibody in antipneumococcus sera. The quantitative determination of antibody in antipneumococcus sera is based on the relative reactivity of the precipitin and the protective antibody; the question of their identity is not raised. Agglutination tests in pneumonia require the use of uniform cultures; they thus share with the animal protection test the disadvantage of possible biological irregularities. Precipitin tests, however, are carried out with a reproducible non-cellular antigen of a definite chemical composition. * This investigation was carried out by means of the Lucius N.

40|$|The antigens {{encoded in}} the HLA-D {{region of the}} human major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) 1 were originally defined with homozygous typing cells by mixed leukocyte culture and, subsequently, by use of human alloantisera reacting with antigens selectively expressed on B cells (1, 2). These antigens were later shown to be the human equivalents of the murine Ia molecules. The major serologically defined specificities, called DR, {{were found to be}} closely associated with the specificities defined by HTCs. Later, the development of ailoantisera permitted identification of additional serologic specificities such as DC, MB, MT, and Te (3 - 8) which are not associated with a single DR specificity but, instead, are found associated with two or more DR alleles and are, therefore, called supertypic. For example, MT 2 is usually found on DR 3 -, DR 5 -, DRw 6 -, or DRw 8 -bearing cells while MT 3 is usually found on cells from DR 4 -, DR 7 -, or DRwg-positive donors. The apparent equivalence of terms used by different investigators is shown in Table I (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> <b>reference</b> 3).
