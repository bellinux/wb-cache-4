Graffiti improved usability by defining a set of [...] "unistrokes", or one-stroke forms, for each character. This narrowed the possibility for erroneous input, although memorization of the stroke patterns did increase the learning curve for the user. The Graffiti handwriting recognition was found to infringe on a patent held by Xerox, and Palm replaced Graffiti with a licensed version of the CIC handwriting recognition which, while also supporting unistroke forms, pre-dated the Xerox patent. The court finding of infringement was reversed on appeal, and then reversed again on a later appeal. The parties involved subsequently negotiated a <b>settlement</b> <b>concerning</b> this and other patents Graffiti (Palm OS).|$|R

Optimal capacity levels are determined for both peak and off-peak hours. Subsequently, a work force policy is obtained through the utilization of a mathematical program. The research suggests that significant savings may accrue through the implementation of a decision support system which may be developed from the models presented. ...|$|R

We evaluate alternative regimes of pricing and investment, i. e., free access (e. g., public road), pricing and investment by two governments, and private operation. Comparisons between free-access and other regimes reveal that pricing plays a positive role of encouraging investment. However, pricing by governments results in lower welfare since excessively high prices are charged. We also show that higher welfare could be attained by elaborating the design of bidding systems {{for the right to}} build and operate the infrastructure. ...|$|R

Because of this, the EU refers to the country only by the provisional appellation [...] "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" [...] (FYRoM). The resolution of the name issue has become a precondition for accession, since Greece has repeatedly confirmed it would use its right to block accession without a prior <b>settlement.</b> <b>Concerns</b> over the country's difficulties in reaching European standards on {{the rule of law}} and the economy and over violence and irregularities in the 2008 parliamentary elections have also cast doubts on the country's candidacy.
