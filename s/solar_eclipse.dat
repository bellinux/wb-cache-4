5|$|The next <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> (Partial) {{will occur}} on February 15, 2018; the last <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> (Total) {{occurred}} on August 21, 2017.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the longest}} {{duration}} {{in which the}} moon completely covered the sun, known as totality, was during the <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of July 22, 2009. This total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> had a maximum duration of 6 minutes and 39 seconds. The longest possible duration of a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> is 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The longest annular <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of the 21st century took place on January 15, 2010, {{with a duration of}} 11 minutes and 8 seconds. The maximum possible duration is 12 minutes and 29 seconds. The eclipse of May 20, 2050, will be the second hybrid eclipse in the span of less than one year, the first one being on November 25, 2049.|$|E
5|$|Concorde 001 was {{modified}} with rooftop portholes {{for use on}} the 1973 <b>Solar</b> <b>Eclipse</b> mission and equipped with observation instruments. It performed the longest observation of a <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> to date, about 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Between two {{and five}} <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> occur every year, {{with at least}} one per eclipse season. Since the Gregorian {{calendar}} was instituted in 1582, years that have had five <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> were 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935. The next occurrence will be 2206. On average, there are about 240 <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> each century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> {{starting}} {{near and}} within the polar areas has only partial <b>eclipses</b> while <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> starting at or within the equator has only total eclipses.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Jupiter, Saturn has a {{moderate}} axial tilt of 26.7 degrees. This means that <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> on Saturn {{are much more}} rare than <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> on Jupiter.|$|R
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a <b>Solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a <b>Solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a <b>Solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{telescopic}} observation {{of a total}} <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> was made in France in 1706. Nine years later, English astronomer Edmund Halley accurately predicted and observed the <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of May 3, 1715. By the mid-19th century, scientific understanding of the Sun was improving through observations of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses. The corona was identified {{as part of the}} Sun's atmosphere in 1842, and the first photograph (or daguerreotype) of a total eclipse was taken of the <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of July 28, 1851. Spectroscope observations were made of the <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of August 18, 1868, which helped to determine the chemical composition of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The simultaneous occurrence of a <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> occurring during a transit of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232. The last time a <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> occurred during a transit of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse,</b> which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
50|$|A {{lunar eclipse}} will be preceded and {{followed}} by <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> by 9 years and 5.5 days (a half saros). This lunar eclipse is related to two annular <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> of <b>solar</b> saros 134.|$|R
50|$|Svarbhānu or Swarbhanu (Sanskrit: स्वरभानु, lit. Splendour of Radiance) is a Hindu Asura (demon) {{traditionally}} {{held responsible}} for <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> in Vedic mythology. The name is also used as an attribute of the demon Rahu in Puranic mythology, who is also connected to <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Planetary eclipse (not {{common to}} be called as an Earthly eclipse) - the {{opposite}} of the <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> on the Moon where the shadows of the Moon block the view of the Sun on Earth making it a planetary eclipse, on Earth, they are <b>Solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{sometimes}} made special flights for demonstrations, air shows (such as the Farnborough, Paris-LeBourget and MAKS air shows) {{as well as}} parades and celebrations (for example, of Zürich airport's {{anniversary in}} 1998). The aircraft were also used for private charters (including by the President of Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko on multiple occasions), for advertising companies (including for the firm OKI), for Olympic torch relays (1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville) and for observing solar eclipses, including the <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of June 30, 1973 and again for the total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> on August 11, 1999.|$|E
5|$|During a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse,</b> the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
50|$|Babylonians {{were keeping}} {{a record of}} <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses,</b> with the oldest record {{originating}} from the ancient city of Ugarit, in modern-day Syria. This record dates to about 1300 BC. Ancient Chinese astronomers were also observing solar phenomena (such as <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> and visible sunspots) {{with the purpose of}} keeping track of calendars, which were based on lunar and solar cycles. Unfortunately, records kept before 720 BC are very vague and offer no useful information. However, after 720 BC, 37 <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> were noted over the course of 240 years.|$|R
25|$|Saros {{series are}} {{numbered}} {{according to the}} type of <b>eclipse</b> (<b>solar</b> or lunar) and whether they occur at the Moon's ascending or descending node. Odd numbers are used for <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses</b> occurring near the ascending node, whereas even numbers are given to descending node <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses.</b> For lunar eclipses, this numbering scheme is somewhat random. The ordering of these series is determined by the time at which each series peaks, which corresponds to when an eclipse is closest to one of the lunar nodes. For <b>solar</b> <b>eclipses,</b> the 40 series numbered between 117 and 156 are active, whereas for lunar eclipses, there are now 41 active saros series.|$|R

5|$|A recent {{published}} observation {{during the}} 1997 <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> by Wang et al. suggested a possible gravitational shielding effect, which generated debate. Later in 2002, Yang and Wang published detailed data analysis, which {{suggested that the}} phenomenon still remains unexplained.|$|E
5|$|During a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse,</b> {{when the}} disk of the Sun {{is covered by}} that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's {{surrounding}} atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse,</b> in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized {{that there may be a}} planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse.</b> No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E

5|$|Several {{stars in}} Hyades cluster include Kappa Tauri were photographed during <b>Solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> of May 29, 1919 by the {{expedition}} of Arthur Eddington in Príncipe {{and others in}} Sobral, Brazil that confirmed Albert Einstein's prediction of the bending of light around the Sun from his {{general theory of relativity}} which he published in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse.</b> It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total <b>solar</b> <b>eclipse</b> {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
