40|$|Platelet {{transfusion}} after acute spontaneous primary intracerebral haemorrhage {{in people}} taking antiplatelet therapy might reduce death or dependence {{by reducing the}} extent of the haemorrhage. We aimed to investigate whether platelet transfusion with standard care, compared with standard care alone, reduced death or dependence after intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy use. We did this multicentre, open-label, masked-endpoint, randomised trial at 60 hospitals in the Netherlands, UK, and France. We enrolled adults within 6 h of supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage symptom onset if they had used antiplatelet therapy for at least 7 days beforehand and had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least 8. With use of a secure web-based system that concealed allocation and used biased coin randomisation, study collaborators randomly assigned participants (1 : 1; stratified by hospital and type of antiplatelet therapy) to receive either standard care or standard care with platelet transfusion within 90 min of diagnostic brain imaging. Participants and local investigators giving interventions were not masked to treatment allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors and investigators analysing data. The primary outcome was shift towards death or dependence rated on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months, and analysed by ordinal logistic regression, adjusted for stratification variables and the Intracerebral Haemorrhage Score. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat and as-treated populations. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR 1303, and is now closed. Between Feb 4, 2009, and Oct 8, 2015, 41 sites enrolled 190 participants. 97 participants were randomly assigned to platelet transfusion and 93 to standard care. The odds of death or dependence at 3 months were higher in the platelet transfusion group than in the standard care group (adjusted common odds ratio 2 · 05, 95 % CI 1 · 18 - 3 · 56; p= 0 · 0114). 40 (42 %) participants who received platelet transfusion had a serious adverse event during their hospital stay, as did 28 (29 %) who received standard care. 23 (24 %) participants assigned to platelet transfusion and 16 (17 %) assigned to standard care died during hospital stay. Platelet transfusion seems inferior to standard care for people taking antiplatelet therapy before intracerebral haemorrhage. Platelet transfusion cannot be recommended for this indication in clinical practice.

A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms was <b>supplied,</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray taken and simple spirometry tests made. Thirty-nine subjects reported attacks of breathlessness associated with fever after exposure to mouldy hay; thirty-six had a clinical history of farmer's lung and X-ray and/or respiratory function changes indicative of chronic farmer's lung; 113 were classified as having bronchial asthma. These 118 subjects and {{a random sample of}} 131 non-symptomatic subjects were examined by intracutaneous skin tests and double diffusion precipitation tests with antigens associated with farmer's lung. All sera positive by precipitation were examined by immunoelectrophoresis, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and C 1 q binding test, and Bovine conglutinin test in solid phase for the detection of circulating immunocomplexes. 27. 8 % cases of chronic farmer's lung, 4. 4 % of cases of bronchial asthma and 2. 3 % of non-symptomatic subjects showed precipitating antibodies against farmer's lung antigens. Of the precipitin-positive subjects, the majority had precipitating antibodies against Micropolyspora faeni. No differences in immunoelectrophoregrams in number and pattern of precipitation arcs for M. faeni were found between chronic farmer's lung and bronchial asthma subjects. Circulating immune complexes were present in 50 % of chronic farmer's lung patients, 40 % of those with bronchial asthma and 33. 3 % of non-symptomatic subjects. Three farmer's lung subjects (9. 3 %) showed immediate skin-test reactions to rural environmental allergens...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionEmergency care is an {{essential}} component of health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We sought to assess the availability of resources to provide emergency care at a second-level hospital in Ghana. By doing so, deficits that could guide development of targeted intervention strategies to improve emergency care could be identified. MethodsA qualitative and quantitative assessment of capacity for care of emergency patients was performed at the Emergency Centre of the Police Hospital, a second-level hospital in Accra, Ghana. Direct inspection and job-specific survey of clinical, orderly, administrative and ambulance staff was performed. Responses to quantitative questions were described. Qualitative responses were examined by content analysis. ResultsAssessment revealed marked deficiencies in many essential items and services. However, several successes were identified, such as laboratory capacity. Among the unavailable essential items, some were of low-cost, such as basic airway <b>supplies,</b> <b>chest</b> tubes and several emergency medications. Themes from staff responses when asked how to improve emergency care included: provide periodic training, increase bed numbers in the emergency unit, ensure availability of essential items and make personal protective equipment available for all staff caring for patients. ConclusionThis study identified opportunities to improve the care of patients with emergency conditions at the Police Hospital in Ghana. Low-cost improvements in training, organization and planning could improve item and service availability, such as: developing a continuing education curriculum for staff in all areas of the emergency centre; holding in-service training on existing protocols for triage and emergency care; adding checklists to guide appropriate triage and safe transfer of patients; and perform a root cause analysis of item non-availability to develop targeted interventions...|$|R

Between 2007 and 2014, 21 patients with malignant tumors of the skin, soft tissues, ribs and sternum (sarcomas and metastases) underwent replacement of post-resection chest wall defects using the original Ti-Ni constructions.

30|$|Generally, SAPVF can {{be managed}} by embolization, {{surgical}} resection, or sometimes observation [3 – 6]. Embolization can {{be more effective in}} patients with a single or a few aberrant arteries than in those with multiple aberrant arteries. Our patient had many aberrant arteries <b>supplied</b> from the <b>chest</b> wall, which may be the reason for having to perform embolization four times. In patients such as ours who have many aberrant arteries, surgery is the treatment of choice to cure and prevent recurrence of SAPVF. However, some fistulas have an abundant blood flow. In such patients, preoperative embolization is recommended {{to reduce the risk of}} intraoperative blood loss. In our patient, although abnormal blood flow remained after embolization, surgical resection could be safely performed without any complications. Another consideration at operation is whether to use a prosthetic sheet to cover the post-resectional surface and thereby prevent re-adhesion and the recurrence of SAPVF. The optimal type of prosthetic sheet remains controversial. The oxidized regenerated cellulose sheet (SURGICEL®) shows to be reasonably well-thickened with minimal or milder adhesion than PGA sheet [10]. So, we used a PGA sheet firstly to prevent bleeding from dilated pulmonary vessels and aberrant arteries in chest wall and finally used an oxidized regenerated cellulose sheet to prevent adhesion.|$|R
