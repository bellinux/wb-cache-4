5|$|In 1760, {{one year}} after Voltaire {{published}} Candide, a sequel was published with the name Candide, ou l'optimisme, <b>seconde</b> partie. This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. Part II has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of Candide, but is almost certainly apocryphal. In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of Candide or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.|$|E

2500|$|Bourguiba {{was first}} {{admitted}} in classe de première {{thanks to the}} help of his brother Mahmoud who solicited the headmaster's secretary, Tahar Zouiten. There, Bourguiba found, with great pleasure, his old Sadiki friend, Tahar Sfar, who studied in another classe de première. Two or three weeks later, he was summoned by Tahar Zouiten who announced the decision to downgrade him to classe de <b>seconde.</b> Bourguiba stated years later: [...] "Despite the chagrin caused by this downgrade, I executed the decision. But three months later, I visited Mr. Zouiten to tell him how much I was thankful to his initiative which helped me learn new disciplines I did not master in Sadiki College. I had just discovered Mathematics. I did not learn algebra or geometry in Sadiki where we were spending our mathematics classes laughing and having fun".|$|E
2500|$|The {{anonymous}} Règles de la <b>seconde</b> rhétorique, written around 1400, lists Tapissier {{as being}} among the most famous French poets, singers, and composers of the time. Around the time this account was written, and into {{the first decade of}} the 15th century, Tapissier ran a singing school in Paris; records from the Burgundian court indicate that they sent boys there to learn to sing. The peak of development of the Burgundian court chapel was in 1404, before the death of Philip, when it surpassed in splendor the chapels of the antipope at Avignon and the king of France, and many of Tapissier's students would have contributed to this development. Further court records show that his students [...] "auditioned" [...] for John the Fearless, the new Duke of Burgundy, in 1408, and they performed at services later that same year. Tapissier was dead by August 1410, but no further details on the circumstances have emerged.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Cartier-Bresson {{published}} his book Images à la sauvette, whose English-language edition was titled The Decisive Moment. It included {{a portfolio of}} 126 of his photos from the East and the West. The book's cover was drawn by Henri Matisse. For his 4,500-word philosophical preface, Cartier-Bresson took his keynote text from the 17th century Cardinal de Retz, [...] "Il n'y a rien dans ce monde qui n'ait un moment decisif" [...] ("There is nothing {{in this world that}} does not have a decisive moment"). Cartier-Bresson applied this to his photographic style. He said: [...] "Photographier: c'est dans un même instant et en une fraction de <b>seconde</b> reconnaître un fait et l'organisation rigoureuse de formes perçues visuellement qui expriment et signifient ce fait" [...] ("To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.").|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{a family}} meeting took place {{to talk about}} the boy's future: None of his sisters-in-law was ready to finance his studies. As for his brothers, they {{considered}} him unsuccessful and considered to find him a job as a farmer or grocer's apprentice. Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: [...] "As for [...] "si" [...] Mahmoud, I had forgotten {{to tell you that the}} year I passed my certificat d'études primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de <b>seconde.</b> I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and my fear was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the cleaning woman rushed to the window and cried for help. I was severely traumatized and I still wonder today how such a scandalous treatment has not finally overcame my intelligence and thirst for knowledge [...] He had indeed redeemed himself".|$|E

40|$|Due {{to health}} {{concerns}} and legal matters, an investigation to limit phthalates esters (PEAs) in spirits is necessary. A lab still {{was used to}} perform pilot distillations according to the official method for brandy production in order to explore the repartition into the distilled fractions of each PAE. The process was divided in two steps: a première chauffe and a bonne chauffe. The former step included the cut into heads, heart and tails, while the latter into heads, brandy, <b>secondes,</b> and tails. The behaviour of each PAE during distillation was affected by its own chemical nature. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) was entirely carried over into the distillate, while bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) only partially, and diisononyl phthalate (DINP) accumulated in the stillage. During the bonne chauffe, DBP and DEHP accumulated in the <b>secondes</b> {{more than in the}} brandy. A rectification step of the <b>secondes</b> was demonstrated to considerably reduce PAEs concentration...|$|R
