40|$|Contrary to the long-received {{theory of}} FDI, {{interest}} rates or {{rates of return}} can motivate foreign direct investment (FDI) {{in concert with the}} benefits of direct ownership. Thus, access to investor capital and capital markets is a vital component of the multinational’s competitive market structure. Moreover, multinationals can use their superior financial capacity as a competitive advantage in exploiting FDI opportunities in dynamic markets. They can also mitigate higher levels of foreign business risks under dynamic conditions by shifting more financial risk to creditors in the host economy. Furthermore, the investor’s expectation of foreign business risk necessarily commands a risk premium for exposing their equity to foreign market risk. Multinationals can modify the profit maximization strategy of their foreign subsidiaries to maximize growth or profits to generate this risk premium. In this context, we investigate how foreign subsidiaries manage their capital funding, business risk, and profit strategies with a diverse sample of 8, 000 matched parents and foreign <b>subsidiary</b> <b>accounts</b> from multiple industries in 38 countries. We find that interest rates, asset prices, and expectations in capital markets {{have a significant effect on}} the capital movements of foreign subsidiaries. We also find that foreign subsidiaries mitigate their exposure to foreign business risk by modifying their capital structure and debt maturity. Further, we show how the operating strategy of foreign subsidiaries affects their preference for growth or profit maximization. We further show that superior shareholder value, which is a vital link for access to capital for funding foreign expansion in open market economies, is achieved through maintaining stability in the rate of growth and good asset utilization.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on trends in Polish {{accounting}} regulations towards harmonization process. The main aim is to present the extend in which Polish regulations follows the International Accounting Standards {{in the field of}} business combinations. These are understood as defined in the scope of IAS 22, but includes also the accounting consequences of legal mergers and acquisitions. 2000 year’s changes in accounting law in Poland, caused by the big amendment of the Accounting Act of 1994, which has introduced for the first lime the accounting rules for use of acquisition (purchase) method and pooling of interests method on the ground of legal mergers and acquisitions had influenced the parallel changes in preparation of consolidated financial statements for parent and <b>subsidiary</b> <b>accounts.</b> These aspects of business combinations legally regulated in the Accounting Act are analyzed in comparison to the IAS. According to the act declaration in article 10. 3, in cases and circumstances not covered by this act national accounting standards, and in case of theirs lack, the international accounting standards can be used. This statement is the way in into discussion whether IAS are to be treated as international accounting standards on the Polish ground and on the European Union ground in the light of last UE Commission’s Proposal fo r a Regulation o f the European Parliament and o f the Council on the application o f international accounting standards. The thesis in this article are, that - comparing to linguistic aspects of communication - avoiding the case of collapse of Esperanto - international artificial language of communication - IAS are to be internationally accepted accounting principles, even in USA, on the condition of establishing, introducing and functioning of the global society in all aspects of social, economic and political aspects. This is not the nearest future. The article is summarized in Table 1 with detail comparison of all accounting aspects of business combinations, including preparation of consolidated financial statements (group accounts) covered by IASs, Accounting Act 1994 and updated Act of 2000.

Compared to international trade relations, however, relatively {{little is known about the}} role foreign direct investment linkages play in the transmission of disturbances from one country to the next. Inspired by the micro-evidence on profit sharing within multinational corporations and within industries, we investigate for six countries whether a cross-border rent-sharing phenomenon can be identified at the macroeconomic level. The rent-sharing hypothesis implies that an increase in foreign profitability should boost wages and/or employment in the domestic economy. We find corroborative evidence for Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. US labour market conditions, by contrast, are not affected by changes in profitability in other countries, which could be explained by the still relatively modest role of foreign-owned capital in the American economy. Hence, international rent sharing might be an important aspect of global economic linkages. foreign direct investment; international rent sharing; labour markets; spillovers; economic integration...|$|R

30|$|The SSE {{required}} its listed {{firms to}} establish an IC system and disclose an IC report as of 2006. However, firm management has full discretion in releasing IC information {{due to the lack}} of minimum requirements. For example, some firms report their ICs very briefly, with a statement such as “The IC system generally met the 2006 guidelines,” whereas others provide detailed explanations of specific risk management, such as management control over <b>subsidiaries,</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable, accounts payable, etc. Some even provide an IC self-assessment with an external auditor’s attestation in the report. During our sample period, about 17.3 % of SSE-listed firms voluntarily disclosed self-assessments with an auditor’s attestation and 12.7 % only disclosed self-assessments in their IC reports. Self-assessment is important, as it reflects the board of directors’ (BoD) view of the firm’s IC system and its disclosure may make the firm legally liable. Hence, voluntary disclosure in this study refers to the circumstances when a firm voluntarily discloses self-assessment in its IC report, not just the release of the IC report as generally required by the SSE. 1 The auditor attestation reflects an auditor’s view of the firm’s self-assessment report, which can enhance the credibility of the report if the auditor agrees with the BoD on self-assessment. According to the Ministry of Finance’s (MOF) interpretation of IC standards, issued in 2010, the self-assessment and auditor attestation are of particular importance in making the IC system effective in China.|$|R
