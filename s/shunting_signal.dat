25|$|On 28 April 2006, {{trainset}} 73 collided head-on {{with two}} BLS Re 465 locomotives at Thun in Switzerland. The {{driver of the}} Swiss locomotives was unfamiliar with the new layout of the station, which had been recently changed. He did not see a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> ordering him to stop. The locomotives automatically engaged the emergency brakes when he passed the signal, but {{came to a stop}} on the same track as the approaching ICE. The ICE was travelling at a speed of 74km/h. The emergency brake slowed the train to 56km/h at the point of collision. 30 passengers and the driver of the ICE suffered minor injuries, the driver of the Swiss locomotives having jumped to safety. Both trains suffered major damage. The powerhead 401 573 had to be rebuilt using components from three damaged powerheads (401 573, 401 020 and 401 551).|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{shunting}}</b> <b>signal</b> (入換信号機, irekae shingōki) is for car shunting in sidings and car depots; it is {{not used}} for trains in operation. A <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> has a protected section, and a train can proceed past the signal under 45 kph mph (25 kph mph if the train passes a non-interlocked turnout).|$|E
50|$|A <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> {{controls}} {{low speed}} movements where provision of a main signal is not appropriate, such as moves into sidings. Clearance of a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> {{does not necessarily}} imply that the line ahead is clear of vehicles. Shunting signals are often mounted at ground level and are smaller than main signals, reflecting their status.|$|E
50|$|Stand-alone <b>shunting</b> <b>signals</b> {{have their}} posts painted gray.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> {{can protect}} {{one or more}} sets of points within a zone.|$|R
50|$|There {{are simple}} yellow light <b>shunt</b> <b>signals</b> on signal posts which authorize {{movements}} {{to the next}} obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow speed <b>shunt</b> <b>signal</b> indication and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see Hines Hill train collision) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow speed <b>shunt</b> <b>signal,</b> not meant for mainline operations.|$|R
50|$|A signal {{appendix}} (信号付属機, shingō fuzokuki) {{is attached}} to a home, starting or <b>shunting</b> <b>signal,</b> complementing its condition.|$|E
50|$|There {{may also}} be a letter m which {{specifies}} that this signal also functions as a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> (see below).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Shunting</b> <b>signal</b> {{merged into}} main signal; the pair {{on the left}} does not show a valid aspect, but all light bulbs that are mounted ...|$|E
5000|$|Dwarf signals (dvärgsignaler) {{are used}} as <b>shunting</b> <b>signals</b> and can show the {{following}} aspects: ...|$|R
5000|$|Signals {{that are}} known to {{sometimes}} be affected by bright sunlight (both main and <b>shunting</b> <b>signals).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Signals {{which are}} {{positioned}} {{on the opposite}} side of the running line in the direction of travel (both main and <b>shunting</b> <b>signals).</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{shunting}} sign (入換標識, irekae hyōshiki or—more briefly—入標, irehyō) {{is not a}} signal; therefore, its diagonal indicator is not [...] "go" [...] but [...] "open" [...] (開通, kaitsū). A shunting sign {{does not}} have a protected section. A <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> is absolute, but a shunting sign is a permissive. A train may pass a shunting sign reading [...] "stop" [...] only if the train is accompanied by a shunting staff; its locomotive displays a shunting car sign (入換動力車標識, irekae douryokusha hyōshiki)—a single red light at both ends—at night. In some systems, shunting-signal identification signs are omitted; instead, a shunting sign uses purple (instead of white) lights in a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A main signal, <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> or a Ne1 will {{be found}} at braking distance. Unless a distant signal, distant signal {{repeater}} or main signal is visible, the train driver treats this signal as [...] "Vr0 or Ks2: Expect Stop".|$|E
50|$|A {{train is}} allowed to travel under 25 kph mph—a lone {{locomotive}} may travel under 45 kph mph {{if it does not}} pass non-interlocked turnouts—under a shunting sign. A stop sign may be installed just before a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> (or sign) for safety.|$|E
25|$|Subsidiary {{signals are}} those which usually control only {{shunting}} moves, {{as opposed to}} train movements. Under this category come permissive <b>signals</b> and <b>shunting</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>shunting</b> <b>signals,</b> dwarf signals protect paths and are interlocked. Points in zones equipped with dwarf signals {{do not have}} points indicators.|$|R
50|$|Subsidiary {{signals are}} those which usually control only {{shunting}} moves, {{as opposed to}} train movements. Under this category come permissive <b>signals</b> and <b>shunting</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signal</b> (Pol. tarcza manewrowa {{literally}} manoeuver shield) is used exclusively at stations. A consist shunting on such signals {{must not}} leave the station. Shunting signals are either stand-alone or incorporated into semi-automatic signals, which bear letter [...] "m" [...] on such occasions.|$|E
5000|$|In position-shunting signals, [...] "go" [...] {{consists}} of two white diagonal lights and [...] "stop" [...] {{consists of}} red and white horizontal lights. The two-color type uses LEDs. When the <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> identification sign (入換信号機識別標識, irekae shingōki shikibetsu hyōshiki) is on, the indicator is a shunting signal; when the sign is off, the indicator is a shunting sign. The shunting-signal identification sign is installed below the position light.|$|E
50|$|The former {{station is}} now a {{mushroom}} distribution business. The main station building, which was {{on the south side}} of the station beside the down platform, is now offices, and the former goods shed is a staff facility. A lower quadrant stop signal, a lower quadrant distant signal and a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> have been relocated to a garden beside the station, along with a wooden shelter from the up platform that has been relocated as a summer house.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> are not {{integrated}} with {{automatic train protection}} systems such as Integra-Signum or ZUB 121, so locomotives only used for shunting are not equipped with these systems.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> {{may also}} {{be placed on the}} ground called a ground {{position}} light (GPL), or on a post with no corresponding main signal. In these cases the signals will show the following aspects: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> {{are older}} {{technology}} and comprise less safety features. They control shunting paths {{and are not}} fitted with interlocks,. The driver must therefore ensure that points are set correctly through his intended path.|$|R
50|$|North Thoresby {{signal box}} is a 7 lever Eastern region ground frame {{that has been}} {{installed}} to operate the track and signalling layout at North Thoresby. It operates two main line signals, two <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> for access {{to and from the}} siding, a facing point lock and a facing point for access {{in and out of the}} siding. With No.1 lever being released by the annetts key making up the final lever in the frame. North Thoresby signal box was commissioned on 7 August 2009.|$|E
50|$|A {{call-on signal}} is {{installed}} under {{a home or}} <b>shunting</b> <b>signal.</b> The train guided by a call-on signal can proceed under 15 kph mph—25 kph mph on some lines—until it reached the forward train. In stations where two trains use the same track simultaneously—for example, the Yosan Line Matsuyama Station (Ehime) and the Nankai Kōya Line Hashimoto Station (Wakayama)—call-on signals are required to allow two trains on a single block section. However, this is unnecessary if the platform track {{is divided into two}} block sections (for example, the Keihan Main Line Yodoyabashi Station of the Keihan Electric Railway).|$|E
50|$|One {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} the grid leak detector is that the input impedance of the detector may {{be affected by the}} need to self bias the detector tube with grid current. Having the grid leak resistor, even in the Megohm range, <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> to ground loads the received signal. Although this may be mitigated to some degree by taking the resistor {{to the top of the}} tuned circuit (i.e. in parallel with the capacitor) and through the coil to earth, or by circuit design and component optimization, forward grid current will still load the input signal (and reduce the Q of the tuned circuit). Plate detectors have the advantage in that they isolate the detector load from the input circuit more effectively and may be employed where sensitivity is thought to be otherwise compromised by a grid leak or diode detector circuit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> {{may also}} {{be placed on the}} ground called a ground {{position}} light (GPL), or on a post with no corresponding main signal. In these cases the signals will show the following aspects: ...|$|R
50|$|According to the rules, {{light signals}} {{are used for}} main line traffic or shunting. N and L type signals are used for main line traffic and {{are not to be}} taken account of during <b>shunting.</b> <b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> do not apply to main line movements.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shunting</b> <b>signals</b> and {{subsidiary}} signals {{also exist}} in semaphore form, with smaller arms and lights than are provided for main signals. These signals may also {{take the form}} of a disc with a horizontal stripe which is rotated 45 degrees to the clear position.|$|R

50|$|The {{rebuilding}} {{of the eastern}} track system, carried out in eight stages, cost around 100 million D-Marks and was {{paid for by the}} Government, the state of Bavaria and the city of Nuremberg. Amongst other things, 16 kilometres of track and 60 points covering an area of 156,000 square metres were relaid, and two new fans of storage sidings (totalling 5.7 km) controlled by a <b>shunting</b> <b>signal</b> box were built. To enable the line to Lauf to cross the line to Altdorf without a track crossing being required, a 60 m bridge crossing was built. In all ten bridges had to be altered or replaced and 640 m of sound-damping walls were erected. The only examples in Europe of the wild flower, Astragalus arenarius, a plant related to the milk vetch, along with other groups of plants was transferred to a temporary nursery and later to areas around the railway. The conversion of the area with the platforms cost another 40 million D-Marks.|$|E
50|$|In Switzerland, {{shunting}} manoeuvres can {{be controlled}} either by <b>shunting</b> <b>signals</b> or dwarf signals. The maximum speed allowed for shunting is 30 km/h. This can be increased in special cases to 40 km/h. In any case speed must be compatible with visibility, local conditions and braking power.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shunt</b> <b>signals</b> {{are located}} at the {{entrance}} and exit of the workshop to indicate to the driver whether {{it is safe to}} proceed. Inbound signals are mounted on low level galvanised stands, whilst outbound signals are placed at cab height on galvanised stands or standoff brackets.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{shunting}} signal: position (灯列式, tōretsushiki) and color (色灯式, shikitōshiki). The position of two lighted bulbs indicates the position-type signal. This type is used primarily on JR and third-sector railways. In the color type, green means go and red stop. Color-type <b>shunting</b> <b>signals</b> are used primarily on private railways and subways; a narrow vertical signal is often used, due to narrow tunnels.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{red lights}} in a {{horizontal}} arrangement: indicates {{the limit of}} shunt, the furthest point to which trains that are shunting are allowed to proceed. [...] No train is allowed to pass this signal as the direction will be against the normal direction of travel. [...] A limit of <b>shunt</b> <b>signal</b> is permanently lit and cannot display any other aspect; {{there will not be}} a lens fitted in the proceed position on these signals.|$|R
