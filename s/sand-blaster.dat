40|$|After WisCon 20, Sylvia Kelso engaged Lois McMaster Bujold in a rich, snappy correspendence about Bujold's Vorkosigan novels. "You [...] . {{remark that}} '[my] post-modern despair is not [your] emergency' over {{the failure of}} {{feminism}} to transform SF," she wrote to Bujold. "My postmodern despair OUGHT to be your emergency, buen'amiga, {{because one of the}} reasons you are being ignored is that [...] . you don't fit the male canon either in the community or the critical industry; so unless you catch their eyes with a <b>sand-blaster</b> like The Left Hand of Darkness, the male academics are also gonna find you invisible [...] . " That correspondence became "Letterspace: In the Chinks Between Published Fiction and Published Criticism," which is published here. Also included are three critical essays discussing the intricacies of being an Australian feminist scholar writing about science fiction, colonialism in science fiction by women, and Bujold's Vorkosigan novels...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sand-Blasters</b> - {{a renegade}} group of Freedom Fighters who {{initially}} worshiped Sonic {{as a hero}} but decided to hold him hostage in their city. He subsequently escaped, leaving them exposed to an attacking horde of Roboticized Mobians, whom they eventually captured and attempted to unleash on Sonic's teammate Bunnie Rabbot. Later the Roboticized Mobians were returned to normal, and the <b>Sand-Blasters</b> briefly took them into their midst, but proved suspicious of their new neighbors. This led them to drive the former robots out of their city, where they ended up becoming the Great Desert Dark Egg Legion. The <b>Sand-Blasters</b> are led by Jack Rabbit, and their membership consists of Shift the Wolf, Jolt the Roadrunner, Tex the Lizard, and Avery the Bear. The members of the <b>Sand-Blasters</b> are inspired to various degrees by Looney Tunes: Jack resembles Bugs Bunny, Shift and Jolt are similar to Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner, and the remaining two are named for Tex Avery.|$|R

40|$|To the Editor: We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Bakan et al 1 {{in a recent issue}} of CHEST (November 2011). The authors describe the patient characteristics in yet another important but tragic description of the ongoing silicosis epidemic among denim <b>sand-blasters</b> in the textile sector in Turkey. As they report, this silicosis outbreak emerged with the new millennium, the magnitude of the problem has continued to increase, 2 - 5 and it remains uncertain how much of the iceberg has been revealed. Although they give detailed information about the patients and report a statistically signifi cant association of reduced lung function tests with mortality, the information provided about fatal cases is insuffi cient to ascertain the cause of death and the progression to massive fi brosis. Younger workers dominate this work sector, 3 and we noted rapid progression of the disease, an...|$|R
