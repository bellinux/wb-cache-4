The shear mechanism along the beam is modelled by adopting a Timoshenko beam approach for 3 D frame elements with arbitrary cross-section geometry.

If, when the die is subjected to another hubbing, it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a secondary image, or doubling.

This allows the steel to maintain its hardness in high temperature or high friction applications.

If the steel contains large amounts of these elements, tempering may produce an increase in hardness until a specific temperature is reached, {{at which point the}} hardness will begin to decrease. For instance, molybdenum steels will typically reach their highest hardness around 315 C whereas vanadium steels will harden fully when tempered to around 371 C. When very large amounts of solutes are added, alloy steels may behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which do not soften at all during tempering.|$|R

40|$|Steel sheets bonded with a {{thin layer}} of a {{polymeric}} adhesive are used for their sound-deadening effect in applications such as machine enclosures and automobile bulk-heads. Unlike sandwich materials designed primarily for high rigidity, they are formed by conventional methods and the effect of the relative inability of the adhesive to transmit shear on formability of the sheet and conformity to the tool profile is important. The adhesive in sheet steel/adhesive/steel laminate used for acoustic damping displays viscoelasticity only at small strain, and strain hardening is associated with subsequent viscous flow. High forming speed is favourable to the forming of steel sheet laminate bonded with a viscoplastic polymeric adhesive because it increases the ability of the adhesive to transmit shear forces, which in turn increases the transverse stiffness of sheet laminates, although it increases springback (decreases the shape fixability of the laminate).

50|$|Tempering - as {{mentioned}} above, steel can be hardened. When heated to red-hot, the iron and carbon {{in the steel}} arrange themselves into a lattice network. When quickly quenched, the lattice is frozen in place and forms a rigid structure; the more carbon, the greater the rigidity. When quenched, the steel is {{as hard as it}} will become. The harder the steel, the more brittle it is. A file is absolutely hard. It will cut lots of mild steel because it is so much harder - but put a file in a vise and hit it with a hammer and the file will readily snap in half. Same with a drill bit, cock the drill and the bit will easily snap. Tempering is a process of controlled heating of hardened steel that will relax the lattice within the iron and carbon, thereby <b>softening</b> the <b>steel.</b> The higher the temperature, the softer the steel becomes. A chisel for steel is tempered at a high temperature - softened enough so it won't snap, but still harder than the steel it will cut. A clean piece of steel will turn a very specific color based on the temperature to which it is raised. Heat one end of a piece of steel in a fire and you can easily see bands of color move up the steel coincidental with the heat migrating up the piece. It begins as a very light yellow, turns to a darker straw color, through red and on to purple. Blacksmiths have always used these colors to identify the temperature of the steel and thus control the temper (hardness) of the work piece. Spring steel is often a pretty bluish-purple color - because it's tempered to 750* and that's the associated color - soft enough to bend, but hard enough to retain “memory” and spring back to its original shape.|$|R

By contrast, a "random", accommodating austenite deformation substructure composed of equiaxed subgrains formed at 1200 °C.

Wear is responsible for 70 % of tool failure and a potential source of high costs; as much as 30 % per forging unit in the forging industries [1]. This paper presents a unique wear prediction and measurement method for open die forging using a modified Archard equation, 3 D FE simulation (to represent the actual forging process precisely) and an industrial scale forging trial. The proposed tool and experimental design is aimed at facilitating a cost effective method of tool wear analysis and to establish a repeatable method of measurement.

40|$|Structural {{materials}} of fusion reactors {{are subjected to}} complex creep-fatigue loading and high irradiation doses. Correct modelling of their deterioration is a precondition of a sufficiently reliable lifetime prediction procedure. In the continuum mechanics approach selected for lifetime prediction of RAFM steels under creep-fatigue conditions the ISRM (Inelastic Strain Rate Modified) damage model is coupled with a modified viscoplastic deformation model {{taking into account the}} complex nonsaturating cyclic <b>softening</b> of RAFM <b>steels.</b> The resulting coupled model is a powerful prediction tool, which can be applied to arbitrary creep-fatigue loading provided that the material, temperature and possibly irradiation dose dependent parameters of the model have been determined. Therefore a fitting procedure has been developed for the parameters identification on the base of deformation and lifetime data from standard low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests without and with hold time as well as creep tests. The coupled deformation-damage model has been meanwhile applied to F 82 H mod and EUROFER 97 in the reference (unirradiated) state under isothermal cyclic loading at 450, 550 and 650 C. The comparisons between model and experiment show that the observed lifetimes in the LCF-tests could be fairly well calculated even for the tests with hold time, which were not considered for the identification of the damage model parameters. However before releasing the model further verifications have to be done by applying the model to isothermal two-steps LCF-tests (low-to-high and high-to-low), to thermo-mechanical LCF-tests, to isothermal multiaxial LCF-tests as well as to a suitable benchmark component test.

The localized failure of material is modeled by the embedded strong discontinuity concept, which enhances standard interpolation of displacement (or rotation) with a discontinuous function, {{associated with an}} additional kinematic parameter representing jump in displacement (or rotation). The new parameters are local and are condensed on the element level. One stress resultant and two multi-layer beam finite elements are derived. The stress resultant Euler-Bernoulli beam element has embedded discontinuity in rotation. Bending response of {{the bulk of the}} element is described by elasto-plastic stress resultant material model. The cohesive relation between the moment and the rotational jump at the softening hinge is described by rigid-plastic model. Axial response is elastic. In the multi-layer beam finite elements, each layer is treated as a bar, made of either concrete or steel. Regular axial strain in a layer is computed according to Euler-Bernoulli or Timoshenko beam theory. Additional axial strain is produced by embedded discontinuity in axial displacement, introduced individually in each layer. Behavior of concrete bars is described by elasto-damage model, while elasto-plasticity model is used for steel bars. The cohesive relation between the stress at the discontinuity and the axial displacement jump is described by rigid-damage softening model in concrete bars and by rigid-plastic <b>softening</b> model in <b>steel</b> bars. Shear response in the Timoshenko element is elastic. The multi-layer Timoshenko beam finite element is upgraded by including viscosity in the softening model.

40|$|Die casting {{is a very}} {{cost-efficient}} {{method of}} forming thin-walled and complex near net-shaped products with close geometric tolerances and good surface finish. A permanent die tool is used to make large quantities of identical products. The performance and tool life are limited by several mechanisms, e. g. thermal fatigue cracking, erosion, and corrosion. To develop new and more resistant tool materials for die casting detailed knowledge of the actual casting conditions and the tool failure mechanisms are essential. This thesis contributes to an increased knowledge of tool failure in die casting by investigating and simulating actual casting conditions and tool failure mechanisms. A method to record the temperature fluctuations in a cavity insert during actual brass die casting was developed, and details of the temperature conditions were obtained. Also, a test method based on cyclic induction heating and internal cooling of hollow cylindrical test rods was developed, where the surface strain during thermal cycling could be measured. This method reproduced the characteristic type of surface cracking observed on die casting tools, and proved to give information of the strains and stresses behind the fatigue failure. In actual die casting, the dominant tool failure mechanism is thermal fatigue cracking. The formation of the cracks is associated to accumulation of the local plastic strain that occurs during each casting cycle. Initial crack growth is facilitated by oxidation of the crack surfaces, and proceeded growth is facilitated by this oxidation in combination with crack filling of cast material, and by softening of the tool material. In addition, local enrichment of Pb at the crack front from the cast alloy melt was also observed to promote the crack growth in die casting of brass. In an investigation of thermal fatigue of two hot work tool steels, quenched and tempered to different conditions, {{it was found that}} low-cycle fatigue occurs, although the estimated tensile stress never exceed the initial yield strength of the steel. The reason is a gradual <b>softening</b> of the <b>steel</b> during the thermal cycling, and the presence of stress raising defects. The resistance against thermal cracking improves with initial tool steel hardness, because any initial ranking in hardness among the steels is unaffected by the thermal cycling. Another investigation on a selection of surface engineered tool steels, including common diffusion treatments, PVD coatings and combinations of these, showed that surface engineering generally reduce the resistance against thermal cracking as compared to untreated references, since the engineering processes influence negatively on the mechanical properties of the hot work tool steels. Finally, corrosion tests of CrN PVD-coated tool steels by exposing them to molten aluminium revealed the mechanisms of initiation and progress of liquid metal corrosion of this material combination, and that the corrosion resistance improves with the CrN coating thickness...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to study the effect of {{shot-peening}} on the fatigue behaviour of carbon steels. Differently heat treated medium and high carbon steel specimens were selected. Medium carbon steels, AISI 1141 and AISI 1151, were respectively air cooled and quenched-tempered. A high carbon steel, C 70 S 6 (AISI 1070), was air cooled. The other material was a powder metal (0. 5 % C) steel. Each group of steels was divided into two. One was shot-peened. The other half remained in their original conditions. All were fatigue tested under fully reversed (R=- 1) tension-compression loading conditions. Microhardness tests were carried out on both the grip and gage sections of selected non shot-peened and shot-peened specimens to determine the hardness profile and effect of cycling. Shot-peening {{was found to be}} deeper on one side of each specimen. Compressive residual stress profiles and surface roughness measurements were provided. Shot-peening increased the surface roughness from 0. 26 ± 0. 03 µm to 3. 60 ± 0. 44 µm. Compressive residual stresses induced by shot-peening reached a maximum of - 463. 9 MPa at a depth of 0. 1 mm. The fatigue limit (N≈ 106 cycles) and microhardness profiles of the non shot-peened and shot-peened specimens were compared to determine the material behaviour changes after shot-peening and cycling. Also their fatigue properties were related to the manufacturing process including heat and surface treatments. Comparing the grip and gage microhardness profiles of each steel showed that neither cyclic softening nor hardening occurred in the non shot-peened condition. Cyclic softening was apparent in the shot-peened regions of all steels except powder metal (PM) steel. The amount of softening in the shot-peened region was 55. 0 % on the left side and 73. 0 % on the right in the AISI 1141 steel, 46. 0 % on the left side and 55. 0 % on the right in the C 70 S 6 AC steel and 31. 0 % on the right side in AISI 1151 QT <b>steel.</b> <b>Softening</b> was accompanied by a decrease in the depth of surface hardness. It is suggested that although the beneficial effects of shot peening, compressive residual stresses and work hardening, were offset by surface roughness, crack initiation was more likely to occur below the surface. Surface roughness was not a significant factor in controlling the fatigue lives of AISI 1141 AC and C 70 S 6 steels, since they were essentially the same for the non shot-peened and shot-peened conditions. Shot-peening had very little effect on the push-pull fatigue limit of C 70 S 6 steel (- 2. 1 %), and its effect on AISI 1141 AC steel was relatively small (6. 0 %). However, the influence of shot-peening on the AISI 1151 QT and PM steels was more apparent. The fatigue limit of the PM steel increased 14. 0 % whereas the fatigue limit of the AISI 1151 QT steel decreased 11. 0 % on shot peening...|$|R
