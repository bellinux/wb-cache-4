40|$|This paper {{examines}} the adoption {{and effectiveness of}} environmental management initiatives. Specifically, it {{examines the}} association between the adoption of an environmental management system (EMS), both ISO 14001 -certified and non-certified, {{and the use of}} nine specific environmental management initiatives with environmental performance. Data were collected by mail survey questionnaire from a stratified random sample of 899 <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> in Australian manufacturing organisations. The findings indicate that while organisations with an EMS achieved higher environmental performance, ISO 14001 certification did not affect environmental performance. In addition, four environmental management initiatives were positively associated with environmental performance: having a documented plan of action for complying with relevant regulations; communicating documented procedures to employees; training employees to implement environmental procedures; and conducting internal and external audits to monitor the impact of operations on the environment. The findings provide management with an insight into the emphasis they should place on environmental management initiatives to improve their environmental performance. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) has {{provided}} a unique challenge for Federal Agencies, such as the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Waste Management (OWM). While performance measurement, as required by GPRA, is new to Federal Agencies, private industry has applied it at all organizational levels to better manage their operations for some time. There has been significant discussion about how the private sector uses performance measures, {{but there have been}} very few empirical studies systematically examining their use. To gather information on comparable private industry practices, waste management industry firms were surveyed through questionnaires and follow-on interviews. Questionnaires were sent to 75 waste management firms throughout the United States and Canada. Twenty-four percent of the firms responded to the questionnaire and participated in the follow-on interviews. The questionnaires were typically completed by vice-presidents or <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers.</b> Information collected from the questionnaire and follow-on interviews provided valuable insight into industry practices in the area of performance measurement. This paper discusses the study results and how they can be incorporated in the DOE OWM performance measures and influence the character of the ``critical few`` metrics used by senior DOE managers...|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} function of disclosure under federal securities laws and regulations, {{and the role}} of management in running the affairs of the corporation consistent with state fiduciary principles have a history of discord. The recent mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX Act” or “SOX”), and the Security and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) implementing regulations continue to increase the disclosure obligations of public companies. This article examines the implementation of code of ethics requirements under SOX. It examines the SEC’s regulations, which implement SOX requirements on the disclosure of codes of ethics, and self-regulatory agency (“SRO” or “listing agency”) rules on codes of ethics for public companies. This article argues that code of ethics rules encroach into state law in defining the fiduciary obligations of officers and directors. Specifically, this article argues that the SEC’s approval of New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD” or “Nasdaq”) rules allow the SEC to do indirectly what it could not do directly. This article, therefore, calls for an amendment to the SEC’s code of ethics implementing regulation to provide a safe-harbor for <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and principal executive officers...|$|R
40|$|For {{a number}} of years, {{groups such as the}} Jenkins Committee and the SEC have taken steps to make {{corporate}} activities more transparent to investors. In addition, the Sarbanes‐Oxley Act requires publicly traded firms to disclose whether they have adopted codes of ethics for their <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers.</b> An implicit assumption is that ethics codes will help firms develop more transparent disclosure policies by enhancing their internal control environments. However, past research (Felo 2000) provides evidence that board involvement in the development, implementation, and maintenance of codes {{is an important factor in}} whether ethics codes are related to stronger internal control environments. Using results from Standard and Poor 2 ̆ 7 s survey of transparency and disclosure (Patel and Dallas 2002), I find that firms having ethics programs overseen by their boards disclose more overall information, financial information, and board and management information than do other firms. Additionally, they are more likely to disclose information recommended by the Jenkins Committee and to voluntarily provide information recently mandated by the SEC. Although my evidence only demonstrates an association between board oversight of ethics programs and disclosure transparency, it does support mandating greater board involvement in corporate ethics programs as a way to enhance corporate disclosure transparency...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{association}} between the use of multidimensional performance measures and four organizational factors with the effectiveness of performance measurement systems (PMSs). Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected by mail survey questionnaire from a random sample of 455 <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> in Australian manufacturing organizations. Findings – The results reveal that the use of multidimensional performance measures is associated with two dimensions of the effectiveness of PMSs (performance and staff related outcomes). The results also reveal that organizational factors were associated with the effectiveness of PMSs. Specifically, top management support was found to be associated with the effectiveness of PMSs in respect to the performance related outcomes, and training was associated with the staff related outcomes. Practical implications – The findings provide managers with an insight into the desirable PMS characteristics and the specific organizational factors that they can focus on in order to enhance the effectiveness of their performance measurement system. Originality/value – This study contributes to the limited empirical research examining the effectiveness of PMSs regarding the extent to which organizational processes are achieved. In addition, the study provides an empirical analysis of the association between the five perspective (financial, customer, internal business process, learning and growth, and sustainability) BSC model and four organizational factors with the effectiveness of PMSs. 24 page(s...|$|R

In general, accountants are perceived as more likely to be the preferred service provider for assurance over information systems and/or when professional reputation and integrity is important for providing a service. These attributes are in line with the projected image of the profession. An accountant is less likely to be the preferred provider when cost and independence are not important. We interpret this result as an indication that independence in the audit is important and, thus, other services are acceptable only when independence is not an issue...|$|R

40|$|Thesis by publication. Includes bibliographical references. 1. Introduction [...] 2. Literature review [...] 3. Data {{collection}} and analysis [...] 4. Paper one [...] 5. Paper two [...] 6. Paper three [...] 7. Conclusion. The thesis examines the environmental management practices of Australian manufacturing organisations with emphasis placed {{on the effectiveness of}} such practices and the role of organisational factors and the use of environmental performance measures in enhancing such effectiveness. The study also examines the effect of the adoption of environmental management systems on environmental performance. Data were collected by mail survey questionnaire from a random sample of <b>senior</b> <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> in Australian manufacturing organisations. The thesis adopts the ‘thesis by publication’ format and consists of three research papers. Paper One examines the association between five specific organisational factors with the effectiveness of environmental management. Paper Two examines the association between the extent to which environmental performance measures (EPMs) are used and the purpose of using EPMs with the effectiveness of environmental management. The first two papers examine the effectiveness of environmental management from two perspectives, environmental performance and the effectiveness of environmental management processes. The results of both papers highlight the significance of the effectiveness of environmental management processes as an antecedent of environmental performance and a mediator of the association between the examined factors and environmental performance. Specifically, in Paper One, top management support, training and the link of performance to rewards exhibit a direct positive association with the effectiveness of environmental management processes and an indirect association with environmental performance, while teamwork exhibits a direct positive association with environmental performance. In Paper Two, using operational EPMs to a greater extent and using EPMs for environmental decision making purposes exhibit a direct positive association with the effectiveness of environmental management processes and an indirect association with environmental performance. Paper Three examines the effect of the adoption of environmental management systems (EMSs) on environmental performance. The results show that organisations that have an EMS achieve higher environmental performance than organisations that do not have an EMS. However, organisations that have an ISO 14001 certified EMS did not achieve higher environmental performance than organisations with a non-certified EMS. The results also reveal five specific environmental management initiatives that contribute to enhanced environmental performance. The thesis contributes to the environmental management literature by empirically examining the contingency factors that influence the effectiveness of environmental management. The findings provide managers with an insight into the need to apply specific organisational factors, use operational EPMs to a greater extent, use EPMs for decision making, and to adopt EMSs, as a means to enhance the effectiveness of environmental management. The thesis also contributes to the limited empirical research by examining the effectiveness of environmental management from two perspectives: the effectiveness of environmental management processes and environmental performance. In particular, the identified mediating role of the effectiveness of environmental management processes in the association between specific organisational factors and EPMs with environmental performance highlights the need for systematic and formalised environmental management processes in Australian manufacturing organisations.

Numerous research projects have been conducted {{to learn more about the}} position of college president and the people who serve in this capacity.

The results of this study indicate that chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and chief executive officers are more similar than different in their perceptions of effective leadership traits, behaviors, and characteristics for a public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> to possess. Both groups agree that the traits of integrity, honesty, ethical, knowledge, and credibility are important traits for a public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> to have. The behaviors that both groups rated as high importance include: accountability, responsibility, decision making, objectivity, collaboration, commitment, fairness and decisiveness. Characteristics that were rated high within the research analyses include the behavior of objectivity and the traits of achievement oriented, honesty, initiative, ethical, and empathy. A discriminant function analysis identified nine predictors that could be used to distinguish group membership. These nine predictors include motivation, knowledgeable, delegate, loyalty, visible, tact, confidence, fairness, and trust. This study indicates that there was a consensus among chief <b>financial</b> <b>officers</b> and chief executive officers regarding the traits, behaviors, and characteristics necessary for a public two-year college chief <b>financial</b> <b>officer</b> to possess.
