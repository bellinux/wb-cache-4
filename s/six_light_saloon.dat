Only two models were available after the war, the <b>six</b> <b>light</b> four door <b>saloon</b> and the van.

50|$|At {{the height}} of her success Chicago Joe owned the Red <b>Light</b> <b>Saloon,</b> The Grand Bordello, The Coliseum Variety Theater, and various other {{businesses}} in the town. At one point she was the largest landowner in the entire Red Light district. These buildings she owned were not shacks, but large event centers that could host parties as well as serve their intended purposes. For example, the Coliseum cost Josephine over $30,000 to build in the 1880s. The panic of 1893 claimed all of her holdings but the Red <b>Light</b> <b>Saloon</b> and she lived {{the last few years}} of her life in a room above it.|$|R

Launched in 1957, the Riley One-Point-Five and Wolseley 1500 {{were based on}} the unused but {{intended}} replacement for the Morris Minor. They shared their exteriors, but the Riley was marketed as the more performance-oriented option, having an uprated engine, twin S.U. carburetters and a close-ratio gearbox. With its good handling, compact, sports-saloon styling and well-appointed interior, the One-Point-Five quite successfully recaptured the character of the 1930s <b>light</b> <b>saloons.</b>|$|R
