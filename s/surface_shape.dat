5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a <b>surface</b> <b>shape</b> is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional <b>surface</b> <b>shape</b> of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E

Experimental measurements of <b>surface</b> <b>shapes</b> consisting of {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) images of epitaxially grown GaAs are compared with <b>surface</b> <b>shapes</b> computed from continuum growth equations with a conservative or a non-conservative nonlinear term. Both the non-conservative and the conservative nonlinear terms {{are found to be}} consistent with the experiments, although the conservative nonlinearity is preferred on physical grounds. Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations cover a wider range of spatial frequencies, which enables the two different nonlinear terms to be distinguished. In this case, the observed <b>surface</b> <b>shapes</b> are consistent with the conservative nonlinearity...|$|R

As a result, an elliptical dish was used, with a major axis of 125ft (38.1m) and a minor axis of 83ft 4in (25.4m). The focal length is 40ft (12.2m).

2500|$|... 3. In three {{dimensions}} {{a consequence of}} the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, {{no matter how much you}} stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred <b>surface</b> <b>shape)</b> maintain a convex volume. [...] Ordering a cocktail shaken, not stirred defeats the convexity condition ("shaking" [...] being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid). [...] In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state.|$|E

40|$|Breaking the up-down {{symmetry}} of tokamaks removes a constraint limiting intrinsic momentum transport, and hence toroidal rotation, to be small. Using gyrokinetic theory, we study {{the effect of}} different up-down asymmetric flux <b>surface</b> <b>shapes</b> on the turbulent transport of momentum. This is done by perturbatively expanding the gyrokinetic equation in large flux <b>surface</b> <b>shaping</b> mode number. It is found that the momentum flux generated by shaping that lacks mirror symmetry (which is necessarily up-down asymmetric) has a power law scaling with the shaping mode number. However, the momentum flux generated by mirror symmetric flux <b>surface</b> <b>shaping</b> (even if it is up-down asymmetric) decays exponentially with large shaping mode number. These scalings are consistent with nonlinear local gyrokinetic simulations and indicate that low mode number shaping effects (e. g. elongation, triangularity) are optimal for creating rotation.
