40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{efficiency of}} one Thai red tilapia strain (NIFI) and three genetically diverse Philippine red tilapia strains (BFS, FAC, and PF) were compared. Breeders from each strain were stocked separately in land-based concrete tanks and lake-based hapa net cages or fine-meshed net cages at densities of 4 males: 12 females per enclosure. Spawning activity, <b>seed</b> (<b>egg</b> and fry) production and hatchability {{data from the}} four strains in each hatchery system were monitored once every three weeks for twelve months. Results showed that seed production in all strains was lower in cages than in tanks. Daily mean seed production in the land-based hatchery system was highest at 12. 41 per spawner for FAC followed by NIFI (11. 18), BFS (9. 49) and PF (5. 56). In the hapa net cages, BFS produced 2. 19 eggs and fry per female daily while NIFI, FAC and PF gave daily harvests of 1. 40, 1. 18 and 1. 14 eggs and fry per spawner. Analysis of variance showed that seed production was significantly influenced by the strain, type of hatchery system and {{the interaction between the}} two factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{scaling of}} {{reproductive}} parameters to body size {{is important for}} understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns. Here, we derived allometric relationships for the number and mass of seeds, eggs and neonates from an existing model on population production. In a separate meta-analysis, we collected 79 empirical regressions on offspring mass and number covering different taxa and various habitats. The literature review served as a validation of the model, whereas, vice versa, consistency of isolated regressions {{with each other and}} related ecological quantities was checked with the model. The total offspring mass delivered in a reproductive event scaled to adult size with slopes in the range of about 3 / 4 to 1. Exponents for individual <b>seed,</b> <b>egg</b> and neonate mass varied around 1 / 2 for most heterotherms and between 3 / 4 and 1 for most homeotherms. The scaling of the progeny number released in a sowing, clutch or litter was opposite to that of their size. The linear regressions fitted into a triangular envelope where maximum offspring mass is limited {{by the size of the}} adult. Minimum seed and egg size scaled with weight exponents of approximately 0 up to 1 / 4. These patterns can be explained by the influence of parents on the fate of their offspring, covering the continuum of r-strategists (pelagic–aquatic, arial, most invertebrates, heterotherms) and K-strategists (littoral–terrestrial, some invertebrates, homeotherms) ...|$|E

40|$|What is an {{invasive}} species? An {{invasive species}} is any species (including its <b>seeds,</b> <b>eggs,</b> spores, or other biological material capable of propagation) {{that is not}} native to a given ecosystem; and whose presence causes economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. Some of the invasive species in this brochure are already serious pests in Georgia while some are currently just threats and not yet widespread. Twenty of Georgia’s many invasive weeds are highlighted here. How do invasive species get here? Invasive species are introduced into a new environment, either intentionally or accidentally. Intentional introductions have often been for agricultural or ornamental purposes. Once introduced, they escape from cultivation, or from their aquariums or cages {{in the case of}} animals, and become established as viable, self-reproducing populations. Accidental introductions are usually the result of contaminated freight, where individuals or the seeds from invasive species are mixed within normal freight. Are all exotic species invasive? No, actually only a small percent of th...|$|R

The focus was on species that are already established in areas that support native ecosystems, such as parks, reserves, wildlife areas, national forests, and rangelands.

50|$|A true {{predator}} is {{one that}} kills and eats another living thing. Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a stork swallowing a frog. Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey before the predator ingests it, as in the box jellyfish, or disables it, as in the cone shell. In some cases, the venom contributes to the digestion of the prey, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders. In contrast, baleen whales eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, swallowing them alive. <b>Seed</b> and <b>egg</b> predation are true predation, as <b>seeds</b> and <b>eggs</b> are potential organisms. Predators need not eat prey entirely; for example, some predators cannot digest bones. Some may eat only part of an organism, but still consistently cause its death.|$|R
5000|$|Spontaneous {{generation}} refers both to {{the supposed}} processes in which different types of life might repeatedly emerge from specific sources other than <b>seeds,</b> <b>eggs</b> or parents, and also to the theoretical principles which were presented in support of any such phenomena. Crucial to this doctrine {{is the idea that}} life comes from non-life, with the conditions, and that no causal agent is needed (i.e. Parent). Such hypothetical processes sometimes are referred to as abiogenesis, in which life routinely emerges from non-living matter on a time scale of anything from minutes to weeks, or perhaps a season or so. An example would be the supposed seasonal generation of mice and other animals from the mud of the Nile. [...] Such ideas have no operative principles in common with the modern hypothesis of abiogenesis, in which life emerged in the early ages of the planet, over a time span of at least millions of years, and subsequently diversified without evidence that there ever has been any subsequent repetition of the event.|$|R

40|$|Predation {{rates of}} natural and {{artificial}} bird nests in rural landscapes {{have been the subject}} of numerous studies, often in the context of proximity to edge. Similar studies in urban and suburban landscapes are lacking. We carried out a study of <b>egg</b> and <b>seed</b> removal at forest reserve edges in three urban and two suburban forests in and near New York City in 1994 – 1995. Few significant edge effects were found, but this may have been because of the extraor-dinarily high rates of <b>egg</b> and <b>seed</b> removal. Daily removal rates were higher in suburban sites (<b>eggs,</b> 86 %; <b>seeds,</b> 95 %) than in urban sites (<b>eggs,</b> 64 %; <b>seeds,</b> 88 %). Exposed <b>seeds</b> and <b>eggs</b> suffered higher rates of removal than <b>seeds</b> and <b>eggs</b> covered by leaf litter. Despite statistically significant differences among treatments, all of these rates would be prohibitively high if experienced by ground-nesting birds or large-seeded trees (if removal was associated with predation). A survey of the literature suggests that egg predation rates are prohibitively high in cities and peak in suburban sites (at least in this study), then drop rapidly in ex-urban and rural sites, perhaps because of a similar pattern in the abundance of corvid bird predators...|$|R
