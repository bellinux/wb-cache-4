40|$|Universally it is {{agreed that}} the state is a {{necessary}} and worthwhile institution in any country. In order to ensure effective service delivery to the population of a country, some form of government intervention is always required. This intervention must however be aligned with the unique characteristics of a country and its population. This article focuses holistically on the nature of state intervention as well as the different forms thereof. The analysis is however narrowed down to possible forms of interventions within democratic states. Against this background, South Africa is selected as a case study, due to the relative youthfulness of its democracy and the reality that the country remains subjected to political and economic transformation. The various applicable forms of state intervention in a democracy are analysed and applied to the current South African socio-political and economic landscape. A specific emphasis is placed on the elements of the <b>social-welfare</b> <b>state</b> and the development state in the South African context. It is argued that South Africa aspires to be a development state. In the analysis it was however found that the country is more of a <b>social-welfare</b> <b>state</b> due to its political history of “apartheid ” which left {{a large portion of the}} population, amongst others, exposed to poverty and unemployment. More than 60 % of the national budget is spent on <b>social-welfare</b> <b>services</b> and South Africa has the most comprehensive social-welfare support system in Africa. South Africa faces a dilemma of attempting to be a development state in a fully democratic dispensation, whilst having huge social-welfare backlogs. As an outcome it is recommended that South Africa needs to proceed with a mixed intervention approach...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{incentive}} effects of performance-based contracts, {{as well as}} their impacts on provider job placement rates, using unique data on Dutch cohorts of unemployed and disabled workers that were assigned to private social-welfare providers in 2002 - 2005. In a growing number of countries, the delivery of <b>social-welfare</b> <b>services</b> is contracted out to private providers, and increasingly so�using performance-based contracts. Critics of performance-based incentive contracts stress their potential unintended effects, including cream-skimming and other gaming activities intended to raise measured performance outcomes. We take advantage of variation in contract design in the Netherlands in 2002 - 2005, where procured contracts gradually moved from partial performance-contingent pay to contracts with 100 %-performance contingent reward schemes, and analyse the impact of these changes using panel data that allow us to control for cohort types and to develop explicit measures of selection into the programs. We find evidence of cream-skimming and other gaming activities on the part of providers but little impact of these activities on job placement rates. Overall, moving to a system with contract payments fully contingent on performance appears to increase job placements for more readily employable workers, although it does not affect the duration of their jobs. ...|$|R

50|$|Austria's {{first attempt}} at republican governance, {{after the fall of}} the monarchy in 1918, was {{severely}} hampered by the crippling economic costs of war reparations required by the victorious Allies. Austria's First Republic (1918-1938) made some pioneering reforms in the 1920s, particularly in Vienna, that served as models for the <b>social-welfare</b> <b>states</b> of post-World War I Europe. However, the Republic gradually developed into an Austrofascist dictatorship between 1933-1934 under Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, whom Nazi party agents assassinated in 1934. The First Republic ended with invasion and annexation by Germany in 1938. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945 Austria resumed its republican government.|$|R

Using longitudinal survey data, {{we examine the}} transitions of leaving home to live with and without a partner. We find that, much {{more than in the}} European countries, union formation has become separated from leaving home in the USA. We also find a different impact of level of education and employment status on leaving-home patterns in the European countries with their <b>social-welfare</b> <b>state</b> system than in the US system in which market forces prevail. The differences are not just related to welfare-state systems but also to the sizes of the countries and the geographical dispersion of jobs and educational opportunities.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} based on {{theoretical}} concepts. From geographic point of view, we {{try to find out}} the interrelationship between human security and sustainable development They are connected to each other in a particular way to achieve the final goal of development of human security and creating a sustainable development in the region of western Asia, such as (Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan). The concept of human security can be understood better and deeply if our acknowledgement concentrated on infrastructural bases and doctrine of philosophy. Thus, this significant issue must be discussed at the university levels by politicians,social scientists,planners,decision-makers, researchers and geographers. Although, the main purpose of social behavioural sciences is to reach the human security development but geographers have stepped on farther than it, and believe that recognition of human security is more important in achieving a sustainable development. Sustainable development must be considered directly or indirectly on planning of western Asian countries. Geographers <b>state</b> that the <b>social-welfare,</b> convenience and well-being of human beings bases on development of human security. This scientific article certainly will help to human development and sustainable development of mentioned countries regarding to their different geographical location. According to the studies of U. N. O. some particular strategies for development of human security have been determined in comparing more economically developed countries (MDCs) with less economically developing countries (LDCs) to each other. As we know, security has various concepts. Its meaning changes in the place and time. Therefore, creating human security has accompanied with some anxieties and its nature is complicated. From the beginning of history, security has been a crucial issue for human being. Therefore, it is so valuable and crucial issue for human society, consequently, regional governments supposed to set human security on the area. On the global scale, general studies should be done on human security on the national and international levels in order the vital values of human to be protected. New political strategies and interregional collaborations are needed for establishing human security in the regional countries...|$|R
40|$|While Labor is {{apparently}} considering large-scale tax reform, John Quiggin says {{the public has}} other priorities on its mind FOR THE first time in years, the federal election looks set to be fought on the bread-and-butter question that dominates modern politics, the balance between taxing and spending. The 1993 and 1998 elections were dominated by the distraction of the GST, the 1996 election was a referendum on Paul Keating and the 2001 election was dominated by terrorism and panic about refugees. Barring a big foreign-policy shock, the question dominating the 2004 election will be whether any budget surplus accruing to {{the government should be}} returned in the form of tax cuts or as higher spending on services such as health and education (there’s a third option keeping the surplus and paying off debt but neither party seems likely to propose this). A Newspoll reported by the Australian this week suggests that, as far as the public is concerned, this issue has already been decided. When asked to choose between allocating a large surplus between tax cuts and spending on health and education, 72 per cent of respondents preferred allocating it mainly to health and education, 16 per cent favoured an equal division and only 9 per cent preferred allocating it mainly to personal tax cuts. It’s hard to recall such an overwhelming expression of preference on an issue of political controversy. The most recent example was in relation to Pauline Hanson’s three-year prison sentence. Presented with such a scoop, the Australian could have made a big splash. In fact, the news was not only played down, but was accompanied by an editorial headed, amazingly, ‘Cutting income tax is a political winner’. The basis for this claim was a second Newspoll question, about the top marginal rate of taxation. Of the respondents, 27 per cent said it was much too high, 23 per cent a little too high, 34 per cent about right and 8 per cent too low. The Australian’s report of the Newspoll ran with this finding, under the headline, ‘Top rate too high, say half of voters’. There is no contradiction between these two results. As any economics student knows, meeting a budget is a matter of trade-offs. Someone who thinks the top marginal rate is ‘a little too high’, but that health and education services are severely under-funded, is likely to prefer allocating scarce public funds to the more urgent problems first. The poll results suggest, reasonably enough, that only those who think that the top marginal rate is ‘much too high’ favour allocating part or all of any surplus to reducing it. But how did the Australian manage to dismiss the overwhelming majority of voters who preferred better health and education to tax cuts? Quoting pollster Sol Lebovic, it suggested that voters were giving the ‘socially acceptable’ answer. According to the editorialist, the ‘gut instincts’ of voters were for tax cuts, and politicians would disregard this at their peril. How the contents of our guts were determined is a question that is perhaps best left alone. The point attributed to Lebovic is an interesting one. It’s well known that (naively designed) readership surveys will show many more households taking the National Geographic than the the National Enquirer, even though audited circulation figures show the opposite. Still, it’s unusual for a pollster to trash his own product by suggesting it is flawed in this way. More importantly, if expressing a preference for tax cuts over health and education spending is as socially unacceptable as a taste for supermarket scandal sheets, {{it would seem that the}} public debate is already over. In reality, there’s little support for such a condescending view. If the question is changed to make ‘social services’ rather than ‘health and education’ the alternative, a plurality of voters prefer tax cuts. The term is ambiguous but most commonly refers to <b>social-welfare</b> benefits and <b>services</b> directed at the poor, unemployed and single mothers. In preferring health and education to social services or tax cuts, voters are not giving ‘altruistic’ answers that might make them look good. Rather they want a government that does something for them and their children, and they are willing to give up tax cuts if they can get it. There is a standard political response to unfavourable poll results election day is the only poll that counts. A string of state election results in the past five years have confirmed that, when voters say they want better health and education, they mean it. In an election fought on domestic policy issues, the party that gives them what they want will win.
