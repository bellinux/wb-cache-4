5|$|The {{relative}} {{reactivity of}} zinc {{and its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E

25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} {{occurs when}} two different metals have physical or electrical contact {{with each other}} and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more active metal (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> for steel structures. Galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.|$|E

25|$|Accelerated {{low-water}} corrosion (ALWC) is {{a particularly}} aggressive form of MIC that affects steel piles in seawater near the low water tide mark. It is characterized by an orange sludge, which smells of hydrogen sulfide when treated with acid. Corrosion rates can be very high and design corrosion allowances can soon be exceeded leading to premature failure of the steel pile. Piles that have been coated and have cathodic protection installed {{at the time of}} construction are not susceptible to ALWC. For unprotected piles, sacrificial anodes can be installed locally to the affected areas to inhibit the corrosion or a complete retrofitted <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> system can be installed. Affected areas can also be treated using cathodic protection, using either sacrificial anodes or applying current to an inert anode to produce a calcareous deposit, which will help shield the metal from further attack.|$|E

40|$|For some 140 years {{steel is}} the common {{construction}} material for commercial ships. Together with this, relatively stable, substance a persistent enemy popped up: corrosion. Two long-established methods {{are being used to}} fight this never sleeping enemy: either through the use of coatings, creating a barrier between the electrolyte and the steel or by way of using <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> or impressed current, lowering the potential of the steel structure until it becomes cathodic. This article will focus on the correct use of <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> in ballast tanks, since these tanks are the most vulnerable to corrosion, especially on board double hull ships due to increased temperatures, inherent wet/dry situations, omnipresence of seawater, storage compartment for ship's structural elements. An in situ survey of > 170 ballast tanks on board merchant ships lead to two principal conclusions: First, epoxy coatings in ballast tanks, remain overall in intact condition for approximately 5 years and afterwards degrade with 1. 7 % surface per year. Secondly, statistical analysis of the database did not show any distinctive advantage of the presence of <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes,</b> hence leading to the alarming conclusions that, probably, for many years anodes have been used without any significant impact on corrosion or corrosion rates. We studied this phenomenon further in depth and found that a cathodic protection system will only generate a distinguishable advantage if installed and maintained meticulously. Calculating the total mass of zinc required to lower the potential of the metallic structure sufficiently is rather easy, distributing the anodes correctly throughout the tank to obtain an even and correct potential is already a lot more complicated. Till today, any legal obligation to install <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> in ballast tanks, is lacking. Consequently there are no rules promoting a correct weighing and spreading out of the <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes.</b> Very often, the design and installation of the cathodic protection system is done by the vendors of the zinc or aluminum anodes. Their and the ship's interest are not always the same. A simulation package, CPMaster, developed by Elsyca, Belgium allows the visualization of the polarization of a metallic structure induced by <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> or impressed current. By way of example one of the ballast tanks of the Flanders Harmony, a 28 year old LNG carrier, was modelled and the results were compared with the outcome of a detailed tank inspection held during dry-dock in Bahrain 2013. The resemblance between the in situ observation and the simulation model was satisfying. Although the tank was in a splendid condition, taking into account the age of the ship, there was still plenty of room for improvement. The cathodic protection system was oversized and the anodes were not distributed in a uniform way, the <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> might even be responsible for the massive quantity of blisters in the tank. Finally we conclude that cathodic protection using <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> is a useful technique only if the system is well proportioned, installed, maintained and evolves together with and in function of the condition of the tank. If one is not prepared to follow up the system in a proper way it is better to abandon cathodic protection all together and invest the money gained in an improved coating system...|$|R
