To their surprise, they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war, and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet. With Zaphod and Marvin's help, the group is able to infiltrate the facilities. Trillian deduces that the Krikkiters have been manipulated, reasoning that the people of Krikkit could not simultaneously be smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon—a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe—while also being <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> not to realise that this weapon would also destroy them.|$|E

25|$|By February 1920 Wilson's Staff {{wanted to}} reduce {{commitment}} to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), despite inevitable loss of prestige, as {{occupation of the}} whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. In May 1920 Wilson submitted a joint paper with Churchill and Trenchard (Chief of Air Staff) complaining {{about the cost of}} keeping 10,000 British and 50,000 Indian troops there. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements (he also needed troops for Ireland and the UK), but Lloyd George said that Curzon “would not stand it”. By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that “we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided”. Wilson was privately scathing about what he called “Hot Air, Aeroplanes & Arabs” – Trenchard's plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 – although glad at the reduction in military commitment, and wrote to Rawlinson that when trouble came Churchill would “hop into an aeroplane and fly away, waving Ta-Ta to any poor bloody native who is <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> to back us”.|$|E

The Richard Hawley song [...] "Tonight The Streets Are Ours", which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield.

500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E

[...] "Hence," [...] as we are told by an old governor, who was somewhat of a wag, and flourished almost a century since, and had paid a visit to the wits of Philadelphia, [...] "hence arose the appellation of man-hat-on, first given to the Indians, and afterwards to the island"--a <b>stupid</b> joke!--but well <b>enough</b> for a governor.|$|R

5000|$|Ferrari's {{management}} style was autocratic {{and he was}} known to pit drivers against each other in the hope of improving their performance.

[...] "He would expect a driver to go beyond reasonable limits...

500|$|During his childhood, and {{owing to}} his {{considerable}} strength and bulk, Steiger {{became known as}} [...] "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he {{ran away from home}} at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II. [...] He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: [...] "I loved the Navy. I was <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> to think I was being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon, which became known as Halsey's Typhoon, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115mph) and [...] waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the Taussig survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.|$|E

According to Rotten Tomatoes, a website which aggregates film reviews, 45% of critics gave Hotel for Dogs a positive review; the site's consensus further stated: [...] "Hotel for Dogs may appeal to children and dog lovers, but it's ultimately contrived, predictable and simplistic". Roger Ebert gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 stars and summed up his review by saying, [...] "What I thought instead was, Marley has a lot he could learn from these dogs". Kent Turner, writing for School Library Journal, stated that while the book is [...] "utterly realistic", the film is [...] "fantastic" [...] and thus fundamentally different. Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, wrote that the film [...] "is loaded with <b>enough</b> <b>stupid</b> pet and human tricks to satisfy David Letterman for years to come".|$|R
6000|$|Proud of his dreary paradoxes, Warburton scorned {{the humble}} office of {{furnishing}} useful information. Pope had said, in his Imitations of Horace, that because three ladies liked a luckless play, a spendthrift {{had taken the}} whole house upon the poet's night,[8] which drew from Warburton the following note:--"The common reader, I am sensible, will be always more solicitous about the names of these three ladies, the unlucky play, and every other circumstance that attended this piece of gallantry, than for the explanation of our author's sense, or the illustration of his poetry, even where he is most moral and sublime. But had it been in Mr. Pope's purpose to indulge so impertinent a curiosity, he had sought elsewhere for a commentator on his writings. Which defect in these notes, the periodical scribblers, however, have been <b>stupid</b> and shameless <b>enough</b> to object to them."[9] Warburton's reserve was praiseworthy when his motive was respect for private feelings. His general neglect to clear up the allusions in Pope's poems did not admit of this apology, and in default of a better defence he called his critics [...] "stupid and shameless." [...] His habit when reasons failed him was to supply their place with abuse.|$|R

[...] {{at the start of}} her (positive) critique of Journey South's performance of Robbie Williams' 1997 hit single [...] "Angels". On 23 November, Walsh told The Sun: [...] "I've been totally humiliated and undermined by both of them. This has caused me nothing but stress.

[...] Cowell apparently [...] "begged" [...] Walsh to come back and, in the event, Walsh did turn up for the next show; it was stated that he had indeed quit midweek but had been persuaded to return.

She then mentioned the general critical decrying of the glamourisation of out-of-wedlock pregnancy in the films Juno and Knocked Up and then says that out-of-pregnancy wedlock is not any better for teenagers. Angelo {{goes on to say that}} [...] "what makes it really hard to watch is Tom and Jessie’s casual discourse on sex." [...] She further explains that what makes 18 to Life so difficult to watch compared to shows such as Gossip Girl and 90210 is that creating a believable world and [...] "trying to legitimize the whole thing only makes it worse - and usually, the CW doesnt try." [...] Mary McNamara, television critic for The Los Angeles Times, opens her review by saying, [...] "The setup for this CW show isnt anything new. Except, possibly, in its old-fashioned commitment to marriage." [...] McNamara later says [...] "It is much more shocking to see these young people leap into matrimony than it would be if they were just having sex or even moving in together."
