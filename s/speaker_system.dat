5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or <b>speaker</b> <b>system.</b> This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the <b>speaker</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic <b>speaker</b> <b>system</b> that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E

5|$|The iLoo (short for Internet loo) was a {{cancelled}} Microsoft {{project to}} develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable plasma screen, a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel <b>speaker</b> <b>system,</b> and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded.

5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism and tie in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's <b>speaker</b> <b>system</b> had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the <b>speaker</b> <b>system</b> and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{the company}} {{publicly}} introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio, including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber-line recorders (named after {{the use of}} a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disc). That May, the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures; he founded Vitagraph, in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest, just one month later. In April 1926, Warners signed a contract with AT for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation, leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months. During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents, the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company's sound-on-film competitors. Meanwhile, Bell Labs—the new name for the AT research operation—was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater-filling volume. The new moving-coil <b>speaker</b> <b>system</b> was installed in New York's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission, for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver, was filed on August 4, just two days before the premiere of Don Juan.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of voice transformation and speech synthesis technologies, <b>speaker</b> identification <b>systems</b> are likely to face attacks from imposters who use voice transformed or synthesized speech to mimic a particular speaker. Therefore, we investigated in this paper how <b>speaker</b> identification <b>systems</b> perform on voice transformed speech. We conducted experiments with two different approaches, the classical GMM-based <b>speaker</b> identification <b>system</b> and the Phonetic <b>speaker</b> identification <b>system.</b> Our experimental results showed that current standard voice transformation techniques are able to fool the GMM-based system but not the Phonetic <b>speaker</b> identification <b>system.</b> These findings imply that future <b>speaker</b> identification <b>systems</b> should include idiosyncratic knowledge in order to successfully distinguish transformed speech from natural speech and thus be armed against imposter attacks...|$|R

25|$|The Government of Japan, the U.S. Congress, and the European Parliament passed {{legislation}} {{to regulate the}} minimum level of sound for hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching. , most of the hybrids and plug-in electric cars available in the United States make warning noises using a <b>speaker</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company will {{step up the}} voltage of the power being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped back down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage <b>speaker</b> <b>system</b> the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E
25|$|Multi-speaker {{electronic}} sirens {{often are}} {{alleged to have}} dead spots at certain angles to the vehicle's direction of travel. These are caused by phase differences. The sound coming from the speaker array can phase cancel in some situations. This phase cancellation occurs at single frequencies, based upon the spacing of the speakers. These phase differences also account for increases, based upon the frequency and the speaker spacing. However, sirens are designed to sweep the frequency of their sound output, typically, no less than one octave. This sweeping minimizes the effects of phase cancellation. The end {{result is that the}} average sound output from a dual speaker siren system is 3dB greater than a single <b>speaker</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Constant-voltage <b>speaker</b> <b>systems</b> {{refer to}} {{networks}} of loudspeakers which {{are connected to}} an audio amplifier using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only {{in the sense that}} at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage <b>speaker</b> <b>systems</b> are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance <b>speaker</b> <b>systems.</b> [...] In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100V.|$|R
2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{alternative to}} constant-voltage <b>speaker</b> <b>systems</b> are low impedance <b>speaker</b> <b>systems</b> (commonly {{referred to as}} [...] "8-ohm speaker systems" [...] {{in spite of the}} fact that their impedance may not be 8 ohms), in which the amplifier and speaker are directly coupled without the use of transformers. The disadvantages relative to constant-voltage <b>systems</b> are that <b>speaker</b> cables need to be shorter or larger diameter and that more amplifiers are needed if different listening levels are desired at different locations.|$|R
50|$|Technology exists where {{underwater}} <b>speaker</b> <b>systems</b> can {{be deployed}} around the designated area. This array of <b>speaker</b> <b>systems</b> can {{be programmed to}} send high powered frequencies which then blasts powerful 'disruption' signals into the water. The frequencies have a maximum disorientation effect on the diver(s), which induce discomfort or panic causing them to leave the area or surface for interception. In cases where the divers remain in the water, the frequencies {{are likely to have}} a continued adverse effect which could cause sickness and confusion.|$|R
25|$|The {{interaction}} of a loudspeaker system with its environment {{is complex and}} is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present {{a more or less}} reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the <b>speaker</b> <b>system,</b> but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from resonant room modes), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and {{this is part of the}} reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.|$|E
