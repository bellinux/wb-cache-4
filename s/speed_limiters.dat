However, the problem is in a certain condition the driver lost their control speed due to their target and minimize the driving time and it led the high potential to accident. Therefore, <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> which applied in the bus is urgently needed to reduce the accident and improve their awareness of road safety.

50|$|In the article, Mike Russel, a {{spokesman}} for American Trucking Associations (ATA), is quoted saying that the ATA supports a national speed limit of 65 mph for all vehicles. Russell goes on to state that forcing trucks to drive slower than other traffic increases the accident rate. In 1991, <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> were considered and rejected by Congress. Despite claims that <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> would increase accident rates, Road Safe America petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to require manufacturers to install <b>speed</b> <b>limiters</b> on all trucks over 26000 lb GVW, to limit their speeds to 68 mph.|$|E

The work was conducted {{within the framework}} of the European project INTERACTION, and the main aim was to collect the opinions of drivers that had cruise control and <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> systems available for more than 1 year. A constant comparison analysis was performed and content categories compared among the sessions. This technique allowed assessing whether themes that emerged from one group also emerged in another. Results provide insights into the motives underlying system use and their effects on driving behaviour. A higher percentage of drivers reported using cruise control more frequently than <b>speed</b> <b>limiter.</b> Moreover, drivers having both systems used cruise control significantly more than <b>speed</b> <b>limiter.</b> Statements of ‘dislike’ were documented for <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> in several group sessions.

40|$|Indonesia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} number of {{fatalities}} caused by traffic accident. It is become main concern since last decades. Approximately of 10 % fatalities is caused by tank truck accident, it recorded by PT. Pertamina Persero, Indonesia in 2015 that 17 % and 20 % tank truck accident is caused by over speed and fatigue, respectively. Therefore, over speed has become main factor the occurrence of tank truck accident. Main objective of this research is to install <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> on the tank truck in order to improve safety engineering system, decrease accident and to maintain engine performance. This research is conducted in Indonesia especially in Java-Bali route travel. <b>Speed</b> <b>limiter</b> is installed to the tank truck engine which completed by fuel cut-off solenoid to reduce the speed automatically when it exceeding the maximum speed that has been determined. From the result shows that top speed which performed by driver up to 133 km/h when tank truck uninstalled by <b>speed</b> <b>limiter.</b> Meanwhile, when <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> is installed to the tank truck, top speed locked at 70 km/h even though the driver want to speed up. It means that fuel cut-off system is very effective to lock the speed at 70 km/h and it shown the improvement up to 65 %. The monitoring activities observed that the decreasing number of fatalities caused by tank truck accident become 7 % as compared to last year of 17 %. It can be found that the <b>speed</b> <b>limiter</b> coupled by <b>speed</b> recorder was very efficient to improve safety engineering system of the tank truck...|$|R

In order to understand the potential that these systems have in terms of road safety, it is crucial to understand how drivers percept the effects of the systems during the driving task. Then, the aim of the present research was to identify driver’s perceptions about the effects of speed regulation systems, more specifically the cruise control and the <b>speed</b> <b>limiter,</b> in the driving task and, to accomplish this goal, a questionnaire was applied. The main findings were that females are more prone to keep speeds equal to the road speed limit, and that when using both, cruise control and <b>speed</b> <b>limiter,</b> drivers are more available to comply with road speed limits. It was also found that the CC has a bigger impact than the SL when it comes to engaging into secondary tasks while driving...|$|R
