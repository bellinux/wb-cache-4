50|$|This book {{deals with}} {{assaying}} techniques. Various designs of furnaces are detailed. Then cupellation, crucibles, scorifiers and muffles are described. The correct {{method of preparation}} of the cupels is covered in detail with beech ashes being preferred. Various other additives and formulae are described, but Agricola does not judge between them. Triangular crucibles and scorifiers are made of fatty clay with a temper of ground-up crucibles or bricks. Agricola then describes in detail which substances should be added as fluxes as well as lead for smelting or assaying. The choice is made by which colour the ore burns out which gives {{an indication of the}} metals present. The lead should be silver-free or be assayed separately. The prepared ore is wrapped in paper, placed on a <b>scorifier</b> and then placed under a muffle covered in burning charcoal in the furnace. The cupel should be heated at the same time. The <b>scorifier</b> is removed and the metal transferred to the cupel. Alternatively the ore can be smelted in a triangular crucible, and then have lead mixed with it when it is added to the cupel. The cupel is placed in the furnace and copper is separated into the lead which forms lithage in the cupel leaving the noble metal. Gold and silver are parted using an aqua which is probably nitric acid. Agricola describes precautions for ensuring the amount of lead is correct and also describes the amalgamation of gold with mercury. Assay techniques for base metals such as tin are described as well as techniques for alloys such as silver tin. The use of a touchstone to assay gold and silver is discussed. Finally detailed arithmetical examples show the calculations needed to give the yield from the assay.|$|E
50|$|The {{refining}} {{of methods}} during the Medieval and Post Medieval periods {{led to the}} invention of the cupel which resembles a small egg cup, made of ceramic or bone ash which was used to separate base metals from noble metals. This process is known as cupellation. Cupellation started long before the Post Medieval period, however the first vessels made to carry out this process started in the 16th Century (Rehren 2003: p208). Another vessel used for the same process is a <b>scorifier</b> which is similar to a cupel but slightly larger and removes the lead and leaves the noble metals behind. Cupels and scorifiers were mass-produced as after each reduction the vessels would have absorbed all of the lead and become fully saturated. These vessels were also used in the process of Metallurgical Assay where the noble metals are removed from a coin or a weight of metal to determine the amount of the noble metals within the object.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{primarily}} at furthering {{our understanding of}} the technologies involved in the metallurgy of precious metals during the Renaissance, by combining a critical evaluation of historical texts with the analytical study of contemporary archaeological remains. In particular, this work focuses on high-temperature processes performed in the fire assay and smelting of ores, by investigating two archaeological case studies from sixteenth-century Austria: the small-scale laboratory of Oberstockstall – the most complete Renaissance laboratory ever recovered –, and the contemporary large-scale gold smelting site of the Angertal. The analytical techniques used are optical microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy-energy and wavelength dispersive spectrometry. In the Oberstockstall laboratory, the study of high-temperature residues produced in triangular crucibles, <b>scorifiers</b> and cupels allows a detailed examination of fire assay practice. The main technical sequence identified is a three-step fusion-scorification-cupellation process, performed on fahlores for their precious metal content, together with a wider range of experimental chymical activities, testing the properties of new materials and illustrating approaches that would prove fundamental in the development of chemistry and modern science. The analyses of metallurgical remains from the contemporary gold smelting site in the Angertal indicate that silver and gold were extracted from a variety of sulphidic minerals characteristic of the regional mineralisation, employing a very standardised technological sequence. Smelting such ores created lead bullion {{at the bottom of the}} furnace, which collected most of the noble metals, fayalitic slag on top, and matte in between. The significant gold and silver losses in matte, documented through experimental cupellation of archaeological samples, suggest the possibility of matte being re-smelted, while it demonstrates in practice the links that would have existed between small- and large-scale metallurgical processes. The archaeological and historical contextualisation of these reconstructions, and comparison with contemporary technical treatises, allow a detailed insight into early modern gold and silver extraction and highlight the potential of future work. ...|$|R
