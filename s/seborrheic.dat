5|$|<b>Seborrheic</b> {{dermatitis}} is a chronic, superficial, {{inflammatory disease}} characterized by scaling on an erythematous base.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis, {{and it may be}} difficult to distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
25|$|Seasonal changes, stress, and immuno-suppression seem {{to affect}} <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|For adults: see {{the article}} on <b>seborrheic</b> {{dermatitis}} (the adult version of cradle cap).|$|E
25|$|However, many melanomas {{present as}} lesions smaller than 6mm in diameter; and all melanomas are {{malignant}} {{when they first}} appear as a small dot. Physicians typically examine all moles, including those less than 6mm in diameter. <b>Seborrheic</b> keratosis may meet {{some or all of}} the ABCD criteria, and can lead to false alarms. Doctors can generally distinguish <b>seborrheic</b> keratosis from melanoma upon examination, or with dermatoscopy.|$|E
25|$|Topically {{administered}} ketoconazole {{is usually}} prescribed for fungal infections {{of the skin}} and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used {{as a treatment for}} dandruff (<b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis of the scalp) and for <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{dermatitis}} including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, and <b>seborrheic</b> eczema. Many use the term dermatitis and eczema synonymously.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{excessive}} {{alcohol abuse}} {{is associated with}} a wide range of skin disorders including urticaria, porphyria cutanea tarda, flushing, cutaneous stigmata of cirrhosis, psoriasis, pruritus, <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis and rosacea.|$|E
25|$|Steroid-induced rosacea {{is caused}} by the use of topical steroids. These steroids are often {{prescribed}} for <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis. Dosage should be slowly decreased and not immediately stopped to avoid a flare-up.|$|E
25|$|Dandruff a skin {{condition}} that affects mainly the scalp. Symptoms include flaking and sometimes mild itchiness. It {{can result in}} social or self-esteem problems. A more severe form of the condition, which includes inflammation of the skin, is known as <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} antimycotic agent that is active against Candida and M. furfur. Of all the antifungals of the imidazole class, ketoconazole has become the leading contender among treatment options because of its effectiveness in treating <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis as well.|$|E
25|$|In the past, some {{research}} suggested that geographic tongue {{was associated with}} diabetes, <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis and atopy, however newer research does not corroborate these findings. Others suggest allergy as a major factor, e.g. to nickel sulphate. Some studies have reported a link between geographic tongue and psoriasis, although 90% {{of children who are}} diagnosed with geographic tongue do not develop psoriasis. Again however, modern research studies do not support any link between psoriasis and geographic tongue. Lesions that are histologically indistinguishable from geographic tongue may also be diagnosed in reactive arthritis (arthritis, uveitis/conjunctivitis and urethritis).|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of cradle cap {{appears to be a}} common manifestation of biotin insufficiency. This may be due, in part, to the {{influence}} of biotin on fatty acid biosynthesis. Possibly {{it has to do with}} overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release a greasy substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry. There may be a relationship with skin yeasts (Pityrosporum ovale, newly renamed Malassezia furfur). <b>Seborrheic</b> dermatitis is the adult version of cradle cap.|$|E
25|$|The {{two factors}} that are {{required}} for external otitis to develop are (1) the presence of germs that can infect the skin and (2) impairments in {{the integrity of the}} skin of the ear canal that allow an infection to occur. If the skin is healthy and uninjured, only exposure to a high concentration of pathogens, such as submersion in a pond contaminated by sewage, is likely to set off an episode. However, if there are chronic skin conditions that affect the ear canal skin, such as atopic dermatitis, <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis, psoriasis or abnormalities of keratin production, or if there has been a break in the skin from trauma, even the normal bacteria found in the ear canal may cause infection and full-blown symptoms of external otitis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{disorder}} can {{be confused}} or co-exist with acne vulgaris or <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis.

2500|$|Cradle cap is <b>seborrheic</b> {{dermatitis}} {{that affects}} infants. [...] It presents on the scalp as greasy patches of scaling, which appear thick, crusty, yellow, white or brown.

2500|$|Seborrhoeic {{dermatitis}} or <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis ("cradle cap" [...] in infants) is {{a condition}} sometimes classified {{as a form of}} eczema that is closely related to dandruff. It causes dry or greasy peeling of the scalp, eyebrows, and face, and sometimes trunk. In newborns it causes a thick, yellow, crusty scalp rash called cradle cap, which seems related to lack of biotin and is often curable. (ICD-10 L21; L21.0) ...|$|E
2500|$|First, a {{diagnosis}} must be made. If the lesion is a <b>seborrheic</b> keratosis, then shave excision, electrodesiccation or cryosurgery may be performed, usually leaving very {{little if any}} scarring. If the lesion is suspected to be a skin cancer, a skin biopsy must be done first, before considering removal. This is unless an excisional biopsy is warranted. If the lesion is a melanocytic nevus, one has to decide if it is medically indicated or not ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis, {{on the other}} hand, tend to appear gradually, from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp (dandruff) to scaling of facial areas, sometimes with itching, but without hair loss. [...] In newborns, the condition causes a thick and yellowish scalp rash, often accompanied by a diaper rash. In severe cases, symptoms may appear along the hairline, behind the ears, on the eyebrows, {{on the bridge of}} the nose, around the nose, on the chest, and on the upper back.|$|E
2500|$|Animal {{studies have}} {{indicated}} few, if any, effects due to high level doses of biotin. [...] This may provide evidence that both animals and humans could tolerate doses of at least {{an order of magnitude}} greater than each of their nutritional requirements. [...] There are no reported cases of adverse effects from receiving high doses of the vitamin, in particular, when used in the treatment of metabolic disorders causing <b>seborrheic</b> dermatitis in infants. However, excess biotin accumulation can inhibit endogenous sirtuin activity leading to increased inflammation, cellularity, and collagen [...] deposition, and may be partly responsible for age related metabolic problems.

50|$|A <b>seborrheic</b> keratosis, {{also known}} as <b>seborrheic</b> verruca, basal cell papilloma, or a senile wart, is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that {{originates}} from cells in the outer layer of the skin (keratinocytes).

5000|$|Visual {{diagnosis}} {{is made by}} the [...] "stuck on" [...] appearance, horny pearls or cysts embedded in the structure. Darkly pigmented lesions can be challenging to distinguish from nodular melanomas. Furthermore, thin <b>seborrheic</b> keratoses on facial skin can {{be very difficult to}} differentiate from lentigo maligna even with dermatoscopy. Clinically, epidermal nevi are similar to <b>seborrheic</b> keratoses in appearance. Epidermal nevi are usually present at or near birth. Condylomas and warts can clinically resemble <b>seborrheic</b> keratoses, and dermatoscopy can be helpful. On the penis and genital skin, condylomas and <b>seborrheic</b> keratoses can be difficult to differentiate, even on biopsy.|$|E
