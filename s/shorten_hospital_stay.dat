40|$|Enhanced {{recovery}} {{is now a}} standard model of care in most UK elective surgical units. For hip and knee arthroplasty this approach typically includes opioid-sparing anesthesia (OSA), local infiltration analgesia (LIA), and day of surgery mobilization. There is evi-dence that these interventions <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay</b> and improve outcomes, without increasing complications or readmissions. These interventions may also benefit patients undergoing surgery for femoral neck (hip) fractures. This group of patients are frail and elderly, and {{are at high risk}} from surgery, anesthesia, and opioid and bed rest-related complications. Hip fractures are also a major public health concern. They are common, expensive to treat, and associated with poor outcomes. Despite this there are no published descriptions of the use of OSA and LIA to enable day of surgery mobilization in patients with hip fractures. We present 3 patients who underwent hip fracture surgery according to an enhanced recovery protocol that incorporated all 3 interventions. In each case day of surgery mobilization was achieved safely and comfortably, without requirement for strong opioids postopera-tively. The cases demonstrate that these interventions can be well tolerated by patients with hip fracture, including those with impaired mobility or cognitive function. The protocol is compatible with all common operations for hip fracture, and with spinal or general anesthesia. It is inexpensive and requires minimal expertise. It may have the potential to improve care and <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> while reducing cost. Further investigation is required...|$|E

40|$|AIMS—To improve energy intake in sick {{very low}} birthweight (VLBW) infants; to {{decrease}} growth problems, lessen pulmonary morbidity, <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> and avoid possible feeding related morbidity. Morbidity in VLBW infants {{thought to be}} associated with parenteral and enteral feeding includes bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis, septicaemia, cholestasis and osteopenia of prematurity.  METHODS—A prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing two types of nutritional intervention was performed involving 125  sick VLBW infants in the setting of a regional neonatal intensive care unit. Babies were randomly allocated to either an aggressive nutritional regimen (group A) or a control group (group B). Babies in group B received a conservative nutritional regimen while group A received a package of more aggressive parenteral and enteral nutrition. Statistical analysis was done using Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the χ 2 test and logistic regression.  RESULTS—There was an excess of sicker babies in group A, as measured by initial disease severity (P < 0. 01), but mean total energy intakes were significantly higher (P < 0. 001) in group A at days 3  to 42  while receiving total or partial parenteral nutrition. Survival and the incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, septicaemia, cholestasis, osteopenia and necrotising enterocolitis were similar in both groups. Growth in early life and at discharge from hospital was significantly better in babies in group A.  There were no decreases in pulmonary morbidity or hospital stay.  CONCLUSION—Nutritional intake in sick VLBW infants can be improved without increasing the risk of adverse clinical or metabolic sequelae. Improved nutritional intake resulted in better growth, both in the early neonatal period and at hospital discharge, but did not decrease pulmonary morbidity or <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b>    Keywords: very low birthweight infant; nutrition; bronchopulmonary dysplasia; necrotising enterocoliti...|$|E
30|$|The {{post-operative}} {{advantages of}} laparoscopy are commonly accepted. In fact, it may decrease pain, morbidity (pneumonia and wound infections) and mortality; in addition, it may increase prompt recovery of gastrointestinal functions, <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> carry a lower incidence of incisional hernias and lesser adhesions, thus decreasing health-care costs and allowing higher comfort and better cosmesis. All these advantages are also demostrated in emergency surgery (Di Saverio 2014; Agresta et al. 2004; Sangrasi et al. 2013; Sinha et al. 2005).The only data remaining controversial {{about the use}} of laparoscopy in acute care surgery are the possible disadvantages of longer operative times and of high intra-abdominal pressure, which both seem to have negative effects (Agresta et al. 2004, 2006). The latter can be reduced if the intraperitoneal pressure is maintained on or below 12  mmHg.|$|E

40|$|Less {{invasive}} {{approaches to}} cardiovascular surgery are used increasingly to reduce surgical trauma and <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay.</b> The rarely used upper partial sternotomy and parasternal incision can confer {{the advantages of}} a smaller surgical wound: reduced blood loss, decreased risk of infection, shorter intubation, earlier discharge, decreased postoperative pain, and a smaller, cosmetically more acceptable postoperative scar. Moreover, reoperation is less hazardous, because the pericardium was not completely dissected.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW The aim of {{this review}} is to {{critically}} appraise the existing evidence on 'early palliative care' (EPC), discuss its relationship with advance care planning, and {{to reflect on the}} impact of EPC on the quality of care provided during the last days of life.

40|$|Background: Many hospitalized {{patients}} with community acquired pneumoniae can be switched {{early in the}} course of therapy from intravenous to oral antibiotics, when there are subjective and objective indicators of improvement. This modality of treatment is called "switch therapy". Aim: To compare sequential therapy using an oral third generation cephalosporin, with conventional therapy using intravenous ceftriazone in community acquired pneumonia. Patients and methods: Forty patients admitted due to community acquired pneumonia, initially treated with ceftriazone 1 g/day iv and that showed clinical improvement after three days of therapy, were studied. They were randomly assigned to continue intravenous therapy with ceftriazone for a total of 10 days or switched to ceftibuten 400 mg od for seven days. Results: Twenty one patients continued iv treatment and 19 were switched to ceftibuten. There were no differences between both groups in terms of clinical cure, radiological improvement or normalisation of white blood cell count. Conclusions: Patients with community acquired pneumonia that have a good initial response to intravenous antimicrobials, can be safely switched to oral therapy.

40|$|Abstract Overcrowding of the {{emergency}} department (ED) is rapidly becoming a global challenge and {{a major source of}} concern for emergency physicians. The evaluation of cardiac biomarkers is critical for confirming diagnoses and expediting treatment decisions to reduce overcrowding, however, physicians currently face the dilemma of choosing between slow and accurate central-based laboratory tests, or faster but imprecise assays. With improvements in technology, point-of-care testing (POCT) systems facilitate the efficient and high-throughput evaluation of biomarkers, such as troponin (cTn), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). In this context, POCT may help ED physicians to confirm a diagnosis of conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome, heart failure or kidney damage. Compared with classic laboratory methods, the use of cTn, BNP, and NGAL POCT has shown comparable sensitivity, specificity and failure rate, but with the potential to provide prompt and accurate diagnosis, <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> and alleviate the burden on the ED. Despite this potential, the full advantages of rapid delivery results will only be reached if POCT is implemented within hospital standardized procedures and ED staff receive appropriate training...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{review the}} risk factors for {{surgical}} would infection; the use of prophylactic antibiotics {{in the prevention of}} wound infection; and the benefits of wound surveillance programmes to reduce the rate of surgical wound infection. Data sources. Medline literature search and review of published work on surgical wound infection, and the references cited in them. Study selection. Critical studies containing supporting evidence were selected. Data extraction. Data were extracted independently by multiple observers. Data synthesis. Factors that effect the susceptibility of a wound to infection include a pre-existing illness, the duration of the operative procedure, wound contamination, three or more diagnoses at the time of discharge, and abdominal operations. Antibiotic prophylaxis can decrease postoperative morbidity, <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay,</b> and reduce overall costs attributable to infection; the choice of antibiotic depends on the would class. Wound surveillance can also decrease wound infection rates. Conclusion. Surgical wound infections are common and consume a considerable portion of health care finances.

40|$|Postoperative ileus is a {{frequently}} occurring surgical complication, {{leading to}} increased morbidity and hospital stay. Abdominal surgical interventions {{are known to}} result in a protracted cessation of bowel movement. Activation of inhibitory neural pathways by nociceptive stimuli leads to an inhibition of propulsive activity, which resolves shortly after closure of the abdomen. The subsequent formation of an inflammatory infiltrate in the muscular layers of the intestine results in a more prolonged phase of ileus. Over the last decade, clinical strategies focusing on reduction of surgical stress and promoting postoperative recovery have improved the course of postoperative ileus. Additionally, recent experimental evidence implicated antiinflammatory interventions, such as vagal stimulation, as potential targets to treat postoperative ileus and reduce the period of intestinal hypomotility. Activation of nicotinic receptors on inflammatory cells by vagal input attenuates inflammation and promotes gastrointestinal motility in experimental models of ileus. A novel physiological intervention to activate this neuroimmune pathway is enteral administration of lipid-rich nutrition. Perioperative administration of lipid-rich nutrition reduced manipulation-induced local inflammation of the intestine and accelerated recovery of bowel movement. The application of safe and easy to use antiinflammatory interventions, together with the current multimodal approach, could reduce postoperative ileus to an absolute minimum and <b>shorten</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>stay...</b>|$|E
