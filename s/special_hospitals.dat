5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression. For this purpose, Anatoly Prokopenko selected suitable archival documents and, {{at the request of}} Vladimir Naumov, the head of research and publications at the Commission, Emmanuil Gushansky drew up the report. It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> under MVD control). When the materials for discussion in the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill. The documents failed to reach the head of the Commission Alexander Yakovlev.|$|E
6000|$|To lift up {{the man who}} {{has been}} {{stricken}} on the battlefield, restore him to the utmost of health and agility, give him an adequate pension, and re-equip him with an occupation suited to the forces left him--that is a process which does not cease till the sufferer fronts the future keen, hopeful, and secure. And such restoration is at least as much a matter of spirit as of body. Consider what it means to fall suddenly out of full vigour into the dark certainty that you can never have full strength again, though you live on twenty, forty, sixty years. The flag of your courage may well be down half-mast! Apathy--that creeping nerve disease--is soon your bed-fellow and the companion of your walks. A curtain has fallen before your vision; your eyes no longer range. The Russian [...] "Nichevo"--the [...] "what-does-it-matter?" [...] mood--besets you. Fate seems to say to you: [...] "Take the line of least resistance, friend--you are done for!" [...] But the sacred work says to Fate: [...] "Retro, Satanas! This our comrade is not your puppet. He shall yet live as happy and as useful--if not as active--a life as he ever lived before. You shall not crush him! We shall tend him from clearing station till his discharge better than wounded soldier has ever yet been tended. In <b>special</b> <b>hospitals,</b> orthopædic, paraplegic, phthisic, neurasthenic, we shall give him back functional ability, solidity of nerve or lung. The flesh torn away, the lost sight, the broken ear-drum, the destroyed nerve, it is true, we cannot give back; but we shall so re-create and fortify the rest of him that he shall leave hospital ready for a new career. Then we shall teach him how to tread the road of it, so that he fits again into the national life, becomes once more a workman with pride in his work, a stake in the country, and the consciousness that, handicapped though he be, he runs the race level with his fellows, and is by that so much the better man than they. And beneath the feet of this new workman we shall put the firm plank of a pension." ...|$|E

50|$|Wish is a {{national}} charity that was founded in 1987 by Prue Stevenson, Terri Simpson and Kimberley Andrews. At the time, Prue {{was working in the}} Education Department at HMP Holloway in London. She became concerned about the high number of women whose mental health deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} they were transferred to the High Secure Hospitals, then known as <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> (Broadmoor Hospital, Rampton Secure Hospital and Ashworth Hospital). Terri and Kim were former patients who had spent many years in High Secure hospitals. Female patients in these hospitals were often subjected to appalling and degrading conditions, and many didn't require such a high level of security. The three women got together to form Wish with the aim of supporting women still in <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> and prison psychiatric units, and to campaign to change policy and attitudes.|$|E

40|$|Background It {{has been}} argued that many {{patients}} in <b>special</b> <b>hospital</b> beds {{do not need to be}} there. In the 1990 s there were initiatives to discharge women and people with learning difficulties. Aims To test for trends in <b>special</b> <b>hospital</b> discharges and to examine annual resident cohorts. Method This study was from case registers and hospital records. The main measures were numbers and annual rates for referrals and beds offered; the Mental Health Act 1983 (MHA) classification of mental disorder; adjusted population rates by region; admission episodes; legal category of detention; admission source and type of offence. Results The median annual number of residents was 1859 (range 1697 - 1910), with an 8...|$|R

50|$|During the 16th century, {{there were}} three plague {{epidemics}} in 1505, 1551 and 1592; leprosy also killed many people.

5000|$|Special health {{authorities}} {{were set to}} provide a national service to the NHS or the public, under section 11 of the National Health Service Act 1977. [...] Prior to {{the repeal of the}} whole of the 1977 Act by the NHS (Consequential Provisions) Act 2006, special {{health authorities}} included both infrastructure support organisations and national/specialist treatment providers such as the <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> Service Authority and the Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Special Health Authority. These direct clinical service providers were progressively merged with local NHS trusts and consequently with mainstream governance and funding arrangements.|$|E
50|$|A {{religious}} order operating in Vienna, the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, created <b>special</b> <b>hospitals</b> for {{both children and}} adults during the 1679 epidemic. The basic nursing care offered in the hospitals was simple, but was generally a vast improvement over other medical and public health measures in the city. Doctors treated patients by using emetics, bloodletting, and by applying noxious ointments. The corpses of plague victims were carted to the outer edges {{of the city and}} placed in large open pits for burning. However, the pits were exposed to the open air for several days until they were nearly full, allowing ongoing infection of the rat population.|$|E
50|$|From its opening, until 1948, Broadmoor was {{managed by}} a Council of Supervision, {{appointed}} by and {{reporting to the}} Home Secretary. Thereafter, the Criminal Justice Act of 1948 transferred ownership of the hospital to the Department of Health (and the newly formed NHS) and oversight to the Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency established under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913. It also renamed the hospital Broadmoor Institution. The hospital remained under direct control of the Department of Health - a situation which reportedly 'combined notional central control with actual neglect' until {{the establishment of the}} <b>Special</b> <b>Hospitals</b> Service Authority in 1989, with Charles Kaye as its first chief executive.|$|E
