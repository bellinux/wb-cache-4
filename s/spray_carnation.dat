40|$|Effects of {{nutrient}} solution concentration on cut flower yield, quality {{and characteristics of}} seasonal nutrient absorption of <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> ‘Barbara’ grown by cultivation in drip fertigation were investigated. 'Barbara' was grown with a {{nutrient solution}} (N: 15 %, P: 6. 5 %, K: 12. 5 %, Ca: 3. 6 %, Mg: 0. 9 %), at three concentration levels which were high concentration (1, 000 times), middle concentration (1, 500 times) and low concentration (3, 000 times). The daily amount of nutrient solution was ranged from 0. 0 mm to 13. 9 mm. The total cut flower yield of middle concentration and high concentration were bigger than that of low concentration. The weight of the second cut flower of low concentration was decreased as {{compared to that of}} middle concentration and high concentration. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in the plant nutrient ratio were decreased as the increase of dry matter and phosphorus (P) was increased at autumn and spring. With a reduction in the soil nutrient contents, Nitrogen and potassium in the plant nutrient ratio of low concentration were decreased. Nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil nutrient contents of high concentration were increased at the end of cultivation. In the total nutrient absorbed amount of middle concentration, 2, 807. 9 mg nitrogen, 493. 5 mg phosphorus, 3, 667. 4 mg potassium, 1, 615. 8 mg calcium (Ca) and 320. 9 mg magnesium (Mg) were absorbed per plant. In spring, the ratio of nitrogen absorbed amount to nutrients absorbed amount was increased 1. 3 times. Phosphorus ratio and phosphorus absorbed amount in <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> were fewer than that of standard carnation. There were no differences in total nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium absorption between <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> and standard carnation. スプレーカーネーションのかん水同時施肥法における養分吸収特性を‘バーバラ’で調査した．窒素：リン（P）：カリウム（K）：カルシウム（Ca）：マグネシウム（Mg）の含有率（%）が 15 ： 6. 5 ： 12. 5 ： 3. 6 ： 0. 9 の液肥を，低濃度（ 3, 000 倍），中濃度（ 1, 500 倍），高濃度（ 1, 000 倍）の 3 水準で，毎日 0. 0 ～ 13. 9 ㎜ずつ点滴給液した．切り花収量は中濃度区と高濃度区が多く，切り花品質は 2 番花において低濃度区の切り花重が減少した．植物体の窒素およびカリウム含有率は乾物増加量が増大するにつれて低下し，リンは秋期と春期に減少した．低濃度区の窒素，カリウムの含有率は土壌養分含有量の減少にともない，低下した．高濃度区では土壌の窒素およびリン含有量が栽培終了時に大幅に増大した．中濃度での給液における１株当たりの総養分吸収量は窒素が 2, 807. 0 ㎎，リンが 493. 5 ㎎，カリウムが 3, 667. 4 ㎎，カルシウムが 1, 615. 8 ㎎，マグネシウムが 320. 9 ㎎であった．リン，カリウム，カルシウム，マグネシウムの窒素に対する吸収割合はいずれも春期に約 1. 3 倍に上昇した．スタンダードカーネーションとの比較では，スプレーカーネーションでは，ややリンの植物体含有率と吸収量が少ないが，窒素，カリウム，カルシウム，マグネシウムの植物体含有率および吸収量には，ほとんど差がなかった...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of three polyamines (PAs) on antioxidants capacity, free radical scavenging and vase life improvement of <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> cut flowers. Hence, the cut flowers were dipped in different concentrations (0, 1, 2 and 3 mmol) of putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) for 24 h. After treatment, the cut flowers were placed in distilled water and kept at 20 °C ± 2 °C, 70 - 80  % RH. All concentrations of Put treatment improved the vase life of cut <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> flowers as compared to control. The highest positive influence on vase life (with 13 days) was related to 2 mmol Put treatments. Result showed that applying Put and Spm treatments at 1 or 2  mmol concentration significantly minimized the percentage of mass loss compared to the control. A significant inhibition of anthocyanin degradation was observed with Put 1 or 2  mmol and Spm 1 mmol Significantly higher activities of catalase and DPPH radical scavenging activity were observed in petals when cut carnations were treated with 1 mmol Put. It can be concluded that application of polyamines such as putrescine can play a key role to prevent or delay deterioration in cut flowers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Conditions {{for plant}} {{regeneration}} of leaf explant from Bulgarian <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> cultivars (Fea and Rossitza) were established. Solid MS medium supplemented with BAP and NAA {{was used for}} direct induction of adventitious shoots. The optimal medium for regeneration for both cultivars contained 0. 9 mg/l BAP and 0. 9 mg/l NAA. The mean number of regene-rants per explant varied 7 - 8 for tested cvs. Regenerated plants possessed normal pheno-type. At dark and light conditions induction of embryogenic callus were observed for both cultivars. Vigor somatic embryos were obtained on embryo formation medium supple-mented with 0. 05 mg/l BAP and 250 mg/l casein hydrolysate. They developed to plants with normal phenotype and rooted easily at in vitro condition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>carnations</b> (Dianthus caryophyllus ‘Exquisite’), planted as potted {{cuttings}} in December, had {{a maximum}} dry-matter production in summer of 22 g m− 2 day− 1, {{calculated for the}} net surface area completely covered by the crop. This value is fairly similar to the maxima established for outdoor crops in The Netherlands. The cation contents in the whole plant, expressed as percentages of dry matter, followed the series Na <Mg <Ca <K. They displayed no significant deviations from what {{was found in the}} literature for perpetual-flowering carnations. Growth was slow in the early phase of the crop and the cation accumulation was correspondingly slight. Growth increased at about 3 months after planting out. Over the period from March to September (24 weeks), the contents established in the aerial parts of the <b>spray</b> <b>carnations</b> amounted to 0. 2 kg Na, 6. 2 kg K, 2. 9 kg Ca and 0. 6 kg Mg per 100 m 2 gross...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{succinic acid}} (0, 1 and 2 mM), malic acid (0, 1 and 2 mM), ethanol (0, 2 and 4 % v/v), and their {{mixtures}} were applied as preservative solutions for cut flowers of spread carnation cv. ‘White Natila’ and {{their effect on}} the longevity, the amount of absorbed solution, malondialdehyde and chlorophyll content, cell membrane stability, fresh, and dry weight and on a visual quality was determined. A similarity in the effect of malic acid and succinic acid on dry weight and fresh weight loss were found. Ethanol positively affected most of the studied traits, including the vase life and fresh weight loss. The preservative solution containing 1 mM of malic acid and 4 % ethanol resulted in the longest average vase life - 11. 1 days compared to 8. 9 days in the control. Malic acid showed a significant positive synergism with ethanol that makes it reasonable to combine them in preservative solutions intended to extend the vase life of cut <b>spray</b> <b>carnation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of three}} {{planting}} patterns; two-row-planting high density (25 plants·m(- 2)), two-row-planting low density (12. 5 plants·m(- 2)), and four-row-planting (25 plants·m(- 2)) on the cut flower number {{and quality of}} <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) cv. ‘Barbara’ and ‘Cherry Tessino’ grown by fertigation cultivation were investigated. In ‘Barbara’, {{there was no difference}} in total cut flower number between two-row-planting high density and four-row-planting. Total cut flower number of two-row-planting low density decreased to 60 % of two-row-planting high density or four-row-planting. In ‘Cherry Tessino’, the total cut flower number of two-row-planting high density was 15 % more than that of four-row-planting. The total cut flower number of two-row-planting low density decreased to 60 ~ 70 % of two-row-planting high density or four-row-planting. There was no difference in cut flower quality between two-row-planting high density and four-row-planting in both cultivars. Cut flower weight and stem diameter of two-row-planting low density increased compared to those of two-row-planting high density or four-row-planting. Thus, the result indicates that two-row-planting high density may be suitable for fertigation cultivation in carnation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{important}} breeding {{goals in}} ornamental crops are plant appearance and flower characteristics where selection is visually performed on direct offspring of crossings. We developed an image analysis toolbox for {{the acquisition of}} flower and petal images from cultivated carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) that was validated by {{a detailed analysis of}} flower and petal size and shape in 78 commercial cultivars of D. caryophyllus, including 55 standard, 22 spray and 1 pot carnation cultivars. Correlation analyses allowed us {{to reduce the number of}} parameters accounting for the observed variation in flower and petal morphology. Convexity was used as a descriptor for the level of serration in flowers and petals. We used a landmark-based approach that allowed us to identify eight main principal components (PCs) accounting for most of the variance observed in petal shape. The effect and the strength of these PCs in standard and <b>spray</b> <b>carnation</b> cultivars are consistent with shared underlying mechanisms involved in the morphological diversification of petals in both subpopulations. Our results also indicate that neighbor-joining trees built with morphological data might infer certain phylogenetic relationships among carnation cultivars. Based on estimated broad-sense heritability values for some flower and petal features, different genetic determinants shall modulate the responses of flower and petal morphology to environmental cues in this species. We believe our image analysis toolbox could allow capturing flower variation in othe...|$|E
