Thus any illegal acquisition of land lacks legal status, then land title regularization will be necessary. When designing and implementing land regularization, the citizen’s opinion is not usually taken into consideration. This study fills this gap by taking statistically representative samples of the opinion of home owners in Ogun State, Nigeria on their level of satisfaction with the latest land regularization policy of Ogun State government. We adopted a purposive sample technique, and we administered a Questionnaire survey to property owners in the study area. Data gathered were analyzed using descriptive method of statistics and the level of satisfaction of the respondents was evaluated based on relevant criteria adopting a 4 point Likert scale. We found that that none of the respondents acquired their through a formal source and none of the have the <b>statutory</b> <b>certificate</b> of occupancy for their land.    We also measured the level of satisfaction of the respondents and we found that the property owners dissatisfied with the extent of high-handedness of the staff of the regularization agency and the level of transparency of the scheme. It was also found that home owners mostly dissatisfied with the amount paid for the application and the procedure for processing title documents. It is very important for the government to address dissatisfaction of the citizens with the scheme and to subsequently include sampling opinion of citizen’s level of satisfaction {{as an integral part of}} land regularization policies...|$|E

Vessels 15 years or older must have a Status Report of the vessel's Special Survey to be reviewed by Marine Safety. Registries charge a registration fee and annual fees.|$|R

Andhra Pradesh is the first state in India to design a state-wide computerization program covering all levels of the administrative spectrum from the smallest—the Mandal Revenue Offices—to the top-most, largest and most powerful. This paper presents a review of the computerization program of the 1, 124 Mandal Revenue Offices in the state and its first application—the delivery of <b>statutory</b> <b>certificates</b> stating caste, place and date of birth, and land holding, to individuals in a few minutes without the current delay of 20 to 30 days...|$|R
50|$|Revenue {{functions}} involve {{maintenance of}} land records, conduct of revenue cases, carrying out of demarcation and mutations, settlement operations and functioning as custodian of public land. Sub Divisional Magistrates are designated as Assistant Collectors and Revenue Assistants and are {{primarily responsible for}} day to day revenue work. The subordinate revenue staff consisting of Girdavars, Kanungos and Patwaries are supervised by Tehsildars who are involved in field level revenue activities and mutations. They are also empowered to issue various kinds of <b>statutory</b> <b>certificates</b> including SC/ST & OBC, Domicile, Nationality etc. Registration of Property documents, sale deeds, power of attorneys, share certificates and all other documents which need to be compulsorily registered as per law is made at Sub Registrar's Office which are nine in numbers. Deputy Commissioners are Registrars for their respective districts and exercise supervisory control over the Sub Registrars.|$|R
50|$|Documentary {{evidence}} of a change of name can be {{in a number of}} forms, such as a marriage certificate, decree absolute, civil partnership <b>certificate,</b> <b>statutory</b> declaration or deed of change of name. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing {{evidence of}} a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.|$|R
