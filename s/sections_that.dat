5|$|Interstate 96 {{was mostly}} {{constructed}} in <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> opened from 1957 to 1962, {{but it was}} not completed in the Detroit area until 1977. Even before the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act was signed in 1956, the route was being planned as a replacement of the old US16, which was decommissioned in 1962.|$|E

50|$|The only {{sections}} of SR 243 {{that are part}} of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense, are the <b>section</b> <b>that</b> runs along the Fall Line Freeway and the <b>section</b> <b>that</b> is concurrent with US 441 Business.|$|R
5|$|MD 170 {{is a part}} of the National Highway System {{from its}} {{southern}} terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within that stretch, there are two <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials.|$|E
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow. This image, copied from the symbol used for waymarking the Ulster Way, has become the traditional waymarking symbol {{for all of the}} National Waymarked Trails in Ireland. Brown fingerposts are used on <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} and {{was bought by}} the state in 1886. This briefly gave it a new lease of life, but the canal had an obsolete gauge. By {{the start of the}} 20th century it was almost abandoned. The canal was neglected and parts were filled in. In the 1970s the A47 autoroute between Givors and Saint-Étienne covered almost all the <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> remained, apart from the site at Tartaras where the double lock and tunnel have been preserved as a heritage site.|$|E

5|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order is an action-adventure and first-person shooter {{video game}} played from a first-person perspective. To {{progress}} through the story, players battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> regenerate; if an entire section is lost, players must use a health pack to replenish the missing health.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply {{in the coming days}} and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> are not are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 {{just east of}} Culmer station, and the {{northern}} end of the line from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a new test track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|Lodges {{are grouped}} into <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a {{volunteer}} adult is appointed as the section adviser, {{and the area}} director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following {{the election of the}} section chief at the section's annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late spring or early fall. The section officers lead the planning of this weekend {{with the help of the}} lodge chiefs in the section.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Sora, {{along with}} his allies, both possess a Hit Point (HP) meter and a Magic Point (MP) meter, which {{increase}} as they gain experience and level up. The MP meter is divided into various <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic using more MP. MP can be replenished by performing melee attacks or using items. The HP meter determines the character's health, reducing whenever a character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora's allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily until someone heals them. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play {{from the beginning of}} an area or boss. Defeating enemies causes various orbs to fall; green orbs which replenish health, blue orbs which restore MP, and yellow orbs which represent Munny, the game's currency, which can be used to purchase new items.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} future, in the year 2039, where humans have begun deep space exploration. A {{distress}} call is transmitted from a crippled ship near an alien planet. The game's protagonist, a special soldier, responds to the call. Upon boarding the ship, the soldier discovers it has been overrun by hostile aliens. The aliens have captured the human crew for an unknown purpose. The story has <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> take place aboard the space craft and on the planet's surface. The protagonist's overall goal is to rescue as many human hostages as possible, eliminate the alien threat, and escape the space craft.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent takedowns, {{dropping}} from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> require the player {{to use these}} tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor grates to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel gun to pull enemies over ledges.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 2000s and despite heavy traffic, Illinois 22 {{generally}} remained a two lane road. The only <b>sections</b> <b>that</b> were four lanes were the intersections of Illinois 83, Buffalo Grove Road, Milwaukee Avenue, Interstate 94, Illinois 43, and U.S. 41. The lengthy two lane gaps in between those intersections, {{as well as}} the rest of Illinois 22 were heavily discussed for expansion starting in the early 1990s. These discussions included plans that called for additional lanes on its entire length from U.S. 14 to U.S. 41, including widening a section from U.S. 12 to Milwaukee Avenue to six lanes. Also mentioned was a bypass around the narrow, downtown area of Lake Zurich.|$|E
