5|$|As {{the creek}} enters Union Township, its valley briefly becomes very deep before {{becoming}} shallower again. It picks up Dark Run in the township. The creek flows along the East Union Township/Union Township border before entering North Union Township. Upon entering North Union Township, Catawissa Creek flows northwards {{until it reaches}} the community of Zion Grove, where it takes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> northwest. At Zion Grove, {{the walls of the}} creek's valley again become considerably higher and steeper. As it exits Zion Grove, it picks up Tomhicken Creek. Catawissa Creek takes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the west and flows under Red Ridge. At the western edge of Red Ridge, the creek takes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> northwards, followed shortly afterwards by a gentle turn westwards. It picks up Crooked Run at the edge of North Union Township, and then flows into Columbia County.|$|E
5|$|A seven-mile (11km) journey over {{increasingly}} {{rolling and}} open terrain takes the two highways {{into the town}} of North East and towards Millerton. Just south of the village, NY199 reaches its eastern terminus. The road enters Millerton on South Elm Street, making a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> north that necessitates a concrete barrier and a lower speed limit just south of downtown.|$|E

5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on a corner of land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner may relate to the <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> in the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Sullivan County, West Branch Fishing Creek enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. Immediately after {{entering}} Columbia County, the creek {{flows through the}} community of Elk Grove. It flows east-southeast for a short distance before reaching the communities of Central and Jamison City. The creek then makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> south and flows between Central Mountain and Huckleberry Mountain and into a plain. After some distance, it turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 118. Several hundred feet downstream, it and East Branch Fishing Creek merge to form Fishing Creek.|$|E
5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp bend in the Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E

5|$|Catawissa Creek enters Columbia County in Beaver Township. It {{immediately}} {{passes by}} Bunker Hill and makes several meanders and passes by Beaver Valley. An old Conrail railroad starts paralleling Catawissa Creek at this point. In {{the southern part}} of Beaver Township, the creek is situated between Buck Mountain to the east and Catawissa Mountain to the west. The creek takes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> westwards as it passes by Shumans, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses the creek and Beaver Run flows into it. The creek closely follows Catawissa Mountain for a short distance before turning northwards and passing close to McCauley Mountain. It meanders past Dry Ridge and then Full Mill Hill, where Pennsylvania Route 339 crosses it again. The creek makes a hairpin turn northwards and picks up Gap Run before exiting Beaver Township.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{the route}} becomes a two-lane {{undivided}} road that continues northeast through {{a mix of}} woods and farms with some development, passing under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. After passing through the community of Hainesburg, the road turns more {{to the east and}} enters Blairstown Township. Route 94 turns northeast before reaching the community of Blairstown, where the road continues east past some development before intersecting CR 521. It forms a short wrong-way concurrency with that route, along which it crosses the Paulins Kill. A short distance later, Route 94 enters Frelinghuysen Township, passing through more rural surroundings. The road turns northeast through the community of Marksboro before heading east again. After the intersection with CR 661, Route 94 makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origins}} to {{approximately}} {{the area of}} Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, US112 was {{originally}} proposed {{to run from}} Oshkosh to Fremont, Wisconsin, on what later became U.S. Route 110. When it was initially designated in November 1926, US112 made a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the southwest to connect to US20 in Elkhart, Indiana. In 1931, a new trunkline highway was designated between M-60 at Niles and US112 at Union. This highway was numbered M-151. In 1933, the section of US112 from Union to Elkhart was renumbered US112S. M-151 and US112S each lasted until 1935 when US112 was extended to replace M-151. US112 was also extended to run concurrently with M-60 to New Buffalo, and US112S was renumbered M-205.|$|E
5|$|NY216's western {{terminus}} is at {{an intersection}} with NY52 {{just south of the}} Trump National Golf Club in Stormville, a hamlet within the town of East Fishkill. It heads northeast into the center of Stormville and intersects with Old Route52, a former alignment of NY52. The route makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the north before intersecting with Phillips Road and turning eastward. Proceeding east, NY216 intersects Green Haven Road (County Route8 or CR8) in the hamlet of Green Haven. South of this intersection is the Green Haven Correctional Facility. After intersecting with several local roads, it turns north and intersects Main Street (CR7) in the Beekman hamlet of Poughquag. South of the Beekman Cemetery, NY216 terminates at NY55.|$|E
5|$|Past MS25, MS172 passes several {{businesses}} in Iuka {{as it comes}} to the MS25 Business junction. The route continues east through wooded residential neighborhoods prior to making a turn to the southeast. MS172 leaves Iuka and heads back into forests as an unnamed road, running a short distance to the southwest of a Norfolk Southern railroad line. Further southeast, the route draws closer to US72 and curves to the east, passing a few fields. MS172 makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> south away from the railroad tracks and comes to its eastern terminus at US72 immediately west of the Alabama border near Oldham. MS172 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.|$|E
50|$|Berm {{a curved}} wallride {{that comes out}} of the ground. Mostly used on <b>sharp</b> <b>turns,</b> berms assist riders by giving them the ability to bank sharply, and make a <b>sharper</b> <b>turn.</b> Mainly used on {{downhill}} trails, but can also be present alongside dirt jumps to help riders avoid hitting trees. They are also used to maintain riders' speed without having to brake on turns. Some trails consist of jumps that lead into berms.|$|R

40|$|The {{locomotion}} of Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits complex patterns. In particular, {{the worm}} combines mildly curved runs and <b>sharp</b> <b>turns</b> to steer its course. Both runs and <b>sharp</b> <b>turns</b> {{of various types}} are important components of taxis behavior. The statistics of <b>sharp</b> <b>turns</b> have been intensively studied. However, {{there have been few}} studies on runs, except for those on klinotaxis (also called weathervane mechanism), in which the worm gradually curves toward the direction with a high concentration of chemicals; this phenomenon was discovered recently. We analyzed the data of runs by excluding <b>sharp</b> <b>turns.</b> We show that the curving rate obeys long-tail distributions, which implies that large curving rates are relatively frequent. This result holds true for locomotion in environments both with and without a gradient of NaCl concentration; it is independent of klinotaxis. We propose a phenomenological computational model {{on the basis of a}} random walk with multiplicative noise. The assumption of multiplicative noise posits that the fluctuation of the force is proportional to the force exerted. The model reproduces the long-tail property present in the experimental data.

5|$|The {{results were}} inconclusive, as {{three weeks of}} {{surveying}} in almost continuous bad weather during July and August 1980 failed to find Titanic. The problem was exacerbated by technological limitations; the Sea MARC sonar used by the expedition had a relatively low resolution and was a new and untested piece of equipment. It was nearly lost only 36 hours after it was first deployed when the tail was ripped off during a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn,</b> destroying the magnetometer, {{which would have been}} vital for detecting Titanics hull. Nonetheless it managed to survey an area of some 500 square nautical miles and identified 14 possible targets.|$|E
5|$|The road {{continues}} north, still paralleling the Nine Mile Creek, {{into the}} town of Camillus. In Bennetts Corners, NY174 intersects with Forward Road (unsigned NY931F), a connector road to NY321, then changes direction to head northeast. The road passes by Nose Hill before entering the village of Camillus. In the village center, NY174 makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the west onto West Genesee Street, where it {{comes to an end}} just west of the village line at a junction with NY5 (where its freeway begins) that includes a jughandle, a slip road onto the freeway. NY174 is located along a geological feature known as a mapped sedimentary bedrock unit, known as the Marcellus Formation. The formation is named for an outcrop found near the town of Marcellus, New York, during a geological survey in 1839.|$|E
5|$|Upon exiting Elk Township, Kettle Creek enters Abbott Township, Potter County. It heads southwest, passing Bear Run Ridge, Rawson Ridge, Big Ridge, {{and several}} hollows, also picking up several small tributaries along the way. After a few miles, it enters Stewardson Township. Its course {{takes on a}} west-southwest {{direction}} and it passes by the community of Oleona, where it picks up the tributary Little Kettle Creek. It also begins paralleling Pennsylvania Route 144 at this point. Kettle Creek then makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the south-southwest. The course soon resumes its southwestern direction, passing through Ole Bull State Park. The creek passes Keeney Mountain and several more hollows before turning west-northwest briefly {{to pick up the}} tributary Cross Fork in the southwestern reaches of Stewardson Township. The creek then turns southwest again and leaves the township.|$|E

5|$|Within Lake Forest Park, SR522 {{is named}} Bothell Way, and follows the {{northern}} shore of Lake Washington. SR522 intersects Ballinger Way (SR104) at the city's downtown shopping center, and {{is joined by}} the Burke-Gilman Trail running along the lakefront. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of Kenmore, passing the Kenmore Air Harbor seaplane base and {{the mouth of the}} Sammamish River. SR522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> north towards Bothell. The highway turns east, passing downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the Sammamish River Trail) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly SR527). Leaving Bothell, SR522 passes around the southern edge of University of Washington Bothell campus and intersects I-405, becoming a grade-separated freeway.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} August 10, {{computer}} models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate {{to the northeast}} and become extratropical within three days, but this did not materialize. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto’s motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed {{to the north and}} west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) on August 20, and a 70mi (110km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105mph (165km/h).|$|E
5|$|At this point, US 1/9 turns east off Broad Avenue {{to merge}} onto US 46, {{which is a}} four-lane freeway. This freeway makes a <b>sharp</b> <b>turn</b> to the {{north-northeast}} and has partial interchanges {{at both ends of}} the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US 1/9/46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US 1/9/46 all join I-95 and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings as it heads east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
