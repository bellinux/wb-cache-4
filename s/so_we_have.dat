5|$|By {{what right}} do you dare accuse the nation of... want of {{perseverance}} in the emperor's interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia.... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, and in doing <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to mourn the blood of three million Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve {{all been}} waiting to learn what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
25|$|A. Ideas {{are always}} imagistic (3rd), <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{no idea of}} {{thinking}} substance (non-image idea).|$|E
6000|$|... "Even <b>so,</b> Fred. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> {{overshot}} our time, and {{the captain}} is signalling us to make haste. He {{said that he would}} not fire unless there seemed some prospect of the ice moving, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better run, unless we wish to be left behind; come along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Syme, [...] "it {{seems that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{all the same}} kind of {{morality}} or immorality, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better face the fact that comes of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{be back to}} {{the grind}} day after to-morrow, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better {{make the best of}} it," [...] was the way Dave {{expressed}} himself.|$|R
25|$|For each object Y in D, {{choose an}} initial {{morphism}} (F(Y), ηY) from Y to G, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ηY : Y → G(F(Y)). We have {{the map of}} F on objects and the family of morphisms η.|$|E
25|$|Distinctions may be {{made between}} {{particular}} kinds of names simply by using the suffix -onym, from the Greek ὄνομα (ónoma) 'name'. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> for example, hydronyms name bodies of water, synonyms are names with the same meaning, and so on. The entire field {{could be described as}} chrematonymy - the names of things.|$|E
25|$|The {{tendency}} for research to {{flow from the}} public {{to the private sector}} is confirmed by Ruben Sinisterra, a researcher at the Federal University of Minas Gerais who has been developing drugs to alleviate hypertension. Brazilian universities now have the capacity to develop nanoscale materials for drug delivery, he says, but ‘our domestic pharmaceutical companies don’t have internal capabilities in research and development, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to work with them to push new products and processes out to market’.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{you know}} it was Dick's {{birthday}} yesterday, and we boys thought we would celebrate a bit. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a little blow-out in our room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they are}} going to make a sally, Albert. If <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> best make off to our lodgings, throw off these garments, and appear in our own." ...|$|R
60|$|The trip didn't take forty minutes, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{scarcely}} time {{to learn}} the whole art of engine-driving, but we were very glad {{to have had the}} ride.|$|R
25|$|It is now {{believed}} that the club was originally a Thursday Club in the literal sense {{but that it was}} understood from the beginning that it considered itself to be representative of Middlesex as a county. It may even have had a Middlesex birth qualification for membership, like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|In his autobiography, Chuck Yeager also writes, however, {{that part}} of the {{ingrained}} culture of test flying at the time, due to the fearsome mortality rates of the pilots, was anger directed at pilots who died in test flights, to avoid being overcome by sorrow for lost comrades. Bong's brother Carl (who wrote his biography) questions the validity of reported circumstance that Bong repeated the same mistake so soon after mentioning it to another pilot. Carl's book—Dear Mom, <b>So</b> <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> a War (1991)—contains numerous reports and findings from the crash investigations.|$|E
25|$|We have {{recorded}} {{everything in the}} studio and are just waiting for Gaahl to put vocals on it. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only vocals and the final mix to go before it's all done. It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he's not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Picking up what another throws down can {{scarcely}} be called [...] "taking away." [...] However, {{we shall not}} agree too well upon that subject, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better part.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Safe {{in an old}} sailors' home," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "He took a trip or two to sea, but he couldn't stand it, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> him put in the home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> better put {{the names}} {{up on the}} door. You go down and try and make that black-browed {{landlord}} understand that you want some paper and pen and ink." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{separate}} celebrations then {{involved the}} building of many altars in one church and {{the reduction of the}} ritual to the simplest possible form. The deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with; the celebrant took their part as well as his own. One server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers, everything was said instead of being sung, the incense and kiss of peace were omitted. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the well-known rite of low Mass (missa privata). This then reacted on high Mass (missa solemnis), so that at high Mass too the celebrant himself recites everything, even though it be sung by the deacon, subdeacon, or choir.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some folks {{might say}} there was madness in his method," [...] muttered the Inspector. [...] "But he's all on fire to start, Colonel, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> best go out if you are ready." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN. Just <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> better {{hold our}} tongues about it, Con. We {{should only be}} laughed at, and lose the little credit we earned on false pretences {{in the days of}} our ignorance.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{found the}} Woozy," [...] {{explained}} the boy, [...] "and {{he agreed to}} give us the three hairs; but we couldn't pull them out. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to bring the Woozy along with us." ...|$|R
500|$|The ending {{left many}} filmgoers confused. In his scathing {{review of the}} film, Roger Ebert says that he cannot believe [...] "that the director, Joseph Sargent, would film this final climactic scene so incompetently {{that there is not}} even an {{establishing}} shot, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to figure out what happened on the basis of empirical evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|There are {{not many}} {{applications}} unique to dysprosium. Theodore Gray wrote in his book The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe [...] "Look up dysprosium, {{and you have to}} go to the fourth page of results before finding anything that isn't a periodic table website's entry for dysprosium, usually an obligatory 'It's an element, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to have a page about it' sort of page." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{theory can}} be straightforwardly {{quantized}} by treating bosonic and fermionic sectors as free. This permits us {{to build a}} set of asymptotic states {{which can be used}} to start a computation of the probability amplitudes for different processes. In order to do <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to compute an evolution operator that, for a given initial state , will give a final state [...] in such a way to have ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{policeman}} said he {{was gone}} out, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the villain up to the Admiral with the greater satisfaction, as he was a lodger {{in one of the}} Admiral's pet public-houses in Tibb's Alley.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> {{not taught}} obedience, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{to take the}} consequences, and we were the less able to enforce it {{that he had come}} to a {{knowledge}} of our mutual relations much sooner than we intended, and in the worst manner possible.|$|R
60|$|We lay in {{the cove}} or harbour, where, as I have said, our {{rendezvous}} was appointed, and {{had not yet been}} on shore, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not seen the directions our admiral had left for us.|$|R
500|$|After {{the early}} departures of Jermaine Pennant and Stuart Taylor, club captain Patrick Vieira joined Italian side Juventus in a £13.7 million deal. Wenger {{did not intend}} to sign a replacement, saying [...] "I am not in a hurry. We have Gilberto, Flamini and Fàbregas. Pirès can play in there also <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> plenty of players." [...] English midfielder David Bentley made his loan deal at Blackburn Rovers {{permanent}} in the January transfer window.|$|E
500|$|The story's themes reflect many of {{the themes}} Coupland has {{addressed}} in his other works, including themes on time, religion, an afterlife, and communication. One reviewer mentioned that the book has [...] "quintessential Coupland themes, chiefly, how the speed of change, both technologically and socially driven, is altering the world, our own {{sense of self and}} our souls". In relation to the Future Legend glossary {{at the end of the}} book Coupland said [...] "The future is happening so fast and furious right now, there's no language to describe all these new sensations, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to begin inventing one".|$|E
500|$|On August 27, 2008, a prequel {{comic book}} (leading {{right up to}} the moment in the pilot where Olivia 'first' meets Walter) written by Zack Whedon was {{released}} by DC Comics under its WildStorm imprint. This was to be the first issue of a monthly 6-issue limited series but the others were delayed until January 2009, when monthly publication resumed, with the sixth and final issue scheduled for release on June 17. The Vice President of WildStorm, Hank Kanalz, explained the publication hiatus: [...] "The writers of the show want to make sure the comic book is integrated into the mythology of the Fringe world, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> decided to refocus the direction of the comic book. Unfortunately, this means that we will have some delays, but will be back in January." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will arise}} {{and go to}} my father." [...] Rebirth! A sense of responsibility, of consecration. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> come painfully through our materialistic individualism, through our selfish Protestantism, to {{a glimpse of the}} true Protestantism--Democracy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something in Joe's voice told me plainer {{than words}} {{that we were}} in danger, and I wished we'd waited till the rest of our party came; but I was tired, and <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> started alone.|$|R
60|$|We did {{not need}} a second bidding; {{the size of the}} fish was <b>so</b> great that <b>we</b> felt more excited than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> yet been during the voyage, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> bent our oars till we almost pulled the boat out of the water. The other boats had got separated, chasing the little whales, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> this one all to ourselves.|$|R
