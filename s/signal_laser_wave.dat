40|$|A high-repetition rate {{electron}} {{source is}} generated by tightly focusing kHz, few-mJ laser pulses into an underdense plasma. This high-intensity laser-plasma interaction leads to stable electron beams over several hours but with strikingly complex transverse distributions even for good quality laser focal spots. We find that the electron beam distribution is sensitive to the <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> front via the laser midfield distribution rather than the laser focal spot itself. We are able to measure the <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> front around the focus and include it in realistic particle-in-cell simulations demonstrating {{the role of the}} <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> front on the acceleration of electrons. Distortions of the <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> front cause spatial inhomogeneities in the midfield laser intensity and, consequently, the laser pulse drives an inhomogeneous transverse wakefield whose focusing and defocusing properties affect the electron distribution. These findings explain the experimental results and suggest the possibility of controlling the electron spatial distribution in laser-plasma accelerators by tailoring the <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> front...|$|R

We {{find that the}} Josephson frequency is virtually independent {{of the number of}} atoms in the BEC and of the inter-atomic interaction (attractive or repulsive). We study the dependence of Josephson frequency on the <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> length and the strength of the optical-lattice potential. For a fixed <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> length (795 nm), the Josephson frequency decreases with increasing strength as found in the experiment of Cataliotti et al. [Science 293, 843 (2001) ]. For a fixed strength, the Josephson frequency remains essentially unchanged for a reasonable variation of <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> length around 800 nm. However, for a fixed strength, the Josephson oscillation is disrupted with the increase of <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> length beyond 2000 nm leading to a collapse of a sufficiently attractive BEC. These features of Josephson oscillation can be tested experimentally with present set ups. Comment: 7 pages, 12 ps and eps figures, Physical Review...|$|R

40|$|Generating the {{difference}} frequency of a frequency-doubled, widely tunable Ti:Al 2 O 3 laser and a Nd:YAG laser provides tunable laser radiation in the visible spectrum range. The generated wavelength region closes the spectral {{gap between the}} fundamental and the second harmonic of the Ti:Sapphire laser. A prototype has being developed with a fully automated wavelength tuning, i. e. the wavelength tuning of the Ti:Sapphire laser, the angel tuning of the nonlinear crystals and the tuning of the temporal delay between the Ti:Sapphire and the Nd:YAG laser operate self-controlled. Design, theoretical modeling and experimental characterization of the system are closely discussed. At a repetition rate of one kilohertz, the frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser provides pulses of approximately 20 ns, a spectral line width of 20 GHz. a nearly diffraction limited beam quality and pulse energies of up to 850 J. The tuning range reaches from 340 nm to 510 nm.

Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit beiden Gebieten. Es wird ein Mechanismus zur Kuehlung von Atomen untersucht, bei dem die Wellennatur des Atoms eine zentrale Rolle spielt. In einem neuartigen Atomstrahlexperiment untersuchen wir diese Kuehlmethode erstmals fuer ein Alkaliatom. Das Grundprinzip des Kuehlmechanismus beruht darauf, dass Atome durch die Wechselwirkung mit einer Laserstehwelle optisch in Quantenzustaende gepumpt werden, die einen scharf definierten Impuls haben und vom Lichtfeld entkoppelt sind. Diese Zustaende werden als Dunkelzustaende bezeichnet, da deren Dipolmoment nicht an das Feld einer resonanten Laserwelle koppelt. In einer eindimensionalen Laserstehwelle mit raeumlcih variierender Polarisation ist der Dunkelzustand delokalisiert. Der Zustand wird als geschwindigkeitsselektiver Dunkelzustand (GSD-Zustand) bezeichnet. Bisher konnten solche GSD-Zustaende nur in Experimenten mit Heliumatomen untersucht werden. Uns ist es erstmals gelungen, die Bevoelkerung von GSD-Zustaenden in einem Experiment mit Alkaliatomen nachzuweisen. Atome eines kalten Rubidiumstrahls werden durch die Wechselwirkung mit einer eindimensionalen Laserstehwelle optisch in GSD-Zustaende gepumpt.

The report addresses both fields. A mechanism for the cooling of atoms is examined, with the wave character of the atom playing {{an important part in}} the process. A novel atomic beam experiment has been worked out and is reported which represents application of this cooling method to an alkali atom for the first time. The basic principle of the cooling process is that atoms are optically pumped into quantum states by means of interaction with a standing <b>laser</b> <b>wave,</b> the quantum states having a sharply defined momentum, decoupled from the light field. These states are called dark states, as their dipole moment does not couple to the field of a resonant <b>laser</b> <b>wave.</b> In a one-dimensional standing <b>laser</b> <b>wave</b> with spatially varying polarization, the dark state is delocalised.
