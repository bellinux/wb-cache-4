40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potentialities}} of the pushover analysis to estimate the seismic deformation demands of concentrically braced steel frames. Reliability of the pushover analysis has been verified by conducting nonlinear dynamic analysis on 5, 10 and 15 story frames subjected to 15 synthetic earthquake records representing a design spectrum. It is shown that pushover analysis with predetermined lateral load pattern provides questionable estimates of inter-story drift. To overcome this inadequacy, a simplified analytical model for seismic response prediction of concentrically braced frames is proposed. In this approach, a multistory frame is reduced to an equivalent shear-building model by performing a pushover analysis. A conventional shear-building model has been modified by introducing <b>supplementary</b> <b>springs</b> to account for flexural displacements in addition to shear displacements. It is shown that modified shear-building models have a better estimation of the nonlinear dynamic response of real framed structures compared to nonlinear static procedures...|$|R

50|$|Both Division One and Two now {{contained}} 14 teams, previously {{considered a}} difficult number {{to ensure a}} balanced schedule. A 26 game programme, with every team playing each other home and away, was considered too short, a 52 game programme (with each team playing each other home and away twice) too congested. A 39 game schedule would leave an imbalance with each side having two fixtures at home against some teams, and one against others. The Scottish Football League addressed the problem by opting for a 26 game calendar and introducing a <b>supplementary</b> competition, the <b>Spring</b> Cup, open only to teams from Divisions One and Two, to be played at the season's end. It was discontinued after a single season.|$|R

In the experiments we explore the effect of <b>supplementary</b> <b>spring</b> topdressing of rape with nitrogen and boron in the BBCH 29 – 30 stage {{with regard to the}} yields of seeds and their qualitative parameters (TSW, content of oil and crude protein). In the experiment we applied DAM– 390 (solution of ammonium nitrate and urea, 30 % N) at a rate of 30 [*]kg N/ha and Humix Bór (humic acids + N, K, B) at a rate of 0. 240 [*]kg[*]B / ha. The different climate conditions in the respective years had a significant effect on yields of rapeseed and ranged as follows: 2003 : 1. 80 – 2. 29 [*]t / ha; 2004 : 2. 60 – 3. 35 [*]t / ha; 2005 : 2. 45 – 3. 29 [*]t / ha. The significant decrease in seed yields {{in the first year of}} the experiment was caused namely by the deficit in precipitation in January, February and June 2003 and high temperatures in May and June in the same year. In terms of the individual years and the three-year average the application of Humix Bór itself did not significantly improve the yield and qualitative parameters of seeds compared to the unfertilised control. In a three-year average the application of the N fertiliser alone or in combination with Humix Bór increased seed yields and the crude protein content by 22. 4 – 30. 7 [*]% and 4. 0 – 4. 9 rel. %, respectively, compared to the unfertilised control. The significantly highest seed yields (2. 98 [*]t / ha) were achieved when the plants were treated with a combination of nitrogen and Humix Bór as compared to all the other treatments (2. 28 – 2. 79 [*]t / ha). The oil content in seeds increased significantly to 44. 1 % only when treated with a combined application of DAM– 390 and Humix Bór as against the unfertilised control (42. 8 %).

40|$|The {{release of}} hand-reared ring-necked {{pheasants}} Phasianus colchicus in summer {{is a common}} practice in Britain {{to increase the number}} of birds available to hunters in winter. The breeding success of the birds which survive the shooting season is poor. Traditionally, birds are provided with supplementary wheat grain from release until the end of the shooting season (1 February) to maintain body condition and to help hold birds in areas for hunting. During 1997 - 2000 we assessed the effect of continuing <b>supplementary</b> feeding into <b>spring</b> on pheasant density and breeding success on seven private shooting estates. On each estate we randomly selected two distinct 1 -km 2 plots and provided wheat grain via feed hoppers for birds in breeding territories in one of the plots on each estate while the other plot acted as an untreated control. Food was provided from mid-February to mid-May. We crossed-over the treatment and control plot on each estate each year. We conducted pre- and post-breeding pheasant counts in the plots during April and September. During April, densities were higher in treatment plots than in control plots for territorial males: (mean ± SE) treatment = 22. 6 ± 1. 5 birds/km 2, control = 14. 8 ± 1. 2 birds/km 2, (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and for females: treatment = 40. 6 ± 5. 8 birds/km 2, control = 24. 1 ± 3. 8 birds/km 2 (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). In September we found no statistical effect of treatment on densities of adult birds or on brood size. However, more young were observed on treatment plots: 10. 8 ± 1. 5 birds/km 2, than in control plots: 5. 6 ± 1. 0 birds/km 2, (P = 0. 02). In order to improve the breeding potential of released pheasants, we recommend that <b>spring</b> <b>supplementary</b> feeding is undertaken on shooting estates in Britain...|$|R
40|$|In Italy {{several small}} populations of red-legged {{partridges}} has been reconstituted {{in areas where}} the species was extinguished. In these areas release of different animals must be programmed, since the dimension of the reconstituted populations does not catch up the minimal dimension required to guard the species from a new extinction. We have thoght therefore indispensable to carry out a research in order to estimate the integration ability of the released raised partridges with the wild population, the survival rates, the use of the habitat and the home-ranges of both populations. In a protected areaf Central Italy 350 raised partridges were released during August month. In January 6 raised partridges and 21 wild partridges has been captured by traps. 6 subjects for each thesis (raised or wild) have been therefore equipped with radio necklaces and localised biweekly until July. No difference in mortality rates was observed between wild or raised partridges that had survived to the winter. Raised partridges, that survive after release in the wild, were able to integrate themselves in mixed brigades with the wild partridges. Vineyards with interlined grass were the habitat most frequented. The distance from the subsidiary artificial feeding points significantly increased during broods showing the necessity to increase the number and dispersion of the <b>supplementary</b> feeders in <b>spring,</b> to help the animals from an alimentary point of view. The distance from the houses and home range surfaces did not differ between wild and raised partridges...|$|R
40|$|Odonate {{seasonality}} {{is determined}} at Isaac's Pond (43 ° 28 'S; 172 ° 32 'E) 30 m amsl and at two sites at Lake Sarah (43 ° 03 'S; 171 ° 47 'E) 579 m amsl in New Zealand. The {{means by which}} seasonality is attained and the effects that altitudinal differences have on the pattern of seasonality is examined in field and laboratory studies. Xanthocnemis zealandica (Coenagrionidae) has a two-year life cycle at Isaac's Pond, but a three-year life cycle at Lake Sarah – tb (Typha - bed site). Emergence starts earlier at Isaac's Pond, but ends by approximately the same date at all three sites. Emergence is trimodal at Isaac's Pond and bimodal at Lake Sarah. Embryonic development is direct; hatching occurs only the summer that eggs are laid. Later instar larvae cease development at about 79 °C. Diapause, possibly cued by rate of change of daylength and temperature, occurs during the summer in the F- 2 to F instar larvae. Austrolestes colensonis (Lestidae) has a two-year life cycle at Lake Sarah - tb. Emergence starts earlier at Isaac's Pond, but ends by approximately the same date and is bimodal at all three sites. Embryonic development usually is direct, although some delayed hatching occurs. Some eggs hatch the summer that they are laid, but others overwinter and hatch the following <b>spring.</b> <b>Supplementary</b> moulting occurs in F- 2 instar larvae during the summer. Procordulia smithii (Corduliidae) has a four-year life cycle and a bimodal emergence pattern at Lake Sarah - tb. Embryonic development is direct above approximately 19 °C, but greatly prolonged below this temperature; therefore, most eggs overwinter. Results from larval laboratory studies are tentative. Procordulia grayi (Corduliidae) is examined only briefly at Lake Sarah - ls (lake shore site). In general larval growth restrictions occur during the late summer that effectively prevent emergence during the autumn when successful reproduction is unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{breeding}} {{success of}} released pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) is poor compared with wild ones in Great Britain. Many {{factors have been}} cited as possible causes of poor breeding success, including reduced hen condition in the nesting season. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine whether reduced body condition due to an inadequate diet contributes to poor breeding success of released pheasants and to demonstrate experimentally the impact of supplementary feeding on their body condition and breeding success. A series of 6 studies of food availability, diet, body condition and breeding success of pheasants was conducted in Britain between 1994 and 2000 to study these questions. Spring diet and food availability were assessed in a multi-site study. Grains and seeds are important dietary components, but their availability to pheasants and their occurrence in the diet was low on all sites during spring. Grains were only a significant component in the diet on sites where supplementary feeding continued into spring. A spring survey of hen pheasant body condition on 21 sites revealed that fat reserves were higher on sites with <b>spring</b> <b>supplementary</b> feeding compared with sites which ceased feeding {{at the end of the}} shooting season (1 st February). Further, it was demonstrated experimentally that continuing feeding into spring enabled hens to maintain fat reserves at their winter levels, whereas fat reserves of hens in unsupplemented areas were reduced by up to 50 %. Supplementary feeding did not improve survival of hens through the spring, but the pre-breeding density of territorial cocks and hens was increased. Feeding did not significantly influence measured productivity parameters except for aspects of re-nesting ability which were improved by feeding. Overall, the densities of young birds observed during autumn counts were twice as high in plots which had been provided with supplementary grain in the previous spring than in unfed plots. Although population densities of pheasants were positively influenced by supplementary feeding, breeding success was still lower than that of wild birds. Clearly, there are behavioural and physiological deficiencies which pre-dispose released pheasants to poor performance in the wild. Habitat deficiencies other than adult food availability are likely to be important too; in particular, the quality of brood rearing habitat which influences chick survival. However, the results of this study contribute to our knowledge of the ecology and management of released pheasants and it is recommended that spring feeding should be conducted routinely by game managers to enable released hens to maintain body condition and maximise their breeding potential...|$|R
50|$|The nave north arcade is Norman {{and might}} date from before 1150 and {{be part of}} the earlier {{structure}} which also contained the west tower. It is of three bays defined by circular piers topped by square abaci with scalloped cushion capitals, supporting chamfered semi-circular arches. The nave south arcade is early 13th century and Perpendicular. The piers supporting the semi-circular arches are narrower than those at the north, the arches having deeper chamfered reveals. The capitals are frustum-style of four facets, with abaci of floriate detailing reminiscent of crocketing, except that on the pier respond at the west carved as flat leaf. In both aisles either side of the nave are rows of pews, provided by Sir Edmund Turnor in 1700. Within the south aisle are two stained glass windows. The chamfered chancel arch sits on polygonal responds with part octagonal capitals in which are embossed and painted cyphers of King George VI between lily floral motifs on one, and rose on the other.The nave arcades run through to corresponding chancel arcades separating the north and south chancel chapels from the chancel.
