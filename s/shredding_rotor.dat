40|$|The {{technique}} for the decomposition of household appliances comprises a pre-reducer, a sorter to obtain metal-rich and coarse-grained plastic-rich fractions, a decompositer for complete decomposition {{of the residual}} composites and a fine sorter to obtain metal and plastic concentrates. The study of decomposition techniques includes basic research work and {{an analysis of the}} state of the art in this field. For the pre-reducing the application of a twin-shaft <b>rotor</b> <b>shredder</b> is proposed, while a new, flexible decompositor has been designed for the residual decomposition. For characterization of the decomposition products the computer system 'MPCA - Multipel Component Process Analysis' has been developed. The study has been completed by testing of the shredder and decompositor systems.

50|$|Gabe and Hal agree, {{and they}} {{meet at a}} cliff side bridge. However, Qualen tries to {{challenge}} Gabe into throwing the case into the helicopter, but when he also threatens to kill Jessie again, Gabe orders Qualen to free her {{at a safe distance}} away from the cliff. Qualen reluctantly agrees, and uses a winch to lower Jessie to the ground. Once Jessie is safely down, however, Gabe throws the bag of money into the helicopter's <b>rotors,</b> <b>shredding</b> the money. Enraged, Qualen attempts to fly off, but Gabe has used the winch cable to tether the helicopter to a steel ladder up the cliff face. The ladder snaps and leaves Gabe and Qualen atop the wreckage of the helicopter hanging by the cable. Gabe fights Qualen and manages to climb to safety as the wreckage snaps off the cable, sending Qualen to his death. Gabe reunites with Jessie and Hal as federal agents arrive in helicopters to offer their assistance.|$|R
