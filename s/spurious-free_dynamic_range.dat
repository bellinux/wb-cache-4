40|$|Dynamic element {{matching}} (DEM) is widely-used in multi-bit DACs {{to prevent}} mismatches among nominally identical components from introducing non-linear distortion. By scrambling the usage {{pattern of the}} components from sample to sample, DEM causes the error arising from mismatches to be white or spectrally shaped noise that is free of non- linear distortion. DEM has long {{been used as a}} performance -enabling technique in delta-sigma data converters which require low-resolution but high-linearity DACs. More recently, segmented DEM architectures with reduced complexity have been developed that have made high- resolution Nyquist-rate DEM DACs practical CMOS DACs play have been used in many applications. Chapter 1 proves that properly-designed dynamic element matching (DEM) eliminates pulse shape, timing, and amplitude errors arising from component mismatches as sources of non-linear distortion in high-resolution DACs. A set of sufficient conditions on the DEM encoder that ensure this effect, and a specific segmented DEM encoder that satisfies the sufficient conditions are presented. Unlike previously published DEM en-coders, the new DEM encoder's complexity does not grow exponentially with the number of bits of DAC resolution, so it is practical for high-resolution DACs.

In Chapter 2 it is shown that there is a fundamental input range restriction to a segmented DEM DAC, regardless of how the DEM encoder is implemented. A general method of designing DEM encoder for unity-weighted DACs and segmented DEM DACs is then presented. The DEM encoders designed are optimal {{in the sense that they}} have a range restriction no worst than that fundamental input range restriction due to segmentation. The methods are demonstrated via examples of a 13 -level unity-weighted DEM DAC and a pair of 14 -bit segmented DEM DACs. The power dissipation versus complexity tradeoff implied by segmentation is also studied through the 14 -bit examples.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of analog baseband circuits for low-power single-chip WCDMA direct-conversion receivers. The reference radio system throughout the thesis is UTRA/FDD. The analog baseband circuit consists of two similar channels, which contain analog channel-select filters, programmable-gain amplifiers, and circuits that remove DC offsets. The direct-conversion architecture is described and the UTRA/FDD system characteristics are summarized. The UTRA/FDD specifications define the performance requirement for the whole receiver. Therefore, the specifications for the analog baseband circuit are obtained from the receiver requirements through calculations performed by hand. When the power dissipation of an UTRA/FDD direct-conversion receiver is minimized, the design parameters of an all-pole analog channel-select filter and the following Nyquist rate analog-to-digital converter must be considered simultaneously. In this thesis, it is shown that minimum power consumption is achieved with a fifth-order lowpass filter and a 15. 36 -MS/s Nyquist rate converter that has a 7 - or 8 -bit resolution. A fifth-order Chebyshev prototype with a passband ripple of 0. 01  dB and a − 3 -dB frequency of 1. 92 -MHz is adopted in this thesis. The error-vector-magnitude can be significantly reduced by using a first-order 1. 4 -MHz allpass filter. The selected filter prototype fulfills all selectivity requirements in the analog domain. In this thesis, all the filter implementations use the opamp-RC technique to achieve insensitivity to parasitic capacitances and a high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> The adopted technique is analyzed in detail. The effect of the finite opamp unity-gain bandwidth on the filter frequency response can be compensated for by using passive methods. Compensation schemes that also track the process and temperature variations have been developed. The opamp-RC technique enables the implementation of low-voltage filters. The design and simulation results of a 1. 5 -V 2 -MHz lowpass filter are discussed. The developed biasing scheme does not use any additional current to achieve the low-voltage operation, unlike the filter topology published previously elsewhere. Methods for removing DC offsets in UTRA/FDD direct-conversion receivers are presented. The minimum areas for cascaded AC couplings and DC-feedback loops are calculated. The distortion of the frequency response of a lowpass filter caused by a DC-feedback loop connected over the filter is calculated and a method for compensating for the distortion is developed. The time constant of an AC coupling can be increased using time-constant multipliers. This enables the implementation of AC couplings with a small silicon area. Novel time-constant multipliers suitable for systems that have a continuous reception, such as UTRA/FDD, are presented. The proposed time-constant multipliers only require one additional amplifier. In an UTRA/FDD direct-conversion receiver, the reception is continuous. In a low-power receiver, the programmable baseband gain must be changed during reception. This may produce large, slowly decaying transients that degrade the receiver performance. The thesis shows that AC-coupling networks and DC-feedback loops {{can be used to}} implement programmable-gain amplifiers, which do not produce significant transients when the gain is altered. The principles of operation, the design, and the practical implementation issues of these amplifiers are discussed. New PGA topologies suitable for continuously receiving systems have been developed. The behavior of these circuits in the presence of strong out-of-channel signals is analyzed. The interface between the downconversion mixers and the analog baseband circuit is discussed. The effect of the interface on the receiver noise figure and the trimming of mixer IIP 2 are analyzed. The design and implementation of analog baseband circuits and channel-select filters for UTRA/FDD direct-conversion receivers are discussed in five application cases. The first case presents the analog baseband circuit for a chip-set receiver. A channel-select filter that has an improved <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> with a smaller supply current is presented next. The third and fifth application cases describe embedded analog baseband circuits for single-chip receivers. In the fifth case, the dual-mode analog baseband circuit of a quad-mode receiver designed for GSM 900, DCS 1800, PCS 1900, and UTRA/FDD cellular systems is described. A new, highly linear low-power transconductor is presented in the fourth application case. The fourth application case also describes a channel-select filter. The filter achieves + 99 -dBV out-of-channel IIP 2, + 45 -dBV out-of-channel IIP 3 and 23 -μVRMS input-referred noise with 2. 6 -mA current from a 2. 7 -V supply. In the fifth application case, a corresponding performance is achieved in UTRA/FDD mode. The out-of-channel IIP 2 values of approximately + 100  dBV achieved in this work are the best reported so far. This is also the case with the figure of merits for the analog channel-select filter and analog baseband circuit described in the fourth and fifth application cases, respectively. For equal power dissipation, bandwidth, and filter order, these circuits achieve approximately 10  dB and 15  dB higher <b>spurious-free</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges,</b> respectively, when compared to implementations that are published elsewhere and have the second best figure of merits. reviewe...|$|R
