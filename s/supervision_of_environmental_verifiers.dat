40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the project {{governance}} scheme in the Polish road sector. It {{is based on the}} case study of the project of the expressway S- 7 realized in northern Poland. The aim of this research was to present Polish road sector scheme and to analyse it with basis on the implemented project. To provide investigation properly, a literature study was performed as well as a definition of the road sector scheme based on guidelines and law acts. Based on the research, significant strengths and weaknesses were identified. The most important weaknesses were found to be, firstly, a too large number of actors in decision-making process, and secondly, slighting of the economic values. The most important strengths were found to be, firstly, a very accurate <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> impact, and secondly, the self-control of the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA). The thesis had many limitations what encourages to further research. The biggest limitation was difficulties with obtaining accurate data adopted to the analysis for project. The thesis offers two main possible ways for further research. The first consist in advancing deeper into an analysis of the road sector. The other consist in the possibility of an analysis of other sectors and, based on a comparative approach, trying to propose measures with the intention of creating a general national project governance scheme for Poland. On basis of the thesis, some suggestions were formulated based on identified European practices. Examples of these are, reducing the number of participants involved into the scheme, and addressing economic issues in more detail. This thesis should contribute real value for Polish scientists, who are interested in project governance, and international society of scientists by presenting Polish project governance scheme in road sector...|$|R

30|$|With {{economic}} reform however, has come substantial environmental degradation {{which in turn}} has led to poor health outcomes for much of society generally. This led to a high level <b>of</b> commitment to <b>environmental</b> regulation in particular from as early as the 1990, followed by the release of even more rigorous regulations on environmental protection in the 2000 s. However, despite the high commitment made by the Chinese central government, implementation of these policies is quite poor (Bina 2010). In terms <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> regulation, for example, the implementation problems stem from a number of areas, including: the position <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> protection agencies in the political framework; conflict between central and local governments; and supervision issues. The system <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> local <b>environmental</b> departments is a key problem (Bina 2010). When an environmental department is set up in the central government, corresponding environmental departments are set up in local governments. Ideally, these local departments should be agencies of the central department, deliver the central environmental department’s strategies, and supervise local environmental protection implementation. In reality, the local environmental departments are subservient to the local rather than central governments. All their financial support and staff appointments come from local governments. Therefore, rather than supervising local environmental protection implementation, the local environmental departments become “rubber stamps” for local governments (Zheng 2010). Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be efficient enforcement <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> laws, regulations and policies at the local level (Bina 2010; Zheng 2010).|$|R

50|$|By the 1960s, the Grand Canal Docks {{were almost}} {{completely}} derelict. By 1987, {{it was decided}} that Hanover Quay was too toxic to sell. Regeneration began in 1998, when Bord Gáis sold the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) the former gasworks site located in the area between Sir John Rogerson's Quay and Hanover Quay for €19 million. The DDDA spent €52 million decontaminating the land, even though the likely return was estimated at just €40 million. The decontamination took place under the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency between 2002 and 2006. The process involved constructing an underground wall eight metres deep around the affected area and the contaminated land dug out and removed. By the time the decontamination was finished, an inflated property bubble and increased demand in the area (brought on, in part, by the decision by Google to set up its European headquarters nearby), allowed the authority to sell the land for €300 million. The DDDA injected some of its new wealth into the area's infrastructure including seers, street lighting, and civic spaces.|$|R

However, the workgroup also concluded that it was unlikely that MCS would receive extensive financial resources from federal agencies because of budgetary constraints and the allocation of funds to other, extensively overlapping syndromes with unknown cause, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War syndrome. The Environmental Health Policy Committee is currently inactive, and the workgroup document has not been finalized.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} of using hybrid ventilation in an office building in Stockholm. The focus is on simulating the natural airflow {{to find out for}} which conditions it is sufficient. The thesis is done at White Arkitekter AB in cooperation and under the <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> specialists working there. A literature study is carried out to study what has been done before in Sweden as well as in other countries. Computer simulations are used to simulate the airflow to examine the conditions and architecture. A synthetic computer model representing a realistic office building is built up as a starting point. The ventilation method for the natural ventilation part is to take air in through the façade and use the stack effects in an atrium for natural ventilation. By altering the architecture and the sizes of the openings according to the results from the simulations the building is dimensioned and formed to cope with the rules and requirements about the indoor air quality in workplaces. The simulations are done with a multi zone energy performance simulation tool that can simulate airflows and indoor air climate conditions in the zones as well as the energy consumption. Computational fluid dynamics calculations are then used to more closely simulate the conditions within the zones. The results from those simulations suggest that the natural ventilation {{as a part of a}} hybrid ventilation works for all the floors of the building for up to 10 ^∘C. The computational fluid dynamics simulations showed that the thermal comfort of all the occupants is fulfilled for these conditions but there is a risk of occupants experiencing draught because of to high velocities in the air especially for the colder outdoor temperatures. For the higher outdoor temperatures the airflow needs to be enforced to ensure sufficient conditions for the occupants and for the colder temperatures mechanical ventilation is needed to decrease heat losses and avoid the risk of draught...|$|R

40|$|Introduction and purpose: Improper {{management}} of healthcare waste (HCW)  can pose considerable risks {{to human health}} and the environment and cause serious problems in developing countries such as Iran. In this study, we sought to determine the hazards of HCW in the public hospitals affiliated to Abadan School of Medicine using the preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) method.  Methods: In this descriptive and analytic study, health risk assessment of HCW in government hospitals affiliated to Abadan School of Medicine (4 public hospitals) was carried out by using PHA in the summer of  2016.  Results: We noted the high risk of sharps and infectious wastes. Considering the dual risk of injury and disease transmission, sharps were classified in the very high-risk group, and pharmaceutical and chemical and radioactive wastes were classified in the medium-risk group. Sharps posed the highest risk, while pharmaceutical and chemical wastes had the lowest risk. Among the various stages of waste management, the waste treatment stage was the most hazardous in all the studied hospitals.  Conclusion: To diminish the risks associated with healthcare waste management in the studied hospitals, adequate training of healthcare workers and care providers, provision of suitable personal protective and transportation equipment, and <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> the <b>environmental</b> health manager <b>of</b> hospitals should be considered by the authorities.   ...|$|R

It is a significant content for regional sustainability development and man-land relationship research to explore the eco-environmental effect of regional industrial structure change. The ecoenvironmental influence produced by nine-industry subclasses’ development was analyzed, {{and at the same}} time, the historical trace of industrial structure development in Chongqing after municipality establishing was reviewed briefly. Making use of ecoenvironmental influence modulus of industrial departments (EIMID), we quantitatively evaluated the entire eco-environmental impact of industrial structure change in Chongqing from 1997 to 2008 by integrated eco-environmental influence modulus of industrial structure (IEIMIS). Our research showed that the industrial structure had experienced two significant transformations since the establishment of municipality in 1997 and that IEIMIS presented an approximate U-shaped curve with an ascent trend after an initial decline and fluctuated in a certain range. From 1997 to 2001 the economic development was rather sustainable in Chongqing, but from 2002 to 2008, the social development was at the expensive of eco-environment deterioration and the industrial structure change intensified human activity's pressure on local environment.
