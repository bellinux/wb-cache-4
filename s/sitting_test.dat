40|$|The {{interest}} for modelling of human actions acting on structures has been recurrent {{since the first}} accidents on suspension bridges {{in the nineteenth century}} like Broughton (1831) in the U.

This work focuses on the latter topic. The dynamic characteristic of a structure can be changed due to the presence of people on it. In order to evaluate these property modifications several testing have been carried out on a structure designed to be a gymnasium.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the experimental identification of transmissibility functions {{from the floor}} of an aircraft cabin through a typical passenger seat to the pelvis, chest and shoulder of a <b>sitting</b> <b>test</b> dummy. For this purpose, a multi-axial vibration test facility was utilized. A typical passenger seat with test dummies was mounted on the vibration table. All six axes of the vibration table were excited with three levels of sine sweep and random excitation signals. The responses at specific positions on the test dummy were measured. The transmissibility FRF were computed with two approaches. First, the response signals were related to the respective excitation axis. Second, an improved approach was used which takes into account the motions of all base axes. Both approaches delivered transmissibility FRF which were nearly identical. However, in most cases the transmissibility FRF, which were computed with the improved approach, were more noisy. The reason for this might be the spill-over effect of some cross-talk motions. An investigation of possible nonlinear effects showed that an increase of the excitation level of the sine sweep excitation resulted in a shift of the resonance peaks to lower frequencies and a reduction of the resonance amplitudes. The verification of computational models should therefore be mainly accomplished with data of the low level, if the models are assumed to be linear. Medium and high levels of sine sweep excitation should only be used for the verification of nonlinear models...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} of vibration comfort for passengers in aircraft, railway vehicles or cars requires comprehensive analytical and experimental investigations in structural dynamics. For analytical {{investigations of the}} vibration comfort {{it is essential to}} establish suitable computational models and to validate them. The validation requires an experimental identification of the dynamic characteristics of passenger seats and persons sitting on the seats. On the other hand it is possible to directly investigate the vibration comfort by performing tests on humans. Both aspects are described and discussed here. The paper describes first the experimental identification of transmissibility functions between the floor of a passenger cabin through a typical passenger seat to the pelvis, chest and shoulder of a <b>sitting</b> <b>test</b> dummy. The transmissibility FRF were computed by using different approaches. Also, nonlinearity investigations were performed. The measured transmissibility functions can be used to validate and verify sophisticated computational models. This may lead to strong improvements in the numerical simulation and finally in a substantial progress of vibration comfort for passengers. In a test campaign with humans typical vibration test sequences of an aircraft flight were applied. It showed that that the vibration test facility, the utilized equipment and the employed tools were able to fulfill all requirements.

40|$|Abstract Background Sitting {{ability and}} {{function}} are commonly impaired after stroke. Balance training {{has been shown}} to be helpful, but abundant repetitions are required for optimal recovery and patients must be motivated to perform rehabilitation exercises repeatedly to maximize treatment intensity. Virtual reality training (VRT), which allows patients to interact with a virtual environment using computer software and hardware, is enjoyable and may encourage greater repetition of therapeutic exercises. However, the potential for VRT to promote sitting balance has not yet been explored. The objective of this study is to determine if supplemental VRT-based sitting balance exercises improve sitting balance ability and function in stroke rehabilitation inpatients. Methods/Design This is a single-site, single-blind, parallel-group randomized control trial. Seventy six stroke rehabilitation inpatients who cannot stand independently for greater than one minute but can sit for at least 20  minutes (including at least one minute without support) are being recruited from a tertiary-care dedicated stroke rehabilitation unit. Participants are randomly allocated to experimental or control groups. Both participate in 10 – 12 sessions of 30 – 45 minutes of VRT performed in sitting administered by a single physiotherapist, in addition to their traditional therapy. The experimental group plays five games which challenge sitting balance while the control group plays five games which minimize trunk lean. Outcome measures of sitting balance ability (Function in <b>Sitting</b> <b>Test,</b> Ottawa Sitting Scale, quantitative measures of postural sway) and function (Reaching Performance Scale, Wolf Motor Function Test, quantitative measures of the limits of stability) are administered prior to, immediately following, and one month following the intervention by a second physiotherapist blind to the participant’s group allocation. Discussion The treatment of sitting balance post-stroke with VRT has not yet been explored. Results from the current study will provide important evidence for the use of low-cost, accessible VRT as an adjunct intervention to increase sitting balance in lower-functioning patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation. The motivating and enjoyable attributes of VRT may increase exercise dosage, leading to improved function and optimal results from rehabilitation. Trial Registration [URL]; Identifier: NCT 02285933.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show the {{feasibility}} of the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the lower back muscles for pressure sores prevention in paraplegia. The hypothesis under study is that FES induces a change in the pressure distribution on the contact area during <b>sitting.</b> <b>Tests</b> were conducted on a paraplegic subject (T 5), sitting on a standard wheelchair and cushion. Trunk extensors (mainly the erector spinae) were stimulated using surface electrodes placed on the skin. A pressure mapping system was used to measure the pressure on the sitting surface in four situations: (a) no stimulation; (b) stimulation on one side of the spine only; (c) stimulation on both sides, at different levels; and (d) stimulation at the same level on both sides, during pressure-relief manoeuvres. A session of prolonged stimulation was also conducted. The experimental results show that the stimulation of the erector spinae on one side of the spine can induce a trunk rotation on the sagittal plane, which causes a change in the pressure distribution. A decrease of pressure on the side opposite to the stimulation was recorded. The phenomenon is intensified when different levels of stimulation are applied to the two sides, and such change can be sustained for a considerable time (around 5 minutes). The stimulation did not induce changes during pressure-relief manoeuvres. Finally, from this research we can conclude that the stimulation of the trunk extensors can be a useful tool for pressure sores prevention, and can potentially be used in a routine for pressure sores prevention based on periodical weight shifts...|$|R

Olfactory impairment {{is common in}} neurological disorders. While smell hypersensitivity has been established with chronic migraine, olfactory acuity has not been well studied. METHODS: We recruited 50 subjects with chronic migraine from the Jefferson Headache Center and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a validated test of olfaction, olfactory acuity was measured at baseline and during a migraine for subjects, and compared to controls at baseline and at home 2 weeks later. All subjects were additionally screened for odor sensitivity and allodynia. RESULTS: The mean UPSIT score for migraine subjects was 34. 5 on non-migraine days and 34. 7 on migraine days (mean difference[*]=[*]- 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI; - 1. 3, 0. 6] P[*]=[*]. 45). Controls had a mean of 35. 9 and 36. 1 for each test day (mean difference[*]=[*]- 0. 1, 95 % CI [- 0. 9, 0. 7] P[*]=[*]. 87). On average, migraineurs performed worse than their matched control counterparts in both <b>test</b> <b>sittings</b> (<b>test</b> 1 : P[*]=[*]. 047; test 2 : P[*]=[*]. 01). The great majority of subjects were allodynic (42 / 50) compared with only 9 of 50 controls, {{and the majority of}} subjects (41 / 50) found more than one listed odor to be bothersome, compared with only 10 / 50 controls.

However, the temporal and spatial domains of dynamic <b>sitting</b> balance <b>test</b> for stroke survivors are lacking. AIMS: To investigate {{the reliability and validity}} of two <b>sitting</b> balance <b>tests,</b> namely limits of stability test (LOS) and sequential weight shifting test (SWS) in stroke survivors. METHODS: Eleven community-dwelling stroke survivors with onset for at least two years (mean time since stroke = 8. 0 years [SD 4. 0]) and 15 healthy subjects were recruited. Reaction time, maximum excursion, directional control of LOS, and total movement time and directional control of SWS were measured. Modified Function Reach Test (MFRT) and Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) were also conducted to correlate with LOS and SWS. RESULTS: Excellent test-retest reliability was demonstrated in reaction time (ICC[3, 8] = 0. 760) and maximum excursion (ICC[3, 8] = 0. 929) of LOS and total movement time of SWS (ICC[3, 3] = 0. 864) in stroke survivors. Known groups validity was only shown in reaction time of LOS (p = 0. 039) between the two groups. Reaction time of LOS of stroke subjects was significantly correlated with MFRT (r = – 0. 684, p = 0. 020), while directional control of LOS was significantly correlated with the dynamic sitting balance score (r = 0. 846, p = 0. 001) and total score (r = 0. 817, p = 0. 002) of TIS. For SWS, total movement time was significantly correlated with dynamic sitting balance score of TIS (r = – 0. 654, p = 0. 029).
