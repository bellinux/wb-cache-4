5000|$|The {{representation}} of {{date and time}} values in SpreadsheetML has attracted some criticism. ECMA-376 1st edition does not conform to ISO 8601:2004 [...] "Representation of Dates and Times". It requires that implementations replicate a Lotus 1-2-3 [...] bug that erroneously treats 1900 as a leap year. Products complying with ECMA-376 {{would be required to}} use the WEEKDAY (...) <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>function,</b> and therefore assign incorrect dates to some days of the week, and also miscalculate the number of days between certain dates. ECMA-376 2nd edition (ISO/IEC 29500) allows the use of 8601:2004 [...] "Representation of Dates and Times" [...] in addition to the Lotus 1-2-3 bug-compatible form.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{process for}} data {{collection}} in multicenter trials may be troublesome and expensive. We report our experience with the <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>function</b> in Googledocs for this purpose. Methods In Googledocs the data manager creates a form similar to the paper case record form, which will function as a decentral data entry module. When the forms are submitted, they are presented in a spreadsheet in Googledocs, which can be exported to different standard spreadsheet formats. Results For a multicenter randomized clinical trial with five different participating hospitals we created a decentral data entry module using the <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>function</b> in Googledocs. The study comprised 332 patients (clinicaltrials. gov identifier: NCT 00815698) with five visits per patient. One person at each study site entered data from the original paper based case report forms which were kept at the study sites as originals. We did not experience any technical problems using the system. Conclusions The system allowed for decentral data entry, and {{it was easy to}} use, safe, and free of charge. The <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>function</b> in Googledocs may potentially replace current expensive solutions for data acquisition in multicenter trials.

40|$|A lumped {{parameter}} {{model has}} been developed to simulate monthly water levels and spring flows in the Edwards Aquifer. It is less complex {{and easier to use}} than the existing complex finite difference models for the Edwards Aquifer. The {{lumped parameter model}} was formulated using a discrete, nonlinear, nonstationary system based on control theory. The physical system of the Edwards Aquifer is conceptualized as a series of connected rock filled tanks representing major drainage basins of the aquifer. The model incorporates recharge functions derived from flow loss analysis of the drainage basins above and within the recharge area. The recharge functions estimate monthly recharge and allow for the interaction between groundwater and surface water for each drainage basin. Pumpage distribution coefficients were derived for each drainage basin to estimate monthly pumpage values. Monthly stream gage and aquifer water level data were used for calibrating and verifying the model. Model parameters were obtained {{with the aid of a}} nonlinear optimization algorithm. A Kalman filter was used to improve simulation results. The lumped parameter model proved to be very efficient in simulating 189 monthly iterations of water levels for nine drainage basins in less than four minutes on a 68040 based microcomputer. The model should prove useful for assessing pumpage regulations necessary to maintain springflows under historic drought conditions and for exploring management alternatives for the Edwards Aquifer. Future plans and research consist of re-coding the model as a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>function</b> and perhaps using a Laplace transform as a solution method. Other research should include generalizing the model for use in other karst aquifers, integrating the model with a rainfall-runoff model, and developing a better method for estimating recharge...|$|E
40|$|Jig has {{widely used}} in various {{applications}} such as in inspection, machining, assembly and fabrication works. Some cases jig developmental works {{take more than a}} year to complete especially in automotive and aerospace industries where precision and safety are prime important. In most applications in small and medium scale industries, the jig design works are done manually and based on trial and error basis. This results in losses in production time and cost. With the development of computer and information technology, the design work can be simplified and the whole fabrication process can be shortened. In this project, Unigraphic software was utilized to document the design procedure and facilitate the whole jig design and assembly process via parametric part library concept. The <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>function</b> within Unigraphic software was used to parameterize all the common parts in jig application. Three case studies were used in developing the design procedure which includes two inspection and one machining jigs. The proposed procedure was written in the sequential order according to the norm of jig design procedure being practiced in small and medium scale industries. In order to design a jig, the designer has to follow the steps in the proposed procedure and match with the parametric part library database which has been developed using Unigraphic software environment. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure and parametric parts library created in the Unigraphic software were evaluated using two different jigs for machining and inspecting a motorcycle oil pump body. It is found that the proposed procedure and parametric part library concept works well for designing and assembling these two jigs...|$|E

The <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>functions</b> enable users to conveniently search and sort rules.
