Key also talked about the sound featured in the song, saying: [...] "...it's got such an amazing, driving, rock-&-roll vibe to it, with none of that frickin' pop-punk and alternative rock stigma. Secondly, I hate yellowcard being tagged as an alternative rock band. It's just a great rock song. That's something we've been striving to write for a long time, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were done, it was a relief." ...|$|E
500|$|Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after Usher were Masque of the Red Death, and Pit and the Pendulum. He {{considered}} {{making the}} former but {{was worried about}} similarities between the story and The Seventh Seal (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter. However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film [...] "because {{it was a lot}} more graphic and in the second place, Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did finally make Masque of the Red Death we went to the UK where it would be less expensive to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Rater {{intended}} {{the theme of}} the episode to be [...] "paranoia", elaborating: [...] "After Richard dropped the bomb that the hospital would be merging with Mercy West, we knew that this episode would have to deal with people's paranoia. Because merger means change. And change means fear. And the worst kind of fear is the kind that lives in your head. The dark thoughts. The paranoia. The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. <b>So,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started talking about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly." [...] All storylines in the episode were inspired by Rater's friend base, including the story on schizophrenia. She offered her insight: ...|$|E
500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in the morning for your call time. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

Liverpool manager Shankly was delighted with the result and hailed the achievement: [...] "To think a team like Liverpool had never won the FA up was unbelievable, so many had prayed {{for it to happen}} over all the years, but it had never come to pass. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> beat Leeds, the emotion was unforgettable." [...] Despite breaking his collarbone in the opening minutes, Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne completed the whole match. Shankly was full of praise for the defender stating: [...] "Byrne was absolutely fantastic. He played the best game of his life." [...] Bryne was concerned about collecting his medal, stating: [...] "I was worried about going up to collect my medal, so many of our fans wanted to slap me on the back. I had to keep twisting and turning to avoid the congratulations." ...|$|E
500|$|Ned Block {{proposed}} {{a distinction between}} two types of consciousness that he called phenomenal (P-consciousness) and access (A-consciousness). [...] P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience: [...] it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies' and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. [...] A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. <b>So,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when we remember, information about the past is access conscious, and so on. [...] Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction, others have broadly accepted it. [...] David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: [...] he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> changed everything I was like I don't think they {{going to like it}} because it felt like I took the energy from it.

500|$|... "Sardines" [...] {{was written}} {{so that a}} feeling of {{claustrophobia}} would develop as the story progressed; Pemberton said that [...] "our first consideration was, 'Can we get 12 people in a wardrobe?' <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did the script read-through, the designer bought a wardrobe off eBay and we checked whether we could all get in it and shut the door". Writers for Broadcast described seeing the assortment of actors [...] "crammed inside an imposing wardrobe" [...] during filming as [...] "an arresting spectacle". The story is filmed from within a single bedroom, with much of it taking place inside the wardrobe. Filming presented a particular challenge, as {{the aim was to}} give the impression that the viewer was in the wardrobe with the characters, and not to [...] "cheat" [...] by giving the impression that the viewer was outside the wardrobe looking in. The episode was filmed with two wardrobes; one complete one, and one [...] "faked" [...] one. The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe, while the other was in a different room for close-up shots from [...] "within" [...] the wardrobe. For director David Kerr, the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place, ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved. The episode was filmed mostly in sequence, meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued, reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses. Kerr aimed for a particularly [...] "immersive" [...] filming style on the episode, with extensive use of wide angle shots. He aimed to avoid [...] "leading" [...] the audience with regards to the more important characters, by, for instance, [...] "not giving [...] coverage" [...] earlier in the episode.|$|E
