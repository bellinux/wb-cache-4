By the 1950s, 29sewers were dumping untreated sewage into the river. Dade County constructed a sewage treatment plant on Virginia Key in the 1950s and started connecting sewer lines to it, a project that took many years.|$|E

The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of {{the water in the}} bowl before it flows down the drain. The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas entering the building. Sewer gas escapes through a vent pipe attached to the <b>sewer</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

However, two police officers responding to reports of gunfire find the dead body of a telephone repairman hanging from a pole near the police station, and call for backup.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, {{the calf}} pasture on Columbia Point {{was used as}} a Boston <b>sewer</b> <b>line</b> and pumping station. This large pumping station still stands and in its time was a model for {{treating}} sewage and helping to promote cleaner and healthier urban living conditions. It pumped waste to a remote treatment facility on Moon Island in Boston Harbor, and served as a model for other systems worldwide. This system remained in active use and was the Boston Sewer system's headworks, handling all of the city's sewage, until 1968 when a new treatment facility was built on Deer Island. The pumping station is also architecturally significant as a Richardsonian Romanesque designed by the then Boston city architect, George Clough. It is also the only remaining 19th century building on Columbia Point and is in the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the <b>sewer</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{enforce the}} {{violated}} regulations more strictly {{and clean up}} the river, the city chose {{to cover it up}} entirely. Between 1917 and 1922, the last [...] of river, including a small gorge, was buried in a flume under the Getty Square neighborhood, an effort to halt the river's frequent floods and quarantine its unsanitary water, and open up some space for further development. That same decade, the county parks commission proposed the Saw Mill River Parkway along the river, just as the 1922 Bronx River Parkway follows the Bronx River, and to add a <b>sewer</b> <b>line</b> along the river to prevent contamination of Yonkers' water supply. Construction began in 1929 and continued throughout the Great Depression. By 1940, the parkway had reached the river's headwaters at Chappaqua, where World War II temporarily halted construction. In 1954, it was complete. The parkway's construction, along with that of the New York State Thruway later in the decade, required some adjustment of the river's course in some areas.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{establishment}} of the B rail yard, Ivy City attracted a large number of rail yard workers as residents. [...] This allowed the neighborhood to thrive. Nonetheless, Ivy City received few services from the city. In the 1920s, there was a single fire alarm callbox in the entire neighborhood, and the city had installed only a second main <b>sewer</b> <b>line.</b> But residents were dismayed when the city built a trash incinerator in 1928 at the junction of Mt. Olivet Road and West Virginia Avenue NE. As of 1931, only a single road (West Virginia Avenue NE) led gave access to Ivy City.|$|E
50|$|A second {{contract}} was let on June 1, 2007, to relocate two 42-inch (1.06 meter) diameter sanitary <b>sewer</b> <b>lines</b> that lie directly beneath where {{part of the}} new bridge will be built. Construction of the new <b>sewer</b> <b>lines</b> involved slant drilling through bedrock under New Haven Harbor.

50|$|Construction of the Northwest Expressway (now {{known as}} the Kennedy Expressway) in the mid-1950s {{required}} substantial relocation of <b>sewer</b> <b>lines</b> around the new thoroughfare. The Mayfair pumping station presented an additional engineering dilemma since these new sewers needed to go either under or over the large water mains that serve the station. An underground bridge, covered with earth fill, was constructed over the mains to carry the <b>sewer</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Germantown Master Plan {{was adopted}} in 1967. The {{plan for the}} [...] area {{included}} a dense central downtown area and less dense development surrounding it. In 1974, the Montgomery County Council approved an amended plan written by the Montgomery County Planning Board. The amended plan included a downtown area and six separate villages, each comprising smaller neighborhoods with schools, shopping areas, and public facilities. The amended plan also included {{the construction of a}} third campus for Montgomery College near the downtown area. The same year, the completion of a <b>sewer</b> <b>line</b> helped the development and growth of Germantown.|$|E
2500|$|The 11 foot 8 Bridge, {{formally}} {{known as}} the Norfolk Southern–Gregson Street Overpass, is a railroad bridge in Durham, North Carolina, United States, that has attracted media coverage and popular attention because tall vehicles such as trucks and RVs frequently collide with the abnormally low overpass, resulting in damage ranging from RV roof air conditioners being scraped off to entire truck roofs themselves being removed. The -year-old bridge along South Gregson Street provides only [...] of vertical clearance. It cannot be raised, because nearby railroad crossings {{would also have to}} be raised. The street cannot be lowered, because a major <b>sewer</b> <b>line</b> runs only [...] under Gregson Street.|$|E
2500|$|From 1993 to 1994, the city’s {{parks and}} {{recreation}} department worked with civic groups and used a grant to improve the natural areas of the park, which included consolidation {{of a variety of}} trails, plantings, and adding bird houses. A wildflower garden was added in 1997. Bisected by Turner Creek, the wetlands area of the park and the creek have experienced numerous sewer overflows beginning around 1995. An older <b>sewer</b> <b>line</b> runs along the creek and passes through the park on its way south to the wastewater treatment plant operated by Clean Water Services at Rock Creek.

2500|$|Dupont Circle {{is located}} in the [...] "Old City" [...] of Washington, D.C.—the area planned by {{architect}} Pierre Charles L'Enfant—but remained largely undeveloped until after the American Civil War, when there was a large influx of new residents. The area that now constitutes Dupont Circle was once home to a brickyard and slaughterhouse. There also was a creek, Slash Run, that began near 15th Street NW and Columbia Road NW, ran from 16thStreet near Adams Morgan, through Kalorama and within a block of Dupont Circle, but the creek has since been enclosed in a <b>sewer</b> <b>line.</b> Improvements made in the 1870s by a board of public works headed by Alexander [...] "Boss" [...] Shepherd transformed the area into a fashionable residential neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continued}} growth of Ashland into the unincorporated areas {{just outside the}} city limits has reduced the city's population. [...] Ashland has two zip codes, 41101 which is mainly within the city limits, and 41102 which serves {{part of the city}} and the surrounding unincorporated areas of the county. [...] These two zip codes combined contain approximately 40,000 residents, which is more reflective of the Ashland community's size. [...] In 1972, a proposal was floated to combine the governments of Boyd County, Ashland, and Catlettsburg. Commonly called ‘Unigov’ it failed 12,514 to 2,518 due to the polarity between the two cities. A commission to draft a charter to merge the three governments into a metro government was seated following a petition drive in 1988. [...] The measure fared much better at the ballot box than the earlier Unigov effort. [...] It was defeated by a 3 to 2 margin, although it carried the majority of the Ashland precincts. [...] The aftermath of the intitiative saw the elimination of the unpopular Ashland and Catlettsburg city stickers and cooperation in the extension of sewer lines into the unincorporated areas of Boyd County. [...] Largely due to the <b>sewer</b> <b>line</b> expansions, growth was spurred along the US 60 shopping corridor between downtown and Interstate 64.|$|E
