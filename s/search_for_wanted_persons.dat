50|$|Heydrich {{returned}} to Berlin {{on the same}} day, and EG Yugoslavia immediately got to work, establishing EK Belgrade in the district prison on King Alexander I Street, and sending SS-Sonderkommandos (ad hoc task forces, or SS-SKs) into {{the interior of the}} occupied territory on various tasks. One of these SS-SKs, commanded by SS-Sturmbannführer Karl Hintze, located the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Gavrilo V, whose name was on the list given to Fuchs. He was sheltering in Italian occupied Montenegro at the Ostrog Monastery, and was arrested and transferred to the Belgrade prison. The same SS-SK seized hundreds of millions of Yugoslav dinar notes and some gold that the fleeing Yugoslav government had been unable to take with it. Within the NDH, EK Sarajevo was established under SS-Sturmbannführer Alfred Heinrich, and in Bulgarian annexed Skoplje another EK was established under SS-Hauptsturmführer Rupert Mandl. In Hungarian-annexed territory, SS-Obersturmführer Karl Pamer led another EK at Novi Sad, and in the ethnic German-administered Banat, SS-Obersturmführer Zoeller set up his EK initially at Pančevo, and later moved it to Veliki Bečkerek. In the first weeks of the occupation, EK Belgrade's SS-Obersturmführer Fritz Müller led a SS-SK in searching for those on the list, but he lacked the manpower for the task, and relied heavily on the Abwehr and Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police), to locate and arrest the wanted people. This <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>persons</b> was the main initial task of EG Yugoslavia, and resulted in the sending of many arrested people to the Gestapo in Graz, or to concentration camps in the Third Reich. The roundup included diplomatic staff in various posts, including Berlin, despite this being a breach of diplomatic immunity. Documents obtained from the Yugoslav embassy in Berlin by Schellenberg's men indicated that the Yugoslav military attaché, Pukovnik (Colonel) Vladimir Vauhnik, had been obtaining information from the top echelons of the Wehrmacht, as he had advised Belgrade of detailed information about the Axis invasion two days before it began.|$|E

40|$|Hegel’s famous {{claim that}} “Philosophy {{is the child}} of its time” touches on how Philosophy {{incorporates}} new social issues that affect the lives of human beings. One of the main characteristics of philosophical thought, and a main line of research in classic and current philosophical works, lies in its contribution to explore how people face the risks, vicissitudes and changes that life presents. Love of wisdom, the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>wanting</b> to know more, the radical continuous thinking that Socrates speaks of and {{that is at the}} core of Philosophy are attitudes that encourage the capacity for indignation. Only when we question reality, when we reflect and wonder about what occurs to us or to others and its causes, can we have a better understanding of the pros and cons of our claims and can therefore come up with nonviolent actions to undertake. From this conviction, I would like to display the points of view of a Philosophy for Peace, an applied Philosophy with the objective of empowering our human capacities for transforming human and environmental suffering by peaceful means. Hence, this essay aims at reflecting on the significance of “indignation,” as it has recently emerged in social protest movements in Spain and elsewhere, from the genealogy of the notion of recognition...|$|R
