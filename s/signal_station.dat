5|$|After the war, Calshot {{returned}} to duty {{as an active}} air base, housing two squadrons of Sunderland flying boats which {{took part in the}} Berlin airlift of 1948, before being passed across to Maintenance Command in 1953. The Southampton Harbour Board built a coastguard lookout tower at the castle in 1952, and the following year they began to construct a <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> tower on top of the keep, complete with radar and radio facilities, which opened in 1958. By then, military seaplanes had become obsolete, and the RAF station was finally closed in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the Roman road, entrenchments and relics it seems that the earliest settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> on Castle Hills just {{to the west of the}} town as part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian's Wall with Eboracum (York) ran through what is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} {{management}} of the castle in 1983, and stripped back 20th-century additions to present it {{as it might have}} appeared in 1914, including demolishing the old <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> tower. The site remains open to visitors and received 5,751 visitors in 2010. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument. The air station's former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of the raid was to capture German servicemen for interrogation by attacking a <b>signals</b> <b>station</b> at Pointe de Plouezec on the north Brittany coast. One raiding party left Dartmouth on the 11 November in Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) 344. After reaching their target they discovered that the cliff tops were heavily mined. Rooney {{and one of his}} men checked out the <b>signals</b> <b>station</b> and a nearby pillbox. The <b>signals</b> <b>station</b> was protected by barbed wire and sentries and the pillbox was unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|While radio has {{superseded}} the telegraph-relay role of <b>signal</b> <b>stations,</b> {{a number}} of <b>signal</b> <b>stations</b> remain in operation in situations where static visual signals provide fast access to specific safety information, such a traffic signalling in ports and narrow passages, or navigational warnings. In Japan, <b>signal</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the form of}} lighted letter boards are extensively used to mark traffic conditions, one way flows and predominant currents. Most ports elsewhere in the world will use a form of the International Port Traffic Signals system.|$|R

5|$|In 1898, in {{response}} to the growing tension with Spain over Cuba, which led to the Spanish–American War, the Cape Florida lighthouse was briefly made U.S. <b>Signal</b> <b>Station</b> Number Four. It was one of 36 along the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast from Maine to Texas. The Signal Stations were established to provide an early warning of any approach of the Spanish fleet.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for {{passengers}} and mail. It had a <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> (built 1872) {{and a time}} ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.|$|E
5|$|The 105th Regiment Royal Garrison Artillery {{took over}} the manning of Pendennis Castle in 1902. A new barracks was built to house them, and a <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> was {{constructed}} {{on top of the}} old keep to coordinate operations with shipping, while the 16th-century guardhouse alongside the keep was demolished. The castle was reinforced by territorial soldiers during the First World War and additional defences were constructed on the landward side. It continued to defend the harbour and was also used for training purposes. After the war, Pendennis continued to be used for training gunners, but its 16th-century buildings were placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1920, and by 1939 the fortification's artillery had all been removed.|$|E
50|$|Signal stations: A {{small number}} of {{traditional}} visual <b>signal</b> <b>stations</b> remain in operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>stations</b> {{were the}} only {{practical}} mean of communicating with passing ships until the development of radio, and {{played a critical role}} in both navigation safety and commercial operation of fleets. As they were normally located in high places with extensive fields of view, surviving <b>signal</b> <b>stations</b> are often in scenic locations, and have become local landmarks. <b>Signal</b> <b>stations</b> used a variety of means to communicate shore-to-ship: Chappe Telegraph or other forms of pole-and-arm optical telegraph, flag semaphore, heliograph, slat semaphore, and port-specific signals (like flag and ball weather warnings). The most widespread method was through different forms of flaghoist. Signals were often private signals, requiring local knowledge or code books.|$|R

5|$|Roman remains, {{possibly}} a <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> or watchtower, {{have been identified}} on the island by an electrical resistance survey. Accurate exploration and interpretation of the site is difficult as it was reused by builders in both the Victorian era and during World War II. A carved stone head found on the island in 1991 {{is likely to be}} a Celtic head from the Romano-British era, but may be from the Iron Age. In addition to shards of cooking pots from the Roman era, some luxury items have been identified including Arretine ware, La Tène style brooches, and an amphora dating from between 90 and 140AD which was made in southern Spain. There have also been shards of Castor ware. Fragments of pottery roofing and box flue tiles have been identified signifying the presence of a heating system and {{possibly a}} bath house. Roman coins from the reigns of Claudius Gothicus (268–270) and Tetricus I (271–273) have also been found.|$|E
5|$|With Île de la Passe secure, Pym gave {{command of}} the {{blockade}} of Grand Port to Willoughby {{and returned to his}} station off Port Napoleon with Iphigenia. Willoughby used his independent position to raid the coastline, landing at Pointe du Diable on 17 August on the northern edge of Grand Port with 170 men and storming the fort there, destroying ten cannon and capturing another. Marching south towards the town of Grand Port itself, Willoughby's men fought off French counterattacks and distributed propaganda pamphlets at the farms and villages they passed. Willoughby re-embarked his troops in the evening but landed again the following day at Grande Rivière to observe the effects of his efforts. Burning a <b>signal</b> <b>station,</b> Willoughby advanced inland, but was checked by the arrival of 800 French reinforcements from Port Napoleon and returned to HMS Nereide. The brief expedition cost the British two men wounded and one missing, to French casualties of at least ten killed or wounded. Willoughby followed the attack on Grande Rivière with unopposed minor landings on 19 and 20 August.|$|E
5|$|Regensburg {{completed}} her trials on 10 March 1915, and was then {{assigned to the}} II Scouting Group. Eleven days later, she bombarded Russian positions near Polangen and Papensee; the operation lasted until the 24th. Captain Hans Zenker proposed that Regensburg and the liner Cap Polonio—which was to be armed with 15cm guns—should be sent out into the Atlantic to replace the commerce raiding cruisers that had been destroyed {{in the early months}} of the war. The fleet commander, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, argued the ships would eventually be sunk as well, and that any possible successes for the raiders would not equal the loss of a modern light cruiser or a large passenger liner. The suggested plan was therefore abandoned. On 1718 May, Regensburg took part in a mine-laying operation {{in the area of the}} Dogger Bank. On 25 August, she went into the Baltic to bombard Russian positions again, this time on the island of Dagö, including the lighthouse in St. Andreasberg and the <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> on Cap Ristna. On 1112 May, Regensburg participated in another mine-laying operation, this time off Texel. In September, she took part in anti-shipping sweeps in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. In early 1916, she continued supporting mine-laying operations and reconnaissance sweeps into the North Sea. On 2324 April, she participated in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft, conducted by the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group.|$|E

25|$|In December 1943 the Royal Australian Navy {{established}} a Port War <b>Signal</b> <b>Station</b> at False Cape, shifting personnel {{from the war}} <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> at Archer Point, which was closed down early in December. They may have shared the observation post with the army, as at Magnetic Island, although a 1944 plan of the area indicates navy accommodation in a separate structure at {{the crest of the}} hill. The <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> closed at the end of June 1945, following the movement of the Australian Army south.|$|E

50|$|The Liverpool to Holyhead {{semaphore}} telegraph {{was set up}} in 1826, {{on which}} Bidston had a <b>signals</b> <b>station.</b> This replaced a flag <b>signalling</b> <b>station</b> dating to 1763, and which itself was replaced in 1861 by an electrical telegraph. Along with the construction of Bidston Lighthouse in 1771, this facilitated shipping to the Port of Liverpool. Bidston Observatory was added in 1866, further enabling shipping movements on the River Mersey.|$|R

25|$|The {{new light}} at Caloundra Head had a {{relatively}} short working life, with nearby high-rise residential unit development obscuring views of the light from sea and rendering it ineffective. Downgraded, the 1968 light was transferred on a reduced area of land (868m2) to the Queensland Treasury in 1974 and it continued to operate as a harbour light and <b>signal</b> <b>station.</b> A new tower, Point Cartwright Light, constructed {{at the mouth of}} the Mooloola River at Point Cartwright in 1978 took over the role of lighting the North West Channel. In 1992 the function of the Caloundra <b>Signal</b> <b>Station</b> was replaced by an automatic radar/microwave link unit on the roof of units at Wickham Point to the east, resulting in the station being de-manned. In the late 1990s the light was replaced by a beacon on Wickham Point. Some radio equipment was left in operation at the Caloundra <b>Signal</b> <b>Station,</b> which is still used by local emergency services.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 Sydney Observatory {{was built}} near the <b>signal</b> <b>station.</b> For over a Century it played an {{essential}} role in shipping, navigation, meteorology and timekeeping and astronomy. Today the building is used as museum and public observatory.|$|E

25|$|A {{windmill}} {{was constructed}} {{on the site}} in 1796 by John Davis, an Irish convict. It was a stone tower used to grind wheat. It subsided {{a few years later}} and was replaced by another windmill to the south. These structures gave rise to the name Windmill Hill for this area. In 1804 Fort Philip was built on the Hill. It was supplied with four 6-pounder cannons and a gunpowder magazine. The powder magazine was moved to Goat Island in 1833, and Fort Philip was partially demolished in the 1850s. A <b>signal</b> <b>station</b> was built on the eastern rampart of Fort Philip in 1847 which was for many years called the Fort Philip <b>Signal</b> <b>Station.</b> This is now open to the public.|$|E
25|$|In 1866 {{there was}} a {{breakwater}} built at the junction of the Bremer and Brisbane rivers {{that was designed to}} stop shingle from blocking the access to the Bremer's boat channel.
