40|$|Grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.; guaya in Ethiopia and gilban in Sudan) {{has long}} been known as a source of forage for animals. It grows mainly in north and {{north-east}} Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. It is rich in protein (30 %), improves the quality of <b>sheep</b> <b>s</b> <b>wool,</b> fixes nitrogen in the soil and is very drought resistant. Both foliage and seeds are used for forage and the latter also for human consumption. But the plant contains a neurotoxin which paralyses leg muscles in humans if eaten as a main source of food for more than 3 months. It is harmless for animals and less harmful for humans when eaten in small quantities and accompanied by vitamin A-rich green vegetables. Especially in times of drought, when the beans are the only source of food for many people in Ethiopia, India and Sudan, the irreversible disease (neurolathyrism, named after the plant) takes its toll. Researchers working at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) harvested the first grasspea lines with low neurotoxin levels during trials in 2002. Four new lines resulted from a breeding programme, crossing low toxin Lathyrus varieties from the Middle East with varieties from Asia and Africa that contain higher levels of neurotoxin. Ethiopian researchers have now started developing locally adapted lines and seed production programmes.

40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>sheep</b> and <b>wool</b> {{industry}} {{is one of}} the oldest agricultural industries within the country. Since the mid 1940 ’s the industry has witnessed dramatic annual declines in sheep inventories. Many factors have contributed to the decline of the sheep industry including declining consumption of lamb and mutton, the growth in man-made fiber use, scarcity of labor, and predator losses. The U. S. congress has attempted to slow this decline throughout the years with various policy including the use of wool marketing loan programs. Such programs are intended to help bring stability as well as to mitigate price risk within the industry. However, despite these efforts the industry continues to experience annual declines in inventory. The United States has vast quantities of public land especially within the western states that is utilized for grazing of livestock every year. Public-land grazing is an important element within the sheep industry with a large portion of sheep producers utilizing the resources available through public-land grazing. For the vast majority of this public land, the fee to graze livestock is charged on a per AUM (animal unit month) basis and is established annually through the use of a set formula. Public grazing fee policy is a widely debated topic with many opposing viewpoints. This research will attempt to evaluate the effects on the sheep and wool industry of policy change in regards to increasing or decreasing the public grazing fee. This analysis uses capital stock inventory accounting methodology to create an econometric model of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>sheep</b> and <b>wool</b> industry. The model is then used to quantify the impact of different levels of public grazing fees under three scenarios which represent a baseline (current level of grazing fee), an increase in the public grazing fee, as well as a decrease in the grazing fee, respectively. Results indicate under a baseline no change scenario the sheep industry will remain relatively stable with some modest decline in numbers expected within the next five years. Abolishment of the public grazing fee would be expected to bring added stability to the sheep and wool industries with total sheep inventories expected to remain fairly constant with some modest growth projected within the next five years. This suggests that lowering the public grazing fee could be a possible policy alternative which could be implemented to help bring stability to the sheep and wool industries. Conversely, projections indicate that raising the grazing fee would have an adverse effect on these industries and contribute to a projected increase in the rate of decline of the sheep and wool industries...|$|R
40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> {{industry}} has long received lower prices for comparable wool types {{than those of}} Australia. In order to better understand such price differences, economic evaluations of both the U. <b>S.</b> and Australian <b>wool</b> markets were conducted. This research focused on two primary objectives. The first objective was to determine what price differences existed between the Australian and U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> markets and measure that difference. The second objective was to calculate price differences attributable to wool characteristics, {{as well as those}} resulting from regional, seasonal, and yearly differences. In order to accomplish the objectives, the study was set up into three different hedonic pricing models: U. S., Australian, and combined. In the U. S. model, there were significant price differences in season, year, region, level of preparation, and wool description. In addition, average fiber diameter (AFD) had a negative nonlinear relationship with price and lot weight had a positive linear relationship with price. The Australian model was notably different than the U. S. model in that there were only three variables. The yearly variable follows the same general pattern as the U. S. data but with a smaller span of difference. The seasonal price differences were distinctly different than the U. S. because of the difference in seasonal patterns. In addition, the AFD had a similar negative nonlinear relationship with price. The final model combines both the U. S. data and the Australian data. The combined model had only three variables: season, year, AFD and country. As {{in the case of the}} previous two models, AFD had the same negative nonlinear relationship and similar price elasticity. Overall, there was a - 30. 5 percent discount for U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> when compared to Australian wool. This can be attributed to several different factors. One of which is that the Australian wool {{industry has}} a more extensive marketing scheme when compared to the U. <b>S</b> <b>wool</b> market as a whole.

In order to achieve the purpose of this research, the choice experiment was applied to examine consumers' preferences for wool attributes. Both mail and on-line surveys were conducted. The mail survey included three versions: basic version, version with definitions of attributes, and version with both definitions and information about wool attributes, with ## responses received (a 29 percent response rate). The on-line survey contained the basic version and the version with both definitions and information about wool attributes, with 514 responses received. Conditional logit and multinomial logit models were used to examine willingness-to-pay for wool attributes and consumer segments, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative {{agent of}} Johne's disease (JD) {{persistently}} infects and survives within the host macrophages. While it is established that substantial genotypic variation exists among MAP, {{evidence for the}} correlates that associate specific MAP genotypes with clinical or sub-clinical disease phenotypes is presently unknown. Thus we studied strain differences in intracellular MAP survival and host responses in a bovine monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) system. Results Intracellular survival studies showed that a bovine MAP isolate (B 1018) and a human MAP isolate (Hu 6) persisted in relatively higher numbers when compared with a <b>sheep</b> MAP isolate (<b>S</b> 7565) at 24 -hr, 48 -hr and 96 -hr post infection (PI). MDMs stimulated with B 1018 up-regulated IL- 10 at the transcript level and down-regulated TNFα at the protein and transcript levels compared with stimulations by the S 7565 and Hu 6. MDMs infected with Hu 6 showed a down regulatory pattern of IL- 10 and TNFα compared to stimulations by S 7565. Cells stimulated with B 1018 and Hu 6 had low levels of matrix metalloprotease- 3 (MMP 3) {{and high levels of}} tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease- 1 (TIMP 1) at 96 -hr PI relative to MDMs stimulated by S 7565. Conclusion Taken together, results suggest that the bovine (B 1018) and the human (Hu 6) MAP isolates lead to anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive pathways in the macrophage environment whereas the <b>sheep</b> (<b>S</b> 7565) MAP isolate induces a pro-inflammatory pathway. Thus the infecting strain genotype {{may play a role in}} polarizing the host immune responses and dictate the clinicopathological outcomes in this economically important disease. </p...|$|R

A higher total DM yield was obtained under sheep grazing (P< 0. 05) than under cattle grazing, whereas grazing by cattle resulted in higher values of dead plant material compared to grazing by sheep (P< 0. 01). Application of 150 kg ha- 1 N resulted in 19. 2 % higher grassland DM yield in comparison with N 0 (P< 0. 01). Sheep grazing was less detrimental to legumes DM yield than was cattle grazing (P< 0. 05), whereas omission of N application (N 0) resulted in higher legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield compared to N 150 (P< 0. 01). A grazing management x N rate interaction (P< 0. 05) was recorded for legumes DM yield and their contribution to total DM yield.

Hope, and G. J. Eamens, Aust. Vet. J. 78 : 184 - 190, 2000). IS 1311 -PCR analysis typed all of the pigmented isolates as <b>sheep</b> (<b>S)</b> strains. The genetic relationship between pigmented and nonpigmented isolates was investigated by using multiplex PFGE data from the analysis of both the 5 pigmented isolates and 88 nonpigmented isolates of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis from a variety of host species and geographic locations. It was possible to classify the isolates into two distinct types designated type I, comprising the pigmented isolates, and type II, comprising the nonpigmented isolates, which exhibit a very broad host range...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of three types of rotational pasture: isolated (I – grazing only by <b>sheep),</b> simultaneous (<b>S</b> – simultaneous grazing by cattle and sheep) and alternated (A – granzing by cattle and then by sheep) on the structural and chemical traits of grass. Twelve crossbreed heifers, weighing initially 207 kg, 30 Santa Inês lambs, weighing 23 kg, and 16 adult ewes weighing 47 kg were used. The following parameters were determined on the pasture: forage mass available per grazing cycle (FMC); proportion of leaf (PF); stalk (PS); dead material (PDM), leaf:stalk ratio (L/S); levels of dry matter (DM); mineral matter (MM); crude protein (PB); ether extract (EE); neutral detergent fiber (NDF); acid detergent fiber (ADF); inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and total digestible nutrients (TDN). The S and I systems presented the smallest values for PS and NDF, while their values for L/S, CP, EE and TDN were higher than in A system. Therefore, the results showed that the grass offered to <b>sheep</b> in <b>S</b> and I systems had better quality than in the A system. There was not effect of systems and cycles of pasture on the others parameters evaluated. Tanzania grass available to sheep showed best structural and chemical traits in S and I systems while it presented worse quality in A system. The S system may be an alternative to traditional sheep rearing systems in the Brazilian savannah region...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a genotype on growth and basic carcass characteristics in male lambs. The experiment was carried out at an organic farm in Proseč and four different genotypes were included in the experiment: Šumavská <b>sheep</b> (<b>S)</b> 100, n = 8; S 50 Texel (T) 50, n = 11; T 75 S 25, n = 13 and S 75 T 25, n = 11. The genotype had no significant effect on most of the monitored growth parameters. The highest daily gain (DG) in the interval from birth to 100 days of age was found out in S 75 T 25 (327 g) but the highest DG from birth until the end of the experiment was found in S 50 T 50 (199 g). By contrast, the lowest DGs in both above mentioned intervals were found out in S 100 (265 and 147 g, respectively). With regards to basic carcass characteristics, the genotype had a significant effect only on proportion of kidney. The highest carcass yield (44. 80 %) was found in S 50 T 50 and the lowest (37. 66 %) in S 100. The best conformation score was found in S 75 T 25 (3. 18) and the lowest fatness score in S 50 T 50. To conclude, it is possible to state that use of the Texel rams in crossing with the Šumavská ewes had a positive effect on both growth and basic carcass characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{ecological}} {{and economic factors}} in milk and meat production stimulate use of legumes and grass-legumes mixtures, with zero or minimum mineral N as alternative to grass monoculture with high rate of mineral N. Research objective {{was to examine the}} effect of N application (0 -N 0 and 150 kg ha- 1 year- 1 -N 150) and rotational grazing by cattle (C) and <b>sheep</b> (<b>S)</b> on white clover: growing points number, stolon lenght, stolon dry weight, dry matter yield and clover contribution to total annual herbage production. N 150 significantly reduced the growing points number, stolon length and stolon dry weight for more than 70 % compared to N 0. Grazing treatment affected stolon population density only in interaction with N application because of N 150 significantly reduced white clover population density only in sheep grazing. S-treatment had higher clover DM yield (0. 21 t ha- 1) than C-treatment (0. 13 t ha- 1). N 0 had higher clover DM yield (0. 25 t ha- 1) than N 150 (0. 09 t ha- 1). However, the interaction grazing management x N rate was significant for clover DM yield and clover contribution to total DM yield. N 150 reduced both parameters for 80 % only in sheep grazing while difference in DM yield and clover contribution to total DM yield between grazing treatment was recorded only in N 0 Sheep grazing increased DM yield for 150 % and clover contribution for 99 % compared to cattle grazing...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop and refine new yarn and knit textile combinations using Nuyarn technology for a selected niche market. New Zealand’s Nuyarn is an industryconnected project with Massey University and Levana Textiles. Levana Textiles is a woolen mill based in Levin with over 50 years industry experience. Through the exploration of trend forecasting, iterative design process, market research as well as finding a gap in the market, this result in unique New Zealand products that can demand a premium price. Nuyarn technology is a new and innovative way of spinning yarn. The technology enhances the yarn performance by taking the twist out, and instead it lays the fibres along the same orientation {{as the rest of the}} yarn. Levana Textiles have purchased Nuyarn spinning technology. Through the use of this technology, Levana is producing and introducing innovative and newly improved products into the textile market. This technology is paramount in setting them apart from other textile mills as well as bringing a point of difference in the market. There is a need to achieve smarter performance in blended yarns for circular knitwear apparel. The wool industry endured hard times in previous years due to the rise in demand for synthetic fibres in the 1960 <b>s.</b> <b>Wool</b> is now re-emerging with companies focusing on new developments and innovation with the fibre. As a result of intensive research and development, cutting-edge design process and contemporary insight into the industry have enabled Levana to lead the way in the development of new yarn combinations and improved yarn performance through the use of new spinning technology.
