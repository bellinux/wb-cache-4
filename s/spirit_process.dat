40|$|This session {{describes}} {{a process for}} developing the “E Spirit ” by using authentic learning experiences across several different learning environments. The process will describe how more than 1, 600 students have used this process and outcomes than have been developed {{as a result of}} the experience. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This study reports on the development and products of a model to infuse entrepreneurship across curricular areas, disciplines and across campuses. Emphasis will be placed on products and / or new venture ideas developed by the process. The model is designed to teach students to recognize new opportunities, to marshal resources in the face of risk and to implement their solutions in everyday life. Instructional methods include problem-based learning, curriculum integration, community involvement and just-in-time learning delivered via the Internet. In previous USASBE sessions, we have presented the process, now we want to present selected products from the Entrepreneurs in Action process. Application of knowledge developed from this “E <b>spirit</b> <b>process</b> will be discussed by several different professors from several different universities and public schools.

40|$|This journal issues entitled: Special Issue: Social Work and Mental Health, A Global Research and Practice PerspectiveIn {{working with}} clients who are {{experiencing}} major difficulties in life, the more traditional, psychopathology-oriented approach is often content with symptom reduction and adaptive functioning. This article proposes that therapists can aim higher, going beyond survivorship. Inspired by Chinese medicine's holistic model, the authors develop the Eastern body-mind-spirit approach {{with the primary}} therapy goal being the facilitation of harmonious dynamic equilibrium within oneself, {{as well as between}} oneself and the natural and social environment. To achieve that, multimodal interventions are employed, including vitalizing body work, such as simplified Tai Chi and Qigong exercises, acupressure, body scan, breathing meditation, and mindful tea drinking and eating, as well as vibrant mind and <b>spirit</b> <b>process,</b> such as the acknowledgement and acceptance of impermanence and unpredictability, regaining self-control by letting go of control, the appreciation and affirmation of life, the fostering of loving kindness and forgiveness. The spiral application of these multimodal interventions activates the interconnected body-mind-spirit systems to rebalance among themselves and arrive at a new harmonious dynamic equilibrium. The benefits of the approach are multidimensionala multimodal approach can access and engage more clients; its focus on strength can avoid over-elaborated psychopathology treatment; and transformed clients are change catalysts, {{both inside and outside the}} therapeutic group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

500|$|According to Helen Vendler, [...] "To Autumn" [...] {{may be seen}} as {{an allegory}} of artistic creation.

40|$|We {{explore a}} variant of a {{recently}} introduced operation on images, which provides an adequate basis for modeling computations in which concurrent agents cooperatively construct (pointed) pictures. In this setting, concurrent agents generate languages of multi-dimensional words on partially ordered alphabets through a simple operation of overlapping, constrained by the order imposed on the alphabet. The overlapping operation is {{proved to be a}} powerful tool for picture generation in general. The operation is parametric with respect to the composition law, and we show how some simple requests on the behavior of this law provide a meet-semilattice structure to the class of pointed pictures. This feature allows their use in building a model for concurrent <b>processes</b> in the <b>spirit</b> of <b>process</b> algebras...|$|R

Execution in a reactive system proceeds in bursts of activity. In each phase, the environment stimulates the system with an input, obtains a response in bounded time, and may then be inactive (with respect to the system) for an arbitrary period of time before initiating the next burst. Examples of reactive systems are controllers and signal-processing systems. The primary issu [...] ...|$|R

It is a new covenant {{in the form of}} a law of faith. In this, a new heart replaces the old heart. This old heart was defective because it was always divided between the letter and the spirit. 12 apostles were needed to preach the second commission but a whole tribe of Levi, the first. [...] "So likewise is the old heart given in Levi, which will have the old law of the old tabernacle forms, and multitudes of blind priests must be maintained for their fruitless prayers, outward formalities and simple ninny's."

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} packaging and labeling attributes of sugarcane spirit on consumers' behavior by applying the results of conjoint analysis in sugarcane spirit market share simulation. Firstly, a conjoint analysis was performed aiming to estimate the part-worths of each consumer for some sugarcane spirit packaging and labeling attributes. These part-worths {{were used in the}} market share simulation using the maximum utility model. It was observed that some packaging and labeling attributes affected consumer's purchase intention and that most consumers showed a similar preference pattern regarding these attributes. These consumers showed preference for the Seleta brand, which was bottled in 700 mL clear glass bottles with a metal screw cap that bore a label illustration unrelated to sugarcane <b>spirit</b> production <b>process</b> and had the information "aged 36 months in oak barrels". This study also showed that conjoint analysis and the use of its results in the market share simulation proved important tools to better understand consumer behavior towards intention to purchase sugarcane spirit...|$|R
40|$|The tcc {{model is}} a {{concurrent}} constraint programming formalism for timed, reactive and deterministic computation. A remarkable feature of the tcc model is that programs and specifications are given in the same language. In this report we develop an extension of tcc that allows the specification of nondeterministic computation. We call this extension the ntcc model. The ntcc model is based upon ideas from both concurrent constraint programming and CCS-like models. The expressiveness of ntcc is illustrated by showing derived constructs such as parameterless recursion, cells and value-broadcasting processes, and by specifying temporal requirements such as eventuality, time-bounded response and time-bounded invariance. We claim the applicability of ntcc by modeling reactive system examples of RCX controllers. We present ongoing work on a denotational semantics and a proof system for the model. In the <b>spirit</b> of <b>Process</b> Algebra, we also define a behavioral equivalence for the ntcc model based upon the notion of (weak) bisimulation...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{reasoning}} about Haskell programs that use Software Transactional Memory (STM). As a motivating example, we consider Haskell code for a concurrent non-deterministic tree rewriting algorithm implementing the operational semantics of the ambient calculus. The core of our theory is a uniform model, in the <b>spirit</b> of <b>process</b> calculi, of the run-time state of multi-threaded STM Haskell programs. The model was designed to simplify both local and compositional reasoning about STM programs. A single reduction relation captures both pure functional computations and also effectful computations in the STM and I/O monads. We state and prove liveness, soundness, completeness, safety, and termination properties relating source processes and their Haskell implementation. Our proof exploits various ideas from concurrency theory, such as the bisimulation technique, but in the setting of a widely used programming language rather than an abstract process calculus. Additionally, we develop an equational theory for reasoning about STM Haskell programs, and establish for the first time equations conjectured by the designers of STM Haskell. We conclude that using a pure functional language extended with STM facilitates reasoning about concurrent implementation code...|$|R
