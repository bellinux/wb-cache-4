The standard linear programming formulation given by Gilmore and Gomory (1961) is the following. Let be given the <b>stock</b> <b>length</b> L and the piece lengths l i, i = 1; : : :; m, not larger than L, and order quantities b i of piece i, i = 1; : : :; m. A cutting pattern is a combination of pieces having a total length not larger than L. It can be represented by a nonnegative integer vector a j = (a 1 j; : : :; a mj) T. The objective is to minimize the number of stock lengths needed to fulfill the order demands [...] ...|$|E

They included five different sizes (76 x 51 x 6. 4, 127 x 76 x 6. 4, 64 x 64 x 6. 4, 64 x 64 x 4. 8, and 76 x 76 x 6. 4 mm) and slenderness ratios varying from 69 to 201. The gauge distances were varied from the minimum {{to the maximum}} possible value for each size of angle. The effect of the connection type (snug tight and pretensioned) was also investigated. The effect of {{the width of the}} connected leg (long leg connected versus long leg out) was studied. All experimental failure loads were compared to CAN/CSA-S 16. 1 - 94 (Limit States Design of Steel structures), CSA-S 37 - 94 (Antennas, Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures). It was shown that the S 16. 1 standard was extremely conservative while the S 37 standard gave more realistic estimations. Variation of yield stress across the cross-section was determined for forty-two <b>stock</b> <b>lengths</b> of angles. Although the nominal yield stress was 300 MPa for all the specimens, the yield stresses determined ranged between 311 and 479 MPa with an average value of 363 MPa.

A field trial was conducted with Gliricidia sepium cuttings to investigate the effect if three stock lengths (20, 30 and 40 cm), two stock diameters (1. 5 - 2. 5) and (3. 0 - 3. 5 cm) and three planting angles (30 °, 60 ° and 90 °) in a factorial experiment. There were high significant differences (p< 0. 05) in all the growth parameters of the stock diameters and stock lengths used.

30|$|In this section, we {{will apply}} column {{generation}} technique to obtain another solution to our problem, {{which may be}} used with larger size systems. This technique originally had been applied to cutting-stock problem, which consists of cutting a set of available stock lengths to meet customer orders for items in required lengths and quantities {{with the objective of}} minimizing the wasted material [18]. Distinct combination of items in length and quantities cut from a <b>stock</b> <b>length</b> is called a pattern. In column generation approach, the optimization problem is divided into two types of sub-problems referred to as restricted master and pricing problems [18]. The Restricted master problem (RMP) determines if the explored patterns satisfy the job demand constraints. The pricing problem finds a new pattern to feed the RMP. The objective function of the pricing problem is in fact the reduced cost coefficient of the RMP. The RMP and pricing problems collaborate until reduced cost coefficients (objectives) of the pricing problems become negative indicating optimal solution has been reached. In our problem, there will be T pricing problems, one for each server type. RMP {{is in the form of}} integer linear program (ILP) and pricing problems are combinatorial optimization problems. RMP is solved using continuous relaxation, which at the end requires integer rounding of the results. There has been some work for application of column generation technique in quadratic programming [19 – 21].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —We used electrofi shing {{data from}} Oklahoma and Texas {{reservoirs}} to evaluate potential temporal (spring, summer, and fall) and spatial (reservoir section and habitat) biases associated with different sampling strategies for estimating size-related metrics (mean total length, proportional size distribution [PSD], and proportion of <b>stock</b> <b>length</b> fi sh [PSL]) of blue catfi sh Ictalurus furcatus. Regardless {{of how many}} individual fi sh were sampled, site-specifi c estimates of mean total length often deviated from the population mean, suggesting that fi sh within a site were of similar size. Bias across seasons was not consistent {{for any of the}} length metrics tested. Only one population had length-related differences between reservoir sections. Blue catfi sh collected from channel habitats were consistently larger than those collected from point or fl at habitats. To identify the number of sites required to reduce deviations in estimates of size-related metrics, we used a Monte Carlo simulation technique to evaluate 3, 5, 10, 20, or 50 randomly selected sites. Regardless of how many individual fi sh were sampled, when too few sites were sampled, size-related metrics deviated farthest from the population mean. No-tably, the population with a truncated length distribution had the least deviation. Simulations indicated that randomly sampling 10 – 20 sites resulted in estimates with consistent deviations 50 mm from the population mean. More effort may be required to routinely estimate PSD and PSL within 10 units. In some situations, biologists may consider stratifying the sample by habitat; however, gains in accuracy and precision may not compensate for increased effort needed to precisely quantify the habitat...|$|E
