40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the different components of a laser scanner for industrial applications, like quality control or future domestic applications such as {{the front end of}} a video phone system. The scanner implemented in this project is based on the line laser range finding principle. The laser beam of an ImW Helium-Neon laser is diffracted in a vertical line, which is projected on the object. The profile highlighted on the object surface is recorded from a Vidicon camera, digitised and stored in the computer. The object is rotated from a <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> this way a series of profiles is acquired. The image of the profile is processed in order to eliminate the noise and define it, as clearly as possible. Different calibration methods have been investigated in order to extract the three dimensional co-ordinates of the profile points. The system has a resolution of 0. 7 mm/pixel and an average error of 0. 3 %. Each profile curve is segmented into a series of straight line segments {{in order to reduce the}} amount of data stored. The Marching Cubes Algorithm has been implemented and enhanced to speed up the formation and connectivity of the triangular facets. The algorithm yields sub pixel accuracy representations of the object but it is slow and requires a lot of temporary storage for the triangle connections. Both of the previously mentioned algorithms result in a wireframe mesh representation of the object. An algorithm has been designed to measure the internal volume of the object from its wireframe representation with an average error of 0. 8 %. The algorithm is based on the principle of a parallelepiped scanning the object in a raster fashion. The total volume of the, object is the sum of the elementary parallelepiped volumes. The scanning speed of the algorithm depends on the slantness of the object facets. Finally, the reconstructed object is displayed on the screen with a CAD style software. The project has exposed the inadequacies of the PC DOS environment as a development system for machine vision research in terms of its storage capabilities and its video graphics subsystem. The implemented system compares favourably with similar commercial systems. The project has proved that it is possible to implement a laser scanner on a low cost budget with reasonable accuracy and resolution...|$|E

40|$|In {{these days}} {{due to the}} {{information}} technology {{there are many ways}} to control a remote servomotor. In the paper it is shown a simple and reliable way to handle the control and monitoring of a remote <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> using a Local Area Network (LAN). The hardware uses a common PIC microcontroller and a stand-alone Ethernet controller. The main program located in the flash program memory solves the following tasks: read packs through SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) from the Ethernet controller's buffer and decode them, encapsulate data to be sent with the Ethernet controller, control the on-off state of the transistors from the static converter and receive feedback directly from the optical sensor to monitor the actual position of the shaft. The microcontroller supervises also the Ethernet controller. The Ethernet controller's job is to receive data from the main application remote program that runs on a computer, via UTP cable. Then it stores the data for a short time in a buffer from which the microcontroller can read it. The microcontroller stores data on this Ethernet controller too and can command it to send data to the main application program running remotely. The main remote program is written <b>in</b> Visual C++ <b>and</b> has a friendly interface allowing to the operator to send commands to the <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> drive <b>and</b> monitor <b>in</b> a dedicated window position, speed or the control sequences for the power transistor drivers of the <b>stepper</b> <b>motor.</b> The operator can send specific commands to the drive such as Start, Stop, Accelerate, Decelerate, Spin Clockwise/Counter clockwise and the number of steps.

40|$|Aircraft wakes ar~ {{dominated}} {{by a pair of}} strong counter-rotating vortices that give rise to the well known 'wake hazard' wherein an aircraft encountering the wake may be subjected to severe forces and moments. Eventually, naturally occurring instabilities grow and cause the breakdown of the wake vortices. The purpose of this current study is to gain a further understanding of instabilities which are supported by <b>and</b> develop <b>in</b> counter-rotating vortex pairs (vortex dipoles). Particularly, it is of importance to try to ascertain under which conditions such instabilities develop and grow and whether it is possible to promote their occurrence by means that could bOe practically implemented on an aircraft. Also ofinterest is whether there are conditions under which such instabilities may not occur. This research is mainly of an experimental nature in which the studies are conducted using water as a medium. A rig has been designed and built to generate a pair of counter rotating vortices in a water tank. The vortices are generated by rotating two flat plates submerged in the water. As the plates rotate, the fluid boundary layer rolls off of the plate edges and thus generates a vortex. The plates are controlled via a <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> code written <b>in</b> LabView. Vortex strength, r, core radius, a, and separation distance between the vortex pair, h, can be controlled by rotating the plates at various angular velocities and though various angular displacements. The rig described above generates vortices with no axial velocity, besides those which occur due to end effects. In order to compare the behaviour of vortices with axial velocity to those without, experiments have also been conducted on a delta wing which was towed through a large (8 m long) water tank. The vortices have been characterised by computing a velocity field from experimental data derived using the PlY technique. Subsequent to this, the vortex characterisation parameters, circulation, r, core radius, a, and separation distance, b, were extracted by means of a least squares fit to a Lamb-Oseen vortex profile. In order to observe instabilities which may occur, the colunmar vortex centre line was mapped by means of flow visualisation using hydrogen bubbles as markers. A new data processing algorithm has been developed to extract frequencies and amplitudes of the 'wave' like vortex centre line disturbance from the flow visualisation and has provided a new insight into this phenomenon. A full discussion of the accuracy of the techniques used is given in the thesis. The results presented are for vortices with Rer (where Rer = r/v) ranging between 2000 and 10000, core radius, a, ranging between 5 mm and 15 mm and the ratio of core radius to separation distance, alb, ranging between 0. 15 and 0. 3.
