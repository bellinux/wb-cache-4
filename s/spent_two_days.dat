5|$|After a short stint {{with the}} Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League, Tyler {{attempted}} {{to earn a}} spot on the Minnesota Vikings but was waived during training camp. Tyler now lives in Covington, Washington, working as a juvenile detention officer for King County. When Marsh, Tyler's former Huskies teammate and co-CIF player of the year honoree, had his ankle amputated, Tyler <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> at his bedside.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} the British steamer, Emden turned south to Simalur, {{where she met}} the captured collier Buresk. Müller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the Cocos Islands; he intended to destroy the wireless station there and draw away British forces searching {{for him in the}} Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, Emden <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> combing the Sunda Strait for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off Direction Island at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by Kapitänleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hellmuth von Mücke, Emdens executive officer. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.|$|E

5|$|Merrick {{became one}} of 928 {{residents}} in the workhouse. The group was segregated by age and sex, and therefore Merrick was housed with the other men between 16 and 60. On 22 March 1880, only 12 weeks after entering, Merrick signed {{himself out of the}} workhouse and <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> looking for work. With no more success than before, he found himself with no option but to return to the workhouse. This time he stayed for four years. Around 1882, Merrick underwent surgery on his face. The protrusion from his mouth had grown to 8–9inches and severely inhibited his speech and made it difficult to eat. He was operated on in the Workhouse Infirmary under the direction of Dr Clement Frederick Bryan and had {{a large part of the}} mass removed.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States Grand Prix on 24 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at various racing circuits across Europe between 26–29 September {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren's test driver Olivier Panis flew to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours to undertake preparations for Suzuka and development work on their 2001 car. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> at the Fiorano Circuit testing mechanical components and ran on an artificially wet track for testing of Bridgestone's wet weather tyre compounds. Williams, with rookie competitor Jenson Button, went to the Autódromo do Estoril for two days and tried wet weather tyres and different aerodynamic configurations. Prost travelled to Magny-Cours and their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin collected three days of chassis design data for the upcoming AP04 chassis. Benetton opted to miss testing prior to the event but their test driver Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E

5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E
5|$|Larger clubs became {{interested}} in buying him {{during the summer of}} 2002 and he decided to consider his options before deciding on his future. He trialled with Everton in May 2002, and played in a friendly against Falkirk in the Alex Scott Memorial Trophy, keeping a clean sheet. He revealed he was interested in a move to Everton, and due to Fettis' good form for York, he decided to pursue a move. After his contract expired on 30 June 2002, Howarth joined Wolves for a second trial in July for a two-week period. After playing in Wolves' opening pre-season friendly against Morecambe, he was invited to join them for their pre-season tour of Portugal. Despite being out of contract at York, the club was entitled a fee as he was under 24 years of age, but a bid of £60,000 from Wolves was rejected. He was recalled by York {{to take part in a}} pre-season friendly against Sunderland, although he refused to participate. Howarth told Dolan he did not want to play for the club, as any potential injury could have ended his proposed transfer. His proposed move to Wolves continued until August 2002, and late that month he trained with Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. He played in a practice match for Tottenham, but after they failed to follow up their interest in him Wolves made a bid to sign him on loan, which York rejected. After Marlon Beresford left York, and Howarth's proposed moves elsewhere fell through, he re-signed for the club in September 2002 on a week-to-week contract. Despite this, he <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> on trial with Premier League club Newcastle United in late September 2002. Howarth's first appearance of 2002–03 came in a 4–3 away defeat to Lincoln City on 22 October 2002 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round, after Fettis was rested due to injury.|$|E

25|$|Soon after questioning, Whiting {{walked to}} his van, but {{was stopped by}} {{undercover}} police and arrested. Whiting <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> in custody, {{but there was no}} evidence to press any charges and Whiting was released on bail. Police had found a receipt for fuel from Buck Barn garage on the A24, not far from Coolham where one of Payne's shoes was found. This contradicted his alibi of being at a funfair in Hove at 5:30pm and then returning to his flat by 9.30pm on the night that Payne had disappeared.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September 1779, Pearl {{engaged the}} 28-gun Santa Monica off the Azores. Pearl left Fayal on 13 September {{where she had}} <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> taking on {{drinking}} water. At 6:00 the following morning, the Spanish frigate was spotted to the north-west and was brought to action after a 3½-hour chase. The Santa Monica surrendered after a two-hour engagement, having 38 men killed and 45 wounded. Pearl had 12 killed and 19 wounded. The Santa Monica was a larger frigate than Pearl, at 956 tons burden, but not as well armed; she was rerated as a 36-gun when taken into British service.|$|E

It is foolish to trust a Chinese kite to the hands of a young child.|$|R
50|$|At {{the meeting}} the DataCenter shared {{research}} {{that it had}} conducted on the work and {{the demographics of the}} membership of each organization and the possibility of common corporate targets among all the groups.

25|$|The conference {{began on}} Thursday September 1 with a banquet for the delegates. Parties and banquets were held each {{night after the}} day's discussions had ended, except for Sunday September 4, when they did not meet. The representatives from the Province of Canada {{dominated}} the conference, overshadowing {{the concerns of the}} Maritimes, and laying out foundations for the union that benefited them the most. Four of the first five days were spent outlining the Canadian position, and the Maritime representatives did not discuss their own plans until September 6 and 7. One Canadian delegate, George Brown, <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> discussing the details of the proposed constitution, which would keep Canada within the British Empire.|$|E

Arriving there on 15 September, they took part in the last Australian {{withdrawal}} of the campaign, falling back on Imita Ridge, before the Japanese themselves were forced to withdraw having exhausted their supply lines. Following this, the battalion took part in the Australian advance towards Gona, subsequently taking part in significant battles at Templeton's Crossing and Gorari throughout October and November, before taking part in the Battle of Buna–Gona in late November–early December.|$|E
25|$|Sultana <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> {{traveling}} upriver, {{fighting against}} one of the worst spring floods in the river's history. At some places, the river overflowed the banks and spread out three miles wide. Trees along the river bank were almost completely covered, until only the very tops of the trees were visible above the swirling, powerful water. On April 26, Sultana stopped at Helena, Arkansas, where photographer T.W. Bankes took a picture of the grossly overcrowded vessel. Near 7:00 P.M., Sultana reached Memphis, Tennessee, and the crew began unloading 120 tons of sugar from the hold. Near midnight, Sultana left Memphis, went a short distance upriver to take on a new load of coal and then started north again.|$|E

The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine so rapidly that she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. Balao fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, could see no sign of damage. The warships were long gone at their high speed.|$|E
25|$|On 17 April, Kormoran sighted a {{passenger}} ship, {{but was unable}} to lure her into range before the vessel disappeared into a rain squall. Two days later, Kormoran met Atlantis and the blockade runner Dresden. An expected shipment of white metal for Kormoran had been supplied to a different blockade runner, which was delayed. Several supply ships arrived at the rendezvous point {{over the next few days}} and transferred provisions, ammunition, and fuel to the raider. Prisoners from Kormoran were handed over to the other ships, and the raider received new sailors to make up numbers. Kormoran departed on 22 April, and <b>spent</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> changing her disguise to the Japanese freighter Sakito Maru before sailing into the Indian Ocean.|$|E
