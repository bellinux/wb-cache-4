5|$|A Short History of Progress is a non-fiction {{book and}} lecture series by Ronald Wright about {{societal}} collapse. The lectures were delivered {{as a series}} of five speeches, each taking place in different cities across Canada as part of the 2004 Massey Lectures which were broadcast on the CBC Radio program, Ideas. The book version was published by House of Anansi Press and released {{at the same time as}} the lectures. The book <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year on Canadian best-seller lists, won the Canadian Book Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year, and was nominated for the British Columbia's National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction. It has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Citys {{marketing}} campaign {{was designed to}} reach an audience outside of superhero fans and appeal to consumers who are attracted to games like the first-person shooter series Call of Duty. Warner Bros.'s marketing team decided that Batman's status as a cultural icon and superhero was unavoidable, {{so they decided to}} emphasize other elements of the character that could appeal to fans of first-person shooters and action games. Black-and-white photographs of iconic personalities like inventor Steve Jobs and actor James Dean served as inspiration and a basis for the final {{marketing campaign}} used in advertisements and the game's cover art. The imagery, highlighted with blood and bathed in light was considered {{to move away from the}} classic superhero image and refocus on Batman's humanity. The black and white campaign was featured on 120 magazine covers and was targeted towards approximately 15 million consumers across a variety of social media and Warner Bros. products, in addition to a series of viral marketing videos and stunts involving actors in costume attending press-related events. By April 2012, three gameplay trailers had gained approximately 6 million views. The viral segment of the campaign involved several audio recordings between characters from the game including Hugo Strange, Quincy Sharp, Riddler, and the Penguin; each recording could be found by solving a puzzle. The entire campaign <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year in development, producing artwork, videos, DLC, printed advertisements, billboards, and events, and was estimated to have cost at least $10 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} a similar joint effort in the Soviet textile {{industry}} emerged during the Russian leg of a European fact-finding mission of ACWA president Hillman. Hillman <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month in Soviet Russia studying the difficult situation facing its textile industry. Shocked by the famine and disrepair, Hillman advocated the immediate appropriation of financial aid to Soviet Russia, believing that infusion of foreign capital {{would be required to}} restore the Russian industrial base.|$|E
25|$|Broadchurch {{creator and}} writer Chris Chibnall {{described}} {{the project as}} a labour of love. He <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade in the United Kingdom working on various television programs, and initially conceived Broadchurch about 2003 while working on his first series, Born and Bred. The concept was to explore how a child's murder affects a small, close-knit community, and how the characters react to the media attention and the mutual suspicion that arises.|$|E
2500|$|... "Matchbox" [...] is {{considered}} a rockabilly classic. The day it was recorded, Elvis Presley visited the studio. Perkins, Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash (who left early) <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour singing gospel, country and rhythm-and-blues songs while a tape rolled. The performers at this casual session were called the Million Dollar Quartet by a local newspaper the next day. These recordings were released on CD in 1990.|$|R

25|$|Having <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{century as}} part of the Russian Empire, in 1918 Georgia regained {{independence}} and established the First Republic. In 1921 Georgia was invaded and occupied by Bolshevik Russia to form the Soviet Union in 1922. When the country regained independence in 1991, the bilateral Russo-Georgian ties were once again strained due to Moscow's support of the separatist regions within Georgia, Georgia's independent energy policies and most recently, its intentions to join NATO.|$|E
25|$|He {{left his}} {{studies in the}} 1960s and took up a {{clerical}} position with the Socialist International, where he received {{an invitation to a}} conference in Ghana. He attended, and instead of returning to Canada, <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year working, traveling, and teaching in various places in Africa. He recalled in his 2005 Massey Lectures that the relatively brief sojourn would be a key influence on his life, especially {{after the turn of the}} new millennium.|$|E
50|$|On 22 September 1914 Collet, {{flying a}} Sopwith Tractor Biplane, led a raid by four aircraft, which flew {{two hundred miles}} to attack the Zeppelin sheds at Düsseldorf and Cologne, in the first British air raid of the war. Thick mist in the Rhine Valley meant that only Collet found his target, and he {{accurately}} dropped two 20 lb bombs from 400 ft on the shed at Düsseldorf, although the bombs failed to explode. Despite being hit by enemy fire, he returned safely, as did the other three aircraft; they had <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour flying over Cologne attempting to find their target, but after failing to do so they returned to base without dropping their bombs.|$|R
2500|$|Lodzinski {{reported}} to investigators {{that she and}} her son had spent time at Holmdel Park during the afternoon before driving to the evening carnival. According to park police, the Holmdel lot where she claimed to have parked was closed that day.

Merritt, who claimed to be the last person McStay called from his cellphone, also said that he had passed a polygraph exam and did not know anything that could help solve the family's disappearance. When asked if he thought Merritt was a suspect, Joseph McStay's father Patrick said, [...] "I have to have faith in Chase because I have to have faith in my son. I believe that (Joseph McStay) trusted Chase and believed in Chase. Do I think Chase is involved? I don't think so and I truly hope not." ...|$|R

25|$|By 1904, Stieglitz {{was again}} mentally and {{physically}} exhausted and decided to take his family to Europe in May. He planned a grueling schedule of exhibitions, meetings and excursions and collapsed almost upon arrival in Berlin, where he <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month recuperating. He {{spent much of the}} rest of 1904 photographing Germany while his family visited their relations there. On his way back to the U. S. Stieglitz stopped in London and met with leaders of the Linked Ring but was unable to convince them to set up a chapter of their organization in America (with Stieglitz as the director).|$|E

5000|$|On May 15, 2006, Chaya, {{exhausted}} {{after his}} successful summit bid, saw his triumph turn to tragedy as he encountered a dying climber {{on his way}} back from the summit of Everest. The name of the distressed climber was David Sharp. Chaya and his Tibetan Sherpa Dorjee, tried their best to help. They <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour next to the stricken climber, whom they did not know, desperately trying to revive him. Unfortunately, Sharp was unconscious and frozen from the knees down. He did not respond to the oxygen administered. Chaya later reported that although very sad of the man's fate, he was confident that nothing more could have been done for him at that stage. [...] "He was much closer to death than he was to life." ...|$|R
25|$|Hochschild {{cites the}} {{research}} of several historians, many of them Belgian. He refers especially to Jules Marchal, formerly a Belgian colonial civil servant and diplomat who (as Hochschild describes) spent twenty years trying to break Belgian silence about the massacres. The documentation {{was not easy to}} come by; the furnaces of the palace in Brussels are said to have <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> week burning incriminating papers before Leopold turned over his private Congo to the Belgian nation. For many years Belgian authorities prevented access to what remained of the archives, notably the accounts given by Congolese to the King's Commission.|$|E
25|$|Strauss <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade {{drumming}} {{up support}} in Northern California. The bridge faced opposition, including litigation, from many sources.

The navy feared that a ship collision or sabotage to the bridge could block the entrance to one of its main harbors. Unions demanded guarantees that local workers would be favored for construction jobs. Southern Pacific Railroad, {{one of the most}} powerful business interests in California, opposed the bridge as competition to its ferry fleet and filed a lawsuit against the project, leading to a mass boycott of the ferry service.|$|E
25|$|They {{began to}} depart from Jaure on 28 October. Captain Boice {{could not find a}} single good place for {{aircraft}} to drop supplies between Jaure and Natunga in the steep foothills northeast of Jaure, leading to the Buna area. During their five-day trek to Natunga, most of the troops' rations dropped between those two points were lost. The men were reduced to eating bananas and papayas or whatever else they could find or had gone hungry. They finally reached the Natunga area on 2 November. There, they <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> week drawing rations, helmets, boots, and other equipment before pushing on to Gora and Bofu, which they reached on 12 November.|$|E

5000|$|Alexander {{lived in}} the Quaker {{community}} in Stoke Newington Church Street, in a very well regarded group of houses known as Paradise Row. Here he was visited in 1850 by Alphonse de Lamartine, and in 1853 by Harriet Beecher Stowe. His and the society's interests were no longer confined to the British empire and as treasurer {{he appears to have}} given freely of his own money. The American freed slave and later abolitionist and statesman, Frederick Douglass, wrote in 1855 after hearing Alexander give a speech in Britain, [...] "George William Alexander ... has <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> American fortune in promoting the anti-slavery cause in different sections of the world." [...] The Society's balance sheet in 1854 showed that Alexander was still treasurer and that income was £766 whilst expenditure was £856, with £321 [...] "due to the treasurer".|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, in {{constant}} rain and through swollen streams, Mackenzie and Burrup {{had made their}} {{way down to the}} river, and there with much difficulty obtained a canoe. On the first night of the voyage all the party, except the Bishop, wished to go on, because the mosquitoes rendered rest impossible. He thought moving on in the dark imprudent, but gave up his own will, and even wrote jestingly afterwards on the convenience of making the mosquitoes act as a spur. The consequence was that they came suddenly upon a projecting bend; the boat upset, and everything they had was in the water. They <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour in recovering what could be brought up; but their powder and their provisions were spoilt, and, what was still worse, their medicines: including the quinine, almost essential to life, and that when they were thoroughly drenched {{in the middle of an}} African night.|$|R
25|$|Gabriel {{spent his}} early life living in fabulous splendor {{on the last}} period of Imperial Russia. His father, a {{respected}} poet, was a first cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II {{and one of the}} wealthiest members of the Romanov family. As a child, Gabriel was frail and or poor health; he was pale and prone to illness. He and Ivan were both often sick and together <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year of their childhood living at Oreanda in the Crimea, with a doctor and several servants. Their health improved in the temperate climate, and the boys enjoyed their time spent on the beaches and in short tours around the peninsula. With only each other, for company, they forged a strong sibling relationship that was to last to the ends of their lives.|$|E
25|$|From 1838 to 1840, he {{attended}} the (Protestant) University of Halle in Germany, where he studied linguistics, history, and philosophy. He {{was influenced by the}} works of the German philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Johann Gottfried Herder. Also during this period, his poetic cycle Dumky večerní ("Evening Thoughts", written in Czech) was published in the Czech journal Květy. He left Pressburg for Halle in September 1838. On his way to Halle, he <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month in Prague, in the company of Czech patriots. In the spring of 1839, Štúr made a long journey to the Upper and Lower Lusatia in Germany (inhabited by Slavs) and got in touch with the Slavs there. He wrote the short travelogue Cesta do Lužic vykonaná na jar 1839 ("A journey to Lusatia made in the spring of 1839"), written in Czech and published in the Czech journal Časopis českého musea.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the mid-1930s, the Yale University scholar Stanley Williams {{supervised}} {{more than}} a dozen dissertations on Melville that were eventually published as books. Where the first wave of Melville scholars focused on psychology, Williams' students were prominent in establishing Melville Studies as an academic field concerned with texts and manuscripts, tracing Melville's influences and borrowings (even plagiarism), and exploring archives and local publications. Jay Leyda, known for his work in film, <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade in archives and small-town libraries gathering documents and records for a day by day record, published as Melville Log (1951). Sparked by Leyda, {{the second phase of the}} Melville Revival emphasized research rather than accepting Melville's early books as reliable accounts. The post-war scholars tended to think that Weaver, Harvard psychologist Henry Murray, and Mumford favored Freudian interpretations which read Melville's fiction too literally as autobiography; exaggerated his suffering in the family; and mistakenly inferred a homosexual attachment to Hawthorne. They saw a different arc to Melville's writing career. The first biographers saw a tragic withdrawal after the cold critical reception for his prose works and largely dismissed his poetry. A new view emerged of Melville's turn to poetry as a conscious choice that placed him among the most important American poets.|$|E
