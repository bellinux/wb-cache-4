50|$|In the 10th century, {{following}} the Synod of Split, Split gained jurisdiction {{over much of}} the Dalmatian coast, except southern regions (including most of Duklja), which were under the Archbisphopric of Dyrrhachium. However, Splits pre-eminent position was soon challenged by other cities vying for metropolinate status - Bar and Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The East-West Schism would soon have a great impact upon Serbia, not only religiously, but also politically. Since Serbia was positioned at the border zone between Roman and Constantinopolitan jurisdiction, Serb rulers tried to exploit this rivalry to their advantage. The Slavs who lived along the southern Dalmatian coast fell under the religious jurisdiction of Rome, via the Archbishops of <b>Split,</b> <b>Bar</b> and Ragusa. The rest, in the hinterland stretching to Serbia, were under the Patriarch of Constantinople via the Archbishops of Ohrid, Sirmium and Dyrrhachium. King Mihailos prerogative was to establish an autocephalous Slavic Church - an independent state requires an independent church. For political reasons, he turned to Rome, since {{at the time he was}} in less than amicable relations with Byzantium. Michael presumed that the Pope would jump at the chance to expand his jurisdiction in southern Dalmatia, but Michaels wish was not easily forthcoming. Although some studies have stated that his request to raise Bar to an Archbishopric was granted in 1067, it seems that the cited bull is not authentic. In 1089, Constantine Bodin managed to raise the bishopric of Bar to an Archbishopric, by supporting the pope against an antipope. The suffragan bishops were to be: Kotor, Ulcinj, Svač, Skadar, Drivast, Pula, Ras, Bosnia and Trebinje. In obtaining its promotion, it acquired a much larger diocese, including territory that earlier had not been under the pope - territories of the metropolitan of Durazzo and Archbishop of Ochrid, two sees that recognized the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bar Archbishoprics new territory were merely theoretical - the popes edict could only affect the churches that recognized Rome. Making Rascia a suffragan to Bar had little meaning, as most of its churches were under Constantinople, and there is no evidence of Vukan changing adherence to Rome. Durazzo and Ochrid may have suffered minimal territorial losses along the coast, Duklja was briefly a subject to Rome, however inland Duklja was not affected, and along with much of Dukljas coast (like most of Kotor) was to retain its loyalty to Orthodoxy.|$|E

40|$|Direct impact Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar systems offer many potential advantages over split Hopkinson {{pressure bar}}s, including access to higher strain rates, higher strains for equivalent striker velocity and system length, lower dispersion and faster achievement of force equilibrium. Currently advantages are gained at a significant cost: {{the fact that}} input bar data is unavailable removes all information about the striker impacted specimen face, preventing the determination of force equilibrium, and requiring approximations {{to be made on}} the sample deformation history. Recently photon Doppler velocimetry methods have been developed, which can replace strain gauges on Hopkinson bars. In this paper we discuss an experimental method and complementary data analysis for using Doppler velocimetry to measure surface velocities of the striker and output bars in a direct impact bar experiment, allowing similar data to be recorded as in a <b>split</b> <b>bar</b> system, with the same level of convenience. We discuss extracting velocity and force measurements, and improving the accuracy and convenience of Doppler velocimetry on Hopkinson bars.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of ultrafine-grained (UFG) and coarse-grained commercially pure aluminum was characterized in tension at {{a wide range}} of strain rates using the tensile Hopkinson <b>Split</b> <b>Bar</b> (THSB) technique and a servohydraulic materials testing machine. Sheet UFG aluminum specimens were wire EDM cut from large equal channel angular pressed (ECAP) ingots, manufactured using the route C+Bc. UFG aluminum is prone to necking at very low strain levels due to its inability to strain harden. Although necking commences almost immediately after yielding, the material is capable of deforming plastically to relatively large plastic strains before final failure. One problem with the tensile Hopkinson <b>Split</b> <b>Bar</b> method with dog-bone specimens is the inaccurate strain measurement due to the deformation taking place outside the specimen gauge section. Strain measurement inaccuracy can, however, be overcome by monitoring the deformation with the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method, which gives the full field strain distribution of the sample surface. In this work, Aramis® 3 D image correlation software with two digital high speed cameras was used for the full field strain measurements. Accurate strain measurement enables, among other things, determination of the strain rate distribution and dynamical necking {{behavior of}} the specimen. The UFG material is shown to strain harden during necking at high strain rates, although the strain hardening rate is not enough to postpone the necking at room temperature...|$|E

For this purpose, a bevelled end is cemented to the input bar and the output bar are rotatable to be parallel to the inclined plane of the bevelled end.

Such a testing method is validated by the simulation of the whole loading system (<b>split</b> <b>bar</b> + specimen) using ABAQUS code. It shows that this combined shear-compression test provides a quite accurate measurement. Tests on the 5052 aluminium honeycombs are performed.

40|$|Development of {{the method}} for {{assessing}} the strength of engineering structures, considering {{the effects of the}} non-locality fracture in the area of stress concentrators, under different loading regime {{is one of the major}} scientific interests. In the present study the linear-elastic Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) is modificated for the case of elasto-plastic material behavior. The for plotting Johnson–Cook model was used for simulation of material behavior, and an elasto-plastic critical distance value was used in order to estimate the strength of the tested samples. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed design methodology was checked against experimental data: the cylindrical un-notched specimens and samples with stress concentrators of titanium alloy Grade 2 were tested under tensile loading with different strain rate. Mechanical tests were carried out using a 300 kN electromechanical testing machine Shimadzu AG-X Plus and Gopkinson-Kolskiy's <b>split</b> <b>bar.</b> The obtained results showed that the use of the modification of the TCD based on elasto-plastic material behavior gives us estimates falling within an error up to 12 % which means that the elasto-plastic TCD gives more accurate predictions than the linear elastic TCD solution (when using of elastic stress information the error interval is ± 15 - 20 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{behavior}} of ultrafine-grained (UFG) commercially pure aluminum (AA 1070) samples prepared via two different equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) routes was studied at high strain rates at room and sub-zero temperatures using the Hopkinson <b>Split</b> <b>Bar</b> technique, and at quasi-static strain rates {{at room temperature}} using a servohydraulic materials testing machine. For comparison, similar tests were also conducted on coarse-grained AA 1070 aluminum samples. 3 D- and 2 D-ECAP dies were used to deform the initial coarse-grained aluminum to total equivalent plastic strains of ca. 10 using routes Bc and C+Bc, respectively. The ECAP processing increased {{the strength of the}} material substantially {{but at the same time}} reduced its strain hardening capability. After initial yielding, strain softening took place in all studied UFG materials at quasi- static strain rates, but at high strain rates (above 103 s- 1) notable strain hardening was observed. Strain hardening was further enhanced by sub-zero temperatures, at least at high strain rates. The microstructures of the ultrafine-grained and coarse-grained materials were investigated prior to and after the compression tests using a transmission electron microscope. Increased dislocation activity at high strain rates and at sub-zero temperatures suggests dislocation mediated plasticity still to play a substantial role in the deformation of the studied ultrafine-grained materials...|$|E
40|$|A new {{apparatus}} and method is {{proposed for the}} investigation of material behavior under high-strain-rate tensile loads. We refer this apparatus as a Split Flying Bar. The method is based on using the inertia of a working mass attached to a specimen. The specimen is placed between the working mass (front part of the bar) and backing part of the bar, which is captured in flight by special brake. When the back part of the flying <b>split</b> <b>bar</b> is stopped, the working mass continues the flight by inertia, creating specimen tension with strain rate depending {{on the length of}} specimen and velocity of flying bar. Properly choosing the working mass and the speed of the flying bar, one can tune maximal stress and strain rate over a wide range. The method is highly scalable and can be used for investigation of specimens from single filament up to reasonable macroscopic size. Contrary to tensile SHPB, the method provides a way to investigate materials with practically arbitrary strain to failure. For example, polyuria, whose strain to failure reaches hundreds of percent. Also, the method can be used for high-strain rate pull-out tests or to measure the quality of adhesion layers under high-stress rates, e. t. c.

40|$|High Entropy alloys (HEAs) are a {{new class}} of {{materials}} that are referred as the resurgence of physical metallurgy in the materials research. The properties generated by these unconventional compositions are astonishing, which could potentially replicate many materials in the industrial applications. The main motto of this thesis is to study the properties of two different HEAs after annealing treatments and high strain rate testing. The theoretical description of the four core effects, properties and a detailed description of thermody-namics influencing the phase formation of HEAs are included in the theory. The annealing treatment of the induction melted Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi and Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNiMo 0. 25 HEAs was carried out. The annealing treatments included quenching and normalizing in the furnace. The microstructural characterization was done by using the optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, elemental mapping was done by EDS and phase recognition was done by X-ray diffraction. The high strain rate properties were investigated for the induction melted samples and an arc melted Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi HEA sample (received from high entropy alloy research group, Chalmers university of technology), which was the reference material for comparison of properties. The technique used was Hopkinson <b>split</b> <b>bar</b> (HSB) compression testing. Finally, the corrosion tests were done in diluted acidic medium in comparison with TWIP steel to check the passivation. The Optical microscopy, SEM and EDS had given a brief idea about the phases formed in the induction melted Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNiMo 0. 25 and Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi HEAs. The comparison of Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi HEA with arc furnace casted Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi reference sample has shown new phases. The annealing treat-ment was done for 3 days for each induction furnace casted sample. These samples were subsequently quenched or cooled (normalizing). The annealed alloys were inspected with SEM and also elemental distribution was analyzed to confirm the presence of different phases. The final confirmation of phases was done with X-ray diffraction measurements. The Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi had formed totally different phas-es compared to reference material due to inclusions. The Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNiMo 0. 25 had formed a copper rich and molybdenum rich phases with minor amount of inclusions or amorphous precipitates. This mo-lybdenum addition had increased the hardness. High strain rate testing proved that Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNiMo 0. 25 is ductile, whereas Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNi (induction cast) is very brittle because of new phase formation. The corrosion tests of Al 0. 5 CoCrCuFeNiMo 0. 25 proved that it is more noble than the reference TWIP steel sample in acidic aqueous solution...|$|E
