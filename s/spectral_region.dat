5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E

500|$|Atomic line filters may {{operate in}} the ultraviolet, visible and {{infrared}} regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In absorption-re-emission ALFs, the frequency of light must be shifted {{in order for the}} filter to operate, and in a passive device, this shift must be to a lower frequency (i.e. red shifted) simply because of energy conservation. This means that passive filters are rarely able to work with infrared light, because the output frequency would be impractically low. If photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are used then the [...] "output wavelength of the ARF should lie in a <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> in which commercial, large-area, long-lived PMT's [...] possess maximum sensitivity". In such a case, active ALFs would have the advantage over passive ALFs as they would more readily, [...] "generate output wavelengths in the near UV, the <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> in which well-developed photocathodes possess their highest sensitivity".|$|E

This {{is usually a}} laser in the visible <b>spectral</b> <b>region,</b> for instance, a HeNe laser [...] with a wavelength of 632.8nm. Therefore, single-wavelength ellipsometry is also called laser ellipsometry. The advantage of laser ellipsometry is that laser beams can be focused on a small spot size. Furthermore, lasers have a higher power than broad band light sources. Therefore, laser ellipsometry {{can be used for}} imaging (see below). However, the experimental output is restricted to one set of [...] and [...] values per measurement. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources, which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet <b>spectral</b> <b>region.</b> By that the complex refractive index or the dielectric function tensor in the corresponding <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> can be obtained, which gives access to a large number of fundamental physical properties. Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) can probe lattice vibrational (phonon) and free charge carrier (plasmon) properties. Spectroscopic ellipsometry in the near infrared, visible up to ultraviolet <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties, for instance, band-to-band transitions or excitons.|$|E
2500|$|Infrared {{absorption}} bands trap heat from escaping earth's atmosphere. In {{the case of}} CFCs, the strongest of these bands {{are located in the}} <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> 7.8–15.3µm [...] – referred to as an atmospheric window due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region. The strength of CFC bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere, at which the compound absorbs and emits radiation, are two factors that contribute to CFCs' [...] "super" [...] greenhouse effect. Another such factor is the low concentration of the compound. Because CO2 is close to saturation with high concentrations, it takes more of the substance to enhance the greenhouse effect. Conversely, the low concentration of CFCs allow their effects to increase linearly with mass.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR), using an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell, was evaluated for the authentication of 25 Gruyere PDO and L'Etivaz PDO cheeses produced at different altitudes in Switzerland.

2500|$|In a pure xenon lamp, the {{majority}} of the light is generated within a tiny, pinpoint-sized cloud of plasma situated where the electron stream leaves the face of the cathode. [...] The light generation volume is cone-shaped, and the luminous intensity falls off exponentially moving from cathode to anode. [...] Electrons passing through the plasma cloud strike the anode, causing it to heat. As a result, the anode in a xenon short-arc lamp either has to be much larger than the cathode or be water-cooled, to dissipate the heat. The output of a pure xenon short-arc lamp offers fairly continuous spectral power distribution with a color temperature of about 6200K and color rendering index close to 100. However, even in a high pressure lamp there are some very strong emission lines in the near infrared, roughly in the region from 850–900nm. This <b>spectral</b> <b>region</b> can contain about 10% of the total emitted light. Light intensity ranges from 20,000 to 500,000cd/cm2.

40|$|The radiometric and {{spectral}} consistency {{among the}} Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) is fundamental {{for the creation}} of long-term infrared (IR) hyperspectral radiance benchmark data sets for both intercalibration and climate-related studies. In this study, the CrIS radiance measurements on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite are directly compared with IASI on MetOp-A and MetOp-B at the finest spectral scale and with AIRS on Aqua in 25 selected <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> through simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) observations in 2013, to evaluate radiometric consistency of these four hyperspectral IR sounders. The spectra from different sounders are paired together through strict spatial and temporal collocation. The uniform scenes are selected by examining the collocated Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) pixels. Their brightness temperature (BT) differences are then calculated by converting the spectra onto common spectral grids. The results indicate that CrIS agrees well with IASI on MetOp-A and IASI on MetOp-B at the long-wave IR (LWIR) and middle-wave IR (MWIR) bands with 0. 1 – 0. 2 K differences. There are no apparent scene-dependent patterns for BT differences between CrIS and IASI for individual spectral channels. CrIS and AIRS are compared at the 25 <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> for both polar and tropical SNOs. The combined global SNO data sets indicate that the CrIS–AIRS BT differences are less than or around 0. 1 K among 21 of 25 <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> and they range from 0. 15 to 0. 21 K in the remaining four <b>spectral</b> <b>regions.</b> CrIS–AIRS BT differences in some comparison <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> show weak scene-dependent features...|$|R

40|$|Determination {{of a gas}} medium {{temperature}} by diode laser absorption spectrometry (DLAS) {{is based on the}} measurement of integral intensities of the absorption lines of a test molecule (generally water vapor molecule). In case of local thermodynamic equilibrium temperature is inferred from the ratio of the integral intensities of two lines with different low energy levels. For the total gas pressure above 1 atm the absorption lines are broadened and one cannot find isolated well resolved water vapor absorption lines within relatively narrow spectral interval of fast diode laser (DL) tuning range (about 3 cm− 1). For diagnostics of a gas object in the case of high temperature and pressure DLAS technique can be realized with two diode lasers working in different <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> with strong absorption lines. In such situation the criteria of the optimal line selection differs significantly from the case of narrow lines. These criteria are discussed in our work.

To study the possible causes for the difference in classification performance, key sensor parameter differences between MSS and TM, including: (1) spatial resolution (30 m for TM versus 80 m for MSS), (2) quantization level (256 levels for TM versus 64 for MSS), and (3) <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> (seven bands in four major <b>spectral</b> <b>regions</b> for TM versus four bands in two regions for MSS), were evaluated.
