5|$|On October 25, 1788 Jones' team {{began their}} survey of Grimsby Township; it was {{completed}} November 13, 1788. Saltfleet Township was surveyed from November 14, 1788 to December 25, 1788 and Binbrook Township was surveyed from December 24, 1788 until February 12, 1789. All of these townships were surveyed using the Front and Rear system, except Binbrook, which was surveyed with the <b>Single</b> <b>Front</b> system. During this time, Frey had assigned two other surveyors to lead surveys in the Nassau district. Daniel Hazen and Jesse Pawling both led teams, but neither group was {{as busy as}} Jones' group. Hazen's group surveyed only four townships, and incompletely, and Pawling's three, also incompletely. In November 1789 Jones began acting as the deputy surveyor in Nassau District as Frey had left Upper Canada, and he officially received the position in early 1791 {{on the order of}} Deputy Surveyor General John Collins.|$|E
5|$|The main visual {{difference}} between the Kand K1classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned <b>single</b> <b>front</b> spectacle plates, {{and a pair of}} substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the Kclass locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No.A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos.A891-A900) alongside a batch of five N1class 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No.A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The Østensjø Line {{became part}} of the Oslo Metro in 1967, and several of the Class E trams were {{transferred}} {{to other parts of the}} tramway. However, the Lilleaker Line was instead tied to the Ekeberg Line on the east side of the city, and the trams started operating on the Jar–Ljabru service. After the last bus route had been converted to one-man operation and the conductor replaced with a ticket-selling motorman, Oslo Sporveier started the process of converting their tram fleet. No. 176 was converted as a trial, and after 1971, all the remaining Gullfisks were converted. Because the trams had been delivered with a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> door, the cost of converting the trams was very little, and the single-manning highly profitable.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} lists only include vehicles {{ordered by}} the company named, however many took additional vehicles second-hand from other operators. The code following the chassis model 'type' column shows the number of seats. The prefix B represents a bus body, C a coach or DP a dual purpose vehicle. The suffix F shows a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> door, D shows dual front and centre doors.|$|E
25|$|Until 1980, {{streetcar}} routes had names but not numbers. When the CLRVs were introduced, the TTC assigned route {{numbers in}} the 500 series. CLRVs have a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> rollsign showing various combinations of route number and destination, while PCC streetcars showed a route identifier (route name until the 1980s and later route number) and destination on two separate front rollsigns. The digital destination signs on the new Flexity Outlook streetcars show route number, route name and destination. Streetcar-replacement bus services also do not indicate the route name.|$|E
50|$|The <b>single's</b> <b>front</b> cover {{features}} Untitled #17 by American artist Richard Diebenkorn. Crafted in 1981, {{the image}} was created using gouache, crayon and graphite on paper, and also appears in the liner notes to Shields, alongside other Diebenkorn works.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Jones and his sister, {{along with}} a 12 year old {{apprentice}} opened a small <b>single</b> <b>fronted</b> shop in 1860, before expanding to larger premises in the same street shortly after, later expanding this store by buying the neighboring Blue Boar pub.|$|R
50|$|Two promotional posters {{were issued}} {{to promote the}} single, {{the most common of}} the pair was simply an {{oversized}} reproduction of the <b>single's</b> <b>front</b> cover.The second version featured a monochrome image of a beach scene. This version of the poster was heavily reproduced for commercial sale during the mid-1980s.|$|R
25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added {{either side of the}} rear door facing inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> seat of the van and pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults. The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan.|$|E
25|$|In August 1939, the Soviet {{government}} decided {{to improve relations}} with Germany by concluding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, pledging non-aggression {{between the two countries}} and dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. While Hitler conquered Poland and France and other countries acted on a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> at the start of World WarII, the USSR was able to build up its military and occupy the Western Ukraine, Hertza region and Northern Bukovina {{as a result of the}} Soviet invasion of Poland, Winter War, occupation of the Baltic states and Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.|$|E
25|$|Police {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} {{the lives of people}} in the three-story apartment building might be at risk, so they couldn't afford to barricade the building and wait. They determined that due to the location of Mixon's sister's apartment within the building, {{there was no way to}} ensure that other residents could safely be brought through the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> entry door to the street. Mufarreh decided to send in the SWAT officers prematurely, assessing that the threat level was low due to a high unlikelihood that Mixon would actually be present inside the apartment. Tactical commander Captain Rick Orozco approved of Mufarreh's plan.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the types}} of telescopes that amateurs build vary widely, {{including}} Refractors, Schmidt–Cassegrains and Maksutovs, the most popular telescope design is the Newtonian reflector, described by Russell W. Porter as “The Poor Man's Telescope”. The Newtonian {{has the advantage of}} being a simple design that allows for maximum size for the minimum expense. And since the design employs a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> surface mirror as its objective it only has one surface that has to be ground and polished, as opposed to three for the Maksutov and four for the refractor and the Schmidt–Cassegrain. Typically a Newtonian telescope of 6” or 8" [...] (15 or 20cm) aperture is a standard starter project, constructed as a club project or by individuals working from books or from plans found on the Internet.|$|E

50|$|Mlahsô is phonologically less {{conservative}} than Turoyo. This is particularly noticeable {{in the use}} of s and z for classical θ and ð. The classical v has been retained though, while it has collapsed into w in Turoyo. Also sometimes y (IPA /j/) replaces ġ. Mlaḥsô also renders the combination of vowel plus y as a <b>single,</b> <b>fronted</b> vowel rather than a diphthong or a glide.|$|R
2500|$|Lambert {{stopped the}} work {{at this stage of}} {{fabrication}} and shipped the non-working engine and incomplete automobile to a small machine shop that he owned in Ohio City. This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a jack shaft. The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The <b>single</b> <b>front</b> wheel of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever. This direct steering method provided that the arms could be rested and the steering done by the feet, and vice versa. One item that needed to be solved for completion and a working engine was a means of carburation. Lambert heard of a means of vaporizing gasoline by Gottlieb Daimler of Germany. He went to New York to see the engine that was operating a boat. After seeing this complicated carburetor Lambert developed what he called the [...] "vaporizer." [...] This was a simpler carburetor than Daimler's, which he was then able to get the engine working the way he intended it to. The automobile was completed soon after he had it Ohio City.|$|E
2500|$|Zuber {{wrote that}} the Schlieffen Memorandum was a [...] "rough draft" [...] {{of a plan to}} attack France in a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> war, which could not be {{regarded}} as an operational plan, as the memo was never typed up, was stored with Schlieffen's family and envisioned the use of units not in existence. The [...] "plan" [...] was not published after the war, when it was being called an infallible recipe for victory, ruined by the failure of Moltke adequately to select and maintain the aim of the offensive. Zuber wrote that if Germany faced a war with France and Russia, the real Schlieffen Plan was for defensive counter-attacks. Holmes supported Zuber in his analysis that Schlieffen had demonstrated in his thought-experiment and in , that [...] corps (1.36 million combat troops) was the minimum force necessary to win a decisive battle against France or to take strategically important territory. Holmes questioned why Moltke attempted to achieve either objective with [...] (970,000 front-line troops), only [...] of the minimum required. In the 1914 campaign, the retreat by the French army denied the Germans a decisive battle, leaving them to breach the [...] "secondary fortified area" [...] from the Région Fortifiée de Verdun (Verdun fortified zone), along the Marne to the Région Fortifiée de Paris Paris fortified zone).|$|E
2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
