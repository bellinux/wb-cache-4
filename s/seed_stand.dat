Significant (p < 0. 05) differences were found among the <b>seed</b> <b>stands</b> in both sites for most of the characteristics, suggesting an additive genetic control with different levels of significance depending on the evaluated trait and the testing site.

40|$|Hybridization is an {{important}} evolutionary force, because interspecific gene transfer can introduce more new genetic material than is directly generated by mutations. Pinus engelmannii Carr. {{is one of the}} nine most common pine species in the pine-oak forest ecoregion in the state of Durango, Mexico. This species is widely harvested for lumber and is also used in reforestation programmes. Interspecific hybrids between P. engelmannii and Pinus arizonica Engelm. have been detected by morphological analysis. The presence of hybrids in P. engelmannii <b>seed</b> <b>stands</b> may affect <b>seed</b> quality and reforestation success. Therefore, the goals of this research were to identify introgressive hybridization between P. engelmannii and other pine species in eight <b>seed</b> <b>stands</b> of this species in Durango, Mexico, and to examine how hybrid proportion is related to mean genetic dissimilarity between trees in these stands, using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers and morphological traits. Differences in the average current annual increment of putative hybrids and pure trees were also tested for statistical significance. Morphological and genetic analyses of 280 adult trees were carried out. Putative hybrids were found in all the <b>seed</b> <b>stands</b> studied. The hybrids did not differ from the pure trees in vigour or robustness. All stands with putative P. engelmannii hybrids detected by both AFLPs and morphological traits showed the highest average values of the Tanimoto distance, which indicates: i) more heterogeneous genetic material, ii) higher genetic variation and therefore iii) the higher evolutionary potential of these stands, and iv) that the morphological differentiation (hybrid/not hybrid) is strongly associated with the Tanimoto distance per stand. We conclude that natural pairwise hybrids are very common in the studied stands.

Plantations can help meet this demand, if the shoot borer is controlled through silvicultural techniques as well as selected seed sources.

40|$|We {{report a}} method using {{variation}} in the chloroplast genome (cpDNA) to test whether oak stands of unknown provenance are of native and/or local origin. As an example, a sample of test oaks, of mostly unknown status in relation to nativeness and localness, were surveyed for cpDNA type. The sample comprised 126 selected trees, derived from 16 British seed stands, and 75 trees, selected for their superior phenotype (201 tree samples in total). To establish whether these two test groups are native and local, their cpDNA type was {{compared with that of}} material from known autochthonous origin (results of a previous study which examined variation in 1076 trees from 224 populations distributed across Great Britain). In the previous survey of autochthonous material, four cpDNA types were identified as native; thus if a test sample possessed a new haplotype then it could be classed as non-native. Every one of the 201 test samples possessed one of the four cpDNA types found within the autochthonous sample. Therefore none could be proven to be introduced and, on this basis, was considered likely to be native. The previous study of autochthonous material also found that cpDNA variation was highly structured geographically and, therefore, if the cpDNA type of the test sample did not match that of neighbouring autochthonous trees then it could be considered to be non-local. A high proportion of the <b>seed</b> <b>stand</b> group (44. 2 per cent) and the phenotypically superior trees (58. 7 per cent) possessed a cpDNA haplotype which matched that of the neighbouring autochthonous trees and, therefore, can be considered as local, or at least cannot be proven to be introduced. The remainder of the test sample could be divided into those which did not grow in an area of overall dominance (18. 7 per cent of <b>seed</b> <b>stand</b> trees and 28 per cent of phenotypically superior) and those which failed to match the neighbouring autochthonous haplotype (37. 1 per cent and 13. 3 per cent, respectively). Most of the non-matching test samples were located within 50 km of an area dominated by a matching autochthonous haplotype (96. 0 per cent and 93. 5 per cent, respectively), and potentially indicates only local transfer. Whilst such genetic fingerprinting tests have proven useful for assessing the origin of stands of unknown provenance, there are potential limitations to using a marker from the chloroplast genome (mostly adaptively neutral) for classifying seed material into categories which have adaptive implications. These limitations are discussed, particularly within the context of selecting adaptively superior material for restocking native forests...|$|E

High incidence of butt rot was noted in all of the studied <b>seed</b> <b>stands</b> (47 % to 87 % of diagnosed tree samples). Stand age had a significant effect on percentage share of ‘damaged wood' on the tomogram. The extent of rot damage was rising with stand age, and the largest was observed in the age category 160 – 170 years. Spruce stands of Istebna provenance were generally more damaged by butt rot than those of Orawa provenance, however, the latter have been growing in forest sites more suitable for spruce in terms of fertility and altitude. Hierarchical analysis of variance did not show a statistically significant relationship between the region of provenance and average share of ‘damaged wood' on the tomogram.

Higher stand stem densities (≥ 3000 st/ha) yielded even more biomass (ca. 300 m 3 /ha) with only slight reductions in DBH (Study I). The effects of different silvicultural regimes on 20 -year-old direct <b>seeded</b> PC <b>stands</b> were analyzed in a field experiment. A high biomass regime (no PCT) produced 144...|$|R
50|$|Some animals, {{including}} birds, reptiles, {{and insects}} such as bees, can see near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Many fruits, flowers, and <b>seeds</b> <b>stand</b> out more strongly from the background in ultraviolet wavelengths {{as compared to}} human color vision. Scorpions glow or take on a yellow to green color under UV illumination, thus assisting in the control of these arachnids. Many birds have patterns in their plumage that are invisible at usual wavelengths but observable in ultraviolet, and the urine and other secretions of some animals, including dogs, cats, and human beings, {{is much easier to}} spot with ultraviolet. Urine trails of rodents can be detected by pest control technicians for proper treatment of infested dwellings.|$|R
40|$|Turkey {{has three}} major bio-geographical regions namely Euro–Siberian, Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian. There are very {{different}} types of ecosystems such as agricultural, mountain, forests, steppes and wetlands, as well as coastal and marine. The country has rich floral and faunal diversity, high endemism and wide genetic diversity. A good {{progress has been made}} in protecting nature and biodiversity rich areas. Since 1990, the extent of protected areas has almost doubled to reach 7. 2 % of the territory. There are 40 national parks, 31 nature conservation areas, 107 natural monuments, 184 nature parks, 81 wildlife reserve areas, 58 conservation forests, 239 genetic conservation areas, 373 <b>seed</b> <b>stands,</b> 15 specially protected areas, 1273 natural sites, 14 Ramsar sites and 1 biosphere reserve. In this paper information on different ecosystems of the country is presented...|$|R
5000|$|Seed {{orchards}} {{for important}} wind pollinated species start to produce seeds before the seed orchard trees start to produce much pollen. Thus {{all or most}} of the pollen parents are outside the seed orchard. Calculations indicates that seed orchard seeds are still to be expected to a superior alternative to older and more mature <b>seed</b> orchards or <b>stand</b> <b>seeds.</b> Advantage of early seeds like absence of selfing or related matings and high diversity are positive factors in the early seeds.|$|R
