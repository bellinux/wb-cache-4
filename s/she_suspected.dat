5|$|Jean Warboys (Doreen Mantle) – Mrs Warboys is {{a friend}} of Margaret (and a rather {{annoying}} one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to (never seen) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> him of having an affair, and they divorced.|$|E
5|$|She later {{contacted}} Mulder, who {{was back}} to full health at the time, seeking help on a case <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> had some link {{to the murder of}} Doggett's son. However, as before, she soon returned to her own work. Reyes remained with the New Orleans field office until she was called upon to protect agent Dana Scully in May 2001, driving her out to a remote location in Georgia so that the pregnant Scully might deliver her child out of harm's way. Reyes helped deliver the child, and made a permanent move soon afterwards, becoming Doggett's partner on The X-Files.|$|E
5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student of Carl Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. As her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy, and <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never re-applied to the institution. She {{took a job as}} a photographer's assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith's vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E
25|$|Nancy {{changes the}} subject to their sex life. She tells him about a time in their {{marriage}} when she thought of divorcing him. There was tension, and <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> {{that he was having}} an affair. Charlie denies this, and Nancy accepts his word.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, she {{installed}} copper mailboxes {{outside the}} imperial government buildings {{to encourage the}} people of the realm to report secretly on others, as <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> many officials of opposing her. Exploiting these beliefs of hers, secret police officials, including Suo Yuanli, Zhou Xing, and Lai Junchen, began to rise in power and to carry out systematic false accusations, tortures, and executions of individuals.|$|E
25|$|Mowlam was a {{lecturer}} in the Political Science Department at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1977 and at Florida State University in Tallahassee from 1977 to 1979.

25|$|Cole's sister, Jeanie Phelps, filed {{a missing}} person's report for Carol, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> foul play, {{after she was}} unable to locate her and the report was also entered in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, abbreviated as NAMUS. She and Cole's childhood friend had also used Facebook as well as Craigslist to garner awareness and information for the case. The grandmother who was determined to find Cole had since died, but Phelps maintained a strong interest in finding her sister.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Sherwin's conduct was {{far from}} {{resembling}} her daughter's, when I spoke {{to her on the}} same subject. She always listened intently to what I said; but her answers were invariably brief, confused, and sometimes absolutely incomprehensible. It was only after great difficulty that I induced her to confess her dislike of Mr. Mannion. Whence it proceeded she could never tell. Did <b>she</b> <b>suspect</b> anything? In answering this question, she always stammered, trembled, and looked away from me. [...] "How could <b>she</b> <b>suspect</b> anything? If <b>she</b> did <b>suspect,</b> it would be very wrong without good reason: but she ought not to suspect, and did not, of course." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in early 1995 as a potential love interest for Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). Before the two finally got together, Tiffany embarked on a relationship with reformed junkie Billy (Darren Young) which landed her with hepatitis C. Tiffany and Chris married in a Valentine's Day ceremony in 1996 but the marriage quickly dissolved when Chris cheated on her. Tiffany later dated and married Johnny Marinovich after a period when <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> {{he was a child}} molestor. The character starred in a dramatic storyline in mid-1998 when she fell from a high rise building after trying to talk down a man on the roof. Tiffany ended up brain dead but her unborn baby was saved; Tiffany's life support was turned off soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} twenty, {{the queen}} consort had begun to wander outside her apartments at Changgyeong Palace and to play {{an active part in}} {{politics}} in spite of the Daewongun and various high officials, who viewed her as becoming meddlesome. The political struggle between the queen consort and the Heungseon Daewongun became public when the son she bore died prematurely four days after birth. The Heungseon Daewongun publicly accused her of being unable to bear a healthy male child, while <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> her father-in-law of foul play through the ginseng emetic treatment he had brought her. The Daewongun then directed Gojong to conceive through a concubine, Lee Gwi-in from the Yeongbo Hall (영보당귀인 이씨), and on 16 April 1868, she gave birth to Prince Wanhwa (완화군), to whom the Daewongun gave the title of crown prince.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1937, Gershwin {{began to}} {{complain}} of blinding headaches and a recurring {{impression that he}} smelled burning rubber. On February 11, 1937, he performed his Piano Concerto in F in a special concert of his music with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra {{under the direction of}} French maestro Pierre Monteux. Gershwin, normally a superb pianist in his own compositions, suffered coordination problems and blackouts during the performance. He was at the time working on other Hollywood film projects while living with Ira and his wife Leonore in their rented house in Beverly Hills. Leonore Gershwin began to be disturbed by George's mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table. <b>She</b> <b>suspected</b> mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist Yip Harburg's empty quarters nearby, where he was placed in the care of his valet, Paul Mueller. The headaches and olfactory hallucinations continued.|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{told her}} friend Oprah Winfrey that the call {{requesting}} her {{to write and}} recite the poem came from television producer Harry Thomason, who organized the inauguration, shortly after Clinton's election. Even though <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> that Clinton made the request because [...] "he understood that I am {{the kind of person}} who really does bring people together", Angelou admitted feeling overwhelmed, and even requested that the audiences attending her speaking engagements pray for her.|$|E
500|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles in 2006, the Laguna Beach {{spin-off}} series The Hills {{was developed to}} chronicle the lives of now-housemates Conrad and Montag and friends Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port. That year, she began a short-lived relationship with Jordan Eubanks; she described its end as [...] "the best decision of [...] life". By the second season, Montag and Conrad's friendship had deteriorated after the former began dating and later moved in with Spencer Pratt. During the third season, Conrad ended her friendship with Montag after <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> that Pratt was responsible for rumors of a sex tape involving her and her former boyfriend Jason Wahler; the ensuing feud carried through each subsequent season.|$|E
500|$|While {{living at}} the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas {{introduced}} herself to Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that she would give Girodias her [...] "next writing, and other writings". In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that [...] "everything I write will be his. He's done this to me... He's screwed me!" [...] Solanas intended {{to write a novel}} based on the SCUM Manifesto, and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the Up Your Ass script. <b>She</b> <b>suspected</b> that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.|$|E

500|$|In her post-war research, Wu {{continued}} to investigate beta decay. Enrico Fermi had published {{his theory of}} Beta decay in 1934, but an experiment by Luis Walter Alvarez had produced results at variance with the theory. Wu set out to repeat the experiment and verify the result. <b>She</b> <b>suspected</b> that {{the problem was that}} a thick and uneven film of copper(II) sulfate (...) was being used as a copper-64 beta ray source, which was causing the emitted electrons to lose energy. To get around this, she adapted an older form of spectrometer, a solenoidal spectrometer. She added detergent to the copper sulphate to produce a thin and even film. She was then able to demonstrate that the discrepancies observed were the result of experimental error; her results were consistent with Fermi's theory.|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 1979, {{three days}} after passing Jupiter, Voyager 1 took images of Jupiter's moons to help mission {{controllers}} determine the spacecraft's exact location, a process called optical navigation.

The feature was determined to be a plume generated by active volcanism at a dark depression later named Pele. Following this discovery, seven other plumes were located in earlier Voyager images of Io. Thermal emission from multiple sources, indicative of cooling lava, were also found. Surface changes were observed when images acquired by Voyager 2 were compared to those taken four months previously by Voyager 1, including new plume deposits at Aten Patera and Surt.|$|E
500|$|In October 2017, former New York Times {{reporter}} Sharon Waxman {{wrote on}} TheWrap that, {{when she looked}} into the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004, Russell Crowe and Damon made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, whom <b>she</b> <b>suspected</b> of having [...] "no film experience" [...] and whose [...] "real job was {{to take care of}} Weinstein’s women needs" [...] in Europe. Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, [...] "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that... It’s not something I would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo [...] "in a professional capacity" [...] while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. [...] "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t." [...] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.|$|E
