You can call their tryst and its consequences a metaphor of two generations of Germans passing guilt from one to the next, but that doesn't explain why filmmakers Daldry and Hare luxuriated in the sex scenes– and why it's so tastefully done audiences won't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the child pornography it is.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Zhou Qun studied {{under the}} tutelage of his father and became well-versed in {{astronomy}} and divination. As he was born in a wealthy family with scores of servants, he built an observation tower in his residence, and ordered his servants to take shifts to observe the sky round the clock and keep him updated. Whenever there was something unusual, he would rush to the tower to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself, regardless of whether it was in the day or at night. He was thus able to predict future events based on his observations. Sometime between 194 and 214, when Liu Zhang was the Governor of Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), he recruited Zhou Qun to serve in his administration as an Assistant Officer for Education (師友從事).|$|E

According to his first biographer Oles' Chapkivskyi, a contemporary of the composer, Leontovych would sometimes work on one choral setting without letting anyone else <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> up to four years. After {{the publication of his}} [...] "Second Compilation of Songs from Podolia", he changed his mind and was not fully satisfied with it, and as a result he bought all 300 copies and had them destroyed.|$|E

500|$|One {{television}} critic briefly {{said that}} What It's Like Being Alone is a [...] "weird show," [...] and simply advised individual viewers to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> themselves.

[...] Bill Brioux of the Toronto Sun commented that in combining a feel one would usually expect from Tim Burton with elements of Sesame Street, What It's Like Being Alone {{would probably not}} appeal fully to any demographic, despite its originality. [...] Additionally, he felt Princess Lucy would be tiresome, {{and said he had}} hoped the show were more amusing.|$|E
500|$|In 1931, Browning read Daphne du Maurier's novel The Loving Spirit and, {{impressed}} by its graphic {{depictions of the}} Cornish coastline, set out to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself in Ygdrasil. Afterwards, he left the boat moored in the River Fowey for the winter, but returned in April 1932 to collect it. He heard that {{the author of the}} book that had impressed him so much was convalescing from an appendix operation, and invited her out on his boat. [...] After a short romance, he proposed to her but she rejected this, as she did not believe in marriage. Dorman-Smith then went to see her and explained that their living together without marriage would be disastrous for Browning's career. Du Maurier then proposed to Browning, who accepted. They were married in a simple ceremony at the Church of St Willow, Lanteglos-by-Fowey on 19 July 1932, and honeymooned on Ygdrasil. Their marriage produced three children: two daughters, Tessa and Flavia, and a son, Christian, known as Kits.|$|E

2500|$|His {{visit and}} account {{laid the groundwork}} for {{the early years of the}} next century, when a young Thomas Cole would visit the Catskill Mountain House and devote much of his {{groundbreaking}} Hudson River School paintings to depictions of the Catskill wilderness. High Peak, visible from the Mountain House as well as from the studio and home he built in Catskill, would frequently show up in the background.

2500|$|Despite these {{shortcomings}} {{the show}} was very influential, with many others imitating its use of handheld cameras, ensemble cast, and multiple overlapping story arcs lasting for several episodes, set in urban decay. Alan Sepinwall wrote in 2014 that it [...] "is {{on the short list}} of the most influential TV shows ever made. Whether through shared actors, writers, directors or through stylistic and thematic complexity, its DNA can be found in nearly every great drama produced in the 30-plus years since it debuted". He compared Hill Street Blues to Casablanca, which was so influential on other films that [...] "if you come to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the first time after a lifetime of watching the copies, it could be at risk of playing like a bundle of clichés—even though it invented those clichés".|$|E
2500|$|Milton S. Hershey, {{owner of}} what was then called Hershey Park, had made the {{decision}} to purchase a carousel for his amusement park in 1908. Hershey decided to place the ride on the western side of the park, a considerable distance from the town center of Hershey, Pennsylvania. As part of placing the ride in that location, he was determined to purchase a transport ride to get visitors of the park from the town center to the carousel. In 1909, Hershey had learned that a small resort outside of Lancaster, Pennsylvania called Peoples Bathing Beach, owned by John B. Peoples, was opening a miniature electric railroad. Hershey went to the bathing beach to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself. Impressed with the ride, he decided to purchase one for the park.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Sibelius also eyed Madetoja's {{maturation}} somewhat wearily. For example, {{when some}} {{reviews of the}} First Symphony discerned within Madetoja's music the influence of Sibelius, he worried his former pupil might take offence at the comparison and mistook Madetoja's characteristic [...] "melancholia" [...] for [...] "sulkiness". Suddenly, Sibelius found Madetoja arrogant and watched with concern as he drew closer to Kajanus, with whom Sibelius had an on-again-off-again friendship/rivalry. [...] "Met Madetoja, who—I'm sorry to say—has become pretty bumptious after his latest success," [...] Sibelius fretted to his diary. [...] "Kajanus smothers him with flattery and he hasn't the breeding to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> what it is." [...] A second complication for the Madetoja-Sibelius relationship was the master's fear that his former pupil eventually might [...] "supplant him in public esteem".

2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E
2500|$|Soon after Europeans reached Ming China by ship in {{the early}} 16th century, {{accounts}} of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European was to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> another century. Possibly {{one of the earliest}} European descriptions of the wall and of its significance for the defense of the country against the [...] "Tartars" [...] (i.e. Mongols), may be the one contained in João de Barros's 1563 Asia. Other early accounts in Western sources include those of Gaspar da Cruz, Bento de Goes, Matteo Ricci, and Bishop Juan González de Mendoza. In 1559, in his work [...] "A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions," [...] Gaspar da Cruz offers an early discussion of the Great Wall. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Early European accounts were mostly modest and empirical, closely mirroring contemporary Chinese understanding of the Wall, although later they slid into hyperbole, including the erroneous but ubiquitous claim that the Ming Walls were the same ones that were built by the First Emperor in the 3rd centuryBC.|$|E
