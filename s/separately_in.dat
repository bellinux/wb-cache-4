5|$|After {{the decline}} in Linnaeus' health in the early 1770s, {{publication}} of editions of Systema Naturae went in two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, Johan Andreas Murray issued the Regnum Vegetabile section <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium, rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition. Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus' work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society as A System of Vegetables (1783–1785).|$|E

5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of worms and handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color – they will still operate <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E

5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
5|$|The DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets of {{each season}} were {{released}} after their television broadcast in various regions. At the 2006 International Consumer Electronics Show, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment {{announced that the}} complete first season of Prison Break was to be released on Blu-ray in early 2007. The release date was later announced to be November 13, 2007, and Prison Break became the first television show to be released on Blu-ray Disc by Fox. The Blu-ray box set contains six discs and includes all the DVD box set's special features. A DVD set containing the first three seasons was released on May 19, 2008, in Region 2. The television movie, , {{was included in the}} Season 4 set in Regions 2 and 4, but was released <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> Region 1. The Final Break was later released <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> Regions 2 and 4. In France, Germany and the United Kingdom, a Blu-ray package of all four seasons including The Final Break has been released. Over a year after its initial release, Season 4 was later re-issued in Region 4 without The Final Break included.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} and {{powers of the}} Indiana General Assembly are established in the state constitution. The General Assembly has sole legislative power within the state government. Each house can initiate legislation, with the exception that the Senate is not permitted to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each law passed by the General Assembly must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the General Assembly has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate <b>separately</b> <b>in</b> prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|The first Championship {{was awarded}} at a Cardiff show in 1928, to {{a red and}} white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds {{continued}} to be judged together until 1934, when The Kennel Club recognised each breed <b>separately.</b> <b>In</b> that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate. The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was Ch. Bowhit Pivot.|$|E
5|$|The largest genera are Gagea (200), Fritillaria (130), Lilium (110), and Tulipa (75 species), {{all within}} the Lilieae tribe.
