5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire,</b> stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. Semi-rigid <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> {{is by far}} the most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E

40|$|Background: One of {{the methods}} used for joining metals {{together}} is welding, which can be carried out using different techniques such as electric spot welding. This study evaluated the effect of electric spot welding on the load deflection rate of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and chromium-cobalt orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, load deflection rate of 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and chromium cobalt wires were evaluated in five groups (n = 18) : group one: <b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires,</b> group two: chromium-cobalt <b>wires,</b> group three: <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> welded to <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires,</b> group four: <b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> welded to chromium-cobalt wires, group five: chromium-cobalt wire welded to chromium-cobalt wires. Afterward, the forces induced by the samples in 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 1. 5 mm deflection were measured using a universal testing machine. Then mean force measured for each group was compared with other groups. The data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), one-way ANOVA, and paired t-test by the SPSS software. The significance level was set as 0. 05. Results: The Tukey test showed that there were significant differences between the load deflection rates of welded groups compared to control ones (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Considering the limitation of this study, the electric spot welding process performed on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and chromium-cobalt <b>wires</b> increased their load deflection rates...|$|R

2500|$|High {{strength}} wire (typically 4 or 6 gauge {{galvanized steel}} wire), is pulled in a loop by pulleys on the traveler, with one end affixed at an anchorage. When the traveler reaches the opposite anchorage the loop is placed {{over an open}} anchor eyebar. Along the catwalk, workers also pull the cable wires to their desired tension. This continues until a bundle, called a [...] "cable strand" [...] is completed, and temporarily bundled using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire.</b> This process is repeated until the final cable strand is completed. Workers then remove the individual wraps on the cable strands (during the spinning process, {{the shape of the}} main cable closely resembles a hexagon), and then the entire cable is then compressed by a traveling hydraulic press into a closely packed cylinder and tightly wrapped with additional wire to form the final circular cross section. The wire used in suspension bridge construction is a galvanized steel wire that has been coated with corrosion inhibitors.|$|E

30|$|Leveling was {{accomplished}} sooner by super-elastic than <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> arch <b>wires</b> in our sample. Similarly, Weiland [15] has shown {{greater amount of}} buccal premolar displacement {{during the same period}} with super-elastic than <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires.</b> Initial force applied by <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> soon declines and needs to be re-established, while the force induced by means of super-elastic wires continues over a longer time. Tooth movement with continuous forces was also found more effective than with interrupted continuous forces at the premolar tipping model by Owman-Moll et al. [16]. Longer treatment time with <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> could be attributed to the intervals when <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> are passive. However, in the Cochrane review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by Wang et al. [8], no difference in the speed of tooth alignment could be shown after using one initial aligning arch wire over another. Authors commented on the general poor quality of the included trials and suggested that the results should be viewed with caution.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to compare root resorption after the leveling phase of treatment, performed by either super-elastic or conventional multi-stranded <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> arch <b>wires.</b> Methods: From a total of 156 future orthodontic patients in a private clinic, 82 {{were included in the}} study after excluding those who earlier had orthodontic or endodontic treatment or signs of resorption. Patients were equally arbitrary allocated into two groups, where leveling was performed either with super-elastic heat-activated or conventional multi-stranded <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> arch <b>wires.</b> Root length loss was calculated using pre-treatment and post-leveling periapical radiographs. Results: The use of super-elastic arch wires did not significantly increase the severity of root resorption, except for tooth 31, while it reduced leveling time compared to conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires.</b> Crossbite of maxillary lateral incisors seemed to be a risk factor for resorption.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the wear patterns of orthodontic archwires in dry and wet conditions in-vitro. METHODS: The patterns of wear of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and NiTi orthodontic archwires were investigated with a fretting wear tribometer fitted with an alumina ball. The tribometer was operated at 23 degrees C {{in three different}} environments: ambient air with 50 per cent relative humidity (RH), 0. 9 wt. per cent sodium chloride solution and deionised water. Differences in the wear characteristics of the archwires were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis and Inductively Coupled Plasma Analysis were used to investigate the surface composition of the wires, the wear debris generated during fretting and the corrosion products in the test solutions. RESULTS: Both archwire materials were degraded by oxidational wear in ambient air. The NiTi wires were more resistant to wear than the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires.</b> In the aqueous media the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires</b> were degraded by abrasive wear, while the NiTi wires were degraded by adhesive wear. CONCLUSION: In ambient air with 50 per cent RH, NiTi wires were more resistant to wear than <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wires.</b> Both archwire materials exhibited higher wear rates in the solutions than in air, indicating some synergism between the wear and corrosion processes. In the solutions the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwires had a much lower corrosion-wear resistance than the NiTi archwires. status: publishe...|$|R
