However, in most cases, drivers do not passively respond to such a task, they actively decide when to perform the task. The current study investigated drivers ’ strategies {{with respect to the}} initiation of text reading when faced with fluctuations in driving demand. Text messages were made available to participants shortly before the vehicle entered an area with increased driving demands (demand zone). Participants were asked to read the message {{before the end of the}} trial, but were free to decide when and how to read the messages. We manipulated the type of driving demand (baseline; three levels of high demand—narrow lane, pace clock, and ultimate [narrow + pace clock]), format of text (no message; paragraph; parsed), and the distance from <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> to the demand zone (near; far). The results showed that in most cases drivers started to read the text message before or in the demand zone even though they would have enough time to complete the task after passing the area. Nonetheless, task initiation time (measured from the appearance of the message to the drivers’ first glance to the display) increased when driving was demanding compared to the baseline condition. It suggests that drivers may be sensitive to transitions from low to high demand when initiating secondary tasks, however are not discouraged from such activities when demands are already elevated...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} an analytical model {{to estimate the}} mathematical expectation of the data center (DC) response time to the interactive requests from remote users connected to the DC via leased lines (LL), which run under control of HDLC-type protocols for configurations "pointpoint» and "point - multipoint » in Normal Response Mode, NRM. In the logic connection DC acts as the host (primary node) and remote stations {{play the role of}} the slave units (secondary nodes). The objective of research is to obtain analytical expressions to define the following: - Mathematical expectation of waiting time required for input and output messages of each class to start transmitting via leased line; - Mathematical expectation of total DC response time to requests of each class. The process of interaction between remote workstations and DC is formalized as a closed three-node queuing network (QN), wherein the first multi-channel node corresponds to the phase of request deliberation (preparation) to DC on the workstation. In this phase, the number of facilities, i. e. service channels, is equal to the number of workstations (terminals), R. The second single-channel node of this QN reflects processing of input and output messages to the LL in accordance with the logic of HDLC protocol. The third multi-channel node of this NQ reflects, as a matter of fact, processing query to DC. In this node one process in DC corresponds to each active terminal, i. e., the number of facilities is equal to the number of workstations R. It is shown that the problem of determining the DC average response time to requests of remote users is reduced to the problem of determining the average waiting time for the input and output messages to start transmitting messages by LL - that sort of unknown average waiting time turns out to be 2 R. The first two points of the probability distribution functions of reflection time, LL transmission time, and time of message processing, as a matter of fact, in DC are assumed to be specified. To create a system of algebraic equations in regard to the unknown average waiting time for the input and output messages to start LL sending a so-called method of "labeled transaction" is used. The system of equations is constructed, initially, to provide the "point-multipoint configuration. " Then it is shown how to obtain a system for configuration "point-point" as a special case. The first phase considers an arrival of the "labelled transaction" submitting output message in QN and builds R equations in regard to the unknown average waiting time for the output message to start its sending by LL from DC to the workstation. The second phase considers an arrival of the "labelled transaction" submitting input message in QN and builds R equations in regard to the unknown average waiting time for the input message to start its sending by LL from the workstation to DC. The result is a system of the 2 R algebraic equations in regard to 2 R unknown average waiting time for a <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> transmission by LL. The existence of a unique solution of the resulting system of equations is proved, and a computationally efficient procedure for determining solution as a modified Newton-Kantorovich method is proposed. The paper shows how to obtain a system of equations for the "point-point" configuration, as a special case, from the system of equations for the "point-multipoint" configuration. It presents the formulas for calculating the DC average response time to remote users’ requests for each workstation. </p...|$|E

First, the affinity of wild-type RNA polymerase for both promoters is increased by the presence of CRP and cAMP. By contrast, holoenzymes reconstituted with truncated alpha-subunits, show cooperative binding at the galP 1 promoter only. Second, footprinting data confirm these observations and indicate that the truncated holoenzymes are unable to recognize regions of the promoter upstream from position - 40. The absence of contacts between the truncated enzymes and CRP at the lacP 1 promoter can explain the deficiency in activation. At the galP 1 promoter, where the CRP site is closer to the initiation site, protein-protein contacts can still occur with the truncated polymerases, showing that the C-terminal part of the alpha-subunit is not involved in activation...|$|R
