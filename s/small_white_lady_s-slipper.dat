Black-footed Ferret (Mustela nigripes) and Eskimo Curlew (Numenius borealis) are not depicted here, because they are species of historical occurrence in Nebraska but have no known extant populations in the state. Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is excluded because it was recently de-listed in the state. A species might be expected to occur anywhere within a mapped range in which there is suitable habitat. The maps show current ranges rather than historical ranges. Thus areas in which a given species formerly occurred but in which it no longer occurs are not included. Species, particularly those highly mobile such as birds, may occur outside of their range in locations in which the species is generally described as 2 ̆ 7 accidental 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 vagrant. 2 ̆ 7 Range maps do not include such locations. In addition to range maps a county-by-species table is included. Finally, the metadata for the spatial data used to create the range maps is included.

40|$|Kirk Fen is a 0. 73 -hectare remnant prairie fen {{located at}} the University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens {{property}} in Ann Arbor, Michigan in Washtenaw County. It {{is known to have}} high floristic quality and two floral species threatened and imperiled in Michigan: the <b>small</b> <b>white</b> <b>lady</b> slipper (Cypripedium candidum) and common valerian (Valeriana ciliata). The eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus), a reptile of special concern, is a resident there as well. However, Kirk Fen occupies only twelve percent of its historical boundaries and is becoming a low diversity shrub-carr habitat dominated by invasive woody species, particularly glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula). Intervention is necessary to prevent further deterioration (Ruhfel 2005). Functioning prairie fens serve a critical role in our watersheds and are globally and locally rare. They are unique ecosystems throughout their range in the upper Midwestern North America and are threatened both from agriculture and urban development. This practicum is focused on two basic questions relating to fen restoration. What is the response of vegetation to the removal of invasive species? How should “success” be measured in fen restoration efforts? Clearing of woody invasive species in Kirk Fen was done in the years 2006 to 2009. Floral response was captured in 2008 and 2009 with comprehensive floral inventories, a pilot plant species dominance survey, and a pilot Cypripedium candidum survey. An inventory and species cover survey using five line-intercept transects was conducted in 2009. Photo points were established and iii base-line photo-point documentation was conducted from 2008 to 2009. Reports were made based on the inventories, surveys, and line-intercept transects. Using the Floristic Quality Assessment for Michigan flora (Herman et al. 2001) to compare the inventories of 2008 and 2009 to those reported in 2005, {{it was found that the}} original remnants had slightly less Mean C and lower species diversity. However, Mean Wetness (Mean W) increased, fewer native and adventive woody species were present, and greater native forbs and graminoid species were found. Low-, mid-, and high-C distribution remained relatively the same. Some important species did not recover during the two years of the inventories. Using the FQA and pilot surveys, the greater restored Kirk Fen site has shown dramatic recovery after clearing of woody invasive species. While common fen species numbers recovered during the study, the numbers of rare species historically found in the fen declined. These results raise questions about the impact of management activities on rare vs. common species in fen restoration projects. The study concludes with recommendations for future fire management, continued invasive species removal, deer exclusion, mitigation and improvements to the Kirk Brook catchment outside the fen, and creation of limited public access and educational activities related to the restoration of the fen...|$|R
