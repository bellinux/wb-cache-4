5|$|Although Bagramyan {{found it}} {{acceptable}} to sustain heavy casualties (as {{did all the}} commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining the element of <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> operations. In his preparations for Bagration, he planned for the 43rd Army {{to move through the}} more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General Afanasy Beloborodov, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.|$|E
5|$|Commanding 75 lances from Kinsky's company, and {{followed}} by {{the bulk of his}} force, Nassau passed through a narrow path in a small forest, and, coming out to open field, was surprised by the Spanish troops, namely by those under Hendrik van den Bergh, followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the 's-Hertogenbosch lances. Van den Bergh's harquebusiers, discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest, fired a volley and, turning right, clashed with the Dutch scouts, starting the action. There was then a firece fight. The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons, but caught by <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> a narrow passage, the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their lances, so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols. Philip of Nassau, his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight. Kinsky's and Balen's troops, coming in relief, were unable to rescue the wounded commanders, and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield. Nicholas Parker, however, managed to collect the fugitives and, renewing the action, he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry. The encounter turned then a general action out the wood, in open ground.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} how announced <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> {{monetary policy}} actions and macroeconomic data releases affect {{the average rate}} of inflation that economic agents expect to prevail over the 10 -year period following the surprise. The analysis also addresses the effect of Federal Reserve communication and <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> monetary policy actions on perceived inflation risk over this 10 -year period. The study shows that <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic data releases and monetary policy actions indeed affect the expected rate of inflation. Further, {{there is evidence that}} <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> monetary policy actions increase perceived inflation risk, whereas Federal Reserve communication reduces it.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study shows}} that firms collectively incur a cost for {{managing}} earnings and analyst expectations to meet earnings forecasts. We compare the coefficient in the regression of abnormal stock returns on earnings surprise (the earnings response coefficient [ERC]) across ranges of earnings surprises. The ERC for earnings <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> the range [0, 1 �] is significantly lower than ERCs for earnings <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> adjacent ranges for firm-quarters in the early and mid 2000 s, but not {{for those in the}} 1990 s. The results are robust to controlling for the sign of estimated discretionary accruals and the trajectory of analyst earnings forecasts. We further find that investors are right to be skeptical about earnings <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> the range [0, 1 �]. The relation of future earnings surprise with current earnings surprise is more negative for current earnings <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> that range than for those in any other range. Evidence also suggests analysts react negatively to earnings <b>surprises</b> <b>in</b> that range. Copyright (c), University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2009. ...|$|R

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the coalition army {{when most of}} it had crossed the Kalka River. The Mongols appear to have caught the coalition forces by <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> a fast transition from horse archer fire to massed cavalry charges, because the coalition rout began incredibly quickly: the Rus forces {{bringing up the rear}} had not yet arrived on the battle by the time the front ranks were dissolving. The armies of Volhynia and Kursk made a gap in their line so that the fleeing Cumans could retreat. However, the Mongol heavy cavalry charged through the newly formed gap and also enveloped them. The army of Chernigov, which was not aware that the battle had started, was advancing when they collided head-on with the retreating Cumans. Using smoke bombs to disrupt the coalition's ability to coordinate, the Mongol cavalry took advantage of the confusion in the Chernigov line and attacked, causing the line to collapse. This, in turn, led to the death of Prince Mstislav of Chernigov.|$|E
5|$|The Saints {{received}} Campbell {{in exchange}} for their first round draft pick in 1985, with which Houston selected cornerback Richard Johnson. The trade came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> New Orleans; the team already had the young George Rogers, the 1981 No. 1 overall draft pick and that year's Rookie of the Year and rushing champion. With Campbell and Rogers, the Saints now had two Heisman Trophy winners in the backfield. In his first game with New Orleans, Campbell carried five times for 19 yards, and continued to have a diminished role in the offense {{throughout the rest of the}} season. He rushed for a total of 468 yards and four touchdowns in 1984, and failed to record a 100-yard game during the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{season began}} with a 2–1 win over Mansfield Town at Field Mill on 19 August; Chris Marron put Mansfield ahead on 52 minutes, before Roy Sproson scored the {{equaliser}} on 69 minutes, Basil Hayward scored the winning goal three minutes later after being the first {{to react to the}} rebound that came when Colin Askey's shot hit the crossbar. The main <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> the line-up of the opening day was that goalkeeper Ray Hancock had been dropped in favour of Ray King after King impressed in the pre-season friendly, the club's positive season meant that Hancock was unable to win back his place in the side. Vale were then held to two consecutive goalless draws but remained unbeaten in their first seven league games, conceding just two goals. This run included a 3–0 win over Darlington at Feethams, and a 4–0 win over Barrow in which Hayward scored a hat-trick. They had risen {{to the top of the}} table by the third game of the season and remained in first place until the end of the season. Of the Barrow first eleven that day three of the players were brothers: Jack, Alan and Bert Keen.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{acquisition}} of Coveleski, combined with winning the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his 1924 season, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as the biggest <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> baseball; Cleveland considered him to be past his best. He won 20 games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year. The Senators won the AL and were to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series, but Coveleski suffered from sore back muscles late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In game two, he faced Vic Aldridge in a pitcher's duel; the teams were tied at one apiece in the eighth inning, but a Pittsburgh home run led to a 3–2 loss. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in game five, and Coveleski allowed four runs in under seven innings, leading to a 6–3 Pirates win. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, {{and two of the}} Senators' four losses.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March, the Germans counterattacked {{with the}} 22nd Panzer Division, which had {{recently}} arrived in Crimea, {{and took the}} Soviet defenses by <b>surprise</b> <b>in</b> the early morning fog. They attempted to eliminate the penetration that the 390th and 398th Rifle Divisions had made into their lines and break through the hastily prepared forward defenses of the 51st Army. Parts of the 390th began to retreat towards Height 28.2, but the situation was restored by the personal intervention of the 143rd Rifle Brigade's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Georgy Kurashvili, who rallied the troops to defend Korpech. Major Mushegh Malkhasyan's 789th Rifle Regiment was the first hit by the German tank attack, but the regiment was able to separate the German tanks from their infantry and break up the counterattack. Major L.G. Akopov's 792nd Regiment also participated in heavy fighting against the German attack. German tanks, supported by a company of infantry, broke through the 390th's line and attacked the divisional command post, forcing Zakian and {{his chief of staff}} to lead rear units in a counterattack. The German assault was eventually repulsed, and Soviet sources claim 17 tanks were destroyed. A second attack against the 398th Division followed but also failed. The Germans then followed up with a more powerful assault at the junction of the 390th and the 83rd Marine Rifle Brigade on the division's right flank. This third German assault was repulsed by Soviet anti-tank fire.|$|E
