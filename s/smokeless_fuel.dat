25|$|English {{inventor}} Thomas Parker, who {{was responsible}} for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries. Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee {{retired as}} Leader of the Opposition, Moyle {{was allowed to}} range more widely in his contributions. He was {{particularly}} concerned about air pollution and complained that <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuel</b> was too expensive and slow to order; he advocated the nationalisation of the companies who made it to expand production. During the Suez crisis, Moyle stated that Britain had destroyed her moral authority by one action and lost the opportunity to criticise the Soviet Union for its action in Hungary. He wanted naval courts martial to be composed of petty officers and ratings as well as officers.|$|E

5000|$|The Act {{introduced}} {{a number of}} measures to reduce air pollution, especially by introducing [...] "smoke control areas" [...] in some towns and cities in which only <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels</b> could be burned. By shifting homes' sources of heat towards cleaner coals, electricity, and gas, it reduced the amount of smoke pollution and sulphur dioxide from household fires. Reinforcing these changes, the Act also included measures to relocate power stations away from cities, and for the height of some chimneys to be increased.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the Great Smog of 1952, the British Parliament introduced the Clean Air Act 1956. This act legislated for zones where <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels</b> had to be burnt and relocated power stations to rural areas. The Clean Air Act 1968 introduced the use of tall chimneys to disperse air pollution for industries burning coal, liquid or gaseous fuels.The Clean Air Act was updated in 1993 and can be reviewed online legislation Clean Air Act 1993. The biggest domestic impact comes from Part III, Smoke Control Areas, which are designated by local authorities and can vary by street in large towns.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{pollution}} {{of the lower}} river, the upper reaches retained a population of fish. Brown trout were present around Stainsby, and there were small numbers of coarse fish, which had originated in the lakes at Hardwick Hall. They could not exist further down river, because of {{the pollution}}. Part {{of the problem was}} caused by efforts to reduce air pollution, which resulted in the production of <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels.</b> While this reduced smoke from domestic fires, the liquors which were removed from the coal were highly toxic and rich in ammonia. The coking plant at Bolsover run by Coalite Chemicals was a significant producer of pollution, and the site was also producing chlorinated compounds by distilling the liquors resulting from the coking process, which added to the toxic mix. The effluent was treated by an activated sludge process, before discharge to the river.|$|R
50|$|It was, however, {{only under}} the impetus of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, which almost brought {{the city to}} a {{standstill}} and may have caused upward of 6,000 deaths that the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed and pollution in the city was finally brought to an end. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities in which only <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels</b> could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities. The act formed an important impetus to modern environmentalism, and caused a rethinking {{of the dangers of}} environmental degradation to people's quality of life.|$|R
500|$|David Lawrence, a Democrat, {{served as}} mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's {{governor}} from 1959 to 1963. Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's [...] political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly. [...] In 1946 [...] Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels.</b> One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because {{many of them were}} on the city payroll.|$|R

40|$|Indonesia’s cattle {{biodigester}} {{system is}} a highly effective ‘green’ technology, radically improving smallholders’ quality of life both in the household and via the farm enterprise: the main product, biogas, is a <b>smokeless</b> cooking <b>fuel</b> and the by-product, bioslurry, is a high-value fertiliser. The biodigesters also qualify for carbon offsets from the avoided use of fuelwood and non-renewable fuel. Carbon income is currently low, however, and the potential of bioslurry – both to earn carbon offsets, and as a market commodity for the farmer – {{has yet to be}} realised. And while there has been a rapid uptake of biogas technology, with 14, 500 digesters installed across nine provinces, this trend is slowing down. One-hundred-per-cent subsidies have distorted the market, and poorer farmers who lack capital or cooperative membership are yet to be reached.

40|$|The Earth’s {{atmosphere}} {{consists of}} both gaseous and condensed-phase components, the condensed-phase material is called particulate matter (PM). The effects of atmospheric PM include adverse health impacts, {{as well as}} climate forcing. Both qualitative and quantitative knowledge about PM is necessary to assess these effects, and to devise best mitigation strategies. Understanding the distribution of atmospheric particulate matter is complex because {{much of it is}} of secondary origin rather than from primary emissions. Furthermore, there are multiple anthropogenic and natural sources of the contributing precursors, and all these processes are influenced by atmospheric conditions and transport. In this work, one of the major constituents of atmospheric PM - carbonaceous aerosol - is studied. A regional application of the EMEP MSC-W atmospheric chemical transport model - EMEP 4 UK - was used to model air pollution over the British Isles with a horizontal resolution of 5 km x 5 km. One-way nesting was used from the European computational domain of 50 km x 50 km to the finer spatial grid of EMEP 4 UK. Several model experiments were devised in order to investigate the well-known deficiency that models currently underestimate organic aerosol (OA) concentrations compared with observations. The model experiments were evaluated with comprehensive year-long novel measurements from the Clear Air for London (ClearfLo) campaign in 2012. Several sources of organic aerosol that are either missing, greatly underestimated, or may be spatially misplaced in official emissions inventories were re-evaluated. Firstly, missing diesel-related intermediate volatility organic compound (IVOC) emissions from diesel vehicles derived directly from field measurements at the urban background site during the 2012 ClearfLo campaign were added into the model. According to the model simulations, these diesel-IVOCs can explain on average ~ 30 % of the annual secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in and around London. Furthermore, the 90 - th percentile of modelled daily SOA concentrations for the whole year was 3. 8 μgm- 3, constituting a notable addition to total particulate matter. More measurements of these precursors (currently not included in official emissions inventories) is recommended. Secondly, spatially and temporally resolved emissions of cooking OA (COA; emissions from meat charbroiling, or frying and deep-frying) were developed. These emissions are currently neglected in European emissions inventories, yet measurements point to significant COA contribution to ambient PM concentrations (up to 2. 0 μgm- 3 on annual average for central London). The final COA emission source strength derived here (320 mg person- 1 day- 1) was spatially distributed to workday population density (as opposed to residential population density). The impact of COA on surface concentrations is spatially very limited, however, as the modelled concentrations dropped markedly outside of urban areas. For example, annual average modelled concentration for the Harwell location was just 0. 1 μgm- 3. Thirdly, redistributing 50 % of non-industrial wood and coal burning emissions to residential population density (thus over-writing, in part, the assumption made by the national emissions inventory that only <b>smokeless</b> <b>fuels</b> are burned in smoke control areas) increased the modelled solid fuel OA (SFOA) concentration at the London North Kensington site to 0. 8 μgm- 3, from the Base run value (using the emissions’ spatial distribution and total as officially reported) of just 0. 3 μgm- 3. For comparison, the measured annual mean concentration of SFOA at this site was 1. 0 μgm- 3. Based on the model evaluation presented, redistribution of SFOA emissions into smoke control areas is justified, but further refinement of the amount, as well as the temporal emission profile of this component is necessary. The total effect of the three refinements undertaken in this work increased the model estimate of the annual mean OA concentration at the London North Kensington site from 1. 8 μgm- 3 to 3. 8 μgm- 3, which is much closer to the observed value of 4. 2 μgm- 3. Thus, this work has provided relevant insight into the nature and magnitude of missing, under-represented, and spatially inappropriately-distributed emissions of primary OA and OA precursors. Although the study area was focused on pollutant concentrations over the British Isles, all of the components examined here are of great relevance to the air quality in other countries as well — in Europe and globally. Therefore, the inclusion of these improvements into other air quality models and official emissions’ inventories is advised...|$|R
