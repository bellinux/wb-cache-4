The resulting dynamic fractal spectrum (DFS) for DT sequences consists of two components: One is the volumetric dynamic fractal <b>spectrum</b> <b>component</b> (V-DFS) that captures the stochastic self-similarities of DT sequences as 3 D volume datasets; {{the other is the}} multi-slice dynamic fractal <b>spectrum</b> <b>component</b> (S-DFS) that encodes fractal structures of DT sequences on 2 D slices along different views of the 3 D volume.

To obtain the highest CRI value possible, the bias currents of the LD and LED were initially varied, yielding a CRI value of 74.5 with a CCT value of 6769 K. This value {{is much higher than}} our previous result using a blue LD/YAG:Ce 3 + phosphor for white light generation [40]. To demonstrate the color tunability, either the LED or the LD bias was varied, starting from the bias value that produced the highest CRI.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{project results}} {{from studies of}} radium {{isotopes}} in natural water samples {{carried out in the}} Nuclear Physics and Its Application Department at the University of Silesia using the liquid scintillation (LS) technique. This paper investi-gates the 228 Ra activity calculation. Theoretically, the activity of the 228 Ra isotope can be determined both from the low-energy beta <b>spectrum</b> <b>component</b> coming directly from 228 Ra and the high-energy beta component from the 228 Ac counts. Until now, the activity of 228 Ra in water samples was calculated using the part of the spectrum related to 228 Ac, which is in radioactive equilibrium with 228 Ra. Samples were measured for ~ 600 hr to minimize the contribution of activity due to 224 Ra. Since the half-life of 228 Ra is 5. 7 yr, the activity of this isotope is constant only {{for a short period of}} time. Taking this into account, we decided to determine the activity of this isotope from its low-energy beta <b>spectrum</b> <b>component.</b> Several samples were prepared using standard radium isotopes obtained from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The chemical procedure for determining radium isotopes by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) was based on the Polish Norm PN- 89 Z- 70072 (1989). The 228 Ra activity can be determined from the first few measurements of the low-energy beta part of the spec-trum, when accounting for the efficiency of the chemical procedure and detection, as well as the sample volume.

[Full text of {{this article}} is not {{available}} in the UHRA]A polarization study is presented of 44 blazars and candidate blazars observed at optical and near-IR frequencies.

The intrinsic frequency-dependent polarization of the BL Lac objects is the result of spectral curvature, due to source inhomogeneity.
