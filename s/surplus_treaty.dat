50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek surplus {{reinsurance}} {{to limit the}} losses it might incur from {{a small number of}} large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line <b>surplus</b> <b>treaty</b> the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|E

By means of first and second moments of the random present value of gain on a single policy, portfolio ruin probability's estimates are derived under either Cebicev-Cantelli's inequality or normal distribution hypothesis, in presence of a low positive correlation among risks and also introducing optimal strategies referred to a <b>surplus</b> reinsurance <b>treaty</b> to face the correlation's effects.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present final {{results of a}} {{research}} on the riskiness of a life policies portfolio with “dread disease” (briefly: DD) coverage in additional or early form, referring to the insurer’s point of view. By means of first and second moments of the random present value of gain on a single policy, portfolio ruin probability’s estimates are derived under either Cebicev-Cantelli’s inequality or normal distribution hypothesis, in presence of a low positive correlation among risks and also introducing optimal strategies referred to a <b>surplus</b> reinsurance <b>treaty</b> to face the correlation’s effects. By means of numerical applications based on insurance company’s experiences we show the riskiness and the ruin probability considerably increase when a binary correlation exists and we demonstrate the inefficiency of the EEC minimum solvency margin rule, even in presence of optimal reinsurance strategies...|$|R
40|$|The law of treaty {{reservations}} - {{which enables}} states {{to ask that}} their multilateral obligations be tailored to their individual preferences - has been controversial for over fifty years, and is at present subject to pitched battles within (and between) the International Law Commission and numerous other international institutions. There is broad agreement that existing scheme under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties involves a sharp tradeoff between honoring the unalloyed consent of non-reserving states (that is, those agreeing to the treaty as originally negotiated, which may object to proposed reservations) and respecting the conditioned consent of reserving states; moreover, it is thought to decisively favor the latter, leading to a <b>surplus</b> of <b>treaty</b> reservations and a paucity of objections to them. The ambiguities that pervade the Convention are said to play a supporting role. Whatever their cause, it is thought, such ambiguities tend to disadvantage non-reserving states; the straightforward solution is to resolve those ambiguities, preferably by making reservations harder to pull off. This approach is seriously flawed. In fact, the law of treaty reservations - understood as reflecting, rather than surmounting, its frustrating ambiguities - plausibly serves the interests of its supposed victims, the non-reserving states, perhaps even {{to a greater degree}} than for inveterate reservers. Treaty reservations not only increase the breadth of treaty participation, but permit agreement on broader commitments than would otherwise be possible. These effects inure to the benefit of reserving and non-reserving states alike. But deeper commitments, coupled with reservations, also establish a reliable, low-cost mechanism for providing information on reserving states, something facilitated by the existing scheme 2 ̆ 7 s eccentricities. Those same eccentricities also enable non-reserving states to reserve their own judgment regarding the acceptability of reservations, and thus shift risk control back (somewhat) in their favor...|$|R
5000|$|Balanced budget rule: General {{government}} budgets {{shall be}} [...] "balanced" [...] or in <b>surplus.</b> The <b>treaty</b> defines {{a balanced budget}} as a general budget deficit not exceeding 3.0% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP), and a structural deficit not exceeding a country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) which at most can be set to 0.5% of GDP for states with a debt&#8209;to&#8209;GDP ratio exceeding 60% - or at most 1.0% of GDP for states with debt levels within the 60%-limit. The country-specific MTOs are recalculated every third year, and might be set at stricter levels compared to what the treaty allows at most. The rule is based upon the existing Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) deficit rule, where the concept of country-specific MTOs was integrated into the preventive arm of the pact in 2005, with an upper limit for structural deficits at 1.0% of GDP applying to all eurozone and ERM-II member states. The novelty of the Fiscal Compact, was to introduce a varying upper limit which depends on the debt-level of the state. When comparing the Fiscal Compact's new MTO rule with the applying country-specific SGP MTOs in 2012, it can be concluded that if the fiscal provisions of the treaty had applied immediately towards all EU member states, then only Hungary and the UK would have been required to introduce a stricter MTO (revising it down to 0.5% of GDP) - as a consequence. As per the already applying Stability and Growth Pact, Member States with a fiscal balance not yet at their MTO, are required to ensure rapid convergence towards it, with the time-frame for this [...] "adjustment path" [...] being outlined by the Council on basis of a European Commission proposal taking the country-specific sustainability risks into consideration.|$|R
5000|$|Member states {{bound by}} the Fiscal Compact have to {{transpose}} into national legal order {{the provisions of the}} Fiscal Compact. In particular, national budget has to be in balance or <b>surplus</b> under the <b>treaty's</b> definition. An automatic correction mechanism has to be established to correct potential significant deviations. A national independent monitoring institution should be mandated to provide fiscal surveillance. The treaty defines a balanced budget as a general budget deficit not exceeding 3.0% {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP), and a structural deficit not exceeding a country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO) which at most can be set to 0.5% of GDP for states with a debt&#8209;to&#8209;GDP ratio exceeding 60% - or at most 1.0% of GDP for states with debt levels within the 60%-limit. The country-specific MTOs are recalculated every third year and might be set at stricter levels compared to what the treaty allows at most. The treaty also contains a direct copy of the [...] "debt brake" [...] criteria outlined in the Stability and Growth Pact, which defines the rate at which debt levels above the limit of 60% of GDP shall decrease.|$|R
