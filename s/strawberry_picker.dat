Such people had surprisingly high FICO scores if you ignored the short credit history or [...] "thin file". Rating agencies did, and FICO scores ignored and personal or household income. [...] Thus did low income immigrants increase the percentage of pool of loans that could be declared triple-A" [...] and explain otherwise unlikely sounding press reports of a [...] "Mexican <b>strawberry</b> <b>picker</b> with an income of $14,000 and no English" [...] being [...] "lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, the Case-Shiller index of house prices peaked. [...] In California home prices had more than doubled since 2000 and median house prices in Los Angeles had risen to ten times the median annual income. To entice the low and {{moderate}} income {{to sign up for}} mortgages, down payments, income documentation were often dispensed with and interest and principal payments were often deferred upon request. Journalist Michael Lewis gave as an example of unsustainable underwriting practices a loan in Bakersfield, California, where [...] "a Mexican <b>strawberry</b> <b>picker</b> with an income of $14,000 and no English was lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000". As two-year [...] "teaser" [...] mortgage rates - common with those that made home purchases like this possible - expired, mortgage payments skyrocketed. Refinancing to lower mortgage payment was no longer available since it depended on rising home prices. Mezzanine tranches started to lose value in 2007, by mid year AA tranches were worth only 70 cents on the dollar. By October triple-A tranches had started to fall. [...] Regional diversification notwithstanding, the mortgage backed securities turned out to be highly correlated.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 At its peak, Oregon {{produced}} 21 {{percent of}} the nation's total commercial strawberry production. However, since 1971, Oregon's share of strawberry production has been declining steadily. In fact, {{for the last three}} years strawberry production in Oregon constitutes only 8 {{percent of the}} nation's total production, which is the lowest since the end of the Korean War (Figure 1). Among other factors, the increase in harvest cost without an offsetting increase in the farm prices of strawberries, is the main cause for the continuing decline of strawberry production in Oregon. Decrease in the supply of <b>strawberry</b> <b>pickers</b> is the main cause for the upward trend of the strawberry harvest cost in Oregon. Particularly, since 1973, due to enactment of the child labor law, the shortage in the supply of <b>strawberry</b> <b>pickers</b> in Oregon has intensified, causing further escalation in harvest cost. Thus, in order to alleviate the problems associated with harvest cost, since 1967, Oregon has been actively seeking to mechanize its strawberry harvest. The principal objective of this thesis has been to evaluate the economic feasibility of mechanical strawberry harvest in Oregon. As demonstrated in Chapter V, depending on the assumptions about the quality and the average yield of the strawberry varieties that would eventually be harvested mechanically, and the efficiency of the harvester; the expected savings per acre to the strawberry growers from the use of mechanical harvester was shown to range from a net saving of 523. 50 to a net loss of 186. 76 (Table 9). Even though negative savings are shown to appear when extremely unfavorable conditions are assumed, in the majority of cases discussed in Chapter V, the implementation of mechanical strawberry harvesting in Oregon is found to be associated with significant positive returns to the growers. In addition, in Chapter VI, under certain conditions which are expected to prevail if mechanization of strawberry harvest become a reality in Oregon, the annual gross and net 'social rate of returns' were estimated to be 330 percent and 95. 7 percent respectively. The difference between the gross and net social rate of return is the wage loss of the displaced workers. Based on the above social return figures and the estimated savings to the growers, it appears that mechanical strawberry harvesting is an economically viable alternative that could eventually solve the problem of the growing shortage of <b>strawberry</b> <b>pickers</b> in Oregon...|$|R

25|$|The driverless tractor {{is part of}} a move to {{increase}} automation in farming. Other such autonomous technologies currently utilized in farming include automatic milking and automatic <b>strawberry</b> <b>pickers.</b> Developing such a technology is difficult. In order for it to be successful, the tractor must be able to follow deterministic tasks (a task that is defined before it starts, such as a path to follow on a field), have reactive behavior (the ability to react to an unknown situation such as an obstacle in the way), and have reflexive responses (making a decision without hesitation or time consuming calculations such as changing the steering angle if necessary). Ultimately, the tractor should imitate a human in its ability to observe spatial position and make decisions such as speed.|$|R
