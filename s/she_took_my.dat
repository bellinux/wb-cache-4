500|$|According to Questlove, [...] "The Root", [...] "Spanish Joint", and [...] "Greatdayndamornin' / Booty'" [...] {{serve as}} the [...] "virtuoso part of the record", {{featuring}} intricate technical arrangements, no overdubbing, and Charlie Hunter playing both electric and bass guitar. [...] "The Root" [...] is a mid-tempo heartbreak song with the bass line and guitar solo played simultaneously by Hunter on an eight-string guitar. It is about a vengeful woman's effect on the narrator: [...] "In the name of love and hope <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". Miles Marshall Lewis writes of the song's subject matter, [...] " [...] can actually be digested and emotionally felt, sadly rare for Hot 97 R" [...] Co-written by Roy Hargrove, [...] "Spanish Joint" [...] is a salsa-infused, high tempo track about karma. It incorporates rhythmic Brazilian guitar licks by Hunter, funky horn arrangements by Hargrove, and Latin grooves and fusion instrumentation similar to Stevie Wonder's [...] "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing" [...] (1973). [...] "Feel Like Makin' Love" [...] is a cover of Roberta Flack's 1974 hit of the same name with a low-key, quiet storm sound. [...] "Greatdayndamornin' / Booty'" [...] features double rimshots placed behind the beat by Questlove.|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. It was hard for me sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E

60|$|NEWTE. If <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> advice, she'll {{return to}} the stage. No sense {{stopping}} where you're not wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do nothing--unless <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> {{advice and}} remains abroad. You must write to her now, {{and you will}} tell her what I say. It's an infernal bore, his dying at this moment; but I suppose people won't expect that I'm to shut myself up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{old lady}} {{must have made}} a tidy pile out of it," [...] Violet declared, flourishing an over-scented handkerchief. [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> advice, <b>she</b> will go quiet for a little time. I can feel trouble when it's about, and I have felt it the last few days." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand, {{and pressed}} it to her cold lips. The tears gushed into my eyes, as I tried to speak to her.|$|E
60|$|She set a {{trembling}} hand upon my head; <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> chin in the other, and raised my face {{until she could}} look into it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes Mrs. Rabbit {{is a very}} {{sensible}} animal, and on {{this occasion}} <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> advice, running at full speed, especially when she heard Tommy cry: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 4.30 P. M. Ah, that accursed woman! That thrice accursed woman! Never mind! She {{shall not}} beat me! No, she shall not! But, oh, the she-devil! <b>She</b> has <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> professorship. Now <b>she</b> would <b>take</b> <b>my</b> honor. Is there nothing I can do against her, nothing save---- Ah, but, hard pushed as I am, I cannot {{bring myself to}} think of that! ...|$|R
60|$|Some impulse {{brought her}} forward, and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> both <b>my</b> {{hands in her}} own.|$|R
6000|$|This pendant was by {{no means}} the only present I had given Maude in recent years, and though she cared as little for jewels as for dress she seemed to attach to it a {{peculiar}} value and significance that disturbed and smote me, for the incident had revealed a love unchanged and unchangeable. Had <b>she</b> <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> gift as a sign that my indifference was melting? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> face in {{her hands}} and looked into my eyes, saying no word. Then she leaned forward, and very gently touched my {{forehead}} with her lips.|$|E
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> arm, {{she always}} leaned upon me her whole weight; and, as I {{was not a}} gentleman, or her lover, I did not like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, in bygone time, as it chanced I {{was able}} yonder at Hastings {{to do some}} service to your {{daughter}} and in that hour <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> heart." ...|$|E
60|$|As I made no reply, <b>she</b> gently <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hands {{within her}} own, removed them from my face, and fixed her eyes steadfastly on mine.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Brown-Smith is {{so pretty}} and so amusing, and dear Matilda; <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> after <b>my</b> dear husband's family, though {{the best of}} girls, Matilda has not that {{flashing}} manner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Agnes {{laughed and}} said, [...] "I hope <b>she</b> will <b>take</b> <b>my</b> {{word for it}} all. Why could you not speak to her? At least I thought you were not afraid of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand. [...] "You have pitied and forgiven her," [...] she answered. [...] "Speak of her, Bernard--and don't, for God's sake, {{think that}} my heart is harder than yours." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand, {{and led me}} to the sofa. We sat down, side by side. Her {{face was}} {{composed}} to a sad tranquillity. She was quiet; she was herself again.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{fell back}} frae my oath," [...] he said, [...] "and syne <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> sleeve and speired, 'What has come ower you, Mr. Whamond? Hae you onything on your mind?' ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{crossed the}} {{threshold}} Stella met me. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> both <b>my</b> hands in hers {{and looked at}} me in silence. All that was true and good and noble expressed itself in that look.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> up <b>my</b> {{hand and}} kissed it. This so {{surprised}} my spirits that I cried out like one hurt. The colour came strong in her face, {{and she looked}} at me and nodded.|$|R
60|$|It was Margaret {{who came}} to where I was {{stationed}} by the jiggermast and told me what had occurred; and it was <b>she</b> who <b>took</b> <b>my</b> rifle and relieved me so that I could go aft.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> {{advice and}} was turning {{to put it}} into execution, when her eyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty, {{immediately}} before her, his body instinct with alertness and grace as he held the turn of the rope.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> card; then, in her {{alternative}} {{manner as}} the perfect lady, she presented me to her mother. [...] "Dr. Cumberledge, mamma," [...] she said, in a faintly warning voice. [...] "A friend of Mr. Holsworthy's." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand in {{her thin}} white own, And smiled her thanks--though nigh too weak - And made them a sign to leave us there [...] Then faltered, ere [...] She could bring herself to speak.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{understand}} her manner. <b>She</b> seemed to <b>take</b> <b>my</b> being there {{as a matter of}} course.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me a little curiously. From the first her own {{demeanor}} had been singularly unmoved. During the last few seconds, however, she had grown paler. <b>She</b> suddenly <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand {{and gave it a}} little squeeze.|$|R
60|$|Hearing his cry, {{the woman}} came back. A comely, healthy-looking woman. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> him from <b>my</b> arms and comforted him.|$|R
6000|$|... “Absolutely,” I {{said in a}} {{perfectly}} conventional tone, I was now on my mettle that she should not discover what there was humanly common in my nature. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> answer at her own valuation and was satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|But <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand soothingly in {{hers and}} said, [...] "Little Beatrice, if {{tomorrow}} {{or the next}} day they should tell you, those cold, proud women, that Alicia was unworthy of your love, tell me, would you believe them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said, almost coaxingly, [...] "promise {{that you}} will not be impolite again." [...] <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> arm in the most {{friendly}} way. [...] "Come, I will walk with you. He will not know--he will remain away all night." ...|$|E
60|$|My manner {{must have}} misled her. She stammered in her eagerness to dispel what <b>she</b> <b>took</b> to be <b>my</b> misapprehension.|$|R
6000|$|Lucilla {{felt the}} taunt base, as recalling {{to her the}} {{dependent}} position into which she had carelessly rushed, relying on the family feeling that had hitherto made all things as one. 'Henceforth,' said <b>she,</b> 'I <b>take</b> <b>my</b> share of all that we spend. I will not sell my free will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|At length, one {{day when}} our lesson was over, with an {{expression}} of mingled pleasure and anxiety on her face, <b>she</b> rose and <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand, saying, [...] "Come." ...|$|R
