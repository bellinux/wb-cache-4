40|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{produced}} by sulfate-reducing bacteria {{is a well}} recognised toxic hazard in storage tanks on HMA Ships, however, {{it also has the}} potential to be an explosive hazard. Hydrogen sulfide can cause explosions when its concentration exceeds 4 % in air. A number of storage tanks on HMA Ships theoretically have the potential to produce enough hydrogen sulfide to exceed this figure. This report assesses the likelihood of this occurring in ballast and <b>sewage</b> holding <b>tanks.</b> <b>Sewage</b> <b>tanks</b> pose the greatest risk of an explosive hazard occurring and this situation is exacerbated when seawater is used for flushing or a concentrated sewage is produced due to reduced flushing volumes, as is the situation with EVAC systems.

40|$|In {{our study}} {{we attempt to}} {{demonstrate}} the effects of uninsulated sewage tanks, which {{are the most important}} sources of contamination in settlements without sewage systems, on groundwater quality. We compared the results of measurements carried out before and one and a half years after the construction of the sewage system. We established 3 m deep monitoring wells within a 25 m radius of a <b>sewage</b> <b>tank,</b> which were then sampled, and the level of groundwater was recorded. The 3 D model constructed {{on the basis of the}} saturated zone shows that the effluent wastewater formed a groundwater level dome with a height of more than 1 m. After the <b>sewage</b> <b>tank</b> was taken out of use the difference between the highest and lowest groundwater levels decreased to a few centimetres. In our study we investigated the spatial distribution of NH 4 + (ammonium). Using the 3 D model we were able to precisely determine the volume of water bodies with different levels of contamination. In an approximately 25 m 3 water body, in the immediate environment of a <b>sewage</b> <b>tank</b> in use we detected NH 4 + at a concentration which was characteristic of undiluted wastewater (> 90 mg·dm− 3). After the <b>sewage</b> <b>tank</b> was taken out of use, the concentration in its immediate environment decreased by more than 50 %, although almost everywhere in the modelled area concentrations were measured above the limit value.
