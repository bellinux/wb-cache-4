40|$|The factors {{involved}} {{in the establishment of}} persistent hepadnavirus infection are poorly understood. Recent findings demonstrate that the sequence of the genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is variable in infected individuals and that, in some cases, virus mutants predominate. Our objectives {{in the present study were}} to analyze the variability of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) genomes in an infected animal and to determine whether sequence heterogeneity played a critical role in the ability of WHV to induce chronic infection. We cloned and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of three supercoiled genomes from an animal that became infected after inoculation with a standardized WHV <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> (i. e., the WHV 7 virus pool). We found that there were four nucleotide substitutions among the three genome sequences as well as a 73 -nucleotide deletion in one of the recombinants. DNA transfection experiments revealed that only one of the three recombinants was capable of independent replication. These data suggest that a significant proportion of replicative templates in woodchucks that are infected with WHV are defective virus genomes. Next, we compared the outcome of acute infection after inoculation with a <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> containing a uniform population of replication competent virus (i. e., the WHV 7 R pool) with a <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> composed of WHV genomes of variable sequence. The WHV 7 R <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> originated from a woodchuck that became a chronic carrier after in vivo transfection of the liver with the infectious WHV 7 recombinant. Neonatal woodchucks were inoculated with 5 x 10 (6) WHV genome equivalents of either the WHV 7 pool or the WHV 7 R pool. All animals in the study became acutely infected with WHV. Of the animals infected with the WHV 7 <b>serum</b> <b>pool,</b> 65 % became chronic carriers, while 80 % of the animals infected with the WHV 7 R <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> developed chronic infection. Thus, infection of woodchucks with a <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> containing defective virus resulted in a rate of chronic WHV infection that was similar to, or even lower than, a rate from a pool containing only wild-type virus. This suggests that the presence of defective virus in the inoculum is not a prerequisite for the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infections...|$|E

An immune <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> was prepared by immunizing chinchillas with killed bacterial cells of nontypable H. influenzae 3245. Pooled preimmune or immune serum from these immunized animals was administered intravenously to a group of nonimmune chinchillas 1 day before intrabullar challenge with strain 3245. Of 5 animals receiving preimmune serum, 5 developed otitis media compared with 0 of 10 animals receiving immune serum (P = 0. 008). The immune <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> contained antibodies directed against both surface-exposed outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Experimental <b>serum</b> <b>pools</b> (n = 280) were created by combining equal aliquots of serum from between 5 and 25 individuals. A further 188 <b>serum</b> <b>pools</b> were generated from field <b>serum</b> samples. All <b>pools</b> and individual sera were tested for BVDV- specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Pools returned repeatable results, with coefficients of variation generally below 10 %. The presence of serum from a persistently infected (PI) individual in the pool had no {{significant effect on the}} ELISA sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio. The results revealed that a single strong antibody-positive individual could maintain a positive result (at the manufacturer’s threshold) in pools of up to 128, while even a single weak-positive animal would generate a positive result in pools of up to 8. The S/P ratio of the pool was positively related to the within-pool prevalence of antibody-positive individuals.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of V 3 loops from naturally occurring viruses on the neutralization sensitivity of a molecularly cloned virus. A selection of well-defined syncytium-inducing (SI) and non-SI V 3 loops of a single human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected individual (H 594) and the V 3 regions of two SI laboratory strains were inserted in an infectious molecular clone of human immunodeficiency type 1 LAI. Neutralization was performed with a heterologous <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> and autologous patient serum, using the virus reduction neutralization assay and peripheral blood lymphocytes as target cells. High sensitivity of the chimeric viruses containing the laboratory strain V 3 regions to neutralization by H 594 sequential sera as well as the heterologous <b>serum</b> <b>pool</b> was found. A statistically significant correlation between the sensitivities of these viruses was seen. In contrast, insertion of the primary isolate NSI and SI envelope V 3 loops significantly reduced the neutralization by autologous serum but not by the heterologous <b>serum</b> <b>pool.</b> No correlation was found between the neutralization of the viruses with laboratory strain-derived V 3 regions and the viruses with primary isolate V 3 domains. We conclude that heterologous antibodies are able to neutralize infectious molecular clones with V 3 loops of both SI and NSI viruses, regardless of whether they originated from laboratory strains or primary isolates. However, serum of patient H 594 discriminated between the two types of viruses and showed reduced neutralization of the viruses with the autologous NSI and SI primary isolate V 3 loops. These results indicated that the neutralization sensitivity of the viruses depended on the capacity of the V 3 region to influence the conformation of the virus envelope. These V 3 -dependent conformational changes partially explain the neutralization sensitivity of laboratory strains and the relative neutralization resistance of primary isolate...|$|E

The electrophoretic apolipoprotein A-I assay avoids {{the problems associated with}} antibody-antigen interaction. The method involves spectrophotometric meas-urement of the Coomassie blue eluted from the apolipoprotein A-I bands of human serum after electrophoresis in a gradient gel. The assay was linear from 0. 5 to 4. 0 micrograms of apolipoprotein A-I. Within-assay variability was 3. 2 % and between-assay variability was 5. 9 %. Overall analytical recovery was 98 %. The electrophoretic assay is suitable for the quantitation of apolipoprotein A-I in fresh, frozen or lyophilized <b>serum</b> <b>pools.</b> Analysis of 6 frozen <b>serum</b> <b>pools</b> showed a good correlation between this assay and an immunoturbidimetric assay (r = 0. 96), and between this assay and consensus values (r = 0. 99).

The mean apolipoprotein A-I concentrations in 3 lyophilized <b>serum</b> <b>pools</b> were 1. 04 + 0. 02, 0. 86 ± 0. 02, and 0. 45 ± 0. 03 g/ 1 (mean + SD) by electrophoretic assay. The consensus values for these pools were 1. 04, 0. 86, and 0. 43 g/ 1, respectively, as derived from the data of different immunochemical assay measurements performed in 84 laboratories in 34 various countries.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} five {{commercially available}} reagent sets supplied for the radioimmunoassay of lutropin, we deter-mined {{whether there was}} parallelism between the curve given by dilutions of the standards supplied by the manu-facturers, by dilutions of a <b>serum</b> <b>pool,</b> and by dilutions of a standard preparation from human pituitaries, LER- 907. These studies demonstrated significant analytical problems with {{three of the five}} sets. We conclude that each user should carefully evaluate all commercially available ra-dioimmunoassays for lutropin (and, by inference, for other peptide hormones) before use.

40|$|A {{commercial}} radloimmunoassay (AlA) {{for human}} proinsulin C-peptide was modified {{to improve its}} ruggedness and specificity, to decrease the influence of specimen matrix, and to shorten “hands-on ” time. In the new protocol, we prepare calibrators in a C-peptide-free <b>serum</b> <b>pool,</b> prepared by treatmentwith activatedcharcoal (biologicalmatrix),instead of in a defined matrix. This yielded essentially 100 % analyti-cal recoveries for C-peptide concentrations up to 300 pmoi/L, a broader analytical range. We also corrected calibrators and unknownsamplesfor nonspecific binding (NSB). Decreasing the concentrationof ethanol (from 950 to 880 mL/L) for differential precipitation of the antigen-antibody complex resulted in an NSB of < 10 %, while maintaining high bound! total count percentages for samples and calibrators.

40|$|Background: Commutable {{reference}} materials (RMs) {{are suitable for}} end-users for evalu-ating the metrological traceability of values obtained using routine measurement systems. We assessed the performance of 6 routine measurement systems with validated second-ary RMs. Methods: We tested the homogeneity, stability, and commutability of 5 minimally processed human <b>serum</b> <b>pools</b> according to the standard guidelines. The <b>serum</b> <b>pools</b> were assigned values as per the reference procedure of the United States Centers for Disease Control and were {{used to evaluate the}} trueness of results from 6 commercial measurement systems based on enzymatic methods: 3 glucose oxidase (GOD) and 3 hexokinase (HK) methods. Results: The prepared RMs were validated to be sufficiently homogenous, stable, and commutable with the patient samples. Method bias varied for different systems: GOD 01,- 0. 17 to 2. 88 %; GOD 02, 1. 66 to 4. 58 %; GOD 03,- 0. 17 to 3. 14 %; HK 01,- 3. 48 to- 0. 85 %; HK 02,- 3. 83 to- 0. 11 %, and HK 03,- 1. 82 to- 0. 27 %. Conclusions: We observed that the prepared serum glucose RMs were qualified for true-ness assessment. Most of the measurement systems met the minimal quality specifications...|$|R
