5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E
5|$|Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{described}} the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War.

The cartoons and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of <b>society.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.|$|E
