All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} when Specter, a white-haired monkey who is {{well-known}} {{at his home}} in a monkey-themed amusement park, puts on an experimental Peak Point Helmet created by a Professor, which increases his intelligence beyond that of a regular monkey, but also twists his mind, turning him evil. Imbued with this new power, Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all the monkeys in the park and <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> loose, having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie (Katie/Natsumi) are currently building a time machine. As Spike (Kakeru) and his best friend Jake (Buzz/Hiroki) arrive at the laboratory, they find themselves transported by Specter, along with all the other monkeys, to the various reaches of time. Realizing that leaving the monkeys to their own devices could rewrite history in disastrous ways, the Professor tasks Spike with finding all of the monkeys scattered across time and sending them back to the present.|$|E

25|$|The same molecule, {{containing}} {{the same number}} of atoms, with a double bond in the same location, can be either a trans or a cis fatty acid depending on the configuration of the double bond. For example, oleic acid and elaidic acid are both unsaturated fatty acids with the chemical formula C9H17C9H17O2. They both have a double bond located midway along the carbon chain. It is the configuration of this bond that <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> apart. The configuration has implications for the physical-chemical properties of the molecule. The trans configuration is straighter, while the cis configuration is noticeably kinked as {{can be seen from the}} three-dimensional representation shown above.|$|E
25|$|After {{many generations}} of Adam have {{passed from the}} lines of Cain and Seth, the world becomes {{corrupted}} by human sin and Nephilim, and God determines to wipe out humanity.

When the waters recede, God promises that he will not destroy the world a second time with water with the rainbow as the symbol of his promise. But upon seeing mankind cooperating to build a great tower city, the Tower of Babel, God divides humanity with many languages and <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> apart with confusion.|$|E

25|$|Another {{variety that}} has {{sometimes}} been recognized is that of Moesian (or Mysian) for the language of an intermediate area immediately {{to the south of}} Danube in Serbia, Bulgaria and Romanian Dobruja: this and the dialects north of the Danube have been grouped together as Daco-Moesian. The language of the indigenous population has left hardly any trace in the anthroponymy of Moesia, but the toponymy indicates that the Moesii on the south bank of the Danube, north of the Haemus Mountains, and the Triballi in the valley of the Morava, shared a number of characteristic linguistic features with the Dacii south of the Carpathians and the Getae in the Wallachian plain, which <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> apart from the Thracians though their languages are undoubtedly related.|$|E

It {{is one of the most}} religious states, with a large proportion of staunch Roman Catholics and a burgeoning Evangelical and neo-Pentecostal population, with pockets of African religions. The Spiritist doctrine is also professed by a significant portion of the population, partly due to the influence of Chico Xavier, the main spiritual icon of Brazil, who lived in Minas Gerais all his life.|$|E
25|$|Holle assumes {{control of}} the ship and executes the head mutineer, but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his {{piloting}} skills to land on Earth III, a cold tidally locked planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere and a red dwarf sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously: since children weigh little, many will fit on the shuttle, thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, whose children are not allowed on the shuttle due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> down safely on a lake and they prepare to settle on their new world.

25|$|The Duke of Habachtsthal {{is a minor}} royal, a German nobleman {{and distant}} {{relation}} of the King, who is the homosexual lover of Wray and Ledward. After their death, he continues to pass secrets on to France, while trying to get Sir Joseph Blaine into trouble, and also trying to get Maturin arrested for his mostly forgotten fringe role in the Irish rebellion of 1798, {{as well as for}} illegally bringing Padeen and Clarissa, both transported convicts, over from Australia. To keep his daughter, Mrs Oakes and Padeen safe from him, Maturin <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> up in a convent in Avila, Spain. He is said to have cut his throat (in The Commodore), possibly due to the threat of trial for treason after being identified by Clarissa Oakes and following extensive investigation carried out by Mr Pratt, a former Bow Street Runner employed by Maturin and Sir Joseph Blaine. His death merits flags at half-staff, in full irony.|$|E
25|$|In the lair, Christine {{is forced}} to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and {{attempts}} to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees {{to stay with him}} forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion {{for the first time in}} his life. The Phantom, having experienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him, and <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom tells Christine he loves her, before she tearfully exits with Raoul. The weeping Phantom huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cloak. The mob, led by Meg, enters the lair. Meg pulls the Phantom's cloak from the throne, finding only his mask on the seat.

500|$|A {{review in}} the science fiction fan {{magazine}} Strange Horizons applauded Le Guin, saying that she [...] "takes nearly every trope of the fantasy genre and deliberately <b>sets</b> <b>them</b> aside," [...] such as by not painting the Alds as [...] "two-dimensional villains."

[...] The review referred to Memer as a [...] "quiet and compelling" [...] voice, while scholar Sandra Lindow also praised Memer's characterization, calling her a [...] "thoughtful and assured" [...] narrative voice. Multiple reviews compared the book to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, which also prominently features the destruction of books by an oppressive authority. The Sydney Morning Herald stated that though Le Guin's work was [...] "at once more concrete and more ethereal than the Bradbury", and was a demonstration of her [...] "tremendous skill as a writer".

500|$|Management teams (also {{referred}} to as action and negotiation teams) {{are responsible for the}} coordination and direction of a division within an institution or organization during various assigned projects and functional, operational and/or strategic tasks and initiatives.

The authority of these teams are based on the members position on the company's or institution's organizational chart. These management teams are constructed of managers from different divisions (e.g. Vice President of Marketing, Assistant Director of Operations). An example of management teams are executive management teams, which consists of members {{at the top of the}} organization's hierarchy, such as Chief Executive Officer, Board of Directors, Board of Trustees, etc., who establish the strategic initiatives that a company will undertake over a long term period (~ 3–5 years).
