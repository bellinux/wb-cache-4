40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of magnetorheological (MR) dampers for {{mitigating}} vibrations {{caused by}} <b>seismic</b> <b>motions</b> in civil engineering structures has attracted {{much interest in}} the scientific com-munity because {{of the advantages of}} this class of device. It is known that MR dampers can generate high damping forces with low energy requirements and low cost of production. However, the complex dynamics that characterize MR dampers make difficult the control design for achieving the vibration reduction goals in an efficient manner. In this article, a semi-active controller based on the backstepping technique is proposed. The controller was applied to a three-story building with an MR damper at its first floor subjected to <b>seismic</b> <b>motions.</b> The performance of the controller was evaluated experimentally by means of real time hybrid testing...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{illuminates}} a newseismic design philosophy,which {{takes advantage}} of soil ""failure"" to protect the superstructure. A reversal of conventional ""capacity design"" is introduced, through intentional underdesigning of the foundation. A simple but realistic bridge is used as an illustrative example {{of the effectiveness of}} the new philosophy. Two alternatives are compared: one in compliance with conventional capacity design, with over-designed foundation so that the plastic ""hinge"" develops in the superstructure; and one with under-designed foundation, so that the plastic ""hinge"" may occur in the soil. The seismic performance of the two alternatives is investigated through numerical (finite element) and experimental (shaking table) simulation. It is shown that the performance of both alternatives is totally acceptable for moderate <b>seismic</b> <b>motions.</b> For large intensity <b>seismic</b> <b>motions,</b> the performance of the new scheme is shown to be advantageous, not only avoiding collapse but hardly suffering any inelastic structural deformation.
