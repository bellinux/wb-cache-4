40|$|Shudder {{vibration}} of {{a hydraulic}} power steering system during parking maneuver was studied with numerical and experimental methods. To quantify vibration performance {{of the system and}} recognize important stimuli for drivers, a shudder metric was derived by correlation between objective measurements and subjective ratings. A CAE model for steering wheel vibration analysis was developed and compared with measured data. In order to describe steering input dependency of shudder, a new dynamic friction modeling method, in which the magnitude of effective damping is determined by average velocity, was proposed. The developed model was validated using the measured steering wheel acceleration and the pressure change at inlet of the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b> It was shown that the developed model successfully describes major modes by comparing the calculated FRF of the hydraulic system with measured one from the hydraulic excitation test. Vibration mechanism from pressure variation at power steering pump outlet to steering wheel vibration was shown through Eigen value analysis of the model. Using the developed model, an optimization was conducted and important factors were presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} wheelchair stair lift with an intelligent control system that aim to apply for helping the mobility of ageing, disabled and wheelchair people who are suffered from any inconvenience causes of building stair usages and also served for the fire stair evacuation path in the same time. The stair lift is controlled by PLC with the fuzzy proportional plus integral (F-PI) controller combined on their driver functions called as fuzzy ladder control which can generate an appropriate setting voltage and torque to maintain a target position and speed of stair lift when it move along the stair path with shorter time of accessing, travelling and dwelling process. To gain the precise value of target position and speed, the DC motor drive with smart <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> that are coupled on two stair guide rails is designed for acting easily as a linear moving control by F-PI controller. By several tests of the unknown characteristics of wheelchair users, the F-PI controller can solve this kind of problems with more efficiency because of the main advantage of fuzzy logic is that no mathematical model is required but can be achieved higher performance with the effective tuning parameters especially in an initial setting process. For more efficiency, the RFID detection method is applied to use for identifying and automatically accessing of wheelchair users who want to use this stair lift with some important data such as their name, ag...|$|E
40|$|Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are {{important}} components of modern automated transport systems. Increasing the system efficiency and throughput requires {{the use of}} heavy vehicles travelling at high speeds. As the AGV's payload capacity and travelling speed increases, the ensuing increase in lateral acceleration requires thorough dynamic modelling and more sophisticated controller design. To establish the sufficient level of model complexity necessary for this work, a 3 -DOF nonlinear dynamic model comprising yaw, lateral, and roll motions is developed. The suspension, lateral and longtudinal load transfer, nonlinear behaviour of tires, and steering dynamics are included in this model. The model also comprises the effect of actuators, differential <b>gear</b> <b>box,</b> <b>steering</b> and tractive <b>gear</b> <b>boxes.</b> The model is validated through simulations and comparison with other models. A dynamic-based approach to the control of a typical transport interfactory AGV in a semi structured environment is studied. The 2 -DOF side slippage free dynamic model comprising steering and actuators dynamics is used to design the controller. The input-output feedback linearization technique is employed to linearize the nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle. To improve robustness in the presence of parameter uncertainty, modelling errors and disturbance, a Boundary Layer Sliding Mode (BLSM) controller is adopted. The BLSM controller is later modified to improve performance and enhance robustness, using simultaneous variable boundary layer and multiple sliding surfaces strategies. Simulations based on the 3 -DOF nonlinear model show the satisfactory results for the Modified Boundary Layer Sliding Mode (MBLSM) controller...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rudder and <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the most}} widely used ship {{maneuvering}} equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, <b>steering</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem.
