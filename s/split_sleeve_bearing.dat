50|$|From November 1944 through February 1945, a {{conversion}} process {{began to use}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of ball <b>bearings.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> were primarily used in the running gear; plans were also made to convert the transmission to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> but were not carried out due to the ending of Panther production.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> use two {{surfaces}} lubricated {{with oil}} or grease as a friction contact. They often use porous sintered sleeves to be self-lubricating, requiring only infrequent maintenance or replacement. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are less durable at higher temperatures as the contact surfaces wear and the lubricant dries up, eventually leading to failure; however, lifetime {{is similar to}} that of ball-bearing types (generally a little less) at relatively low ambient temperatures. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> may be more likely to fail at higher temperatures, and may perform poorly when mounted in any orientation other than vertical. The typical lifespan of a sleeve-bearing fan may be around 30,000 hours at 50 °C. Fans that use <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are generally cheaper than fans that use ball bearings, and are quieter at lower speeds early in their life, but can become noisy as they age.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} {{was attributed to}} the disengagement of {{the left and right}} spur gear teeth in the main transmission, caused by the load imposed by the failure of the gearbox's rear <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> journals. The rear <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> failure was caused by an oil leak although evidence was destroyed by fire and the source of the leak was not established.|$|R

5000|$|Rifle {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> but are quieter and have almost as much lifespan as ball bearings. The bearing has a spiral groove in it that pumps fluid from a reservoir. This allows them to be safely mounted with the shaft horizontal (unlike <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings),</b> since the fluid being pumped lubricates {{the top of the}} shaft. The pumping also ensures sufficient lubricant on the shaft, reducing noise, and increasing lifespan.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 25 - 32 One {{property}} of heavily to moderately loaded <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> is the resulting asymmetric stiffness and damping coefficients. These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. Tilting pad bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit first critical speed that is located approximately midway between the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>split</b> peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with tilting pad bearings. Both rotor bearing systems resulted in first critical speeds in the operating speed range. Numerous attempts to shift the critical out of the operating range were explored without success. As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots. While a tilting pad to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> change is not recommended for all classes of turbomachinery to shift critical speeds, it is a powerful design tool as it may produce critical speed changes of up to 1000 rpm...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows a {{theoretical}} vibration analysis regarding excitation due to elliptical shaft journals in <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> of electrical motors, {{based on a}} simplified rotordynamic model. It is shown that elliptical shaft journals lead to kinematic constraints regarding {{the movement of the}} shaft journals on the oil film of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> and therefore to an excitation of the rotordynamic system. The solution of the linear differential equation system leads to the mathematical description of the movement of the rotor mass, the shaft journals, and the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> housings. Additionally the relative movements between the shaft journals and the bearing housings are deduced, as well as the bearing housing vibration velocities. The presented simplified rotordynamic model can also be applied to rotating machines, other than electrical machines. In this case, only the electromagnetic spring value cm has to be put to zero...|$|R
40|$|Plastic sliding {{bearings}} in massive and composite structure mostly {{are used as}} wearing bearing. The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive {{sliding bearings}} with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive sliding bearings is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the sliding bearings are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic sliding bearings {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic sliding bearing works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.

25|$|The BCNR33 GT-R version {{also had}} the same RB26DETT engine that the BNR32 was {{equipped}} with, although torque had been improved, due {{to changes in the}} turbo compressor aerodynamics, turbo dump pipe, and intercooler. The turbo core changed from a <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> to a ball bearing, but the turbine itself remained ceramic, except on N1 turbos (steel turbine, <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing).</b> From the R33 onward, all GT-Rs received Brembo brakes. In 1995 the GT-R received an improved version of the RB26DETT, the ATTESA-ETS four-wheel-drive system, and Super HICAS 4-wheel steering.|$|R

40|$|Coldworking {{fastener}} holes is {{a mechanical}} method of strengthening materials by retarding crack growth around the holes. It expands the hole diameter {{by creating a}} radial plastic flow of material, thereby producing a large residual compressive stress zone around the hole. This zone, depending upon variables such as material and applied expansion levels, will extend approximately one radius {{from the edge of}} the hole. This zone acts as a barrier, retarding crack growth, thereby increasing the fatigue life of the part. In this paper the benefits of coldworking are discussed. Currently there are two fastener hole coldworking methods used widely, the <b>split</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and <b>split</b> mandrel processes. The <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> process utilizes a solid, tapered mandrel and an internally lubricated <b>split</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The sleeveless <b>split</b> mandrel process utilizes a hollow, tapered mandrel that is longitudinally slotted into quarters (making it collapsible). Details of each process are discussed. Coldworking research to date has been focused on either fatigue life enhancement, or stress zone measurements (both actual and computer simulated). Research of the differences between the <b>split</b> <b>sleeve</b> and <b>split</b> mandrel process has been very limited. West Coast Industries (WCI) has theorized that these differences are important in determining the correct process for a specific application.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a mathematical rotordynamic model regarding excitation due to elliptical shaft journals in <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> of electrical motors also considering the gyroscopic effect.

Additionally, the bearing housing velocities can also be derived with this mathematical rotordynamic model. </p...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{heavy duty}} diesel engines utilize turbochargers for {{increased}} power output. Also, {{a wide range}} of power levels can be achieved with one engine displacement through the use of different turbocharger configurations, eliminating the need for several different sized engines. These are the reasons that virtually all diesel truck engines currently marketed use turbochargers. However, because these turbochargers rely on ring seals and oil-lubricated floating <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> they often suffer breakdowns. These turbochargers operate at elevated temperatures which often causes the oil to degrade and even coke to the bearing surfaces. This can lead to catastrophic failure, increased particulate emissions from oil leaks, and, in extreme cases, engine fires. Replacing the oil lubricated bearings from these turbochargers with some other device is desirable to eliminate these inherent problems. Foil bearings are compliant selecting bearings lubricated by air and are well suited to high speed, light load applications. Thus, foil bearings present one potential replacement for oil-lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> Their use as such is investigated in this work...|$|R
50|$|Bearings are an {{important}} part of a fan. Sleeve-ring oil bearings are used extensively in fans. Some sleeve-ring bearings may be water-cooled. Water-cooled <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are often used when the fan moves hot gases. Heat is conducted through the shaft and into the oil, which must be cooled to prevent overheating the bearing. Lower-speed fans have bearings in hard-to-reach spots, so they use grease-packed bearings.|$|R
