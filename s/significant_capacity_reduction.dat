40|$|This study {{investigated}} the fundamental performance of manganese greensands {{for the removal of}} both dissolved manganese and iron species from solution. The hypothesis was that iron ions may detrimentally impact manganese removal and that the magnitude of this outcome was dependent upon greensand composition. Consequently, five greensand materials were examined in terms of repeatability of operation, the relationship of performance to physical criteria, the mechanism of removal, influence of solution pH and the performance changes that occur when manganese and iron were co-present in solution. All greensand medias were shown to remove Mn(II) over 5 treatment cycles, where the solid MnO 2 media had a larger removal capacity (0. 35 mg/g) compared to the two coated medias (0. 09 and 0. 05 mg/g, respectively). The greensand medias also showed a <b>significant</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction</b> from 72 to 93...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strengthened and unstrengthened cold-formed steel tubular columns to deter-mine the maximum temperature that a column can sustain {{for a given}} service load factor. Finite element (FE) models were developed and validated by comparing axial compression test results from an ongoing exeperimental study. Validated models {{were used to determine}} the failure loads of CFRP strengthened and unstrengthened columns at elevated temperatures by incorporating the elevated temperature mechanical properties of CFRP and cold-formed steel tubular sections. Results showed that CFRP strengthened tubular columns displayed a <b>significant</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction</b> with temperature than unstrengthened tubular columns. Therefore, this paper shows that the fire performance of CFRP strengthened steel tubular columns is worse than that of unstrengthened columns for a given service load ratio and thus emphasizes the importance of an insulation system to protect the CFRP strengthened steel columns in fire events...|$|E
40|$|Incident {{clearance}} {{and road}} work often require {{the closure of}} {{one or more of the}} available lanes on a highway. A lane-closure causes a <b>significant</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction,</b> which often leads to heavy congestion. Simulation of congestion events due to lane - closures is relevant both for traffic and infrastructure management. This is especially valid when trucks are involved and they concentrate on bridges or in tunnels, thus generating critical situation s for loading and safety. A better understanding of the effects of lane closures requires a realistic simulation of the merging manoeuvre of vehicles occurring in the proximity of the lane closure. Micro-simulation allows for the motion of individual vehic les and it is therefore a suitable tool for studying traffic merging. In this paper, a micro-simulation tool made up of a car-following model and a lane-changing model is used for simulating a lane closure on a two-lane one direction stretch of road. The effects on traffic are studied, in terms of average speed, lane change rates, and truck distribution. It is found that the lane-changing model requires an appropriate parameter calibration when applied to lane-closures. These parameters are quite different from the ones reported in literature. An alternative means of causing congestion is also tested and it is found that it can replicate the overall congestion features upstream the closure. However, there are some differences about details of the traffic feature...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the uncertain value of the gravity loads and the vertical ground motion component on the seismic performance of a non-ductile reinforced concrete building. Seismic guidelines typically enforce the use of the Gκ + 0. 3 Qκ combination, where Gκ, Qκ are the characteristic dead and live loads, respectively. However, their true values and their influence to the seismic response are not known. Using a typical existing five-story reinforced concrete building, we employ incremental dynamic analysis to evaluate the seismic performance under probabilistic load distributions in combination with the use or not of the vertical component of ground motion. Multiple accelerograms are scaled to several levels of intensity, both in the horizontal and in the vertical sense, to evaluate the building capacity in limit-states ranging from serviceability to global dynamic instability and structural collapse. Thus, it is shown that the highly variable live loads tend to increase the response uncertainty especially when they dominate over dead loads. On the other hand, the effect of vertical accelerations depends on the magnitude of the gravity loads, with higher loads causing <b>significant</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>reductions</b> across all limit-states considered...|$|R

We provide a simulation-based framework for evaluating gate allocation policies under reduced runway capacity. We first analyze a simple example, demonstrating {{the complexity of the}} problem and some key insights into different operating policies. Having shown that even simple scenarios can be difficult (if not impossible) to evaluate in closed form, we turn to simulation. We model the impact of reduced runway capacity on inbound and outbound flights by considering a major U. S. airport and its legacy carrier, focusing on the impact of delays on passengers. The contributions of this work are to highlight the challenges of accurately modeling the impact of runway <b>capacity</b> <b>reductions</b> and to present a simulation-based framework for evaluating operational policies. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies how {{financial}} distress affects competition and how incumbent bankruptcy affects {{the growth of}} rivals, specifically {{in the context of}} airline bankruptcies. I begin by studying whether bankrupt airlines put competitive pressures on rivals by cutting fares and maintaining or expanding capacity on the 1000 most popular domestic routes from 1998 - 2008. The results suggest that, although bankrupt legacy airlines reduce fares, they also reduce capacities significantly. Low-cost carrier (LCC) rivals do not match the fare cuts and expand capacities by 13 - 18 % above trend growth. The <b>significant</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>reductions</b> associated with legacy airline bankruptcies create growth opportunities for LCC rivals. This indicates the existence of barriers that have limited LCCs from expanding faster and more extensively. The LCC expansion during rivals' bankruptcies is even greater when I consider the 200 most popular airports instead of the 1000 most popular routes. During legacy airlines' bankruptcy, non-LCC rivals reduce capacities on the routes affected by the bankruptcy but expand at the affected airports. A likely explanation for this result is that non-LCCs avoid 'bankruptcy' routes as more competitive pressure is expected with increasing presence of LCCs, but they pick up the gates or time slots given up by the bankrupt airlines to expand on other routes. On balance the total route capacity on the 1000 popular routes shows only a modest decrease during bankruptcy and eventually recovers, but the capacity mix changes in favor of LCCs. Overall, I find little evidence that distressed airlines toughen competition and lower industry profitability. LCC's capacity growth during legacy rivals' bankruptcy suggests the existence of market frictions in competition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} provide the joint {{versatility}} for pultruded fibre reinforced polymer (PFRP) in civil structures industry is crucial for its application demands. Bolted joint is extensively used in the industry due to low cost and ease of assembly. However, this jointing method can compromise the PFRP strength at the joint due to poor quality of drilling techniques, accuracy of hole size and threaded bolt. In this study, the main objective is to investigate the effect of threaded bolt {{on the strength of}} bolted joints in pultruded fibre reinforced polymer. Double lap joint configuration was used on both longitudinal and transverse laminates and tested to failure (in tension) in accordance with ASTM D 5961. The test specimens failed in shear-out (heavily crushed) mode and net-tension mode for longitudinal and transverse laminates, respectively. A <b>significant</b> joint <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction</b> was observed on the threaded samples due to unevenness of the contact surface. The load-displacement curve shows the slope with several knees after the first drop, which may indicate some damping effects and unstable development of internal damage. ...|$|R

The LSB is subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling (LDB) mode when used as flexural members. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by cross sectional change due to web distortion. Lateral distortional buckling causes <b>significant</b> moment <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction</b> for LSBs with intermediate spans. Therefore a detailed investigation was undertaken to determine the methods of reducing the effects of lateral distortional buckling in LSB flexural members.

It {{was found that the}} use of 5 mm steel plate stiffeners welded or screwed to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges at third span points considerably reduced the lateral distortional buckling effects in LSBs.

The accumulation operation- fundamental basis of the adaptation process- is split into two steps: A fine-grain carry-save accumulation with timesharing factor 2 collects the products of estimated error and input symbols over a blocklength of 16 input symbols and operates at twice the symbol rate; a master accumulator with timesharing factor 32 collects the block-sums from 16 fine-grain accumulators, multiplies them with the adaptation constant and carries out the final vector merging operation, saturation, tap leakage and radix- 4 Booth recoding. Three steps to reduce the power consumption of the fine-grain accumulators will be presented and evaluated for a 14 -bit-wide accumulator: The suppression of one state of the redundant codes for the value ” 1 ” in the carry save digit alphabet, i. e. redundancy-reduced digit alphabet can be exploited to reduce the transistor count of the following full adder by one third, resulting in a <b>significant</b> input <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction</b> which increases the maximumand clock frequency by nearly 15 % and an additional reduction of power consumption of 2. 7 %; Finally an optimized sign extension logic reduces the capacitive load of the input sign bits by 70 %, eliminates six of the full adders in the sign extension slices and increases the power reduction to 19. 2 %. The maximum clock frequency of the accumulator could be increased by 18 % due to the reduced internal loads. ...|$|R

Chapter 2 examines the relationship between multimarket contact (MMC) and competition. When demand is fluctuating, so is the sustainability of collusive profit. This paper investigates how MMC affects collusive profit under demand fluctuations. In particular, I focus on the correlation structure between demand shocks over multiple markets and show how it can lead to a positive link between collusive profit and MMC. Simple theoretical models show that, regardless of whether demand shocks are observable or not, MMC may improve collusive profits through diversification of demand shocks over overlapping markets. If firms meet in multiple markets and link those markets in the sense that deviation in any market will trigger simultaneous retaliations in every market, then a cheating firm will optimally deviate in every market. Demand fluctuations that a firm is facing in its markets in total will be reduced as the number of markets increases, unless demand shocks are perfectly and positively correlated between the markets. The reduction of demand fluctuations can boost collusion (1) by reducing the temptation to deviate in a period of high demand when demand shocks are observable and (2) by reducing the frequency of costly punishments on the equilibrium path when demand shocks are unobservable. The conclusion in the case of observable demand shocks provide us with a new testable implication that price competition will be muted by MMC in periods of high demand...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we look at}} one of the aging {{mechanisms}} that may have affected current aged Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Irradiation as an age-related degradation mechanism is studied for Reinforced Concrete (RC) in NPPs. This problem can be important for aged reactor buildings, radwaste buildings, spent nuclear fuel, research reactors, or accelerators that experience high levels of radiation close to existing thresholds. Mechanical properties of concrete are the most important parameters affected by radiation in NPPs. Compressive strength of concrete is reduced between 80 and 35 % for radiation fluences between 2 × 10 ^ 19 and 2 × 10 ^ 21 n/cm^ 2. Tensile strength reduction is more significant than compressive strength. It is reduced between 20 and 80 % for a radiation fluence equal to 5 × 10 ^ 19. We chose three radiation levels 2 × 10 ^ 19, 2 × 10 ^ 20, 2 × 10 ^ 20 based on experimental results as the critical levels of radiation that RC structures in NPPs may be exposed to. Structures susceptible to the problem are mostly RC walls; so the RC panel is chosen as an appropriate representative scale element for the analysis. The effect of radiation on mechanical properties of concrete is considered to analyze degraded scale elements. Material properties, geometry, and loading scenarios of scale elements are selected to be close to actual quantities in existing nuclear power plant. Elements are analyzed under six types of loading combination of shear and axial loading conditions. A nonlinear finite element program, Membrane- 2000, based on the Modified Compression Field Theory (MCFT) is used to solve scale elements numerically. Element behaviors are studied considering the factors influence ultimate strength capacity, failure mode, and structural ductility index of members. The results show that ultimate shear capacity of the elements subjected to combinations of shear and tension loading are reduced significantly for highly reinforced elements (1. 35 <ρ< 1. 88) in 2 × 10 ^ 21 n/cm^ 2 radiation. RC panels under shear-biaxial and uniaxial compression also show <b>significant</b> strength <b>capacity</b> <b>reduction</b> in radiation levels 2 × 10 ^ 20 n/cm^ 2 and 2 × 10 ^ 21 n/cm^ 2, respectively. Failure modes of the elements change from yielding of steel to shear failure by increasing level of degradation for the elements with reinforcement ratio between 0. 9 and 1. 88.
