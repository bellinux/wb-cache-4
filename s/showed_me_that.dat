25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{one could}} attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E
500|$|Lead vocalist Mark Hall {{says that}} [...] "Praise You In This Storm" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's experience with a young girl, Erin Browning. The band made arrangements to meet Erin, who had performed a dance at her public school to one of the band's songs, and her family on Valentine's Day 2004 before one of their concerts. Right around the time the band connected with Erin and her family was when she was found to have cancer. Erin died on November 1, 2004. According to Hall, [...] "Watching [...] walk through this really showed me truth about my worship. Watching her walk through a real storm <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my worship was extremely situational". Hall began writing the song before Erin's death and told her about it, but was not able to complete it before she died.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, {{she dropped}} out of college and {{relocated}} to New York City. She had little money and worked as a waitress at Dunkin' Donuts and with modern dance troupes, taking classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and eventually performing with Pear Lang Dance Theater. Madonna said of her move to New York, [...] "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done." [...] She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. Madonna claimed that during a late night she was returning from a rehearsal, when a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. Madonna later commented that [...] "the episode was a taste of my weakness, it <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I still could not save myself {{in spite of all the}} strong-girl show. I could never forget it." ...|$|E

500|$|LeMond's first {{professional}} victory came three months into his 1981 debut {{when he won}} a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He followed with a win in the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of Sergei Sukhoruchenkov, the 1980 Olympic road champion. The major step forward in 1981 occurred in the Dauphiné Libéré stage race where LeMond placed third. The achievement is the more remarkable because he rode the race in support of team leader Bernard Hinault. LeMond missed standing on the podium with race winner Hinault, as Pascal Simon had finished ahead of him. Two weeks later Simon was assessed a 10-minute penalty when it was discovered he had been doping. LeMond considered the race {{to have been a}} [...] "major steppingstone" [...] in his career. Said LeMond: [...] "It <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races." [...] LeMond won a total of five races in his rookie season of 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Two of Rea's most {{important}} influences were the György Ligeti compositions on the [...] soundtrack and the King Crimson album In the Court of the Crimson King. In a 2001 interview in Exposé magazine Rea {{comments on the}} impact on his music: [...] "The former opened my ears to expanded conceptions of form and tonality {{and to the world}} of 'extended' instrumental technique, and Ligeti remains my favorite composer to this day. The latter <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> rock music could be so much more than the usual foursquare pounding with juvenile lyrics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, Hall and the design team took a research trip to Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, where they met a team of DARPA-funded researchers who were pioneering the new field of 'soft robotics' using inflatable vinyl, which ultimately inspired Baymax's inflatable, vinyl, truly huggable design. Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch but the minute he <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot." [...] Hall stated that the technology [...] "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tyler has {{occasionally}} been {{classified as}} a “Southern author” or a “modern American author.” [...] The Southern category apparently results {{from the fact that}} she grew up and went to college in the South. [...] Also she admired and/or studied under well-known Southern authors Eudora Welty and Reynolds Price. In a rare interview with The New York Times, Tyler cited Eudora Welty as a major literary influence: [...] "Reading Eudora Welty when I was growing up <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> very small things are often really larger than the large things". [...] However, poet and author Katha Pollitt notes, “It is hard to classify Anne Tyler’s novels. [...] They are Southern in their sure sense of family and place but lack the taste for violence and the Gothic that often characterizes self-consciously southern literature. [...] They are modern in their fictional techniques, yet utterly unconcerned with contemporary moment as a subject, so that, with only minor dislocations, her stories could just as well have taken place in twenties or thirties.” ...|$|E

6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "O Allen! your not KNOWING {{makes it}} all the more hopeless and killing.

[...] "It <b>shows</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you never understood me, and you never will. I know you're good and kind and all that, but that only makes your not understanding me so much the worse. I do it quite as much for your sake as my own, Allen." ...|$|R

5000|$|In September 2008, Sci-Fi Wire ran an {{interview}} with Sarah Michelle Gellar in which {{she said she would}} not rule out returning to her most iconic role: [...] "Never say never," [...] she said. [...] "One of the reasons the original Buffy movie did not really work on the big screen-and people blamed Kristy, but that's not what it was-the story was better told over a long arc," [...] Gellar said. [...] "And I worry about Buffy as a 'beginning, middle and end' so quickly. ... You <b>show</b> <b>me</b> a script; you <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it works, and you <b>show</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the audience can accept that, and I'd probably be there. Those are what my hesitations are." ...|$|R
