2500|$|This form of {{bilirubin}} is excreted {{from the}} liver in bile. Excretion of bilirubin from liver to biliary canaliculi is an active, energy dependent and rate limiting process. The intestinal bacteria deconjugate bilirubin diglucuronide and convert bilirubin to urobilinogens. Some urobilinogen is absorbed by intestinal cells and transported into the kidneys and excreted with urine (urobilin, {{which is the}} product of oxidation of urobilinogen, is responsible for the yellow colour of urine). The remainder travels down the digestive tract and is converted to <b>stercobilinogen.</b> This is oxidized to stercobilin, which is excreted and is responsible for the color of feces.|$|E
5000|$|Urobilinogen ( [...] D-{{urobilinogen}}) {{is closely}} related to two other compounds: mesobilirubinogen (a.k.a. I-urobilinogen) and <b>stercobilinogen</b> (a.k.a. L-urobilinogen). [...] Specifically, urobilinogen can be reduced to form mesobilirubinogen, and mesobilirubinogen can be further reduced to form <b>stercobilinogen.</b> Confusingly, however, all three of these compounds are frequently collectively referred to as [...] "urobilinogens".|$|E
50|$|Intestinal {{bacteria}} {{convert the}} conjugated bilirubin that is excreted by the bile duct into the intestine into urobilinogen and <b>stercobilinogen.</b> Part of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed in the intestine then circulated {{in the blood}} to the liver where it is excreted. A small part of this recirculated urobilinogen is filtered out by the kidneys and appears in urine (less than 1 mg/dl urine). The <b>stercobilinogen</b> can not be reabsorbed and remains in the intestine.|$|E
5000|$|In obstructive jaundice, no {{bilirubin}} {{reaches the}} small intestine, meaning {{that there is}} no formation of <b>stercobilinogen.</b> The lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored.|$|E
5000|$|The {{urobilinogen}} in the intestine {{is directly}} reduced to brown stercobilin, {{which gives the}} feces their characteristic color. It can also be reduced to <b>stercobilinogen,</b> which can then be further oxidized to stercobilin. This constitutes the normal [...] "enterohepatic urobilinogen cycle".|$|E
5000|$|The {{increase}} of stercobilin (urobilin) in the feces and urine {{is caused by}} the enhanced intracellular hemolysis of erythrocytes. Formed an unconjugated bilirubin entering the intestine, gives a large number of <b>stercobilinogen</b> (urobilinogen). Last absorbed into the blood and passes into the urine.|$|E
50|$|This {{conjugated}} bilirubin is excreted from the liver into the biliary and cystic ducts {{as part of}} bile. Intestinal bacteria convert the bilirubin into urobilinogen. From here urobilinogen can take two pathways. It can either be further converted into <b>stercobilinogen,</b> which is then oxidized to stercobilin and passed out in the feces, {{or it can be}} reabsorbed by the intestinal cells, transported in the blood to the kidneys, and passed out in the urine as the oxidised product urobilin. Stercobilin and urobilin are the products responsible for the coloration of feces and urine, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|First, at birth, the gut is sterile, {{and normal}} gut flora {{takes time to}} establish. The {{bacteria}} in the adult gut convert conjugated bilirubin to <b>stercobilinogen</b> which is then oxidized to stercobilin and excreted in the stool. In the absence of sufficient bacteria, the bilirubin is de-conjugated by brush border β-glucuronidase and reabsorbed. This process of re-absorption is called enterohepatic circulation. It {{has been suggested that}} bilirubin uptake in the gut (enterohepatic circulation) is increased in breast fed babies, possibly as the result of increased levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in breast milk. Breast milk also contains glucoronidase which will increase deconjugation and enterohepatic recirculation of bilirubin.|$|E
50|$|Stercobilin {{results from}} {{breakdown}} of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated {{with one or two}} glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile. In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum. This bilirubin is further converted to colorless urobilinogen. Urobilinogen that remains in the colon can either be reduced to <b>stercobilinogen</b> and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, heme {{degradation}} {{appears to}} be an evolutionarily-conserved response to oxidative stress. Briefly, when cells are exposed to free radicals, there is a rapid induction of the expression of the stress-responsive heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) isoenzyme that catabolizes heme (see below). The reason why cells must increase exponentially their capability to degrade heme in response to oxidative stress remains unclear but this {{appears to be}} part of a cytoprotective response that avoids the deleterious effects of free heme. When large amounts of free heme accumulates, the heme detoxification/degradation systems get overwhelmed, enabling heme to exert its damaging effects.In the second reaction, biliverdin is converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR):Bilirubin is transported into the liver by facilitated diffusion bound to a protein (serum albumin), where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to become more water-soluble. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. This form of bilirubin is excreted from the liver in bile. Excretion of bilirubin from liver to biliary canaliculi is an active, energy dependent and rate limiting process. The intestinal bacteria deconjugate bilirubin diglucuronide and convert bilirubin to urobilinogens. Some urobilinogen is absorbed by intestinal cells and transported into the kidneys and excreted with urine (urobilin, which is the product of oxidation of urobilinogen, is responsible for the yellow colour of urine). The remainder travels down the digestive tract and is converted to <b>stercobilinogen.</b> This is oxidized to stercobilin, which is excreted and is responsible for the color of feces.|$|E
40|$|The {{spectrophotometric}} {{studies were}} made on the coloured solutions prepared {{by the addition of}} the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent into the urobilinogen solution (<b>stercobilinogen)</b> prepared from urine and stool, the mesobilirubinogen solution prepared from crystalline bilirubin by a reduction with natrium amalgam, and their salt and mesobilinogen dimethylester etc. And the results are as follows. 1. Both the urobilinogen solution in which <b>stercobilinogen</b> is mainly included and the mesobilinogen solution coloured with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent, display the absorption maxima at 560 mμ and 490 mμ at the pH 4. 2. 2. When the hydrogen ion density of the above coloured solution becomes below 4. 0, the absorption maxima display at 558 mμ and 490 mμ or 492 mμ. Both of these absorption maxima are not moved by the change of pH. 3. In proportion as the pH of the coloured solution becomes high more than 42, the absorption maximum at 560 mμ shifts slightly to the short wave length and displays at 556 mμ or 554 mμ, but the absorption maximum at 490 mμ shifts to the long wave length in a relatively prominent degree and displays at 506 mμ or 510 mμ. As the pH of the coloured solution becomes showing a alkaline reaction, the absorption maximum at 560 mμ disappears and the absorption maximum at 490 mμ shows shifting to the opposite direction, the short wave length. 4. On the use of methanol, as a solvent, instead of water, both of them display the absorption maxima at 550 mμ and 490 mμ at the pH 5. 4. And no differences are observed, on the change of the pH, between the coloured substances of <b>stercobilinogen</b> and mesobilinogen with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent. 5. As for the absorption maximum of mesobilinogen is observed shifting to the long wave length for 1 or 3 mμ more than that of <b>stercobilinogen</b> under the acid-and weak acid condition of pH. 6. The coloured substances of the sodium-, potassium- and ammonium salts of urobilinogen with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent display the same absorption maxima by the change of the pH value, but the absorption maximum shifts to the short wave length for 2 mμ on the occasion of preparing the salts by adding several times of the computation dosis of caustic soda, caustic potash and ammonia more than on the occasion of preparing the salts by adding the computation dosis of them or the absorption maximum of the coloured substance of <b>stercobilinogen</b> itself with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent at the pH 1. 4 - 1. 0, and it displays at 556 mμ. 7. When the Ehrlich's aldehyde reaction is obtained immediately after the process being moved into caustic soda from the petroleum ether stratum on the preparation of <b>stercobilinogen</b> from stool, the absorption maximum displays only at 556 mμ at the pH 1. 6 without showing the absorption maximum around 490 mμ. Therefore, it is thought that the absorption maximum at 420 mμ is not coexisted with the absorption maximum around 560 mμ when the oxidation is prevented on the preparation of urobilinogen or during it's process, and that the absorption maximum of the coloured substance with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reaction displays only one around 560 mμ and the absorption maximum around 490 mμ belongs to that of the urobilin oxygenated from urobilinogen. 8. The coloured substance of mesobilinogen dimethylester with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent displays the absorption maxima at 550 mμ and 488 mμ at the pH 3. 8. 9. The attitude of mesobilinogen dimethylester to various solvents is markedly different from that of bilirubin dimethylester, and mesobilinogen dimethylester is more unstable to an oxidation than mesobilinogen...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{chromatography}} was attempted for {{the separation of}} <b>stercobilinogen,</b> predominating in urobilinogen of living body, and mesobilinogen, being supposed to partly exist in vivo, on the coloured substances of them {{by the addition of}} the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent, and the columnchromatography with the column of a cellulose powder was also attempted for the separation of the urobilin coexisting in the coloured substances of urobilinogen by the addition of the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent. And the results are as follows. 1. The coloured substance of urobilinogen and urobilin are definitely separated, but the separation between the coloured substances of <b>stercobilinogen</b> and mesobilinogen by the addition of the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent is impossible, by the {{paper chromatography}} with the developing solvents of a methanol and water mixture (1 : 2), a methanol, butanol and ammouia mixture (1 : 2 : 1), a 28 % amonia and butanol mixture (4 : 96), N-Ammonia-condensed butanol, 10 % Ammoniacondensed butanol, and a butanol, and a butanol, propanol and ammonia mixture (2 : 2 : 1) etc. 2. The coloured substances of <b>stercobilinogen</b> and mesobilinogen with the Ehrlich'c aldehyde reagent display the Rf 0, 81 and 0. 64 respectively and are definitely separated, {{on the use of the}} paper with the stationary phase made with glacial acetic acid and, with the developing solvents of a methanol, ammonia and water mixture (76 : 4 : 20) and a methanol, butanol and ammonia mixture (2 : 2 : 1). 3. The separation of stercobilin and urobilin IX α are easily obtained by the paper chromatography with the developing solvents of a methanol, ammonia and water mixture (76 : 4 : 20), and a methanol, butanol and ammonia mixture (2 : 2 : 1). 4. The coloured substances of urobilinogen with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent and urobilin in them can be separated by the column chromatography with the column of cellulose powder and the developing solvent of a methanol and water mixture (1 : 2). Therefore, as the absorption curve of the coloured substance with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent displays having only one absorption maximum at 558 mμ, it must he definitely distinguished from the urobilin which becomes coexisted during the process...|$|E
40|$|It {{seems to}} be a well {{established}} fact that bilirubin is reduced to urobilins by the intestinal microbial flora. (The term urobilins is used to mean the group of reduction products of bilirubin: the levorotatory stercobilin, the inactive urobilin, and the dextrorotatory dehydrourobilin, or their chromogens.) Researches upon this subject are reviewed by Lemberg and Legge (1), Watson (2, 3), and With (4). Very little is known, however, concerning the kind of microorganisms involved. Another problem is whether a production of urobilins also occurs outside the intestinal tract. Baumg~trtel (5) is of the opinion that urobilinogen is produced by liver enzymes, whereas <b>stercobilinogen</b> is formed by bacteria. Mter a survey of the experimental evidence Watson (3), however, stated "if the liver participates in urobilinogen formation, it must be to a very minor and unimportant extent and that in general the intestinal origin of the urobilinogen group {{is by far the most}} significant. " If an extraintestinal formation of urobilin occurs urobilin must be formed also in germ_free animals. The excretion of bilirubin and urobilin have therefor...|$|E
40|$|The mesobiliviolin {{reaction}} and the intermediate products of bilirubin were observed on the B-bile, with the positive Ehrlich's aldehyde reaction, odtained from 20 cases of cholecystopathy, {{and the results}} were as follows. 1. After mesobiliviolin reaction on 19 cases the chloroform extract was separated into each pigment by column chromatography, and the absorption curves of each pigment and their changes on the addition of a saturated alcoholic solution of zine acetate were observed. 2. The question whether or not stercoblinogen occupies the position superior to mesobilinogen {{can be explained by the}} intensity of bile duct infection, especially the infection by B. coli, or by the intensity of the inflammation findings of bile duct. 3. From the 4 cases treated with antibiotics <b>stercobilinogen</b> could not be detected but only mesobilinogen, suggesting that antibiotics reduce the chemical activity of bacteria. 4. In 4 cases bilirubin and mesobilirubin could be detected and also a pigment that apears to be dihydromesobilirubin. From these results it bas been clarified that the in vivo reduction of bilirubin to urobilinogen is not conducted by liver enzymes but by bacterial enzymes. 5. On 2 cases the detection of d-urobilin was attempted by means of polarimeter and dioxan-HCl boiling method, but the existence of this pigment could not be observed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a report}} on three cases of acute {{haemolytic}} disease in glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficient workers exposed to trinitroluene (TNT). The courses of the haemolytic crises have several features in common, the most striking being {{the onset of the}} disease within two to four days after the start of exposure, and the fact that this has been the first and so far the only haemolytic episode in their lives in spite of detailed medical records of past diseases, injuries, and medications during 12 to 16 years preceding the haemolytic crisis and five to nine years following the disease. The lowest haemoglobin levels for the three patients were 4 - 0, 6 - 8, and 8 - 2 g/dl respectively; haematocrit values were 17 and 24 %; reticulocytes rose in case 1 to 26 - 2 %, in case 2 to 26 %, and in case 3 to 10 %. Indirect bilirubinaemia was increased in two patients (5 - 1 and 2 - 6 mg/ 100 ml) and <b>stercobilinogen</b> was as high as 2150 mg/ 24 hr in one patient. The presence of the metabolite monoamino 2 - 6 dinitrotoluene was proved in the urine of case 3 and reached 21 gamma%. The possibility of a dose-response relationship is briefly discussed and the risk of exposing G 6 PD individuals in chemical processes is mentioned...|$|E
