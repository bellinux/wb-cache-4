Behavior of finite gold nanosheets containing 57 and 73 atoms under load are investigated modeled by many-body Gupta potential.

The accessibility of these structures and their <b>stability</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> are found to be the key factors governing the morphological evolution of the gold nanosheets.

30|$|The {{combined}} {{movement of}} the medial and the lateral compartment finally equates to external rotation of the tibia with extension and internal tibial rotation with flexion of the knee joint. The axis of external and internal rotation, which is primarily determined by the geometry of the articulating surfaces, generally passes through the medial intercondylar tubercle of the tibial plateau [11]. Due to the incongruency in the radius of the medial and lateral condyle, the total range of tibial rotation depends upon the degree of knee flexion and sharply decreases near extension. Although surface geometry {{has been identified as}} a major guide of femorotibial joint motion, the complex kinematics of the knee <b>under</b> physiological <b>loading</b> in vivo have yet to be completely investigated. It appears to be obvious that the constraints provided by the femorotibial joint surface are insufficient for functional knee stability, though a combination of resisting structures such as the menisci, the joint capsule, the muscles, and the intra- and extraarticular ligaments account for both functional range of motion and joint <b>stability</b> <b>under</b> <b>loading</b> conditions.|$|R

Proximal humerus interlocking osteosyntheses that maintain angular <b>stability</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> have been proposed {{as an alternative to}} hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of three- and four-part proximal humeral fractures. Materials and Methods: The records showed 50 patients, {{with a mean age of}} 57. 5 years. The Neer three-part proximal humeral fractures were 18 in number, and the four-part proximal humeral fractures were 32. All the patients were treated surgically between January 2008 and December 2010. All patients had a radiographic and clinical follow-up performed at one, three, and six months and at one year. The clinical outcomes were measured with the use of the Constant-Murley system. This study was based on level 1 of the evidence. Results: The mean Constant score (and standard deviation) at the time of the final follow-up was better in the locked-plate group. The mean Constant score was 80 (range, 40 - 100). Complications with this fixation included osteonecrosis in one patient, malunion in one patient, Axillary nerve palsy in one patient, and impingement syndrome in one patient. Conclusions: The most important factor for a favorable outcome in three- and four-part fractures in the proximal end humerus gives an accurate anatomical reduction, which is achieved by locking plate osteosynthesis, with multiplanar screws. It is a safe and effective method, with minimal tissue damage, higher primary stability, and load transfer through the implant, which are important to avoid complications.

Methods Eighteen healthy adults (6 women and 12 men), aged 20 to 39 years, participated in this study. They undertook 2 sessions in which they had to perform a standardized cervical flexion/extension movement in 3 phases: complete cervical flexion; the static period in complete cervical flexion; and extension with return to the initial position. Two different rhythm conditions and 3 different loading conditions were applied to assess load and speed effects. Kinematic and EMG data were collected, and dependent variables included angles corresponding to the onset and cessation of myoelectric silence as well as the root mean square (RMS) values of EMG signals.
