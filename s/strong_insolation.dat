500|$|Kepler-11b is {{estimated}} to be ≤3.3 Earth masses and 1.8 Earth radii, making it around three times (or less) as massive and nearly twice as large as Earth. While the radius of Kepler-11b is fairly well known (with a range of likely radii between 1.75 and 1.83 Earth radii), the mass is not as well constrained, with a range between 0.9 and 3.3 Earth masses. The mass is determined using transit timing variations of Kepler-11c, and is limited by the quality of the data. [...] Kepler-11b is the closest planet to its host star in the Kepler-11 planetary system. With an estimated density of 1.7 g/cm3, comparable to Neptune's, Kepler-11b is denser than the solar system's gas giants but significantly less dense than the terrestrial planets. The estimated density range suggests that it is not of Earth-like composition, yet it is nonetheless composed mostly of elements heavier than helium. The planet's effective temperature is 900 K, and is thus the hottest of the planets discovered in the Kepler-11 system. Kepler-11b orbits its host star every 10.30375 days at a distance of [...]091 AU. Planet Mercury, in comparison, orbits the Sun every 87.97 days from a distance of [...]387 AU. Kepler-11b's inclination of 88.5° means that it deviates slightly from the orbital plane, but it does so more than the other five planets with which Kepler-11b was discovered. [...] Its close proximity to the star implies a <b>strong</b> <b>insolation,</b> which caused the planet to lose all of light-element envelope acquired during formation. [...] The observed low density does require the presence of a gaseous envelope though, which was most likely produced via outgassing of hydrogen or evaporation of H2O from the condensed core.|$|E

The angular momentum balance and energy balance are examined to understand the mechanisms that produce this result.

Using selected samples, we measured physical properties including (i) the relative dielectric permittivities in both the vertical and horizontal planes, (ii) the bulk density at a resolution of millimeters, (iii) the three-dimensional geometric structure of pore space, and (iv) crystal orientation fabrics. We found that the firn at Dome Fuji contains horizontal strata with thicknesses of several centimeters. Near the surface of the ice sheet, these strata are characterized by contrasting bulk density. Earlier field studies suggest that summer insolation causes densification of surface firn. Down to ～ 30 m, density maxima exhibited a clear positive correlation with the strength of structural anisotropy and c-axis clustering around the vertical. In contrast, the correlation is negative in deeper firn, confirming previous findings that initially less dense firn became denser than initially dense firn. In addition, numerous examples of textures indicating that deformation preferentially occurred in weaker layers were found. Moreover, the initially dense firn layers were more permeable for air near the bottom of firn. We propose a model linking firn properties with conditions for the gas transport processes near the bottom of firn. The model explains how <b>stronger</b> <b>insolation</b> can lead to bulk ice with a lower O 2 /N 2 ratio and smaller total gas content...|$|R

Resolving long-term changes {{in the flow of}} the KC water masses is, therefore, crucial for advancing our understanding of the Pacific's role in global ocean and climate variability. Here, we reconstruct changes in ICC dynamics over the past 20 ka based on grain-size spectra, clay mineral, and Sr-Nd isotope constraints of sediments from the northern Okinawa Trough. Combined with published sediment records surrounding the NPG, we suggest that the KC remained in the Okinawa Trough throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Together with Earth-System-Model simulations, our results additionally indicate that ICC intensified considerably during the early Holocene (EH). The synchronous establishment of the ICC "water barrier" and the modern circulation pattern during the EH highstand shaped the sediment transport patterns. This is ascribed to the precession-induced increase in the occurrence of La Nina-like state and the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. The synchronicity of the shifts in the intensity of the KC, Kuroshio extension, and El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability may further indicate that the western {{branch of the}} NPG has been subject to basin-scale changes in wind stress curl over the North Pacific in response to low-latitude insolation.

There is a marked southwest-northeast rainfall gradient with the driest conditions (200 - 500 mm per year) along the southwestern Andes, and the wettest conditions along the eastern slopes (>1000 mm per year). Upon the interaction between the topography and the mean flow, some regions immediately east of the Andes can receive as much as 10000 mm per year. Rainfall is also larger over mountain ranges than over valley floors, since most of the rainfall occurs in the form of afternoon convective storms. Lakes also modulate the distribution and rainfall amounts. Lake Titicaca, for example, induces nocturnal convective storms that produce twice as much rainfall over the lake than over the surrounding terrain. Occasionally thunderstorms can be accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning, strong winds and damaging hail, especially during the onset of the rainy season and over higher elevations.

40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of ocean–atmosphere–cryosphere interactions at ice-age terminations relies largely on {{assessments of the}} most recent (last) glacial–interglacial transition 1, 2, 3, Termination I (T-I). But the extent to which T-I is representative of previous terminations remains unclear. Testing the consistency of termination processes requires comparison of time series of critical climate parameters with detailed absolute and relative age control. However, such age control has been lacking for even the penultimate glacial termination (T-II), which culminated in a sea-level highstand during the last interglacial period that was several metres above present 4. Here we show that Heinrich Stadial 11 (HS 11), a prominent North Atlantic cold episode 5, 6, occurred between 135 ± 1 and 130 ± 2 thousand years ago and was linked with rapid sea-level rise during T-II. Our conclusions are based on new and existing 6, 7, 8, 9 data for T-II and the last interglacial that we collate onto a single, radiometrically constrained chronology. The HS 11 cold episode 5, 6 punctuated T-II and coincided directly with a major deglacial meltwater pulse, which predominantly entered the North Atlantic Ocean and accounted for about 70 per cent of the glacial–interglacial sea-level rise 8, 9. We conclude that, possibly in response to <b>stronger</b> <b>insolation</b> and CO 2 forcing earlier in T-II, the relationship between climate and ice-volume changes differed fundamentally from that of T-I. In T-I, the major sea-level rise clearly post-dates 3, 10, 11 Heinrich Stadial 1. We also find that HS 11 coincided with sustained Antarctic warming, probably through a bipolar seesaw temperature response 12, and propose that this heat gain at high southern latitudes promoted Antarctic ice-sheet melting that fuelled the last interglacial sea-level peak...|$|R

Abstract The Kuroshio Current (KC) is the northward branch of the North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPG) and exerts influence on the exchange of physical, chemical, and biological properties of downstream regions in the Pacific Ocean. Resolving long-term changes in the flow of the KC water masses is, therefore, crucial for advancing our understanding of the Pacific's role in global ocean and climate variability. Here, we reconstruct changes in KC dynamics over the past 20 ka based on grain-size spectra, clay mineral, and Sr–Nd isotope constraints of sediments from the northern Okinawa Trough. Combined with published sediment records surrounding the NPG, we suggest that the KC remained in the Okinawa Trough throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Together with Earth-System-Model simulations, our results additionally indicate that KC intensified considerably during the early Holocene (EH). The synchronous establishment of the KC “water barrier” and the modern circulation pattern during the EH highstand shaped the sediment transport patterns. This is ascribed to the precession-induced increase in the occurrence of La Niña-like state and the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. The synchronicity of the shifts in the intensity of the KC, Kuroshio extension, and El Niño/La Niña-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability may further indicate that the western branch of the NPG has been subject to basin-scale changes in wind stress curl over the North Pacific in response to low-latitude insolation.

For our reconstruction, we employed a uniform high-resolution, AMS 14 C-calibrated d 18 O-chronology, converted to a calendar timescale, and the new SIMMAX-Transfer-Technique in the Atlantic Oceans (Pflaumann et al. in press). The short-term SST fluctuations during the last 30, 000 years are {{not directly related to}} the relatively slow changes in insolation during this period, reaching maximum seasonal deviations from modern values at approximaterly 11, 000 years B. P. Although seasonal changes in solar radiation must have triggered global warming to the modern, interglacial mode, there is little evidence for linear warming and heat transport by ocean currents. The SIMMAX-temperature estimates indicate an early and rapid warming in the Equatorial Atlantic, {{as well as in the}} eastern North Atlantic, where modern SSTs were reached for a short time between 20, 000 to 16, 000 kalendar-years B. P. On a core transect crossing the Island-Faroer Ridge, the history of high-latitude warming along the eastern margins of the big North Atlantic gyres was reconstructed. Prior to the Younger Dryas cold interval (12, 000 kalendar years), SSTs of the Norwegian Greenland Sea were still at glacial levels. After the Younger Dryas, there was a rapid inflow of warm Atlantic surface waters into the Norwegian-Greenland basins. In the northern Indian Ocean, the SST-patterns were totally different from the Atlantic during the last 20, 000 years. Temperature variations did not exeed 2 - 3 °C in the open ocean. During the Last Glacial Maximum (18, 000 years B. P.), temperatures were higher than today whereas they were lowest during the early Holocene. This was caused by changes in the monsoon-induced oceanic upwelling intensity. At this time trade winds off Northwest Africa were also stronger, related to the stronger seasonal constrasts in insolation. Perhaps, the atmospheric circulation was generally enhanced at 10, 000 years B. P. High-resolution SST-records from the southern Ocean (Pichon et al. 1992) indicate a slight asymmetry between the two Hemispheres. At 10, 000 years B. P, SSTs were 1 - 2 °C higher than today in the southern Indian Ocean. At the same time, somewhat colder SSTs imply still cool, boreal conditions in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Although SSTs of both seasons are only little different from the modern patterns, differences in the direction and strength of the major ocean currents are indicated by internally consistent positive and negative temperature anomaly fields. They were found in both, in the lower and in the high latitudes. The distribution of the anomalies in the North Atlantic further suggests, that the remnants of the ice shields still had a strong impact on the SST distribution. The particulary <b>stronger</b> <b>insolation</b> in the high northern latitudes during summers had nearly no influence.

However, CoRoT- 7 b's semi-major axis (0. 0172 AU) suggests the planet has a history unlike the planets in our solar system. The <b>strong</b> stellar <b>insolation</b> received by CoRoT- 7 b can quickly drive off an atmosphere and may have evaporated a few Earth masses of rocky material during the planet's lifetime. Such rapid mass loss even suggests that CoRoT- 7 b may be the remnant core of a hot Jupiter whose gaseous envelope was completely evaporated. Also important are tides, which have drawn the planet in from a more distant, and possibly eccentric, orbit. As the planet neared its host star, the rate of mass loss probably increased dramatically, but mass loss slows tidal migration, resulting in a complex interplay between tides and mass loss. We combine tidal evolution and mass loss models to constrain the range of original orbits and masses of CoRoT- 7 b and find, indeed, that CoRoT- 7 b may once have been a gas giant planet. We discuss the plausible evolutionary pathways that allow CoRoT- 7 b to have begun life as a gas giant. Our results suggest that similar processes may have influenced many other close-in exoplanets as well.

A stronger seasonal cycle is simulated by the model, which shows a relatively homogeneous winter cooling and a summer warming with well-defined spatial patterns, in particular, a subsurface warming in the Cretan and western Levantine areas. The comparison between the SST simulated for the HIM and a reconstruction from planktonic foraminifera transfer functions shows a poor agreement, especially for summer, when the vertical temperature gradient is strong. As a novel approach, we propose a reinterpretation of the reconstruction, to consider the conditions throughout the upper water column rather than at a single depth. We claim that such a depth-integrated approach is more adequate for surface temperature comparison purposes in a situation where the upper ocean structure in the past was different from the present-day. In this case, the depth-integrated interpretation of the proxy data strongly improves the agreement between modelled and reconstructed temperature signal with the subsurface summer warming being recorded by both model and proxies, with a small shift to the south in the model results. The mechanisms responsible for the peculiar subsurface pattern are found to be a combination of enhanced downwelling and wind mixing due to strengthened Etesian winds, and enhanced thermal forcing due to the <b>stronger</b> summer <b>insolation</b> in the Northern Hemisphere. Together, these processes induce a stronger heat transfer from the surface to the subsurface during late summer in the western Levantine; this leads to an enhanced heat piracy in this region, a process never identified before, but potentially characteristic of time slices with enhanced insolation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{behavior}} of different parameterizations of mixed layer physics {{when used in}} an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) having coarse resolution of the upper ocean is examined. The method of parameterization {{is expected to have}} an important effect on the resulting sea surface temperature, and hence affect the model's overall fidelity from the viewpoint of air-sea interaction. Tests of three possible parameterizations differ {{in the manner in which}} the mixed layer depth is determined: predetermination, diagnostic determination, or prognostic determination. The sea surface temperature is taken to be equivalent to the top OGCM layer temperature in the first two methods, while it is found prognostically in the third method. Results show that for typical forcing cases such as <b>strong</b> <b>insolation,</b> weak surface cooling or weak winds, mixing is insufficient to cause heat transfer between the top two OGCM layers, which occupy the uppermost 500 m of the model. The predetermined and diagnostically determined mixed layer depth parameterizations reduce to a diffusive mixing parameterization, while the prognostic approach satisfactorily models mixed layer depths for all forcing cases. The prognostic method also agrees most closely with the results of a mixed layer model and with observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{climate of}} the Marine Isotopic Stage 13 (MIS- 13) is {{explored}} in the fully coupled atmosphere– ocean general circulation model the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM 3). It is found that the <b>strong</b> <b>insolation</b> forcing at the time imposed a strengthened land–ocean thermal contrast, resulting in an intensified summer monsoon over Asia. The addition of land ice over North America and Eurasia results in a stationary wave feature across the Eurasian continent. This leads to a high pressure anomaly over the Sea of Japan with increased advection of warm moist air onto the Chinese landmasses. This in turn reinforces the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), highlighting the counterintuitive notion that, depending on the background insolation and its size, ice can indeed contribute to strengthening the EASM. The modeling results support the geological record indication of a strong EASM 500 000 years ago. Furthermore, Arctic Oscillation, El Ni~no–Southern Oscillation, and Indian Ocean dipole–like tele-connection features {{are discussed in the}} MIS- 13 environment. It is shown that the change in the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature has the potential to impact the North Atlantic climate through an at-mospheric ‘‘bridge. ’’ 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{semiarid}} {{is characterized}} for presenting precipitations concentrated in {{short period of}} time, form that {{to most of the}} year the ground are displayed the <b>strong</b> <b>insolation</b> and to the raised hídrico deficit. On the other hand, the estacional variation of the climate affects the water content of the ground and as consequence the biological activity and the losses of C, mineral N and C-CO 2. The purpose of this research was to analyze the losses of C, mineral N and C-CO 2 of the ground in a microbasin, that passes for a process of environmental degradation, located in the Fazenda Experimental Bacia Escola/CCA/UFPB in São João do Cariri - PB, during the period of a translation, of the years of 2003 and 2004. It was defined a toposequence and chosen points of determination for the evaluation of the reserves of carbon, mineral nitrogen and microbic activity by means of the C-CO 2 production. The biggest amounts of C had been verified in the areas of pediment and the minors in the area of side slopes; The amounts of mineral N was not influenced by the position of the ground in the toposeqüência; The biggest liberation of C-CO 2 happened in the areas of pediment followed by the flood plain and half hillside, places with the biggest amount of of water in the soil...|$|E
40|$|During Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) - 13, an interglacial about 500 000 years ago, the East Asian {{summer monsoon}} (EASM) was {{suggested}} exceptionally strong by different proxies in China. However, MIS- 13 is a weak interglacial in marine oxygen isotope records and has relatively low CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations {{compared to other}} interglacials of the last 800 000 years. In the meantime, the sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions {{have shown that the}} warm pool was relatively warm during MIS- 13. Based on climate modeling experiments, this study aims at investigating whether a warmer Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) can explain the exceptionally strong EASM occurring during the relatively cool interglacial MIS- 13. The relative contributions of insolation and of the IPWP SST as well as their synergism are quantified through experiments with the Hadley Centre atmosphere model, HadAM 3, and using the factor separation technique. The SST of the IPWP has been increased based on geological reconstructions. Our results show that the pure impact of a <b>strong</b> summer <b>insolation</b> contributes to strengthen significantly the summer precipitation in northern China but only little in southern China. The pure impact of enhanced IPWP SST reduces, slightly, the summer precipitation in both northern and southern China. However, the synergism between insolation and enhanced IPWP SST contributes to a large increase of summer precipitation in southern China but to a slight decrease in northern China. Therefore, the ultimate role of enhanced IPWP SST is to reinforce the impact of insolation in southern China but reduce its impact in northern China. We conclude that a warmer IPWP helps to explain the strong MIS- 13 EASM precipitation in southern China as recorded in proxy data, but another explanation is needed for northern China...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} of the Kathmandu valley has been investigated by measuring broad-band l ght scattering coefficient and light extinction coefficient. The values of scattering coefficients measured in winter season were found high {{in the morning and}} subsequently steadily decreasing values with a minimum in the late afternoon. This type of variation of the scattering coefficients is attributed to the increase in the mixing layer height during daytime due to <b>strong</b> solar <b>insolation,</b> which allows an increasing dilution of suspended particulate matter. The values of scattering coefficients lie in between 0. 10 ± 0. 016 km- 1, to. 78 ±. 24 km- 1, which indicate heavy pollution. Spatial variation of light extinction coefficient measured by Telephotometer show that visibilities have lower values in the direction of brick kilns, high population density and high traffic density. High volume air sampling of suspended particulates show that there is a distinct seasonal variation of Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) and particulate matter of 10 micron or less in diameter (PM 10) concentrations. The particulate concentrations are higher in the dry season than the rainy season. The PM 10 concentrations measured in the dry season at low traffic area lie in between 54 to 118 µg/m 3 whereas in the rainy season those were 33. 2 to 114. 1 µg/m 3. The annual mean concentrations of TSP and PM 10 measured at high traffic area were 1378. 3 ± 433. 2 µg/m 3 and 261. 4 ± 28. 5 µg/m 3. The suspended particulate matters in the Kathmandu Valley are mostly coarse particle with the diameter greater than 10 µm. In the high traffic areas these particles comprises 80 % of the TSP. This is due to resusp nsion of dust particles from the road...|$|R
40|$|The warmest millennia of {{at least}} the past 250, 000 years {{occurred}} during the Last Interglaciation, when global ice volumes were similar to or smaller than today and systematic variations in Earth’s orbital parameters aligned to produce a <b>strong</b> positive summer <b>insolation</b> anomaly throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The average insolation during the key summer months (M, J, J) was ca 11 % above present across the Northern Hemisphere between 130, 000 and 127, 000 years ago, with a slightly greater anomaly, 13 %, over the Arctic. Greater summer insolation, early penultimate deglaciation, and intensification of the North Atlantic Drift, combined to reduce Arctic Ocean sea ice, allow expansion of boreal forest to the Arctic Ocean shore across vast regions, reduce permafrost, and melt almost all glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere. Insolation, amplified by key boundary condition feedbacks, collectively produced Last Interglacial summer temperature anomalies 4 – 5 1 C above present over most Arctic lands, significantly above the average Northern Hemisphere anomaly. The Last Interglaciation demonstrates the strength of positive feedbacks on Arctic warming and provides a potentially conservative analogue for anticipated future greenhouse warming...|$|R
