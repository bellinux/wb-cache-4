The main challenges for the CSEECBs going forward involve needed improvements in data reliability, consideration of quantitative microprudential indicators in macroprudential stress tests, explicit incorporation of dynamics in stress tests to include reaction functions of banks and macroprudential policy, institutionalization of macroprudential policy responses to alarming stress-test results, use of the top-down and bottom-up stress test results in <b>supervisory</b> communication, <b>cooperation</b> of macroprudential and microprudential supervision, and information exchange for better cross-border supervision of international banking groups.

40|$|The post-crisis {{financial}} services regulatory overhaul, and, particularly, {{the creation of}} the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) and the Banking Union mechanisms, has increased the complexity of the EU’s financial supervisory architecture. In this new system, financial supervision is carried out by a network of interconnected financial supervisors, with different mandates and subject to various accountability structures, operating at both the Member State and EU levels and bound by a regime of cooperation duties. An efficient cooperation among and within the various levels of this complex supervisory architecture is critical for the good functioning of the EU’s financial system. This paper identifies and analyses key <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> challenges in the single market for {{financial services}}, and assesses whether the EU legal and regulatory frameworks effectively address them. The paper argues that, despite the advancement of EU financial services integration and supervisory convergence that the post-crisis regulatory overhaul has brought, there are important legal and regulatory obstacles to an efficient <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the EU; these source, primarily, from the following: first, the lack of clarity and precision of the EU’s regime on <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> duties; secondly, the limited applicability of the ESFS’s mediation mechanisms to <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> disputes; and, thirdly, the tensions between transnational mandates of financial supervision and national accountability structures and mandates.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{triggered}} by a perceived loss of control of governments over societal developments, due to globalization and technological developments, which inhibit the effective protection of essential values in democratic societies. Privacy and data protection are essential values in democratic societies, which {{are subject to the}} rule of law. The EU Treaties have granted the Union a widely formulated role in ensuring effective protection of these fundamental rights of the individual, by means of judicial review, legislation and supervision by independent authorities. Hence, the imperative of protection is laid down at the constitutional level, empowering the Union to play its role as constitutional guardian of these two fundamental rights. More precisely, Article 16 TFEU, read in connection with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the Union, lays down the tasks of the EU in relation to privacy and data protection as fundamental rights for individuals. The mandate under Article 16 TFEU is broadly formulated and gives the Union - in principle - the power to act, and make a difference. This is a subject where the EU can act successfully, by addressing a problem with a global scale and which is technologically difficult.

40|$|A {{variety of}} factors led or contributed to the current {{financial}} crisis, including loose monetary policy; excessive financial market liquidity, leverage and maturity mismatch; weak risk management and underwriting standards; and poor incentives and regulatory gaps in some important segments of the fi nancial system. These weaknesses were amplified by certain procyclical dynamics in regulatory, accounting and risk management frameworks. The banking sector was at {{the centre of the}} crisis as the market stress led to an acute re-concentration of on- and off-balance sheet risks in banks, putting pressure on capital buffers, liquidity and credit availability. The weaknesses in the banking sector amplified the transmission of shocks from the financial sector to the real economy. Strengthening the banking sector and how it is managed and regulated is critical to a return to both nearand long-term financial stability. The Basel Committee’s programme to promote a more robust supervisory and regulatory framework for the banking sector has five key components: strengthening the regulatory capital framework; increasing banks’ liquidity buffers; enhancing bank governance, risk management and supervision; improving market transparency; and deepening cross-border <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> for internationally active banks. Taken together, and reinforced through a macroprudential approach to regulation and supervision, these efforts will promote a banking sector that is more resilient to future periods of economic and financial stress and help reduce systemic risk. ...|$|E

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has uncovered {{a number of}} weaknesses in the supervision and regulation of cross border banks. One such weakness {{was the lack of}} effective cooperation among banking supervisors. Since then, international bodies, such as the G- 20, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee have actively promoted the use of supervisory colleges. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the obstacles to effective cross border supervisory information sharing. More specifically, a schematic presentation illustrating the misalignments in incentives for information sharing between home and host supervisors under the current supervisory task-sharing anchored in the Basel Concordat is developed. This paper finds that in the absence of an ex ante agreed upon resolution and burden-sharing mechanism and deteriorating health of the bank, incentive conflicts escalate and <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> breaks down. The promotion of good practices for cooperation in supervisory colleges is thus not sufficient to address the existing incentive conflicts. What is needed is a rigorous analysis and review of the supervisory task-sharing framework, so that the right incentives are secured during all stages of the supervisory process. For this purpose, it is essential that policy makers integrate and harmonize the current debates on crisis management, resolution policy and good supervisory practices for cross border banking supervision.

40|$|Cross-border banking {{services}} by African banks within Africa {{have been on}} the rise since the last decade. As these services are provided predominantly by complex financial institutions and involve operating within a number of African financial systems, effective regulation of such entities can be challenging. The challenges are two-fold: regulating complex financial institutions on a consolidated basis and achieving effective <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation</b> between home and host country regulators of these banking entities, which is critical given the cross-border nature of the services they provide. Regulation is particularly significant due to the linkages of all financial systems involved in the operation of cross-border {{banking services}} and also the ease and speed with which a crisis can spread from one jurisdiction to another - as the last global financial crisis revealed. This chapter, as such, assesses the legal and regulatory challenges inherent in the delivery of cross-border services by African banks within Africa and proposes solutions for making the operation of such services safer. Section one considers the reasons for the rise of African cross-border banks and their effect on African banking systems. Section two considers the legal and regulatory challenges inherent in their operations.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999, the debate on the financial stability architecture in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and {{the introduction}} of the Lamfalussy process for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation.</b> In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard cross-border financial stability. In this context, the financial crisis {{has proved to be a}} major challenge to the ongoing process of European financial integration. In particular, momentous events such as the freezing of interbank markets, the loss of confidence in financial institutions, runs on banks and difficulties affecting cross-border financial groups, questioned the ability of the EU financial stability architecture to contain threats to the integrated single financial market. In particular, the crisis has demonstrated the importance of coupling to micro-prudential supervision a macro dimension aimed at a broad and effective monitoring and assessment of the potential risks covering all components of the financial system. In Europe, following the de Larosière Report, the European Commission has put forward proposals for establishing a European System of Financial Supervision and a European Systemic Risk Board, the latter body to be set up under the auspices of the ECB.

40|$|PhDDevelopments in the {{investment}} securities markets have {{played an important}} role in the growth and globalization of the worldâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s financial markets. Securities market participants, investment banks and hedges funds in particular, were also in the epicentre of the global financial crisis 2007 2010 (GFC). The globalization-to-crisis process has highlighted the problems of regulating the globalizing transnational securities markets on the basis of national laws alone. More precisely, the three global-level problems in securities regulation are: regulatory divergence and conflicts, gaps in cross-border supervision, and, spill-over of systemic risks. This thesis contributes to the post-GFC regulatory reforms debate by establishing the concept of a Global Regulatory Framework (GRF). The GRF consists of a flexible governance structure within which national regulators and policy makers may interact with counterparts, either directly or through regional and global bodies, in seeking to address cross-border or substantive issues of securities regulation. The GRF also comprises a framework of tools for regulatory and <b>supervisory</b> <b>cooperation,</b> using which solutions could be reached for the global-level problems. The GRF is essentially soft law by nature. As a result, while the structure and mechanisms provided by the GRF contribute to securities market efficiency and stability, national sovereignty is also duly upheld. The problems of implementation and legitimacy pertaining to soft law processes are addressed, with recommendations for an implementation structure and principles of ex ante participation and transparency developed. The thesis comprises three Parts, with two Chapters in each, followed by a seventh Chapter of overall Conclusions. Starting from the analysis of the three global-level regulatory problems in the fast globalizing securities markets, the thesis builds on the experience from the EU and US, and other global actors, including the IMF, FSB and IOSCO, to produce a multi-layered structure for the governance of the securities markets. The GRF is designed to accommodate and engender different functions and forms of collective actions, because flexibility is crucial for addressing new cross-border issues arising from the often turbulent transnational securities markets...|$|E
