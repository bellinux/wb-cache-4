From December 2014 to March 2015, 239 infants were born at the AH. The number of eligible infants was 200 and they were equally assigned to either case group (dry cord care) or control group (70 % alcohol, standard procedure). <b>Standard</b> <b>cord</b> care consisted in 1 application of 70 % alcohol at birth followed by other 2 times a day, while experimental dry cord care procedure was executed by the only application of a sterile gauze around the base of the UC at the 1 st day of life and after the cord has been exposed to air off the diaper edge. The time to UC separation and any AEs such as local and systemic infections, hemorrhage, and granuloma formation were reported by mothers. We found a significant difference in the mean cord separation time between the 2 groups (dry cord care: 10. 1 days [standard deviation, SD= 4. 0] vs 70 % alcohol: 12. 0 days [SD= 4. 2]; P < 0. 001), while no significant AEs resulted. Incidence rate of granuloma was 0. 67 × 1000 days of life in dry cord care group.

Methods: Thirty rats were used, with age varying between 20 and 25 weeks, and weight ranging from 200 to 300 g for females, and from 232 to 430 g for males. The impacts were done with weights of 10 g starting from 12. 5, 25 and 50 mm of height, and the impact speed and compression coefficient were obtained. The impact occurred {{on the surface of}} the spinal cord at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra after laminectomy.

40|$|As {{a baby is}} born, the {{umbilical}} cord is cut and clamped, then it dries up and detaches. During the course of cord detachment and before the wound completely heals up, umbilical cord care is essential for preventing any local infection, which may lead to septicemia or infection of other organs. However, the yellowish and blood-stained discharge {{from the base of}} the cord and the appearance of the cord stump often causes anxiety among parents and make them hesitant to provide cord care. Hence, healthcare professionals are responsible for explaining the importance of proper cord care and provide consistent information on the course of cord detachment. This will decrease parental anxiety or the cord-related issues and improve compliance. Currently, different solutions are being used at different healthcare facilities. This leads to confusion among healthcare professionals and parents. Moreover, as evidenced in many studies, different solutions can affect {{the umbilical}} cord detachment time and prolongation of umbilical cord separation time, which can cause immense anxiety among the parents. Hence, a solution that is effective in reducing the umbilical cord separation time can help to alleviate parental anxiety. Dry care, such as using cold boiled water to clean the cord, is suggested to be suitable for umbilical cord care as it shortens the umbilical cord separation time compares to alcohol, which is still being used in many healthcare facilities. Therefore, this proposed innovation attempts to promote dry care as the <b>standard</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> care practice, to shorten the umbilical cord separation time, which in turn, decreases parental anxiety and the workload related to cord care for the healthcare professionals. The implementation of dry care was explored and it was found that this innovation is cost-effective and has a high transferability and feasibility in the current setting of Hong Kong Maternal and Child Health Clinics. An evidence-based practice guideline was developed and would be launched initially on a trial basis at one of the Maternal and Child Health Clinics after a well-developed communication and implementation plan is established.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} whether the ice water test (IWT) {{should be performed}} {{before or after the}} standard urodynamic investigation (UDI). PATIENTS AND METHODS Two cohorts of patients suffering from neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) due to spinal cord injury (SCI) were matched by lesion level and age. The patients of cohort A (n= 55, retrospective cohort) underwent the IWT before and the patients of cohort B (n= 110, prospective cohort) after standard UDI. The IWT effect on urodynamic parameters has been compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples. UDI was performed according to good urodynamic practices recommended by the International Continence Society. RESULTS The mean age of both cohorts was 49 years. Performing the IWT before versus after standard UDI resulted in a significantly lower maximum cystometric bladder capacity (P= 0. 01), lower incidence of detrusor overactivity (P= 0. 017) and lower maximum detrusor pressure during IWT (P= 0. 04). All other urodynamic parameters assessed demonstrated no significant difference (P> 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS Our results are in line with findings from animal studies demonstrating a bladder cooling-induced gating effect on the micturition reflex volume threshold on the level of sacral interneurons. Since the IWT is an unphysiological investigation that might significantly bias subsequent urodynamics, we suggest that the IWT should not precede more physiological <b>standard</b> UDI.

We aimed to assess the effect of umbilical-cord cleansing with 4 % chlorhexidine (CHX) solution, with or without handwashing with antiseptic soap, on the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality. Methods: We did a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomised trial in Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan. Clusters were defined as the population covered by a functional traditional birth attendant (TBA), and were randomly allocated to one of four groups (groups A to D) with a computer-generated random number sequence. Implementation and data collection teams were masked to allocation. Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received birth kits were eligible for enrolment in the study. One intervention comprised birth kits containing 4 % CHX solution for application to the cord at birth by TBAs and once daily by family members for up to 14 days along with soap and educational messages promoting hand washing. One intervention was CHX solution only and another was handwashing only. <b>Standard</b> dry <b>cord</b> care was promoted in the control group. The primary outcomes were incidence of neonatal omphalitis and neonatal mortality. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00682006. Findings: 187 clusters were randomly allocated to one of the four study groups. Of 9741 newborn babies delivered by participating TBAs, factorial analysis indicated a reduction in risk of omphalitis with CHX application (risk ratio [RR]= 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 82, p= 0. 002) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing (RR= 0. 83, 0. 61 - 1. 13, p= 0. 24). We recorded strong evidence of a reduction in neonatal mortality in neonates who received CHX cleansing (RR= 0. 62, 95 % CI 0. 45 - 0. 85, p= 0. 003) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing promotion on neonatal mortality (RR= 1. 08, 0. 79 - 1. 48, p= 0. 62). We recorded no serious adverse events. Interpretation: Application of 4 % CHX to the umbilical cord was effective in reducing the risk of omphalitis and neonatal mortality in rural Pakistan.

Background Maternal overweight and obesity during pregnancy is associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and a low-grade state of chronic inflammation. The aim of this pre-specified analysis of secondary outcome measures was to evaluate the effect of providing antenatal dietary and lifestyle advice on cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods We conducted a multicentre trial in which pregnant women who were overweight or obese were randomised to receive either Lifestyle Advice or Standard Care. We report a range of pre-specified secondary maternal and newborn cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarker outcomes. Maternal whole venous blood was collected at trial entry (mean 14 weeks gestation; non-fasting), at 28 weeks gestation (fasting), and at 36 weeks gestation (non-fasting). Cord blood was collected after birth and prior to the delivery of the placenta. A range of cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers were analysed (total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, glucose, leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon gamma, TNF-α, and interleukins 1 β, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10).

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether cord blood vitamin D concentrations were associated with risk of early childhood allergic disease. Measurements of cord blood 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations were available in 270 mother-child pairs who were participating in the allergy follow-up (n[*]=[*] 706) of the Docosahexaenoic Acid to Optimise Mother Infant Outcome randomised controlled trial. All of the children had a hereditary risk of allergic disease. The diagnosis of allergic disease was made during medical assessments at 1 and 3  years of age. The mean (<b>standard</b> deviation) standardised <b>cord</b> blood 25 (OH) D concentration was 57. 0 (24. 1) nmol/L. The cumulative incidence of eczema to 3  years of age, n[*]=[*] 101 / 250 (40  %) was associated with standardised cord blood 25 (OH) D concentration, with a 10  nmol/L rise in 25 (OH) D concentration reducing the risk of eczema by 8  % (relative risk 0. 92, 95  % confidence interval 0. 86 - 0. 97; P[*]=[*] 0. 005). This association was stronger at 1  year of age, when a 10  nmol/L rise in standardised cord blood 25 (OH) D concentration reduced the risk of eczema by 12  % (relative risk 0. 88, 95  % confidence interval 0. 81 - 0. 96; P[*]=[*] 0. 002). No associations between cord blood 25 (OH) D concentrations and development of allergic sensitisation, allergic rhinitis or asthma in early childhood were found. In children with a family history of allergic disease, a higher cord blood 25 (OH) D concentration appears to be associated with reduced risk of eczema in early childhood.

40|$|Background: Maternal {{overweight}} and obesity during pregnancy {{is associated with}} insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and a low-grade state of chronic inflammation. The aim of this pre-specified analysis of secondary outcome measures was to evaluate the effect of providing antenatal dietary and lifestyle advice on cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: We conducted a multicentre trial in which pregnant women who were overweight or obese were randomised to receive either Lifestyle Advice or Standard Care. We report a range of pre-specified secondary maternal and newborn cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarker outcomes. Maternal whole venous blood was collected at trial entry (mean 14  weeks gestation; non-fasting), at 28  weeks gestation (fasting), and at 36  weeks gestation (non-fasting). Cord blood was collected after birth and prior to the delivery of the placenta. A range of cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers were analysed (total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, glucose, leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon gamma, TNF-α, and interleukins 1 β, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10). Participants were analysed in the groups {{to which they were}} randomised, and were included in the analyses if they had a measure at any time point. results: One or more biological specimens were available from 1951 women (989 Lifestyle Advice and 962 <b>Standard</b> Care), with <b>cord</b> blood from 1174 infants (596 Lifestyle Advice and 578 Standard Care). There were no statistically significant differences in mean cardiometabolic and inflammatory marker concentrations across pregnancy and in infant cord blood between treatment groups. Estimated treatment group differences were close to zero, with 95 % confidence intervals spanning a range of differences that were short of clinical relevance. There was no evidence to suggest that the intervention effect was modified by maternal BMI category. Conclusions: Despite our findings, it will be worth considering potential relationships between cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes, including longer-term infant health and adiposity.
