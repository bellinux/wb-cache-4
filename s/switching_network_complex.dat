In this paper, pinning synchronization of <b>complex</b> dynamical <b>networks</b> with <b>switching</b> topology is studied. Two basic problems are considered: one is pinning synchronization of <b>switched</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> under arbitrary switching; the other is pinning synchronization of <b>switched</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> by design of switching when synchronization cannot achieved by using any individual connection topology alone. For the two problems, common Lyapunov function method and single Lyapunov function method are used respectively, some global synchronization criteria are proposed and the designed switching law is given.

That is, only some switching topologies contain a directed spanning tree when zero-in-degree nodes are pinned.

30|$|In this paper, by {{establishing}} an impulsive delay differential inequality, the exponential synchronization of the coupling delay <b>switching</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> has been investigated.

In Section  3, by using M-matrix theory and constructing multiple Lyapunov functions, some sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the aperiodically intermittent synchronization of <b>switching</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks.</b> Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} main results in Section  4.

40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>networks</b> of {{dynamically}} connected saddle states persistently {{emerge in}} {{a broad range of}} high-dimensional systems and may reliably encode inputs as specific switching trajectories. Their computational capabilities, however, are far from being understood. Here, we analyze how symmetry-breaking inhomogeneities naturally induce predictable persistent switching dynamics across such networks. We show that such systems are capable of computing arbitrary logic operations by entering into switching sequences in a controlled way. This dynamics thus offers a highly flexible new kind of computation based on <b>switching</b> along <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> of states...|$|R
30|$|Although aperiodically {{intermittent}} {{control has}} been investigated in [27], the network topology was time-invariant and the pinning control was only imposed on the first node all the time. In this paper, we investigate <b>switching</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> and choose the pinned nodes with zero in-degree in G(A̅^ς _i) (i= 1,...,q) by using Tarjan’s algorithm [32]. Moreover, the nodes which are pinned may be different at different modes. The pinned nodes are controlled aperiodically intermittently only in some topologies which contain a directed spanning tree, while in other topologies no node is pinned. Our model (3) is more general than the model in [27].|$|R
30|$|On the one hand, {{the actual}} systems may {{experience}} abrupt {{changes in their}} structure and parameters caused by phenomena such as component failures or repairs, changing subsystem interconnections, and abrupt environmental disturbances. In general, these systems can be modeled by using Markov chains [9 – 11]. For example, in [12], mean-square exponential synchronization of Markovian <b>switching</b> stochastic <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> with time-varying delays by pinning control was proposed and in [13], synchronization of Markovian jumping stochastic <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> with distributed time delays and probabilistic interval discrete time-varying delays was considered. Besides these, the other strategies, which usually include data-driven approaches, support vector machine and multivariate statistical methods, {{and can be used}} to process these systems [14 – 18].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} global pinning {{synchronization}} {{problem for a}} class of <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> with <b>switching</b> directed topologies. The common assumption in the existing related literature that each possible network topology contains a directed spanning tree is removed in this paper. Using tools from M-matrix theory and stability analysis of the switched nonlinear systems, {{a new kind of}} network topology-dependent multiple Lyapunov functions is proposed for analyzing the synchronization behavior of the whole network. It is theoretically shown that the global pinning synchronization in <b>switched</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> can be ensured if some nodes are appropriately pinned and the coupling is carefully selected. Interesting issues of how many and which nodes should be pinned for possibly realizing global synchronization are further addressed. Finally, some numerical simulations on coupled neural networks are provided to verify the theoretical results...|$|R
30|$|However, <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> are {{not always}} able to {{synchronize}} by themselves. Hence, various effective control protocols have been proposed to achieve synchronization, such as feedback control [13 – 15], adaptive control [16, 17], impulsive control [18, 19], pinning control [20, 21] and intermittent control [22, 23] and so on. Compared with the continuous control, intermittent control is more economic and it has attracted great interests [24, 25]. In [26], the synchronization problem for a class of <b>complex</b> delayed dynamical <b>networks</b> is investigated by periodically intermittent control. The topology structure of the considered <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> is time-invariant and the intermittent controller is periodical. In [27], synchronization problem for nonlinear coupled networks is investigated via aperiodically intermittent pinning control. Both an aperiodically constant intermittent control strategy and an aperiodically adaptive intermittent control strategy are designed. However, the network topology considered is undirected and time-invariant. In most of the aforementioned works, it is commonly assumed that the network topology contains a directed spanning tree. There is very little research on <b>switching</b> <b>complex</b> <b>networks</b> containing no directed spanning tree.|$|R

40|$|L (Logarithmic space) versus NL (Non-deterministic {{logarithmic}} space) {{is one of}} {{the great}} open problems in computational complexity theory. In the paper "Bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity", we separated monotone analogues of L and NL using a model called the <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> model. In particular, by considering inputs consisting of just a path and isolated vertices, we proved that any monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> solving directed connectivity on N vertices must have size at least N^Ω((N)) and this bound is tight. If we could show a similar result for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity, then this would prove that L ≠ NL. However, proving lower bounds for general <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> solving directed connectivity requires proving stronger lower bounds on monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity. To work towards this goal, we investigated a different set of inputs which we believed to be hard for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> to solve and attempted to prove similar lower size bounds. Instead, we found that this set of inputs is actually easy for monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity to solve, yet if we restrict ourselves to certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks,</b> which are a simple and intuitive subclass of monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity, then these inputs are indeed hard to solve. In this paper, we give this set of inputs, demonstrate a "weird" polynomially-sized monotone <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> for directed connectivity which solves this set of inputs, and prove that no polynomially-sized certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>network</b> can solve this set of inputs, thus proving that monotone <b>switching</b> <b>networks</b> for directed connectivity are strictly more powerful than certain-knowledge <b>switching</b> <b>networks.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Consequently, optical communication, and in particular Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, has become a versatile transmission medium for many applications. ^ The introduction of WDM technology has resulted in increasing the dimensionality of switching by addition of the wavelength switching domain.
