5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of groups of Jews venerating Ezra to an extent greater than mainstream Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small group of Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E
5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E
5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} area about 12,000 {{years ago but}} did not leave much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep— all large game who no longer range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E

5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is one of the}} Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of {{seemingly}} connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was Parmenides (5th century BC), who was <b>a</b> Greek philosopher <b>of</b> the monist school. He argued that [...] "nothing" [...] cannot exist by the following line <b>of</b> reasoning: To <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thing, one has to <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thing that exists. Since we can <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concludes {{that there is no}} such thing as change. As a corollary, there can be no such things as coming-into-being, passing-out-of-being, or not-being.|$|R

In its account of the past, Akilattirattu speaks of an age in which people lived as one family without the discrimination of caste.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the first book of Kalila wa Demna is different than Panchatantra, in being more elaborate and instead of king and his three sons studying in the Indian version, the Persian version <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merchant and his three sons who had squandered away their father's wealth. The Persian version also makes an abrupt switch from {{the story of the}} three sons to an injured ox, and thereafter parallels the Panchatantra.|$|E

They base this on a verse of the Quran wherein Jesus <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> messenger to appear after him named Ahmad. Islam associates Ahmad with Muhammad, both words deriving from the h-m-d triconsonantal root which refers to praiseworthiness. Muslims also assert that evidence of Jesus' pronouncement {{is present in the}} New Testament, citing the mention of the Paraclete whose coming is foretold in the Gospel of John.|$|E
25|$|Penwith is {{believed}} to be the last part of Cornwall where Cornish was spoken as a community language. Dolly Pentreath, known as the last recorded speaker (but arguably not the very last) came from Paul in Penwith. A year following the death of Dolly Pentreath in 1777 Daines Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.|$|E

Among {{the participants in}} the Synod of Ancyra in 314 was a bishop of Caesarea named Agricolaus, who may have been the immediate predecessor of Eusebius, who does not mention him, or who may have been bishop of a different Caesarea. The immediate successors of Eusebius were Acacius (340–366) and Gelasius of Caesarea (367–372, 380–395). The latter was ousted by the semi-Arian Euzoius between 373 and 379. Lequien gives much information about all of these and about later bishops of Caesarea.|$|E

It is preserved in the Greek Life of St. George of Amastris, which <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raid that had extended into Paphlagonia. Contemporary Byzantine presence of the Rus' is mentioned in the Frankish Annals of St. Bertin. These relate that a delegation from the court of the Byzantine emperor visited Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious at his court in Ingelheim in 839. In this delegation were two men who called themselves Rhos (Rhos vocari dicebant). Louis enquired about their origins and learnt that they were Swedes. Fearing that they were spies for their brothers, the Danes, he incarcerated them.|$|E
25|$|Internal and {{external}} trade was well organised and active. Evidence from both archaeology and literature <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flourishing foreign {{trade with the}} Yavanas (Greeks). The port city of Puhar {{on the east coast}} and Muziris on the west coast of south India were emporia of foreign trade, where huge ships moored, offloading precious merchandise. This trade started to decline after the 2nd century CE and the direct contact between the Roman empire and the ancient Tamil country was replaced by trade with the Arabs and the Auxumites of East Africa. Internal trade was also brisk and goods were sold and bartered. Agriculture was the main profession of a vast majority of the populace.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, {{especially}} in photography and astronomy, aperture {{refers to the}} diameter of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a telescope, the aperture stop is typically the edges of the objective lens or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter aperture. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In astrophotography, the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in inches or mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the focal length. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.|$|E
