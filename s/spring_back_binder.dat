40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the <b>spring</b> <b>back,</b> should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to the bending over the bend line, <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to the curvature of the flange, and <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effect of process {{parameters}} such as Blank Holder Force (BHF) and Feed Rate, on the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior of a polymer metal laminate (PML) system comprised of aluminum and polypropylene. Specimens were formed over a hemispherical punch in stamp forming process. A novel real time strain measuring system, ARAMIS, was employed to capture the strain evolution during forming. The results of this work indicate that both BHF and feed-rate exert influence in PML <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior.

40|$|The {{tendency}} of the metal to regain its original shape {{will result in the}} <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> when it is being formed to make aircraft components like outer body panels and brackets.

This will lead to increase in weight, fabrication cost and also the assembly line time. So the Finite-Element Analysis (FEA) is used to accurately predict this deflection so that manufacturing processes can be optimized to produce a perfect output with least deviations from the design. This thesis bridges a relation between the experimentally evaluated <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and FEA calculated <b>spring</b> <b>back.</b> Also in order to validate the FEA Analysis regression analysis has been performed.

40|$|International audienceIn this project, it {{is planned}} {{to carry out}} a {{complete}} microstructural characterization of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) currently used in the automotive industry. These steels have an elastic effect, called <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect, during the sheet metal forming of parts. This <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> is the main problem of this family of steels during the production process of the structural components of the automotive industry: especially for dimensional problems in automotive structural components. It is therefore necessary to evaluate changes in microstructure during the stages of sheet metal forming in order to know precisely the microstructural and mechanical behavior of material after being subjected to this effect. Steels studied in this research work are currently used by all major automobile industries, which are dual-phase (DP) 600 and 780. The <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect mechanical characterization was performed by means of a mechanical bending test, called as Air Bending. The results indicate that the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect in the DP 780 has the highest <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> rate due to its high mechanical strength due to Hall-Petchphenomenom. The comparison of analyses EBSD before and after bending tests showed a relation between the misorientation of grains and the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect. The results obtained by microstructure analysis of EBSD confirmed the tendency of DP 780 absorb a greater amount of energy during the deformation, thus resulting in greater springback effect...|$|R
40|$|In a {{world where}} fuel economy and crash safety is {{becoming}} {{an important factor in}} the automotive industry, the need for materials with very high strength-to-weight ratio is growing rapidly. One of the materials used for this purpose is the boron steel 22 MnB 5. Since the material has very high mechanical yield limit it is hard to produce parts using cold forming, which is the standard procedure for sheet metal forming. Therefore, the use of hot stamping is increasing. Hot stamping enables manufacturing of boron steel parts with good dimensional accuracy and low <b>spring</b> <b>back.</b> However, some amount of <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> is still present during the process. In this thesis, <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of a hot formed 22 MnB 5 A-pillar is investigated using computer simulations in the software LS-DYNA. The main focus was to develop a process for simulating <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> in hot stamping. The work started with simulations of the forming and quenching stages of the hot stamping process, both on a full size and on a smaller section of the blank. Simultaneously as the simulations, a literature study was also conducted. The literature study was aimed at finding hints and information on how to build the simulations. Furthermore, interviews were made with experts on both LS-DYNA and hot stamping. A process for <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> evaluation was then created and written as an LS-DYNA keywordfile. In the developed <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> simulation, the part is taken out of the press right after the quenching is finished and placed in a space where it can cool and move freely. The simulation is conducted until the part reaches room temperature. After the quenching is done, data containing temperatures, stresses and strains of the part is exported. This data is then included in the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> simulation where the part is cooled to room temperature. During the cooling, the stresses, strains and temperatures are equalized until the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> reaches a steady state. The results indicate that the developed method for <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> evaluation can be used to foresee shape deviations for the intended part and process...|$|R

40|$|Many {{products}} in the automotive industry are produced with the deep drawing process. When the tools are released after the forming stage, the product <b>springs</b> <b>back</b> due to the action of internal stresses. Because the geometric tolerances can be tight for sheet metal products, this shape deviation can be unacceptable. In many cases <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> compensation is needed: {{the tools of the}} deep drawing process are changed so, that the product becomes geometrically accurate. In the industry, this is currently a costly and time consuming process of producing prototype products and redesigning the tools manually. In the case of deep drawing process, the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> is an important phenomenon that leads to the modification of the part shape and dimensions after the tools removing. For this reason, in order to obtain a drawn part with a good accuracy of the shape and dimensions, this phenomenon must be controlled. The main cause of the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> phenomenon is represented by the residual stress distribution on the sheet thickness of the drawn part. Hence, in order to control the <b>spring</b> <b>back,</b> the residual stress distribution on sheet thickness must be known and controlled. In this project an analysis was made concerning the influence of the residual stress distribution on the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> intensity in the case of cylindrical drawn parts made from steel sheet[1][23][32].

This paper {{presents the results}} of applying the finite element method to calculating the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of an automotive hood assembly, and its application to the functional build method. The assembly was comprised of six individual panels: an inner panel, an outer panel, a major reinforcement, a latch reinforcement, and two hinge reinforcements. Finite element simulations were conducted for forming each of the six components. Each component was formed, trimmed, and positioned in car position. The outer panel required several secondary forming operations including a re-meshing, remapping, trim, and flanging operation. Once in car position, the components were moved so that they just contacted each other, and were “spot welded ” together through the application of nodal constraints. Mastic between components was simulated with tied contact. Contact between components was simulated with contact interfaces. Finally, a <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> analysis was conducted.

40|$|Abstract. In macro forming it {{is already}} known, that the punch {{velocity}} {{has an influence on}} the deep drawing process. This influence is considerably induced by the velocity dependent friction behavior between sample and tool. A further influence is the strain rate dependent forming behavior of the material. In micro range, the influence of punch velocity on the deep drawing process could, due to the size effects, be different from that in macro range, for example the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior. In this article the influence of punch velocity on the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior in micro deep drawing is investigated using strip drawing test with two different widths (1 mm and 2 mm). Experiments with aluminum strips with a thickness of 50 µm were performed with punch velocities ranged from 1 mm/s to 1000 mm/s. The strain behavior, which occurs with different punch velocities are investigated on the basis of microsections.
