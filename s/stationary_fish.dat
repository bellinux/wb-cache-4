50|$|The {{process of}} durotaxis {{requires}} a cell to actively sense the environment, process the mechanical stimulus, and execute a response. Originally, this {{was believed to}} be an emergent metazoan property, as the phenomenon requires a complex sensory loop that is dependent on the communication of many different cells. However, as the wealth of relevant scientific literature grew in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, it became apparent that single cells possess the ability to do the same. The first observations of durotaxis in isolated cells were that mechanical stimuli could cause the initiation and elongation of axons in the sensory and brain neurons of chicks and induce motility in previously <b>stationary</b> <b>fish</b> epidermal keratocytes. ECM stiffness was also noted to influence cytoskeletal stiffness, fibronectin fibril assembly, the strength of integrin-cytoskeletal interactions, morphology and motility rate, all of which were known influence cell migration.|$|E

Individual brown trout used afew specific locations near cover (referred to as home sites) as resting locations during the day,moved across various distances at night, and generally returned to the same home site the nextmorning. Home sites were predominantly artificial cover (88 %) rather than natural sites, asnatural cover was very limited in the study area. Some fish used multiple home sites, and theaverage separation between multiple home sites for individual fish was over 500 m. Fish trackedfor more than 1 year used the same home sites each summer and generally exhibited similarbehaviour each year. Fish belonged to two general categories of daily movement behaviour:mobile or stationary. Mobile fish tended to move frequently and were found within their homesites only 43 % of the time at night. <b>Stationary</b> <b>fish</b> did not move far from home sites, even atnight. There was a negative correlation between the average gradient and the maximum distancefish moved from their home sites during nocturnal periods. <b>Stationary</b> <b>fish</b> resided in areas ofsteeper gradient (usually about 0. 20 %) and moved less often nocturnally than did mobile fish. Three fish were tracked extensively over 36 d to quantify diel activity patterns. The hourly activityof fish increased dramatically at dusk, continued at a lower level overnight, and then increasedagain at dawn before declining to near zero during the day. This behaviour pattern was similaramong all individuals tracked and also between the months of June, July, and August for anindividual fish. Nocturnal movements involved significantly greater distances than diurnalmovements for these fish. The relationship between movement and gradient may indicateenergetic tradeoffs between the cost of moving against a current and the energy gained duringactive foraging. Also, the dominant use of artificial home sites has implications for the value ofhabitat improvements meant to increase abundance of large brown trout...|$|E

Utilization distributions presented a clear pattern {{in the distribution of}} dolphin activities and use of various locations within the study area. The 50 % kernel density estimate (core area) for foraging/feeding (2. 1 km 2) was clustered around the harbour mouth (including the shark net installation). The core areas for resting, socialising and travelling were more widespread ([2. 95 km 2). A mixed effects model indicated that location (longitude and latitude), distance from shore, year and group size are important variables in predicting foraging/feeding behaviour as opposed to other behaviours. The resting core was found {{in the southern part of}} study area and socialising was less clustered. This indicates preferential use of certain areas for specific behaviours. The overlap of foraging/ feeding areas with <b>stationary</b> <b>fishing</b> gear (shark nets) and boat traffic are a major concern due to the risk of humaninduced incidental mortalities.

40|$|Bycatch of red {{king crab}} (Paralithodes camtschatica) in <b>stationary</b> <b>fishing</b> gears, q&ally gillnets, is an {{increasing}} problem to the inshore fishermen {{in the northern part}} of Norway (Finnmark county). The results are large bycatches of king crabs together with the crabs’ damages on the gear and catch. In the cod gillnet fisheries, the problem might be solved by using specially made gillnets (“norsel-mounted” nets) where the net itself is floated 0. 5 meters above the seabed. The norsel-mounted nets were compared with standard nets in the Varangerfjord (eastern Finnmark) in the period 17 March - 28 May 1999. The trials showed that norsel nets needed more floats than the standard nets to get the net to stand properly in the sea (to get the norsels stretched out suitably). By using extra float (rings) on the norsel mounted nets the bycatches of king crab were reduced to an acceptable level with an average of 0. 6 crabs/net, compared with 3. 3 crabs/net on standard and 6. 7 crabs/net on nor-se 1 nets without extra float. Norse 1 nets caught only about l/ 3 as many fish as standard nets. The catch results indicated that the gear configuration functioned in order to reduce the bycatch of red king crab. Loss of fish up to 65 % is, however not satisfying. Further work is needed to find a solution that gives a minimal loss of fish.

40|$|Morphological {{analysis}} of a small freshwater goby, Rhinogobius flumineus, showed a distinct dimorphic asymmetry in the lower jaw. The mouth of each fish opened with a slight but definite distortion toward the right or left side, depending on the individual. Right-opening mouth (dextral) fish had a right lower jaw that was more protruded than the left one, and left-opening (sinistral) fish had a more protruded left lower jaw. No fish had laterally symmetric lower jaws, indicating that the asymmetry was different from ‘fluctuating asymmetry’. These fish used either the right or {{left side of the}} mouth when picking up food from the bottom, but neither dextral nor sinistral individuals used one side more frequently than the other side. The mouth asymmetry, however, was related to the <b>stationary</b> posture: dextral <b>fish</b> stayed on the bottom with the line of their bodies curved to the right more frequently than to the left, and vice versa for the sinistral fish. Genetics of the morph phenotype were investigated by observing the frequencies of morphs in F 1 under captive breeding.

We further compared accuracy and precision of density and richness estimates from several combinations of <b>stationary</b> cylinders and <b>fish</b> size. A simple improvement in stationary censuses, i. e. a sampling unit composed of 2 nested cylinders (2 m and 4 m radii, respectively), enhanced the accuracy and precision of estimates.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{disentangle}} {{if and when}} resource supply and adult and young-of-the-year (0 +) fish predation affect zooplankton dynamics during spring, we monitored zooplankton during three consecutive years in a lake in southern Sweden. We also experimentally assessed 0 + fish predation rates and estimated changes in predation rates of adult fish on zooplankton. Decline in abundances of large-sized zooplankters in early spring was not caused by 0 + fish predation. Instead, this decline was most likely a combined result of size-selective predation from adult <b>fish</b> (<b>stationary</b> in the lake and from those returning from surrounding streams) and competition for diminishing algal food resources. On the other hand, the decline in medium-sized zooplankton in the lake during spring was strongly affected by 0 + fish. Hence, during spring, zooplankton are facing predation both from adult fish selecting large prey and from 0 + fish, which start feeding on small-sized prey and eventually switch to larger. Neither predation by different ontogenetic stages of fish (adult and 0 +) nor resource supply shape the zooplankton spring dynamics, but rather they affect the timing and strength of these events. 0 + cyprinids tend to have stronger effect on zooplankton dynamics than other taxa of 0 + fish.

50|$|Twice a year, {{partners}} including The Nature Conservancy, the Bureau of Land Management, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and Dr Peter Reinthal, {{professor at}} the University of Arizona, sample nine sites {{along the length of}} Aravaipa Canyon. Three of these sites are located at the west and east ends of the canyon respectively, and three are within the canyon itself. Various methods are used to survey the type and abundance of fish species present at each location. The most common of these is seining, a method that involves dragging a long net through the water and catching many fish at a time. This is best done by two individuals (one {{on either side of the}} net) who run downstream, scooping up the fish that are attempting to swim upstream against the current. Another form of seining involves the same two people on either side of the net, but this time they plant the edges of the net into the streambed. Then, another group of individuals form a line parallel to the net and kick up the water as they move toward the <b>stationary</b> net, driving <b>fish</b> into it. This approach works best on narrow side-channels that deviate from the wider stream’s flow. Yet another, less-used method is known as electro-shocking. This involves placing a set of electrodes in the water which send out a low-level electric pulse, temporarily stunning the fish in the immediate area. This makes catching and identifying the fish somewhat easier than seining, but some may say it has ethical implications as it can occasionally cause death to some fish if not expertly done.|$|R
40|$|Sprat Sprattus sprattus is a marine, {{forage fish}} of high {{ecological}} and economical value. This thesis addresses the ecology {{and behavior of}} sprat during overwintering, a phase that is poorly studied in marine pelagic <b>fish.</b> <b>Stationary</b> upward-facing echosounders were used to study individual behavior as well as collective behavior of sprat throughout four separate winters in a high-latitude, hypoxia-impacted fjord. The acoustic studies were supplemented by field campaigns. Long-term, continuous coverage of several winters provided unique information on sprat behavior in relation to different environmental conditions, for example ice-free versus ice-covered waters and hypoxic versus welloxygenated conditions. Feeding behavior of sprat in relation to size, as well as abundance, composition and distribution of potential prey and predators could furthermore be established. The physical and biological properties at the overwintering fjord-habitat varied considerably between winters, as also did length-distribution and feeding activity of sprat. Generally, the largesize classes of sprat had empty stomachs, particularly in one winter. The apparent lack of feeding suggests an inactive overwintering mode where predator avoidance is prioritized {{at the expense of}} feeding. The winter diet of sprat otherwise varied according to prey availability, yet with a positive selection towards calanoid copepods, especially the larger-sized Calanus spp. Sprat was shown to have a flexible behavioral repertoire, displaying different behaviors with changing conditions. For instance, ice conditions promoted a response where sprat moved to shallower depths after the ice covering, and oxygen content proved to be an important factor governing their vertical distribution and diurnal behavior. Solitary swimming in near-bottom waters prevailed in moderate hypoxia (~ 30 % O 2 saturation) as opposed to schooling in mid-waters when deep waters were oxygen depleted (0 - 7 % O 2 saturation). Two different anti-predation strategies were likely displayed: “hiding at depth” and “hiding in schools”. Highly varied, and mixed diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns were always observed. The dynamic behavior of sprat was likely shaped by individual strategies involving optimized feeding and predator avoidance, as well as relating to temperature, hypoxia and negative buoyancy. Negative buoyancy appears as common in sprat, as implied by frequent “rise-and-sink” swimming while not schooling. Stationary, upward-facing echosounders proved to be a powerful tool for assessment of individual behavior of sprat, and novel information on several behavioral traits is provided in this thesis. A surfacing behavior was always prevalent at nighttime with individual sprat carrying out rapid excursions to- and from the surface. Associated gas release suggested that the physostome sprat gulped air when at the surface, presumably to refill their swimbladders. The results further indicated that this behavior affects the acoustic properties of sprat. These findings are important considering the potential implications this can have for reliable stock assessments of forage, physostome fish. The discovery of brief dives into severely oxygen depleted waters by individual sprat revealed that sprat can tolerate very low oxygen levels (< 0. 45 mL O 2 L- 1 at 8 ºC) for a couple of minutes. The results further indicated that sprat exhibit certain tactics for dealing with what can be a typical challenge in hypoxia-impacted habitats; reduced overlap with potential prey Overall, this study provides a unique insight into the dynamic conditions that sprat may encounter while overwintering and shows that the overwintering strategies of sprat are flexible and varied. It also contributes with novel information on a scarcely described phase in the life history of fish at high latitudes...|$|R
