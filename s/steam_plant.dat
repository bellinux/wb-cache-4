5|$|Ground {{was broken}} {{at the site}} on 9 July 1944. By 16 September, with {{about a third of}} the plant complete, the first rack had {{commenced}} operation. Testing in September and October revealed problems with leaking pipes that required further welding. Nonetheless, all racks were installed and ready for operations in January 1945. The construction contract was terminated on 15 February, and the remaining insulation and electrical work was assigned to other firms in the Oak Ridge area. They also completed the auxiliary buildings, including the new <b>steam</b> <b>plant.</b> The plant became fully operational in March 1945. Construction of the new boiler plant was approved on 16 February 1945. The first boiler was started on 5 July 1945, and operations commenced on 13 July. Work was completed on 15 August 1945.|$|E

5|$|Other {{structures}} {{designed by}} Cutter include the Spokane Club, Washington Water Power Substation, Monroe Street Bridge (featured {{in the city}} seal), Central <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant,</b> and the Davenport Hotel. Built in renaissance and Spanish Revival style, the Davenport Hotel cost two million dollars to complete, and included new technologies {{at the time of}} its opening in September 1914, such as chilled water, elevators, and air cooling. In contemporary times, one of the foremost and influential architects in the city has been Warren C. Heylman, who helped give the city a great breadth of mid-century architecture. Heylman's career was most prolific during the 1960s and 1970s where his main body of work was done in the modernist style, designing numerous residential houses, apartment buildings, and architectural embellishments. Some of his most noteworthy works in Spokane include The Parkade, Spokane International Airport, Spokane Regional Health Building, and the Burlington Northern Latah Creek Bridge over Hangman Valley.|$|E
5|$|Sites at Watts Bar Dam, Muscle Shoals and Detroit were considered, but it {{was decided}} to build it at the Clinton Engineer Works, where water could be {{obtained}} from the Clinch River and steam from the K-25 power house. The thermal diffusion project was codenamed S-50. An S-50 Division was created at the Manhattan District headquarters in June under Lieutenant Colonel Mark C. Fox, with Major Thomas J. Evans, Jr., as his assistant with special authority for plant construction. Groves selected the H. K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, Ohio, as the prime construction contractor on its record of finishing jobs on time, notably the Gulf Ordnance Plant in Mississippi, on a cost plus fixed fee contract. The H. A. Jones Construction Company would build the <b>steam</b> <b>plant,</b> with H. K. Ferguson as engineer-architect. Although his advisors had estimated that it would take six months to build the plant, Groves gave H. K. Ferguson just four, and he wanted operations to commence in just 75 days.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{shows that}} {{temperature}} decrease of heat rejection in a cycle {{is necessary for}} energy efficiency of <b>steam</b> turbine <b>plants.</b> Minimum temperature of heat rejection at <b>steam</b> turbine <b>plant</b> work on water steam is 15 °C. <b>Steam</b> turbine <b>plant</b> of triple cycle where lower cycle of <b>steam</b> turbine <b>plant</b> is organic Rankine cycle on low-boiling substance with heat rejection in air condenser, which safely allows rejecting heat at condensation temperatures below 0 °C, has been offered.

30|$|This {{effect is}} only {{relevant}} for CCPPs {{and does not}} occur at <b>steam</b> power <b>plants,</b> because the condensate preheating in <b>steam</b> power <b>plants</b> is realized with steam extractions from the steam turbine instead of heat exchangers in the flue gas system.|$|R
25|$|In {{a thermal}} power station, {{water is the}} working medium. High {{pressure}} steam requires strong, bulky components. High temperatures require expensive alloys made from nickel or cobalt, rather than inexpensive steel. These alloys limit practical steam temperatures to 655°C while the lower temperature of a <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> is fixed by {{the temperature of the}} cooling water. With these limits, a <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> has a fixed upper efficiency of 35–42%.|$|E

25|$|Other {{vestiges of}} the company's {{streetcar}} history remained in the Twin Cities, and some surviving elements are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of the oldest structures to survive is a building in Minneapolis {{now known as the}} Colonial Warehouse. First built in 1885, it housed the headquarters of the Minneapolis Street Railway Co. during the early horsecar era and also later served as a powerhouse as the system was converted. The lines needed a lot of electricity, so hydroelectric generators were installed at Saint Anthony Falls about a mile away and the Southeast <b>Steam</b> <b>Plant</b> was also constructed nearby. The old headquarters was sold in 1908, soon after these were constructed. The <b>steam</b> <b>plant</b> was bought by the University of Minnesota, which now uses it for providing heat to the campus downriver.|$|E
