The German results indicate that relationship tenure {{is not related to}} LMX. However, <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> is shown to be relevant in the followers' evaluation of LMX. With respect to the consequences of LMX, results indicate that delegation as well as commitment and occupational self-efficacy are positively related to LMX. Some of the results differ from US results, namely, antecedents are related to LMX to a lower degree in Germany and consequences to a higher degree. Based on these results, future research should take into account the country in which the LMX data is collected {{in order to be able}} to make more precise statements about the respective relationships...|$|E

This article is re-printed, with permission, from the Academy of Management Journal, June, 1969. A modified semantic differential is a valuable instrument for getting qualitative evaluations in numerical form. It can measure attitudes about certain aspects of formal organization structure like <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> and shared authority. ABCA members may find numerous uses for the semantic differential in business communication research. MosT OF You are familiar with semantics, the science of meanings. A semantic differential is a technique developed by Charles E. Osgood and his associates to measure in quantifiable terms what meaning a a concept might have to a group of people. Since the concept can be an abstract word or idea such as a company image or a product im-age, we can use the semantic differential to measure the image of any organization, for example the Academy of Management...|$|E

5000|$|The sum {{of these}} three types of {{interactions}} {{is the number of}} potential relationships of a supervisor. Graicunas showed with these formulas, that each additional subordinate increases the number of potential interactions significantly. It appears natural, that no organization can afford to maintain a control structure of a dimension being required for implementing a scalar chain under the unity of command condition. Therefore, other mechanisms had to be found for dealing with the dilemma of maintaining managerial control, while keeping cost and time at a reasonable level, thus making the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control a critical figure for the organization. Consequently, for a long time, finding the optimum <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control has been a major challenge to organization design. As Mackenzie (1978, p 121) describes it:”One could argue that with larger <b>spans,</b> the costs <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> would tend to be reduced, because a smaller percentage {{of the members of the}} organization are supervisors. On the other hand, if the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control is too large, the supervisor may not have the capacity to supervise effectively such large numbers of immediate subordinates. Thus, there is a possible trade-off to be made in an attempt to balance these possibly opposing tendencies.” ...|$|R

A large number of organisations implement microfinance, covering a significant proportion of the world population. This study looks into the information systems (IS) of microfinance following an interpretive epistemological philosophy, drawing on research approaches within the fields of IS and organisational studies. It is based on an in-depth comparative case study in six micro finance organisations with different features and characteristics, combined with a questionnaire survey covering fifty-eight microfinance organisations of Bangladesh. Drawing on phenomena observed in microfinance this study analyses how lCT plays a role in shrinking organisational structure, enhancing the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> and operational performance, and centralisation of delegation of authority. It identifies how key aspects of the context including financial, human resources, technological, regulatory, and national culture impact upon the IS of microfinance in Bangladesh, and block implementation of ICT -based IS. The findings on different positive and negative implications of the use of ICT on the personal, social and gender perspectives and job satisfaction of the human resources inform and add value to the existing body of knowledge. With an aim to contribute to the field of ICT 4 D, this study examines the use of ICT in combating corruption in microfinance and argues that along with the use of ICT, an ethical ambiance and administrative reforms are required to prevent corruption more effectively. It also argues that the adoption of emerging mobile phone-based microfinance will radically change the conventional operational model and its IS, with profound implications for the material aspects, but that it can also be detrimental to the social performance of this development programme.

It was assumed, that no manager would be capable of supervising more than 5-6 direct subordinates. However, this conclusion built on the assumption, that the superior must actively monitor the work of all subordinates. Later on, this statement was diversified, and Davis (1951) divided managerial work into two categories, one requiring the attention to physical work, the other one requiring mental activity. Depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>supervision,</b> a <b>span</b> <b>of</b> 3-8 subordinates for managers at higher levels was considered adequate, while first level supervisors, i.e. those supervising shop floor personnel could have up to 30 subordinates.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> {{in educational}} psychology has regularly reported {{low rates of}} participation and dissatisfaction with the adequacy of supervisory arrangements. Most studies to date have been conducted {{on the assumption that}} supervision is a formalised, often one-to-one relationship. However, this view <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> is incongruent with the ecological theories of human development that currently guide educational psychologists' work. The present study sought to develop understanding of the nature and contexts <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> for a group of educational psychologists through examination of the actions they took to meet the goals <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> A situational analysis research method was used to examine the supervisory actions, in relation to the theories underlying current field practice, of 38 educational psychologists. This collaborative method of inquiry reflected the procedures of the psychologists' professional practice and enabled the understanding <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> to be constructed using the participants' own sense-making processes. Results of the study indicated that the psychologists pursued the goals <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> through the multiple interactions that took place within the regular activity of their community <b>of</b> practice. <b>Supervision</b> included a combination of formal, informal and situated interactions. It was concerned with connectedness to the professional community and comprised a range of integrated activities. The psychologists demonstrated that their supervision-in-action was guided by the same ecological principles that guided their professional practice. When supervision was conceptualised as a practice that included formal, informal and situated interactions intended to meet the goals <b>of</b> <b>supervision,</b> the participants reported high levels of satisfaction with current supervisory arrangements and participation in the practice. This thesis proposes an extended view <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> that depicts supervision as activity situated within the interaction of a community of practice. It suggests that ecologically valid evaluations <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> activity and the development of applicable systems <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> must consider a wide range <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> activities and contexts of practice...|$|R

Relative excess risks due to interaction (RERIs) were calculated to assess whether quality <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> modified the association between health and VERP. Results: Employees with poor health at baseline had an increased risk of VERP during follow-up (hazard ratio [HR]= 1. 23; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 02 – 1. 49). Quality <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> at baseline was not associated to VERP during follow-up (HR= 1. 04; 95 % CI 0. 90 – 1. 21). There was no statistically significant interaction of poor health and poor quality <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> with regard to risk of VERP (RERI=− 0. 33; 95 % CI − 1. 79 to 1. 14). Conclusions:This study did not support the notion that quality <b>of</b> <b>supervision</b> buffers the association between poor health and VERP. Future {{research is needed to determine}} whether other aspects <b>of</b> <b>supervision,</b> for example supervisors’ opportunities to effectuate workplace adjustments, may modify the association of poor health and VERP...|$|R
