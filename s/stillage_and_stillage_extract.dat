40|$|Ethanol {{is used as}} a fuel {{additive}} has resulted in rapid of growth of ethanol production. Thus the bio-based ethanol production {{has been one of the}} fastest growing industries in the U. S. The dry grinding corn ethanol process is more predominant than other ethanol production process in the U. S. In the dry grinding process, the corn is fermented to produce ethanol and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). The generated DDGS are primarily used by farmers to feed livestock. However, drying distillers grains consume energy and costs money. As a result, DDGS are more expensive than other distiller grains (Gorden, 2008). To reduce operational costs through drying process, some other distiller grains with relatively high moisture content, including whole <b>stillage,</b> thin <b>stillage,</b> <b>and</b> syrup could be considered as an alternative animal feed ingredient.

This product {{has the potential to be}} used as a novel feed ingredient for poultry, swine, or cattle diets. [Beta]-carotenes have been supplemented in animal diets to improve animal health, enhance meat color and quality and increase vitamin A concentrations in milk and meat. Microbial fermentations involving growth and product kinetics were performed in 500 mL baffled shake flasks and in a 5 L fermentation bioreactor. Media optimization was conducted in shake flasks to evaluate two carbon sources: glucose and glycerol, and two nitrogen sources: ammonium sulfate and urea. Final [beta]-carotene concentration of 272. 57 ± 4. 34 [mu]g [beta]-carotene/g biomass was found to be highest for the whole stillage, with 10 g/L added glucose and 10 g/L nitrogen added through ammonium sulfate supplementation. Glycerol addition yielded no significant increase (P<. 05) in [beta]-carotene yield, while urea addition significantly decreased (P<. 05) the final [beta]-carotene concentrations. The resulting fermented product can be blended with regular feed using either whole stillage as a dry feed ingredient or thin stillage as a liquid feed additive. The fermentation of whole stillage significantly influenced the physical and flow properties of the material. Even though there was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in bulk density and increase (P< 0. 05) in tapped density between DDGS <b>and</b> fermented whole <b>stillage,</b> there was a less pronounced difference between the whole <b>stillage</b> <b>and</b> fermented whole <b>stillage.</b> The fermentation of whole stillage significantly influenced the physical and flow properties of the material.

A 50 L bioreactor was specifically designed to evaluate the scalability of the process and to perform subsequent feed production trails. Pilot scale feed pelleting runs were conducted and the resultant product was put in environmental chambers to determine if [beta]-carotene concentration was reduced as a result of storage. There was a significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in [beta]-carotene levels after pelleting and after 28 d of storage at elevated temperature and humidity.

40|$|Assessing the {{economic}} and environmental benefits of constructing a biorefinery consisting of an ethanol plant, an anaerobic digester and a beef feedlot depends on understanding the methane potential of substrates available within the system. Fuel ethanol is produced from wheat in Western Canada and literature values for the methane potential of wheat-based ethanol byproducts is scarce. This study consisted of conducting biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays at thermophilic temperatures on ethanol byproducts typically produced downstream of distillation in wheat-based ethanol facilities. One experiment focused on the methane potential of the byproducts alone and two more experiments focused {{on the effect of}} amending the highest potential byproducts with feedlot manure at 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 volatile solids ratios of byproduct to manure. Methane yields for whole <b>stillage,</b> thin <b>stillage</b> <b>and</b> wet cake were 585 ± 32, 547 ± 76 and 495 ± 45 ml/g VS added, respectively. Reliable methane production rate constants for these byproducts could only be determined from the third experiment, but were 0. 106, 0. 090 and 0. 105 day- 1, respectively. When feedlot manure was added to the ethanol byproducts, methane yield results were proportionally equal to the ratio of byproduct to manure, except in the case of thin stillage. The combination of thin <b>stillage</b> <b>and</b> feedlot manure yielded 125 % and 119 % of expected results. Overall, feedlot manure stabilized and increased methane production rate constants for wheat-based ethanol byproducts. It was concluded from the results that whole stillage should be used in anaerobic digesters when manure is not available near ethanol facilities.

40|$|Introduction Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFA) are {{intermediates}} of the biogas process, thus {{can be produced}} from waste streams, and have a higher economic value {{as they can be}} used as industrial precursors and bulk chemicals. Several specific organisms present in mixed cultures have the capacity to elongate short VFA to caproate or others with a higher value using ethanol as a reducing agent. In this study we investigated different operational conditions to enhance VFA production from stillage of a bio-ethanol biorefinery. The main goals were to i) increase the titers of VFA; and ii) evaluate the ethanol requirements for carboxylate upgrade. Methods Two continuous reactors were fed with distilled <b>stillage</b> <b>and</b> operated at pH 5. 5 and 6. 5. They run for 300 days at different HRT. Batch tests with inoculum from reactor 5. 5 were performed with different proportions of beer <b>and</b> <b>stillage.</b> Results A decrease of HRT improved the production rate of VFA from 2. 7 to 8. 8 g COD L- 1 d- 1, but final concentration and composition remained similar within the same reactor (Fig. 1). A decrease of pH inhibited methane production by VFA present in acidic form, but also reduced VFA concentrations in the broth. pH reduction induced ethanol production and therefore, a higher presence of longer carboxylates. Mixing beer (ethanol-rich stream) in a fermentation broth included active yeast in the system and this used VFA to generate more ethanol available for chain elongation (Fig. 2). However, high concentrations of ethanol inhibited VFA production.

30|$|Bioethanol {{production}} proceeds {{in several}} stages. The {{most important factor}} for the efficiency of bioethanol production is the capacity of a microorganism to consume the entire starter compound {{to which it is}} exposed, and to perform the relevant biochemical reactions in a dynamic and coordinated manner. If all the required stages of conversion of sugars, formation of cellular energy and production of bioethanol are complete and synchronized, the production is effective. However, in the Brazilian industry, the presence of contaminants is a problem directly affecting process productivity (Costa et al. 2015). Contaminants found in Brazilian distilleries may be of bacterial or fungal origin, and may reduce bioethanol production by growth inhibition, reduction of nutrient availability, and increasing acidity (Bayrock et al. 2003). The origins of these contaminants include the soil, plant, must, <b>stillage,</b> <b>and</b> yeast cream after centrifugation in batch processes (Cabrini and Gallo 1999; Limtog et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} ultrasonic pretreatment on biochemical methane potential (BMP) of corn-ethanol by-products (dried distiller grain with solubles (DDGs), centrifuge-solids, thin <b>stillage,</b> <b>and</b> corn-syrup) and four types of animal manure (swine slurry, beef feedlot manure, dairy manure slurry, and solids separated dairy manure effluent) and energy efficiency of ultrasonic pretreatment. Ultrasonic pretreatment was applied with various amplitude and treatment time settings. Biogas production was measured and analyzed for methane content and methane yield. Ultrasonic pretreatment of DDGs, centrifuge-solids, swine slurry, beef feedlot manure, dairy manure slurry, and solids separated dairy manure effluent increased methane production by 25, 12, 14, 55, 37 and 8 %, respectively. An increase in ultrasonic amplitude and treatment time resulted in an overall increase in methane production, but with a reduction of energy efficiency. The greatest energy efficiency was obtained with the lowest ultrasonic amplitude combined with the shortest treatment time used...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{biochemical}} methane potential (BMP) production from anaerobic digestion of corn-ethanol by-products including dried distiller grain with solubles (DDGS), centrifuge solids, thin <b>stillage,</b> <b>and</b> corn-syrup {{as well as}} evaluating the effects of ultrasonic pretreatment on biogas production from these feedstocks. Ultrasonic pretreatment was applied with three amplitude settings of 33 % (52. 8 µm pp), 66 % (105. 6 µm pp), and 100 % (160 µm pp) as well as five time settings of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds, respectively, {{to each of the}} four by-products before setting up a bench top BMP trial. Biogas production was measured and analyzed for methane content and accumulated methane production. Without ultrasound pretreatment, corn-syrup had the highest methane production potential (408 ml/g VS added) compare to the other by-products. Methane production was increased by 25 and 12 % for the ultrasound pretreated DDGs samples and solids samples, respectively, compared with untreated samples. The ultrasonic pretreatment of ethanol co-products was shown to increase methane production from the anaerobic digestion of these products. The ultrasonic pre-treatment of solids co-products (DDGS and centrifuge solids) was far more effective than on liquid co-products (syrup <b>and</b> thin <b>stillage).</b> An energy balance showed that ultrasonic pretreatment of DDGS provided 70 % more energy than was required to operate the ultrasonic unit. An energy balance for other co-products however, indicated that the ultrasonic pre-treatment required more energy than was generated by the process in terms of additional biogas production...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of single-stage and two-stage anaerobic digestion processes for biomethane and biohydrogen production using thin stillage {{was performed to}} assess the viability of biohydrogen production from thin <b>stillage</b> <b>and</b> the impact of separating the acidogenic and methanogenic stages on anaerobic digestion with hydrogen production in the first stage. A comparative {{evaluation of}} anaerobic digester sludge (ADS) and acclimatized anaerobic digester sludge (AADS) for biohydrogen production was performed at various S°/X° ratios. The optimum range of S°/X° ratio for hydrogen production {{was found to be}} 1 to 2 gCOD/gVSS using conventional ADS and 3 to 6 gCOD/gVSS using AADS. Maximum methane yields of 0. 33 L CH 4 /gCODadded and 0. 26 L CH 4 /gCODadded were achieved in the two-stage and the single-stage processes, respectively. An artificial neural network model was developed to estimate the hydrogen production profile with time in batch studies and successfully predicted it with a correlation coefficient of 0. 965...|$|R
