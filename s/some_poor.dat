5|$|Struthers {{was one of}} six children, {{three boys}} and three girls. The boys were privately tutored in the classics, {{mathematics}} and modern languages at home in Brucefield House. They went out boating in summer, skating in winter on the nearby dam; they rode ponies, went swimming in the nearby Firth of Forth, and went for long walks with wealthy friends. Both his older brother James {{and his younger brother}} Alexander studied medicine. James Struthers became a doctor at Leith; Alexander Struthers died of cholera while serving as a doctor in the Crimean War. His sisters Janet and Christina provided a simple education at Brucefield for <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> friends, Daniel and James Thomson. Daniel (1833–1908) became a Dunfermline weaver as well as a historian and reformer.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season began}} {{with the promise of}} several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24million), Robinho (€30million) and Sergio Ramos (€27million). However, Real Madrid {{suffered}} from <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005. Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal, 6–1 to Real Zaragoza. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the workhouse {{can be traced to}} the Poor Law Act of 1388, which {{attempted}} to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. But mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. <b>Some</b> <b>Poor</b> Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates, who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market. Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing bones to produce fertiliser, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike, perhaps the origin of the workhouse's nickname.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} started with Botha kicking a penalty {{to make the}} score 10–3. However Botha missed two further penalty kicks which proved crucial in {{the result of the}} match. Following a {{clearance}} kick from Robert du Preez, John Kirwan scored a try for New Zealand with Fox converting, making the score 17–3, before Fox scored another penalty to make it 20–3. Later in the match Danie Gerber scored a try for the Springboks which Botha converted. Following <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> tackling, John Timu scored for the All Blacks, with the try again being converted by Fox. In the last 5 minutes of the match, South Africa scored two tries from Pieter Muller and Gerber with both being converted by Botha with the last kick of the game to make the final score 27–24.|$|E
5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, <b>some</b> <b>Poor</b> Law boards granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These boards used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant boards, and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such boards. Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three boards, replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E

5|$|The Lancashire Thunder {{took on the}} Loughborough Lightning in {{the fourth}} match of the tournament, and the two teams {{combined}} to score over 300 runs. Amy Satterthwaite scored a rapid 52 runs from 32 balls for the Thunder to help them reach 164 for eight. A combination of good bowling from the Thunder bowlers, and <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> run outs hindered the Lightning's batting. Sophie Ecclestone took three wickets with her spin bowling as the Lightning collapsed to 77 for eight. A partnership of 69 runs between Thea Brookes and Paige Scholfield gave Loughborough a chance at chasing down the total, but late wickets for Hayley Matthews saw Lancashire win by six runs. The next day, Yorkshire batted first against Surrey and scored 134 for five, largely due to runs from Hollie Armitage (43) and Lauren Winfield (29). Surrey's Alex Hartley was the pick of the bowlers, taking two wickets and restricting the Diamonds to 18 runs from her four overs. In their reply, Tammy Beaumont, Bryony Smith and Nat Sciver all made good starts to help their side chase down the total and give the Stars a six wicket victory with 11 balls remaining. Lancashire Thunder hosted the Southern Vipers in their third match of the tournament. The Vipers batted first and scored 132 for 4, helped by a score of 54 not out from Sara McGlashan. The Thunder lost Matthews from the fourth ball of their batting innings, but then recovered with a 57-run second wicket partnership between Satterthwaite and Emma Lamb. The pair were dismissed two overs apart, and Lancashire failed to score the runs they needed, falling 11 runs short of the Vipers' total.|$|E
25|$|After <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> {{form with}} the bat, Pettini decided to resign his county {{captaincy}} for {{all forms of}} the game in June 2010. James Foster took over as Essex captain. Pettini then took a few weeks off to work on his batting.|$|E
25|$|Cost {{recovery}} in rural water schemes has apparently improved in those schemes that are run as public-private partnerships, {{despite the fact}} that <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> users receive water for free. Private operators also pay a monthly rent to the districts for the right to use the systems, which remain publicly owned.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{epidemic}} proportions of obesity in the Western world, {{and the fact}} that it is increasing rapidly in <b>some</b> <b>poorer</b> countries, observers expect developments in this area to snowball in the near future. Dieting alone is ineffective in most obese adults - and even obese adults who successfully lose weight through dieting overwhelmingly put weight back on afterwards.|$|R

50|$|The biggest sums of aid {{money were}} given to the {{affected}} boyars, important merchants and even relatives of the commission members (such as Elenca Califarov, receiving 8000 lei), some of them receiving over 10,000 lei, while many of the poorer people receiving only 100-200 lei. This led to discontent, with <b>some</b> <b>poorer</b> craftsmen sending petitions and refusing to accept the sums.|$|R
25|$|Thanks to <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> {{weather and}} some {{resolute}} Australian batting {{on the last}} day the Test was a draw, leaving the teams 0–0. Even though the first two Tests had been drawn the press were optimistic about the series. Lindsay Hassett said it wasn't the best team England had sent to Australia, but no other tried so hard to make cricket interesting.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of fires in 1741, the city became panicked that blacks planned to burn the city in {{conspiracy}} with <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> whites. Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear, but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites, who {{over a period of}} months were convicted of arson. Of these, the city executed 13 blacks by burning them alive and hanged 4 whites and 18 blacks.|$|E
25|$|Houston later {{embarked}} on a world tour, entitled the Nothing but Love World Tour. It was her first world tour in over ten years and was announced as a triumphant comeback. However, <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> reviews and rescheduled concerts brought some negative media attention. Houston canceled some concerts because of illness and received widespread negative reviews from fans who were disappointed {{in the quality of}} her voice and performance. Some fans reportedly walked out of her concerts.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 {{the number}} of donkeys {{in the world was}} {{reported}} to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in <b>some</b> <b>poorer</b> nations, conversion of forests to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{a fairly}} solid start to his {{international}} career, Shah could not produce the required consistency of form, making {{just one more}} fifty in ten innings from 2001/02 to 2002/03. He also suffered from a perception that his fielding was below par, something close to unforgivable in the modern one-day game, and he was dropped from the England side without having had a chance at Test cricket. In 2004, a year of success with the bat (1,336 runs at 53.44) was tempered {{by the loss of}} his Middlesex captaincy in mid-season after <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> results.|$|E
25|$|The new batsman Ricky Ponting {{walked in}} and was greeted by Ajit Agarkar's {{beautiful}} first over, but Agarkar was quickly removed from the attack after <b>some</b> <b>poor</b> bowling resulted in damage of his figures which read: 5–1–40–0. Then having no other options, Ganguly turned towards the only spinner in his team, Harbhajan Singh. Harbhajan had dismissed Ponting five times in the 2000–01 series and had troubled the Australians with 32 wickets in three tests, but this time his first ball was savagely cut by Langer, and then Ponting dealt {{with him in the}} same manner.|$|E

To quell social unrest, provincial governors padded their payrolls.

The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God.

However, Azerbaijan managed to finish qualification cycle in fourth place, team's best ever finish. In December 2013, Vogts being granted a new two-year contract, with aim to lead Azerbaijan through EURO 2016 qualifying. On July 2014, Azerbaijan beat its ranking record by reaching 73rd place in FIFA World Rankings. Following three straight losses, Vogts has resigned from his post after spending six years in charge of Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|The {{education}} of boys began {{in their own}} home up until the age of seven when they had to attend school. There, they had several teachers who taught them to read and write, as well as subjects such as mathematics and music. Boys also had to take part in physical education classes where they were prepared for future military service with activities such as wrestling, racing, jumping and gymnastics. At eighteen they served in the army and were instructed on how to bear arms. Physical education was very intense and many of the boys ended up becoming true athletes. In addition to these compulsory lessons, the students had the chance to discuss and learn from the great philosophers, grammarians and orators of the time. <b>Some</b> <b>poor</b> people had to stay at home and help their parents.
