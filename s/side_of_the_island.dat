5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> platform. The disused platform is used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining wall. In the 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E

5|$|Gaelic {{was still}} spoken widely on Arran at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. The 1901 Census reported 25–49 per cent Gaelic speakers on the eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and 50–74 per cent on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> By 1921 the proportion for the whole island had dropped to less than 25 per cent. However, Nils Holmer quotes the Féillire (a Gaelic almanack) reporting 4,532 inhabitants on the island in 1931 with 605 Gaelic speakers, showing that Gaelic had declined to about 13 per cent of the population. It continued to decline until the last native speakers of Arran Gaelic died in the 1990s. Current Gaelic speakers on Arran originate from other areas in Scotland. In 2011, 2.0 per cent of Arran residents aged three and over could speak Gaelic.|$|E
