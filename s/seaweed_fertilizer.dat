40|$|Rescuing biochar: Pre - {{application}} techniques to enhance plant responses to biochar additions: Nigel Gale, U of Toronto A {{growing body of}} literature indicates variable responses of different plant species to biochar, including positive, neutral, and negative, suggesting {{that it is important}} to investigate the nature and mechanism of species-specific responses to biochar additions. Neutral or negative plant responses to additions of biochars have commonly been reported in prior studies, and are likely the result of a combination of changes in soil properties (e. g. pH, surface area, and nutrient and water retention) and the production of volatile organic compounds from pyrolysis. In a series of greenhouse studies in Toronto, Ontario, we tested the effects of: dosage (0, 5, 10, 20, 50 t/ha); biochar type (Maple batch and Spruce batch 475 °C, Maple flow-through 575 °C); and application method (complete mixing vs. top dressing) on the growth and performance of two temperate species commonly used as forage crops and for erosion control: Lolium multiflorum, and Trifolium repens. Freshly produced biochars generally resulted in neutral or negative biomass and leaf area responses regardless of the dosage, biochar type, or application method. Pyrolysis typically produces biochars that contain significant amounts of volatile organic compounds that may have substantial inhibitory effects on plant growth. We subsequently tested methods to ameliorate effects of toxic compounds sorbed by biochars during production, using washing (with water and oil) and convection heating (50 - 150 °C) techniques prior to biochar application. Preliminary results demonstrated that heating biochars at 100 - 150 °C for 24 hours reduced toxic effects exhibited in leaf area by 20 % for Lolium grown in mixed biochars applications. Similarly, Lolium grown in water-washed biochars showed a 17 % increase in leaf area relative to non-washed controls in soils where biochar was applied as a top dressing. Our results suggest that pre-application heating and/or washing treatments may substantially enhance plant responses to biochar, in some cases reversing negative effects. Intuitive Inoculation: Doug Clayton, Dale Hendricks Pre-treating biochar by incorporating it into the composting process has become standard practice for many gardeners, small farmers and permaculturists. Doug and Dale have not only been layering biochar into their compost piles but also pre-soaking their biochars in liquid fish and <b>seaweed</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> molasses, fermented teas, human urine, etc. We are suggesting that incorporating biochar into a comprehensive combination of “composting” processes (hot, cold, vermi-, ferments, etc.), using all of nature’s avenues for breaking down organic matter, may provide a superior biochar treatment. There may be no better inoculation of biochar than that achieved by passing it through a worm’s gut. Both “red wigglers” and “night crawlers” make this an easy process to achieve. Worms thrive in finely ground, urine soaked biochar. Biochar can assist with the efficient and safe recycling of urine, maintaining the fertility of hundreds of square feet of garden plot, giving those who already have fertile soil, and seemingly lack a problem for biochar to fix, an avenue of beneficial use. We will show compost nutrient level test results and pictures of our processes and plant trials...|$|R

Methods: Experiments were conducted on ground nut to study the potential red alga of H. musciformis as a biofertilizer. The seeds were sown in soil and SLF were added to soil bed in five different concentrations separately (1 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 % and 8 % w/v). Results: The 2 % concentration of water extract showed better results of growth parameters, biochemical and pigments constitutions. Among the different concentrations of SLF investigated, the plants that received with 2 % SLF showed maximum germination percentage, fresh weight, dry weight, root and shoot length, number of branches, leaf area, root nodules and content of total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a and b, protein, carbohydrate and lipid were observed at 2 % concentration of SLF. The leaf of 2 % SLF treated A. hypogea has subjected to Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive spectroscopic analysis, it revealed {{that the presence of}} ten elements in the following order: Ca>P>N>Na>K>Mg>Mn>S>Fe>Zn in treated and Ca>N>P>Na>Mg>Mn>K>Zn>S>Fe in control plant.

30|$|This is in {{accordance}} with the earlier reports that lower concentrations of seaweed extracts enhanced the biochemical constituents in Cajanus cajan (Erulan et al. 2009), Brassica nigra (Kalidass et al. 2010), Citrullus lanatus (Abdel-Mawgoud et al. 2010), Trigonella foenum-graecum (Pise and Sabale 2010), Solanum melongena (Bozorgi 2012) and Abelmoschus esculentus (Sasikumar et al. 2011). In our study, reducing sugar was found to be increased twofold when 1.5  % of S. marginatum was given to brinjal plants. The increase in reducing sugar (201  %) {{may be due to the}} presence of magnesium (Table  1) which could have triggered chlorophyll synthesis and thereby subsequently increasing the photosynthetic rate in the plants. The increase in photosynthetic pigments may be also be due to the presence of betaines (Blunden et al. 1997), increase in number and size of the chloroplast and better grana development (Atzmon and Van Staden 1994) in the SLE-treated plants. Moreover, the increase in the protein content and nitrate reductase activity at lower concentrations of SLE confirmed the efficiency of foliar spray as it enhanced the absorption of most of the necessary elements by the seedlings. The increase in chlorophyll content could also be a result of reduction in chlorophyll degradation, which might be caused in part by betaines in the seaweed liquid extract (Whapman et al. 1993). In addition, in a study, 1  % Ulva lactuca extract along with 50  % recommended rate of chemical fertilizers enhanced the content of protein, carbohydrate and lipid in Tagetus erecta (Sridhar and Rengasamy 2010).

This study aimed at evaluating the effects of inoculation and application of seaweed extract, molybdenum and rock powder, {{as an alternative to the}} application of urea, in beans. A randomized blocks design, with three replications, was used. Two common bean cultivars (Pérola and FEPAGRO 26), as well as the following cultivation methods, were used: i) conventional; ii) inoculation with a mixture of three inoculants recommended for bean; iii) inoculation + complementation via seeds, with extracts of the Ascophyllum nodosum <b>seaweed</b> and mineral <b>fertilizer</b> containing rock powder and molybdenum; iv) inoculation + complementation via leaf, using products with extracts of the Ascophyllum nodosumseaweed and mineral fertilizer containing rock powder and molybdenum. The inoculation alone is not enough to reach grain yield levels similar to those reached using the conventional method. The cultivation method with inoculation + complementation via seeds maintains grain yield with the lowest cost, in relation to the conventional method...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{faced in}} {{cultivation}} of ginger is {{the availability of}} uniform plant propagation materials. Ginger is propagated through underground rhizomes. Growth of the rhizome is not uniform, since the shoots do not sprout at the same time. Most of the rhizomes were attacked by several diseases such as bacterial wilt, soft rot, and nematodes. Propagation of plant material through in-vitro culture is also an obstacle since the price of pure agar and chemicals is very expensive. Therefore, production of cheap, uniform and disease-free plant materials with rapid multiplication rate {{is necessary for the}} successful ginger cultivation. The use of alternative media on in-vitro culture of ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) cv. Gajah was conducted in order to substitute cheaper alternative media for in-vitro culture of ginger. An experiment using two basic composition of media (MS and liquid fertilizer) and three different types of agar (seaweed, Swallow and Oxoid agar) was done at the Tissue Culture Laboratory of Center for Research and Development of Isotope and Radiation Technology, Jakarta. The result showed that the highest shoot height, number of shoot and leaf was obtained from medium composition of sea weed and MS. Whilst the medium of Oxoid agar and MS produced the longest and the highest number of root. The cheapest medium was found from <b>seaweed</b> and liquid <b>fertilizer</b> composition, whereas the most expensive medium was from Oxoid agar and MS composition. Seaweed and Swallow agar in MS media showed similar growth performance as well as Oxoid agar in development of ginger plantlets...|$|R
