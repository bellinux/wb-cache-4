5|$|The allotropes {{of carbon}} include graphite, {{one of the}} softest known substances, and diamond, the hardest {{naturally}} occurring substance. It bonds readily with other small atoms including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable covalent bonds with suitable, multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, {{a large majority of}} all chemical compounds. Carbon also has the highest <b>sublimation</b> <b>point</b> of all elements. At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330°C or 7,820°F), so it sublimes at about 3,900K. Graphite is much more reactive than diamond at standard conditions, despite being more thermodynamically stable, as its delocalised pi system is much more vulnerable to attack. For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated nitric acid at standard conditions to mellitic acid, C6(CO2H)6, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.|$|E

The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's <b>sublimation</b> <b>point</b> of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel {{post-combustion}} CO 2 capture process concept is proposed and developed, based on cryogenic CO 2 freeze-out in dynamically operated packed beds.

H 2 O and CO 2 will condensate and desublimate, respectively, extracting the cold energy stored in the packing and therefore avoiding unacceptable pressure drop or plugging. Great advantage is that both H 2 O and CO 2 can be separated from a flue gas simultaneously, circumventing costly pretreatment steps. Furthermore, no chemical absorbent or elevated pressures are required. Experiments have been carried out and demonstrated that CO 2 can be well separated from N 2. The process is described by a pseudo-homogeneous 1 D model. The resulting simulations show good resemblance with experiments...|$|R

Adaptations are defense mechanisms; there are bad ones like paranoia, and healthy ones like humor, anticipation, and <b>sublimation.</b> Set <b>point</b> theory [...] which is the subject of much debate in psychology [...] posits that people can adapt to anything, such as bad health, divorce, and extreme poverty, and return to a natural level of cheerfulness.

40|$|The {{advancing}} {{complexity of}} advanced microelectronic devices is placing rigorous demands on currently used PVD and CVD deposition techniques. The ALD deposition method is proposed {{to meet the}} film thickness and conformality constraints needed by the semiconductor industry in future manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, there is {{a limited number of}} chemical precursors available that have high thermal stability, reactivity, and vapor pressure suitable for ALD film growth to occur. These properties collectively contribute to the lack of suitable transition metal precursors available for use in ALD. In this thesis, we report the discovery of a series of novel transition metal diazadienate precursors that promising properties deemed suitable for ALD. The volatility and thermal stability of the new transition metal diazadienyl compounds were studied by preparative sublimation and capillary tube melting point/decomposition experiments. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) demonstrate precursor residues of less than 4 % at 500 Â°C. In addition, <b>sublimation</b> data, melting <b>points,</b> and decomposition temperatures for all complexes are presented. The manganese diazadienyl complex has the highest decomposition temperature of the series of complexes produced (325 Â°C). During preparative sublimations, the product recoveries of all transition metal diazadienyl complexes were greater than 92. 0 % with nonvolatile residues of less than 7. 0 %. This is an excellent indication that these complexes may be suitable candidates as metal precursors for ALD. Nickel nitride (NixN) films have been studied as an intermediate material for the formation of both nickel metal and nickel silicide using chemical vapor deposition. Herein, we describe the ALD growth of nickel nitride thin films from bis(1, 4 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 3 -diazabutadiene) nickel(II) (Ni(tBu 2 DAD) 2) and 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine. An ALD window for the deposition of nickel nitride films on 500 nm thermal SiO 2 substrates was observed between 225 and 240 Â°C with a constant growth rate of 0. 70 Ã/cycle. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed all expected ionizations with carbon concentrations below the detection limit after argon ion sputtering. Due to preferential nitrogen sputtering in XPS, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) were performed and subsequently revealed Ni:N ratios between 2 - 4 for films deposited within the ALD window. AFM measurements revealed a RMS roughness value of 10. 8 nm on an as-deposited film at 225 Â°C. All as-deposited films were amorphous as determined by X-ray diffraction. Copper is the primary interconnect material in microelectronics devices, due to its high conductivity and low affinity towards electromigration. With transistor gate lengths scheduled to reach 14 nm by 2014, there are severe demands upon the current film growth techniques used in device fabrication. The ALD film growth method is ideally suited for future microelectronics manufacturing, since it inherently provides highly conformal thin films, even in high aspect ratio nanoscale features, and allows sub-nanometer control over film thicknesses. In Chapter 4, we describe the atomic layer deposition of high purity, low resistivity copper metal thin films using a three precursor sequence entailing Cu(dmap) 2, formic acid, and hydrazine. In this process, Cu(dmap) 2 is unreactive towards hydrazine but is transformed to copper(II) formate, which is then readily reduced to copper metal by subsequent hydrazine exposure. The present work therefore addresses a central problem with the ALD growth of metal thin films: low reactivity of metal precursors toward common reducing agents. A constant growth rate of 0. 47 - 0. 50 Ã/cycle upon prime grade Si(100) was observed at substrate temperatures between 100 and 170 Â°C. Compositional analyses (XPS and TOF-ERDA) revealed copper films with low levels of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Powder X-ray diffraction spectra of all films showed polycrystalline copper. The resistivities of films grown between 100 and 140 Â°C ranged between 9. 6 and 16. 4 μΩ*cm, demonstrating the growth of high purity, low resistivity copper films. An AFM measurement revealed a RMS roughness value of 3. 5 nm on an as-deposited 50 nm Cu film at 120 Â°C...|$|R

We use the improved disk model to calculate the temperature variation for a range of planet masses and distances and find that planets at the gap-opening threshold can induce temperature variations of up to +/- 30 %. Temperature variations this significant may have ramifications for planetary accretion rates and migration rates.

While at temperatures below and close to the <b>sublimation</b> <b>point</b> of coronene, nanotubes with suitable diameters are filled with single coronene molecules, at higher temperatures additional dimerization and oligomerization of coronene occurs on the surface of carbon nanotubes. The fact that dicoronylene and possible higher oligomers are formed at lower temperatures than expected for vapor-phase polymerization indicates the active role of the carbon surface used primarily as template. Removal of adsorbed species from the nanotube surface is of utmost importance for reliable characterization of encapsulated molecules: it is demonstrated that the green fluorescence attributed previously to encapsulated coronene is instead caused by dicoronylene adsorbed on the surface which can be solubilized and removed using surfactants. After removing most of the adsorbed layer, a combination of Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy was employed to follow the transformation dynamics of coronene molecules inside nanotubes...|$|E
