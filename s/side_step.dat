25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to <b>side</b> <b>step,</b> and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|A player {{could also}} try to get around a defender by stepping, swerving, or goose-stepping past them. To sidestep a defender, the attacking player takes a wide step in one {{direction}} while running forward and then shifts their body weight in the opposite direction. If successful the defender will be off balance, allowing the attacker to accelerate past. When swerving, an attacker runs straight at the defender, but before making contact accelerates and sways to the outside. Although similar to a <b>side</b> <b>step,</b> the swerve involves less sideways movement, but results in less loss of speed. The goose-step is a move made famous by David Campese and involves slowing down while running {{on the outside of}} the opponent, causing them to also slow, before accelerating away.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

25|$|There are two centres in a rugby team, inside centre (number 12) {{and outside}} centre (number 13). The inside centre usually stands {{close to the}} fly-half or at first {{receiver}} {{on the other side}} of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres' main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They need to run good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to <b>side</b> <b>step</b> and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.|$|E

500|$|All of the in-game objects (including non-player characters) in Virtual Theatre {{occupied}} space, {{which was}} a unique feature for an engine at the time. Consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, {{as well as the}} player had to <b>side</b> <b>step</b> them. When a non-player character bypassed the protagonist, he or she uttered a comment (like [...] "Excuse me, Sir"). As the result, the engine achieved a more realistic game world than previous engines were able to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{characteristics}} of the foot pressure distribution for primary movements in football (soccer) using an insole pressure distribution measurement system (F-scan system; Nitta Inc). For this study, six male university football players were instructed to carry out typical movements such as sprinting, running backwards, <b>side</b> <b>stepping,</b> diving, turning and jumping. The pressure distribution was analyzed with the foot divided into 12 areas. In the case of sprinting movement, the maximum vertical peak pressure was observed on the area of the first metatarsal head or the hallux. In the case of running backwards, there was little pressure on the area of heel. On both the fore foot and the rear foot in the case of <b>side</b> <b>stepping</b> movement, the maximum vertical peak pressure was observed on the area of first metatarsal head. The path trajectory of the centre of pressure was through the longitudinal section of the sole of the foot without the case of running backwards and <b>side</b> <b>stepping...</b>|$|R
