This thesis explores ways of doing sketch recognition by extracting as much information as possible from temporal patterns that appear during sketching. (cont.) We present a sketch recognition framework based on hierarchical statistical models of temporal patterns. We show that in certain domains, stroke orderings used in the course of drawing individual objects contain temporal patterns that can aid recognition. We build on this work to show how sketch recognition systems can use knowledge of both common stroke orderings and common object orderings. We describe a statistical framework based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks that can learn temporal models of object-level and stroke-level patterns for recognition. Our framework supports multi-object strokes, multi-stroke objects, and allows interspersed drawing of objects - relaxing the assumption that objects are drawn one at a time. Our system also supports real-valued feature representations using a numerically stable recognition algorithm. We present recognition results for hand-drawn electronic circuit diagrams. The results show that modeling temporal patterns at multiple scales provides a significant increase in correct recognition rates, with no added computational penalties. by Tevfik Metin Sezgin.

40|$|This paper uses a Foucauldian discursive {{approach}} {{to shed light}} into how organisational actors are ‘made’ to act as strategists, incorporating into their work practices the demands and expectations {{of what it means}} to be a strategist in a specific context at a specific time. It draws on a Foucauldian understanding of governing and self formation to explore the ways in which actors work on themselves in order to act meaningfully as strategists. I argue that, rather than organisational identities being <b>static</b> or <b>finished,</b> organisational actors actively say and do things in their continual attempts to attain a more complete, acceptable and congruent identity. In contexts with high degrees of uncertainty and heavily power- and conflict-laden relationships, both discourses of how strategy is made and the practices involved in it can be seen as exercises (askesis) which strategists actively perform to better embrace their responsibility of rendering the future governable for others. The paper brings together the literatures on identity and on strategic practices to show the dialectic relationship between them...|$|R
40|$|Since several years, {{the term}} {{emergence}} is {{mentioned in the}} paradigm of chaos and complexity. Following this approach, complex system constituted by multitude of individual develop global behavioural properties {{on the base of}} local chaotic interactions (self-organization). These theories, developed in scientific and philosophical milieus are rapidly spreading as a “way of thinking” in the several fields of cognitive activities. According to this “way of thinking” it is possible revise some fundamental themes as the economic systems, the cultural systems, the scientific paths, the communication nets under a new approach where nothing is pre-determined, but the global evolution is determined by specific mechanisms of interaction and fundamental events (bifurcation). With a jump in scale of the life, also other basic concepts related to the individuals as intelligence, consciousness, psyche can be revised as self-organizing phenomena.   Such a conceptual fertility has been the base for the revision of the artistic activities as flexible instruments for the investigation of imaginary worlds, metaphor of related real worlds. In this sense we claim to the artist a role of “researcher”. Through the free exploration of new concepts, he can evoke qualities, configurations and hypothesis which have an esthetical and expressive value and in the most significant cases, they can induce nucleation of cultural and scientific bifurcation. Our vision of the art-science relation is of cooperative type instead of the conflict of the past decades.   In this paper we describe some of the most significant realized artworks in order to make explicit the concepts and basic themes. One of the fundamental topics is the way to generate and think to the artwork. Our characterization is to see the artwork not as a <b>static</b> <b>finished</b> product, but as an instance or a dynamic sequence of instances of a creative process which continuously evolves. In this sense, the attention is focused on the “generative ideai which constitutes the envelop of the artworks generable by the process. In this approach the role of technology (computers, synthesizers) is fundamental to create the dimension of the generative environment. Another characterizing aspect of our artworks is derived by the previous approach and specifically related to the interactive installations. The classical relation between artist, artwork and observers is viewed as an unidirectional flux of messages from the artist to the observer through the artwork. In our approach artist, artwork and observer are autonomous entities provided with own personality which jointly intervene to determine the creative paths. The artist which generate the environment in not longer the “owner” of the artwork, simply he dialectically bring the generative environment (provided by a certain degree of autonomy) towards cultural and creative “void” spaces (not still discovered). The observers start from these platforms to generate other creative paths, sometimes absolutely unexpected, developing their new dialectical relations with the artwork itself. The results derived by these positions characterize the expressive elements of the artworks (images, sequences and sounds) as the outcomes of emergent behaviour or dynamics both in the sense of esthetical shapes emergent from fertile generative environments, either in terms of emergent relations between artist, artwork and observer, either in terms of concepts which emerge by the metaphor of artificial worlds to produce imaginary hypothesis for the real worlds. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new code, Lorene's Ghost (for Lorene's {{gravitational}} handling of spectral transport) developed {{to treat the}} problem of neutrino transport in supernovae {{with the use of}} spectral methods. First, we derive the expression for the nonrelativistic Liouville operator in doubly spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi, epsilon, Theta, Phi) $, and further its general relativistic counterpart. We use the 3 + 1 formalism with the conformally flat approximation for the spatial metric, to express the Liouville operator in the Eulerian frame. Our formulation does not use any approximations when dealing with the angular arguments (theta, phi, Theta, Phi), and is fully energy-dependent. This approach is implemented in a spherical shell, using either Chebyshev polynomials or Fourier series as decomposition bases. It is here restricted to simplified collision terms (isoenergetic scattering) and to the case of a <b>static</b> fluid. We <b>finish</b> this paper by presenting test results using basic configurations, including general relativistic ones in the Schwarzschild metric, in order to demonstrate the convergence properties, the conservation of particle number and correct treatment of some general-relativistic effects of our code. The use of spectral methods enables to run our test cases in a six-dimensional setting on a single processor. Comment: match published versio...|$|R
50|$|After {{a podium}} finish at Formula Student Germany 2013 in the Cost Analysis Event, the season 2014 team {{successfully}} completed the registration for both Formula Student Germany and Formula Student Czech Republic 2014. The team headed to Hockenheimring, Germany {{in the end}} of July 2014 where they easily cleared the Technical Inspection and the Tilt Test and also competed successfully in all the <b>static</b> events and <b>finished</b> 31st out of the 74 participating teams in the Business Plan Presentation. The FMX4 could not compete in the Dynamic events due to a sudden and unfortunate engine failure which could not be fixed in time. However, the team bought another engine in Germany as it was easily available and more economically feasible. The FMX4 then went to CzechRing, Czech Republic with a new engine aiming to blaze through all events. The team cleared all parts of the Technical Scrutiny with ease and also completed all the static events with commendable results. The car completed the Acceleration event with a timing of 4.81 seconds and Skidpad event with a timing of 8.120s. The car blazed through AutoCross with a timing of 71.710s. Unfortunately, the team could complete only half of the endurance due to a bent suspension bolt in the rear LHS pick-up point. Having competed at two international competitions, the team set about testing the car rigorously after it arrived home.|$|R
40|$|In the {{interest}} of applying reader response theory to journalism this paper posits that readers of newspapers, like readers of literature, {{take an active role}} in making meaning from the articles they read, rather than passively accepting news as a <b>finished,</b> <b>static</b> product. Additionally, it proposes that journalism textbooks pay little attention to the role of the reader, hence affecting the way future journalists will write. Specific areas addressed in the paper are: (1) the news as narrative, which discusses two views of the structure of news stories; (2) audience approaches in cultural studies, which offers various notions of how audiences go about interpreting news articles; (3) literary reader response theories; (4) inter-meeia differences, which examines the differences in roles of readers of literature and viewers of film and television; (5) the role of readers in journalism textbooks; and (6) "New Journalism " as metalanguage. The paper concludes that by incorporating reader response theory in 3 ournalism education, and changing the way journalists think, they may come to understand how readers differ from one another, how they differ from reporters, and how reporters and readers together make meaning, while the study of the linguistic and conceptual forms used by real people to give meaning to their situations would offer journalists new rhetorical tools.

40|$|Precision cutting, {{considering}} the time, cost and flexib ility of the production, {{has been one}} of the major goals in manufacturing. Especially using new technological tools such as linear motors, laser and piezoelectric actuators in cutting operations to increase the accuracy of the workpieces produced, is becoming more popular day by day. In this thesis, a new precision cutting system is developed to decrease the basic workpiece errors (straightness, roundness, diameter error, etc.) for commercial CNC lathes in a cheaper way. In order to characterise the CNC lathe, a laser displacement sensor is used. A mechanical design with piezo stack actuator and tool tip, i. e. piezo based cutting device (PBCD), is inserted on the turret of CNC lathe to give both <b>static</b> and dynamic <b>finish</b> cutting operation of PBCD. FEA (Finite Element Analysis) tool is used at the design stage of PBCD. The controller of PBCD is PID (Proportional Integrate Derivative) control that is running in the dSPACE software. In dynamic operation of PBCD, instantaneous angular position of CNC lathe spindle is specified by means of the rotary encoder. And it is used in the control loop for active elimination of roundness errors of cylindrical workpieces during cutting operation. The results after assessment of the measurements of cylindrical workpieces are encouraging. In static operation of PBCD, the finish cutting decreases the roundness error at an amount of at least 30 % with respect to the operation without control of PBCD. In most CNC turning machines, if cutting conditions such as cutting speed and feed, tool geometry and vibration are not changed, the workpiece geometric errors are mostly repeatable. So it may not be needed to measure the geometric errors of the same workpiece produced at the same cutting conditions after each cutting operation. Especially in mass production, all cutting conditions and workpiece produced are same. So, the PBCD would be very useful tool in mass production regarding the repeatability of workpiece geometric errors...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{microbial}} community {{is important for}} monitoring the performance of biological processes. One of the most simple, quantitative and high reproducible method for analysis of the {{microbial community}} is lipoquinone profile method. Lipoquinone is constituent of bacterial plasma membrane that is essential for electron transporter. Lipoquinone {{could be used as}} a biomarker to analyze the microbial community because in general one species or genus of bacteria has one dominant type of lipoquinone, thus any changes in the lipoquinone profile would reflect the changes in the microbial community. The method for lipoquinone determination in environmental sample is direct extraction using organic solvent and analysis using chromatography system. Since the method is tedious and uses a large amount of organic solvent, the on-line supercritical fluid extraction-high performance liquid chromatography (on-line SFE-HPLC) has been developed to simplify the method, and was successful determine lipoquinone compounds in activated sludges. The effect of static extraction time on extraction efficiencies of the lipoquinone was investigated in order to eliminate the water pump and methanol pump in the previous system. The CO 2 was used as an extraction solvent. The 0. 1 g of freeze dried activated sludge was placed into a 1 mL stainless steel extraction vessel and methanol was spiked into the sludge as a modifier. The SFE was connected to HPLC by using trapping column as an interface for collecting lipoquinone extracted from the sludge. The static extraction time was conducted by allowed the matrix to immersed in CO 2 and methanol. When the <b>static</b> extraction time <b>finished,</b> the dynamic extraction time was carried out. The extracted and trapped lipoquinone then directly transferred to HPLC system for determination. In this study, the effect of static, dynamic extraction time and volume of spiked methanol were optimized using simplified on-line SFEHPLC for lipoquinone analysis. The best results in terms of extraction yield were obtained at 25 MPa, 45 °C, 10 min static extraction time with 500 µL methanol spiked, and 25 min dynamic extraction time with 0. 9 mL min- 1 CO 2 flow rate. It was concluded that the developed method could simplify the online SFE-HPLC system of lipoquinone determination which is useful for a rapid and routine analysis of microbial community in activated sludge...|$|R
