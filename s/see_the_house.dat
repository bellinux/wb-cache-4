5|$|While Governor, Edwards' first {{official}} {{role was to}} christen Alan Bond's America Cup challenger, Southern Cross. One of the couple's first visitors to the Governor's estate was {{a man by the}} name of Thomas Dunhill, who had consumed ten beers and wanted to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Lady Edwards apparently found him in the pantry; he was arrested by the police but no charges were laid. Ill health forced Edwards to resign his vice-regal appointment on 2 April 1975, and he and Lady Edwards went to live in Sydney, where he continued in semi-retirement with commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E

Though he was initially active in the Lords, his career there was cut short by the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the right of most hereditary peers to a seat in the parliament.

2500|$|On 18 August 2010 the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that plans were in motion to redevelop the home into a multi-unit apartment building, stating [...] "The hammers start raining blows on Undershaw {{as early as}} next month." [...] The plan continued to be opposed by the preservationists, who wanted to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> maintained as a single structure in whatever form it is subsequently put to, such as a home or museum. [...] They had been frustrated when attempts to promote Undershaw into the top rank of protected buildings failed. A government report stated that the house was not architecturally notable, and that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was not of the same standing as Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.|$|E
2500|$|Springfield {{introduced}} the Motown sound {{to a wider}} UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs, and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, and Stevie Wonder on {{a special edition of}} the Ready Steady Go! show – which was produced by Wickham – called The Sound of Motown. On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening when you go out there and you <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All I See Is You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20. In August and September 1966, she hosted Dusty, a six-part music and talk show weekly BBC TV series. A compilation of her singles, Golden Hits released in November 1966, reached No.2 in the UK. From the mid-1960s, Springfield would use the pseudonym [...] "Gladys Thong" [...] when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair co-wrote [...] "I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] with Lesley Duncan, which appeared as the B-side of [...] "Goin' Back." ...|$|E
