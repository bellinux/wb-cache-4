Harry Potter creator J. K. Rowling called Rickman [...] "a magnificent actor and a wonderful man". Emma Watson wrote, [...] "I feel so lucky to have worked and spent time with such a special man and actor. I'll really miss our conversations." [...] Daniel Radcliffe appreciated his loyalty and support: [...] "I'm pretty sure he came and saw everything I ever did on stage both in Britain and America. He didn't have to do that." [...] Evanna Lynch said it was scary to bump into Rickman in character as Snape, but [...] "he was so kind and generous in the moments he wasn't <b>Snaping</b> about." [...] Rupert Grint said, [...] "even though he has gone I will always hear his voice." ...|$|E

According to Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, however, James and <b>Snape</b> shared a rivalry not unlike that of Draco and Harry. In addition, Lupin tells Harry that <b>Snape</b> [...] "never lost an opportunity to curse James". According to an interview with Rowling, [...] "James always suspected <b>Snape</b> harboured deeper feelings for Lily, which {{was a factor in}} James's behaviour to Snape." [...] However, when Sirius attempts to lure <b>Snape</b> into the Shrieking Shack where Lupin stays during his werewolf transformations, James prevents him from entering the tunnel under the Whomping Willow, thus saving <b>Snape's</b> life; albeit - as <b>Snape</b> points out - this also saved James from expulsion.|$|R

2500|$|From these memories, Harry sees <b>Snape's</b> {{childhood}} and learns his true loyalties. In this vision, Harry learns that <b>Snape</b> befriended Lily {{as a child}} when they lived near each other. Upon their arrival at Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat placed <b>Snape</b> and Lily into Slytherin and Gryffindor Houses, respectively. They remained friends {{for the next few}} years until they were driven apart by <b>Snape's</b> interest in the Dark Arts; the friendship finally ended following the bullying episode that Harry had briefly seen in the fifth book, in which <b>Snape</b> calls Lily [...] "Mudblood". Despite this separation and <b>Snape's</b> enduring animosity toward Lily's eventual husband James Potter, <b>Snape</b> continued to love Lily for the rest of his life.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Snape's</b> family {{background}} is mostly shown in flashbacks {{during the course}} of the last three novels. <b>Snape</b> was born to Eileen Prince, a witch, and Tobias <b>Snape,</b> a Muggle, making him a half-blood (hence the name, [...] "Half-Blood Prince"). This is rare for a Death Eater, as remarked in the last book, though Voldemort himself also had a Muggle father. <b>Snape</b> spent his early childhood living with his parents in a small house in Spinner's End. <b>Snape's</b> family was a poor one and he is described as wearing ill-fitting clothes [...] "that were so mis-matched that it looked deliberate". As a child, <b>Snape</b> was apparently neglected and his parents often fought with one another. <b>Snape</b> was very eager to leave his home to go to Hogwarts. Towards the end of the last novel, Harry draws parallels between his childhood, <b>Snape's,</b> and Voldemort's.|$|R

2500|$|Before leaving Hogwarts to {{accompany}} Dumbledore in locating another horcrux –part of Voldemort's soul– Harry discovers from Professor Trelawney {{that it was}} <b>Snape</b> who overheard the prophecy and told it to Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort hunting down Harry and his parents. Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in <b>Snape.</b> Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch <b>Snape,</b> but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and <b>Snape.</b> <b>Snape</b> interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself. Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. Enraged, he pursues <b>Snape,</b> Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. <b>Snape</b> easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, <b>Snape</b> reveals himself as the eponymous [...] "Half-Blood Prince" [...] (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias <b>Snape</b> and pure-blood Eileen Prince). <b>Snape</b> passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book's end. The full relationship between Dumbledore and <b>Snape</b> {{and the reason for}} <b>Snape's</b> actions remain unknown until the final book.

2500|$|The old, pre-Hogwarts {{friendship}} between Lily and <b>Snape</b> is fully revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, {{along with the}} fact that <b>Snape</b> harboured unrequited romantic feelings for Lily from childhood. Rowling states that while Lily loved <b>Snape</b> as a friend, she might have returned those romantic feelings if <b>Snape</b> had not become so seriously involved in the Dark Arts. Their relationship ends in their fifth year at Hogwarts, when <b>Snape,</b> in his anger and humiliation at being jinxed by James and Sirius, unthinkingly calls Lily a [...] "Mudblood" [...] after she defended him.|$|R
2500|$|When Draco and Astoria Greengrass' son Scorpius Malfoy {{finds himself}} in an {{alternate}} timeline in which Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, killed Harry and his allies and instituted a terrible reign of terror, he desperately searches for help in restoring history to its original course. He finds that in this reality <b>Snape</b> is still alive and still teaches at Hogwarts, and asks for his help. At first <b>Snape</b> is suspicious of him, since this timeline's version of Scorpius is a bully and a Voldemort stalwart. But when Scorpius shows that he knows of <b>Snape</b> having {{been in love with}} Lily, Harry's mother - <b>Snape's</b> most closely guarded secret - <b>Snape</b> becomes convinced that he does indeed come from a different timeline where Harry and his friends won. <b>Snape</b> then reveals that he, together with the fugitive Ron and Hermione Granger, maintain the last remnants of Dumbledore's Army - still waging hopeless resistance against the all-powerful Voldemort. In talking with Scorpius, <b>Snape</b> had learned that Harry would name his son [...] "Albus Severus" [...] and would regard <b>Snape</b> as [...] "probably the bravest man I ever knew" [...] - and is deeply moved. Though having guessed that in the other timeline he would die, <b>Snape</b> nevertheless willingly helps Scorpius recreate this timeline - and being discovered by Dementors, <b>Snape</b> sacrifices himself in order to cover Scorpius' escape.|$|R

2500|$|All seven novels show <b>Snape</b> to {{be a very}} {{powerful}} wizard and to have been outstanding while a student. He specialises in potion making and has talent and passion for the Dark Arts. Sirius claimed that <b>Snape</b> knew more hexes and curses as a first-year student at Hogwarts than most seventh-years knew. Particularly gifted in potion making, <b>Snape</b> added major improvements to his Potions textbook while still a student. Also as a student, <b>Snape</b> shows a rare gift for discovering new spells. Lupin describes Sectumsempra as <b>Snape's</b> [...] "speciality" [...] in Deathly Hallows. <b>Snape</b> is shown using this spell as a teenager against Harry's father James and in the aerial battle in the last novel when he accidentally hits George Weasley (acting as a Potter decoy) with it while actually aiming for a Death Eater who was trying to attack Lupin, causing George's right ear to be severed off permanently. Despite Sectumsempra's deadly power, <b>Snape</b> can also heal the wounds it causes. <b>Snape</b> is adept at reversing or containing fatal damage from other dark curses as well, due to his vast knowledge of Dark Arts, as he does when Dumbledore and then Katie Bell are cursed. Skilful in the arts of Legilimency and especially Occlumency, <b>Snape</b> is able to both access the minds of others and protect his own thoughts—indeed, though <b>Snape</b> does not care for the term himself, Harry forms the uncomfortable impression early in the series that the Potions Master is able to [...] "read minds." [...] Being an Occlumens, <b>Snape</b> is able to keep his betrayal from Voldemort, who is himself described as being [...] "the greatest Legilimens" [...] in history. According to Rowling, <b>Snape</b> is the only Death Eater capable of producing a full Patronus, which, like Lily's, is a doe. <b>Snape</b> is a talented duellist, able to hold off by himself (if only briefly) a group of three Hogwarts professors that included former duelling champion Filius Flitwick. Professor McGonagall later implies that <b>Snape</b> learned to fly without the use of a broom, a rare skill previously displayed only by Voldemort.|$|R

It is later revealed that <b>Snape</b> had in fact supplied Umbridge with fake Veritaserum on the prior attempt. <b>Snape</b> then carries Harry's cryptic warning about Sirius' capture to the other Order members, allowing them to come to the rescue in the Department of Mysteries.
