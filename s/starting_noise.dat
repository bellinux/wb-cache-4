50|$|The {{most common}} form of linear {{oscillator}} is an electronic amplifier such as a transistor or operational amplifier connected in a feedback loop with its output fed back into its input through a frequency selective electronic filter to provide positive feedback. When the power supply to the amplifier is first switched on, electronic noise in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations <b>started.</b> The <b>noise</b> travels around the loop and is amplified and filtered until very quickly it converges on a sine wave at a single frequency.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-objective optimization program for {{small wind turbine}} blade design in which the optimization can be of any combination of maximum power and minimum <b>noise,</b> <b>starting</b> time, and structure. Traditional blade element theory predicts the power extraction, and a modification of it gives the <b>starting</b> time. <b>Noise</b> is not {{used in the present}} calculations. Simple beam theory assuming isotropic material properties determines the structural strength {{on the basis of a}} choice between two load cases of the IEC 61400 - 2 SLM for small wind turbines. The blades are assumed hollow with a constant shell thickness. The optimization uses a GA with user input population and maximum number of generations, as well as crossover type and mutation index. Starting performance is a specific requirement of small blades that have no pitch adjustment. Since the starting time depends on the blade inertia, which in turn depends on material and density, this introduces a complex interaction between the objective functions that does not occur if design is based only on power production.|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic {{noise levels}} are {{steadily}} increasing worldwide and may potentially affect many species. Short-term experimental noise exposure under field and lab conditions {{has revealed that}} noise can affect the behavior and physiology of birds. However, {{few studies have been}} able to link these short-term effects to longer-term consequences. Here, we report on 2 long-term noise exposure field experiments to assess the direct and indirect effects of noise on avian reproductive success. In one experiment, we provided 2 types of nesting sites in our study area, a nest-box with traffic noise broadcast inside, as well as a control nest-box. We found great tits (Parus major) to avoid breeding in noisy nest-boxes, in particular when they had both nest-box types available in their territory. Interestingly, we found blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) to breed more often in the noisy nest-boxes compared with the control nest-boxes. In another experiment, we randomly assigned nest-box treatments to breeding great tits after settlement and <b>started</b> <b>noise</b> exposure prior to egg laying or hatching. We found no significant effect of noise treatment on clutch size, number of fledglings, or any other life-history trait we measured. Our results show that great tits avoid breeding in noisy locations. Birds that are however forced to breed in noise, either through experimental manipulation or potentially through competitive exclusion, do not suffer from reduced reproductive success. Thus, anthropogenic noise can affect settlement behavior, but breeding inside a noisy nest-box has no reproductive consequences, at least not for great tits...|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} Local Hadron Calibration {{is used in}} Atlas as one of two major {{calibration}} schemes for hadronic signals like jets and missing transverse energy. <b>Starting</b> from <b>noise</b> suppressed energy clusters a modular chain of classification and corrections steps are applied to distinguish electro-magnetic from hadronic deposits and to compensate invisible energy losses, deposits in dead material and noise threshold related losses. Finally jet-level corrections take care of missing energy due to particles never reaching the calorimeter.
