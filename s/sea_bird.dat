5|$|The local {{way of life}} {{reflects}} the Scottish and Norse heritage of the isles, including the Up Helly Aa fire festival, and a strong musical tradition, especially the traditional fiddle style. The islands have produced a variety of writers of prose and poetry, often in the distinct Shetland dialect of Scots. There are numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including {{a number of important}} <b>sea</b> <b>bird</b> nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known Shetland animal breeds. Other local breeds include the Shetland sheep, cow, goose, and duck. The Shetland pig, or grice, has been extinct since about 1930.|$|E
25|$|Paleontologist Georg Graf Munster {{discovered}} an unusual skull. He sent the fossil to Soemmering, {{who thought it}} belonged to an ancient <b>sea</b> <b>bird.</b> He also sent a cast of the skull to August Georg Goldfuss, who recognized it as a pterosaur. Goldfuss described the new species Pterodactylus muensteri based on the specimen.|$|E
25|$|Maatsuyker Island {{supports}} a surprising variety of flora and fauna, although the flora {{is limited in}} size by the windy conditions.

As a testament to fertility, potatoes sown by former lighthouse keepers now grow wild.|$|E

40|$|Although {{blood lead}} levels have {{declined}} in Greenland, {{they are still}} elevated {{despite the fact that}} lead levels in the Greenland environment are very low. Fragments of lead shot in game birds have been suggested as an important source of dietary exposure, and meals of <b>sea</b> <b>birds,</b> particularly eider, contain high concentrations of lead. In a cross-sectional population survey in Greenland in 1993 – 1994, blood lead adjusted for age and sex was found {{to be associated with the}} reported consumption of <b>sea</b> <b>birds.</b> Participants reporting less than weekly intake of <b>sea</b> <b>birds</b> had blood lead concentrations of approximately 75 µg/L, whereas those who reported eating <b>sea</b> <b>birds</b> several times a week had concentrations of approximately 110 µg/L, and those who reported daily intake had concentrations of 170 µg/L (p = 0. 01).

25|$|Perhaps one of {{the more}} {{interesting}} discoveries were the avian remains found in Unit II. The skeletal remains of an immature <b>sea</b> <b>bird</b> was found, careful positioned with small fish and crab remains, in association with a right handprint pressed into a large piece of mortar. Another bird skeleton was found along with carefully arranged sticks parallel to one another. Two more sets of avian related materials were found: a large amount of bird guano and a scattering of bird down.|$|E

25|$|After his {{win in the}} Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in October 2011, Frankel {{was given}} a rating of 143 by Timeform, the highest mark awarded by the {{organisation}} in over forty years and their fourth highest of all time behind <b>Sea</b> <b>Bird,</b> Brigadier Gerard and Tudor Minstrel. In June 2012, following his win in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, Timeform raised its provisional rating to 147, making him the highest-rated horse in the organisation's history.

25|$|There {{was also}} the Citadel, the {{exterior}} of {{which was in the}} Stone Street Studios backlot, using forced perspective. It contains the withered White Tree, built from polystyrene by Brian Massey and the Greens Department with real branches, influenced by ancient and gnarled Lebanese olive trees. The interior was within a three-story former factory in Wellington, and colour wise is influenced by Charlemagne's Chapel, with a throne for Denethor carved from stone and polystyrene statues of past Kings. The Gondorian armour is designed to represent an evolution from the Númenóreans of the first film's prologue, with a simplified <b>sea</b> <b>bird</b> motif. 16th-century Italian and German armour served as inspiration, while civilians wear silver and blacks as designed by Ngila Dickson, continuing an ancient/medieval Mediterranean Basin look.|$|E
25|$|No further {{changes of}} status {{affected}} the Mosquito Fleet. On {{the eve of}} battle, Lynch had at his disposal six ships in the water, each with only enough shot and powder {{to be able to}} fire ten times. His flagship, <b>Sea</b> <b>Bird,</b> carrying two guns, was a converted sidewheel steamer. Three of his other vessels were former tugs: Appomattox and Ellis, each with two guns, and Beaufort, with only one. Fanny, with two guns, had been a transport vessel used by the United States Army until she was captured by Confederate forces near Cape Hatteras. The last vessel, CSS Black Warrior, a schooner that had been pressed into service only four days before the battle, was armed with two 32-pounder guns. In addition to the eleven guns of his fleet, Lynch counted on the four guns of the Cobb's Point battery for support.|$|E

Before De Soto's boats could board, however, the enemy steamer's crew set fires and abandoned ship, sinking {{what turned out to}} be Confederate steamer Cuba beneath the waves. De Soto continued her fast pace of operations the next day, capturing schooner Mississippian on 19 May before finally returning to Key West for repairs.|$|E

2500|$|Enterprise {{built for}} [...] the Willamette River was {{not strong enough}} to {{regularly}} cross the often stormy Strait of Georgia, which was the body of water that separated Vancouver Island {{from the mouth of the}} Fraser River on the mainland. [...] The Wrights however had no choice in the matter if they were to remain in business, because the vessel they had been running on the route, the <b>Sea</b> <b>Bird</b> was destroyed by fire in the Strait of Georgia on September 7, 1858 while en route from Victoria to Fort Langley. [...] By the spring of 1859, Capt. John T. Wright was able to replace <b>Sea</b> <b>Bird</b> by purchasing an interest in the sidewheeler Eliza Anderson, and arranging to have the Anderson brought from Portland, Oregon where she had been recently built, to Victoria, BC, where she arrived in late March, 1859. [...] This allowed the Wrights to run the heavier more durable Anderson across the Straits to Fort Langley, while returning Enterprise to the 'Fraser River to make the run up from Fort Langley.|$|E

Hunt, none of them succeeding particularly well until the Fraser River Gold Rush in 1858. [...] Puget Sound then became a shipping point for supplies and goldseekers, and the steamboats profited well. [...] Bellingham Bay was one jumping-off point for the rush, which was handicapped by the almost complete lack of roads or paths into the mainland of British Columbia at the time, and boats were also brought in to carry miners from Victoria to the mainland, and thereafter up the Fraser River.|$|E
2500|$|Oxbow {{lakes and}} side-sloughs {{are a common}} feature of the Lower Fraser's geography. [...] The two main oxbows are those of Hatzic Lake and the Stave River on {{opposite}} sides of Mission, although that of the Stave has been silted in and part of it drained for a man-made lake. [...] Around Fort Langley is an oxbow formation, mostly swamped in {{at the time of the}} fort's foundation, which was drained and made part of the fort's farm and remains farmland today. [...] The system of sloughs and side-channels of the river is complicated, but important sloughs include those around Nicomen Island, <b>Sea</b> <b>Bird</b> Island and flanking the river from Rosedale to Sumas Mountain, on the western side of Chilliwack.|$|E
2500|$|When {{news of the}} Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached California, Hunts owners {{sent her}} north to take {{advantage}} of the situation. [...] Hunt arrived in Victoria in the middle of August, 1858. [...] Because there was a shortage of British vessels, the colonial government at Victoria had decided to license American steamers to move the resultant gold rush traffic up the river. [...] and ran for a short time on the New Westminster route. [...] Another vessel running on the same route was the <b>Sea</b> <b>Bird,</b> which on September 7, 1858, caught fire en route and was destroyed, with the loss of two lives. [...] Fortunately the Hunt was not far behind her and was able to take off her surviving passengers and crew.|$|E
