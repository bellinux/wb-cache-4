25|$|There {{are quite}} a few players like me who did really well early in their careers, but didn't {{consolidate}} later on. I guess it is like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - where do you go from there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
500|$|Powderfinger’s bass guitarist, John Collins, jokingly {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Rod Yates of Massive Magazines that [...] "the guitars are out of tune at the start of Passenger", whilst guitarist Darren Middleton explained that [...] "there are not regrets with any of that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> it’s part of who we are and what we’ve done", in reference to the out of tune guitars.|$|E

500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that we had with Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board. The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has been absolutely unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in all of us that loves this <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> because it's fun, it's different." [...] From its conception, Petrucci envisioned the story as eventually being re-worked into a film, play, or video game.|$|E
500|$|Soundgarden were {{pioneers of}} the grunge music genre, which mixed {{elements}} of punk rock and metal into a dirty, aggressive sound. [...] "Soundgarden are quite good..." [...] remarked Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi, [...] "It's {{very much like}} the same <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> that we would have done." [...] Soundgarden's sound {{during the early years of}} the Seattle grunge scene has been described as consisting of [...] "gnarled neo-Zeppelinisms". The influence of Led Zeppelin was evident, with Q magazine noting that Soundgarden were [...] "in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo." [...] According to Sub Pop, the band had [...] "a hunky lead singer and fused Led Zeppelin and the Butthole Surfers". The Butthole Surfers' mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence on the early work of Soundgarden.|$|E

In July 2015 her first solo release, [...] "Threads", was announced; it was released on 7 August.|$|R
500|$|The Secret River is Rawlings' only book {{intended}} for children. According to Murray Laurie, {{the idea for}} the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek: “some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child.” She discussed the idea with her Scribner's editor, Maxwell Perkins, who encouraged her to follow it up. While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she [...] "deliberately avoided Negro dialect. 'No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> At one point she thought about making the story into a full-length novel. Helen Masten, writing for The Saturday Review, commented [...] "Had this happened this little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children, to whom it rightly belongs." [...] Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp, an illustrator and friend. From that conversation, Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea. In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret Rivers manuscript to Perkins, and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings. When Perkins responded with suggestions, Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp's illustrations. By June of that year, Perkins' death from pneumonia and Rawlings' own personal problems had derailed the project. After Rawlings' death in 1953, the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers.|$|E

2500|$|One of Zimmer's most durable {{works from}} {{his time in}} the United Kingdom was the theme song for the {{television}} game show Going for Gold, which he composed with Sandy McClelland in 1987. In an interview with the BBC, Zimmer said: [...] "Going for Gold was a lot of fun. It's the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> you do when you don't have a career yet. God, I just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time." ...|$|E
60|$|In the women's apartments all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuffs,</b> some <b>of</b> European, some {{of native}} manufacture, were found {{scattered}} {{about in the}} wildest confusion.

6000|$|Across {{the ragged}} vacant lots {{to the west}} a vast sunset processional marched down the sky. It had not been visible from their flat, which looked across East River to the tame grassy shore of a {{real-estate}} boomer's suburb. [...] "Gee!"

2500|$|The hits just {{inspired}} {{confidence in}} us. We became totally involved in getting dressed up {{and going out}} to gigs, the gigs and rehearsals were everything. Nothing worried us, we were so busy consuming what was happening around us. We were super aware, on top of every trend in music and clothes and language. We tried {{to be honest and}} sincere with our music, only playing and recording what we liked. The guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us. We were listening to Zoot Money, John Mayall, Manfred Mann, The Animals, all that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> and trying to create that sound. We were different from groups like The Underdogs who just played 12-bar blues all night; we tried {{to be a lot more}} imaginative about what we did ... We had no idea what we were earning on tour, we just spent what we wanted and ploughed the rest back into the band. We had our way with girls, bought more clothes and equipment and just enjoyed being stars.|$|E
2500|$|Paine captained Tasmania at Under–15 and Under–17 level, {{along with}} {{being a member of}} its Under–19 team at the age of just fifteen. He was vice-captain of the Australian Under–17, before scoring a first grade century for the University club in Hobart. [...] "He was always the {{smallest}} one playing cricket," [...] Paine's father John said. [...] "We lived in a fairly quiet street and we lived right next to the beach [...] so they used to play a fair bit of beach cricket. We used to have a cricket pitch in our backyard which was the driveway and the next-door neighbours had a turf wicket which the boys used to roll and mow and do all that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> So he had to learn from an early age I suppose to be a bit stronger and a bit more competitive." [...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club. Paine's uncle, Robert Shaw, was an AFL player and coach.|$|E

5000|$|Stump {{served as}} the primary {{composer}} for From Under the Cork Tree. He said of the album's musical style: [...] "We experimented quite a bit with all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> Some metal, some folk, some R&B. But ultimately, your band sounds like your band. You can put those things in it, but it's still going to sound like you." [...] Niyaz Pirani of The Orange County Register referred to [...] "Dance, Dance" [...] as [...] "pop-punk-meets-swing-dance glory".|$|R
5000|$|She is her own individual. When I met her, she was {{an actress}} known as Joke Silva so why should marrying me now deny her and her {{audience}} her name.

5000|$|... "I like a well-told story, {{something}} that's directed well in {{a different}} way, anything, even commercials. It doesn't have to be underground or horror films, lately I've been getting into more horror stuff but I've kind of eased off and been watching different types of films, you know, back into that. I like all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> it just {{has to be a}} well-told story, like everything coming from the writers look. I mean, special effects and that type <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> doesn't impress me that much more subtle effects do, I mean, I know of the editing process and that doesn't really do anything for me, you know, the magic's taken out. I just like a well-written story with something that just looks really direct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you shall, Elly. But we {{must have}} somebody. When we go abroad and all that {{and for all the}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{business}} <b>stuff</b> and looking after things that you can't do. We've got to have her. She's the only thing going of her sort." ...|$|R

50|$|Tom Selleck later reflected:Jack Ramsay is {{not exactly}} a {{character}} whose name is on the tip of everybody’s tongue, but Runaway was a really great popcorn movie... It was very futuristic, it had robots and all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> and it was a nice movie. It was a good movie that I’m very proud of. It didn’t do very well, which was a great disappointment to Michael, who became a friend. And Gene Simmons was in it! Gene hadn’t been in a feature film before, but he was great. We had some great talks and good times... I know it plot sounds hokey, but with Michael Crichton at the helm, it was pretty good stuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse than that. I {{really feel}} a little responsible. I always told you Miss Brooke would be such a fine match.

However, I am taken by surprise for once." ...|$|R
500|$|Constance {{joined the}} hippie {{movement}} and encouraged her sons {{to get involved}} in the arts. Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums. [...] "I come from a pretty artistic family," [...] he explained, [...] "There were canvases and paint everywhere, instruments, and all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> It just kind of made sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so I just kind of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|R
