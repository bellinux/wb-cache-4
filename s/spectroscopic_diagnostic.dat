40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evidence of}} very high coronal plasma density, i. e. up to 10 12 cm Γ 3 and higher, sometimes measured with <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> methods during flares and in active regions. The ratio of the forbidden and intercombination lines in He-like ions {{has been the most}} used spectroscopic tool in such measurements. The limits and advantages of spectroscopic diagnostics are discussed as well as the interpretation of such high density, both in terms of high density filamentation and, with the help of hydrodynamic model calculations, in terms of of chromospheric evaporation and dense plasma layers in the transition region of flares. 1. Introduction This paper reviews the evidence of very high coronal density, derived from X-ray spectroscopic measurements at high resolution which has been sometimes related to the fine structuring of the solar outer atmosphere, the main subject of this workshop.

It is found that the relative abundance of the lithium-, beryllium-, and boron-like ions at electron densities as low as 1 million per cu cm is density-dependent. Because of this dependence, the intensity of lines arising from ions of the Li, Be, and B isoelectronic sequences are density-sensitive. The general implications of these results as applied to solar and stellar atmospheric models, coronal abundances, and <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> techniques are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Spectroscopy of {{radiation}} emitted by impurities and hydrogen isotopes {{plays an important}} role in the study of magnetically-confined fusion plasmas, both in determining the effects of impurities on plasma behavior and in measurements of plasma parameters such as electron and ion temperatures and densities, particle transport, and particle influx rates. This paper reviews <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> of plasma radiation that are excited by collisional processes in the plasma, which are termed 'passive' <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> to distinguish them from 'active' <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> involving injected particle and laser beams. A brief overview of the ionization balance in hot plasmas and the relevant line and continuum radiation excitation mechanisms is given.

40|$|In {{the near}} future the {{interior}} materials of JET will be changed to a beryllium wall and tungsten divertor so as to resemble the ITER design. Initially {{there will be no}} carbon strike plates in the divertor but there is the possibility of adding these later for an exact match. Such a change requires upgraded <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> in order to measure the spatially dependent influx of these impurities and their concentrations in the confined plasma. With 74 ionization stages (many of them very complex) the high Z of tungsten also places new demands on the atomic physics required to model its behavior which in turn informs the design of potential diagnostic systems. Modeled emission patterns from the upgraded JET are used as part of the diagnostic specification. We describe a suite of <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> in the visible, extreme ultraviolet, vacuum ultraviolet, and x-ray spectral regions suitable for these tasks.

These equations are reduced to the steady-state limit for a two-level system under the effect of single-mode and multimode optical fields. The steady-state equations are shown to be valid only when the laser pulse rises slowly with respect to the collisional dephasing rate for single-mode excitation, and for certain special cases under multimode excitation...|$|E

The theory {{can now be}} considered as mature for many applications, especially for accurate <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and modeling, in astrophysics, laboratory plasma physics and technological plasmas, as well. This requires the knowledge of numerous collisional line profiles. In order to meet these needs, the “SCP” (semiclassical perturbation) method and numerical code were created and developed.

Furthermore, Raman spectroscopic probes are of particular interest as they allow for in vivo <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> for tasks such as the identification of tumour margins during surgery. In this study, we investigate a feature-driven approach to the classification of metastatic brain cancer, glioblastoma (GB) and non-cancer from tissue samples, and we provide a real-time feedback method for endoscopic diagnostics using sound. To do this, we first evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of three classifiers (SVM, KNN and LDA), when trained with both sub-band spectral features and principal components taken directly from Raman spectra. We demonstrate that the feature extraction approach provides an increase in classification accuracy of 26. 25 % for SVM and 25 % for KNN. We then discuss the molecular assignment of the most salient sub-bands in the dataset. The most salient sub-band features are mapped to parameters of a frequency modulation (FM) synthesizer in order to generate audio clips from each tissue sample. Based on the properties of the sub-band features, the synthesizer was able to maintain similar sound timbres within the disease classes and provide different timbres between disease classes. This was reinforced via listening tests, in which participants were able to discriminate between classes with mean classification accuracy of 71. 1 %. Providing intuitive feedback via sound frees the surgeons' visual attention to remain on the patient, allowing for greater control over diagnostic and surgical tools during surgery, and thus promoting clinical translation of <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics...</b>|$|R

In addition, for the finer <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> and modeling tools now being promoted, existing data may be organized inappropriately or may be at unsuitable precisions.

The CH radiation (at 431 nm) is correlated with the CH density and with the methane flux. This correlation is generally applied in fusion experiments to obtain methane fluxes. The present investigations show that the C 2 radiation (Swan band at 516 nm) corresponds to the C 2 density which refers to the C 2 H 2 flux and provide a <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tool for these higher hydrocarbons. By introducing various sur-faces into hydrogen plasmas, atomic hydrogen fluxes are lowered and reflection coefficients are derived from the Balmer radiation. Furthermore, the vibrational population of hydrogen molecules is influenced, in particular in case of graphite.

They found that stellar population synthesis models constrained by the <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> implied star formation rates that accounted for their infrared luminosities, {{and there was also}} no spectroscopic evidence for ”buried ” AGN at 2 μm. To search for evidence of AGN buried deeply in extinction we have supplemented the UKIRT spectra with Spitzer mid-infrared (5. 2 to 38. 0 μm) spectra. Using a variety of <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> we find that ∼ 50 % of the sample shows some evidence for an AGN. We also find that the luminosity of about ∼ (17 ± 4) % of our sample is probably dominated by emission from AGN, and the remaining ∼ (80 ± 4) %have luminosities dominated by starbursts. Since ∼ 50 % of the sample shows some evidence of concurrent AGN and starburst activity this suggests that both AGN and starbursts commonly coexist in the LIRGS phase of evolution.

40|$|<b>Spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> {{of solar}} coronal plasmas {{critically}} {{depends on the}} uncertainty in the measured line intensities. One of the main sources of uncertainty is instrumental scattered light, which is potentially most important in low-brightness areas. In the solar corona, such areas include polar and equatorial coronal holes, which are the source regions of the solar wind; instrument-scattered light must thus pose a significant obstacle to studies of the source regions of the solar wind. In this paper we investigate the importance of instrument-scattered light on observations of equatorial coronal holes made by the Hinode/EIS spectrometer in two different phases of the solar cycle. We find that the instrument-scattered light is significant at all temperatures, and in both regions it amounts to approximately 10 % of the average intensity of the neighboring quiet Sun regions. Such contribution dominates the measured intensity for spectral lines formed at temperatures larger than Log T = 6. 15 K, and has deep implications for <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> of equatorial coronal hole plasmas and studies of the source regions of {{a large portion of}} the solar wind which reaches Earth.
