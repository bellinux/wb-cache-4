[...] Kali thus declared: [...] "I promise that if I create any troubles to beggars on earth, I, my lady, my boons, my kingdoms, and my military will all fail, my dynasty and I will die, and both my dynasty and I will go to hell." [...] As Kali made his oath, Vishnu got the Chakram from Kali, cursed the Chakram as Money, and gave it back to him. As soon as it was cursed, the chakram asked Vishnu, [...] "When will your curse finish?". Vishnu replied, [...] "It'll be away from you when Kali is defeated."

When another show made men, women, children, foreigner, etc as object, “Be A Man” was so different by presenting transsexual as object. The transsexual was “educated” in military neighborhood, {{so that they could}} became a “man”. Basically, the show wanted to present masculine side of transsexual, where feminity was stuck on them. “Be A Man” format didn’t get positive respond from television audience. The background’s different created people respond, whether positive or negative. As television tex, “Be A Man” was interpretated in different view by the television audience. <b>So,</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> transsexual meaning interpretation who became minority audiences of “Be A Man”? Understanding was always came from positiion or view of a man who understood, not only involving textual meaning reproduction, but also meaning production by the reader. Text could structure meaning aspect by guiding its reader, but it couldn’t state meaning which was a result from interaction between text and reader’s imagination. Audience was active creator of meaning related with text (Barker, 2005 : 34). Understanding was influenced by several factors, they were race, nation, ethnicity, social background, education, gender, sexuality, etc. This influence created various meaning in picture and messages series in television, depending on audiences. Different meaning interpretation by audiences to media text gave a sign that there was ambiguity and meaning richness in a text. The approach used by the researcher was qualitative approach. The method was reception studies with interpretative paradigm. Interpretative paradigm in the research was an effort to diagnose people’s reality. The pioneers of reception studies or consumption study stated that whatever did by textual meaning analysis as critic was far from certainty of identified meaning which would be actived by reader/audience/consumer. From data analysis, there could be stated as explained in research subject, changing transsexual into man which became the program’s purpose was not synchronous with the field’s fact in quarantine time. Transsexual still behaviored as transsexual, they were taught and educated in military style, but still in woman make up and style. Talking about sex orientation, research subjects had opinion that transsexual couldn’t be changed into male who had female oriented, if they were forced, they could turn into gay who had male-sex orientation. It was general since transsexual placed themselves in woman position than male position. The theme was only as completion or target accomplishment by the producer. Transsexual in “Be A Man” reality show was exploited. He was published, but insulted for entertainment because of their different behavior with heterosexual people. Keke, Siska, Yayuk, and Meriatun were hoped a program which could able to show positive image of transsexual, not exploiting their community.
