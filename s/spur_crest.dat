40|$|A jetty spur is a {{relatively}} short structure that extends from the beachside of a jetty and diverts sediments from entering a navigation channel. A series of physical model laboratory tests with waves and currents was conducted in that varied spur length, <b>spur</b> <b>crest</b> elevation relative to the jetty structure, and spur orientation. Wide and narrow breaker zones were simulated. These experiments were augmented with numerical modeling that coupled waves, depth-averaged current, sediment transport, and morphology change at an inlet. Results indicated that a submerged spur was as effective as a surface-piercing structure in deflecting the seaward-moving current along the jetty, potentially saving construction and maintenance costs. Also {{it was noted that}} if the angle of the spur was such that the approaching waves broke initially at the seaward end and progressed breaking in an upcoast direction along the spur face, the ability to deflect a current moving along the jetty axis was enhanced. Recommendations for jetty spur location, elevation, length and angle are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Fish in {{schooling}} mode swim fast, eat at intermediate rates, {{and are not}} aggressive, {{even though}} they are often chased by damselfish. Schooling is the most prevalent in areas with high damselfish densities such as the groove zone, <b>spur</b> zone, and <b>crest</b> zone (shallow reef area), while schools are most prevalent near midday.|$|R

The <b>crest</b> is blazoned: an imperial crown proper. The supporters are blazoned: dexter a peregrine falcon and sinister a raven both proper. The motto is: Quocunque Jeceris Stabit.|$|R
60|$|So seemed Vivenza in its better aspect. Nevertheless, Vivenza was a braggadocio in Mardi; {{the only}} brave one ever known. As {{an army of}} <b>spurred</b> and <b>crested</b> roosters, her people chanticleered at the resplendent rising of their sun. For shame, Vivenza! Whence thy undoubted valor? Did ye not bring it with ye from the bold old shores of Dominora, {{where there is a}} {{fullness}} of it left? What isle but Dominora could have supplied thee with that stiff spine of thine?-- That heart of boldest beat? Oh, Vivenza! know that true grandeur is too big for a boast; and nations, as well as men, may be too clever to be great.|$|R
50|$|Anoda cristata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the mallow family known by many common names, including <b>spurred</b> anoda, <b>crested</b> anoda, and violettas. Its exact native range is unclear but it probably spans Mexico and part or all of Central America. It is known {{throughout the rest of}} the Americas as well as Australia as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. This is an annual herb reaching a maximum erect height between one half and one meter. The stem is ridged and branching. The plant is variable in morphology, especially in leaf shape, but leaves are usually somewhat triangular, and hairy. Solitary flowers grow in the leaf axils. The flower is 2 to 3 centimeters wide, with pointed green to reddish sepals and lavender petals. The fruit is a bristly, disc-shaped capsule with 9 to 20 segments. Each segment produces a seed. This is sometimes an agricultural weed, especially of soybeans. It is tolerated as a weed of crop fields in parts of Mexico, and even fostered, because it is eaten and used as a source of medicinal remedies.|$|R
5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} {{take their place}} {{at the front of}} the royal procession as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the procession of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and <b>crest,</b> <b>spurs,</b> gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This procession of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|R
40|$|Vegetation series, {{defined as}} the {{sequence}} of stages in a sucession, and know as sigmetum (synassociation), describes the set of plant communities or stages {{that can be found}} in similar tesselar spaces {{as a result of the}} sucession process. This establishes the concept of vegetation series; a climatophilous series is one that depends on the climate, whereas an edaphoxerophilous series depends on the dryness of the soil, and is found on <b>crests,</b> <b>spurs,</b> ledges and limestone and siliceous rock fields. Edaphohygrophilous series are located in valleys, dry water courses and river terraces, and depend on the water present in the soil, which may become temporarily flooded and thus condition the temporihygrophilous series; they represent the transition between the clearly edaphohygrophilous and climatophilous series. The vegetation permaseries represents the perennial communities of permatesselae or similar permatesselar complexes, as occurs in polar territories, hyperdesert, high-mountain peaks, and non-stratified communities lacking in serial communities. The edaphoxerophilous series may include -in addition to the series head- permaseries (permanent communities) and other habitats, such as annual and crevice habitats. A territory behaves undergoes soil-loss phenomena it may become an edaphoseries, if the loss of the soil factor produces a situation of rocky crest. Thus the edaphoseries may act as dynamic transitional stage between the climatophilous series and the permaseries...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the abundance of}} blue tang surgeonfish, Acanthurus coeruleus, in each of three social modes (schooling, territorial, and wandering) in relation to size class, ecological variables, population density and time of day to discern potential determinants of social organization. We found individuals from all three social modes in all four fringing reef habitats (back reef, flat, <b>crest</b> and <b>spur</b> and groove zones) at our main site. Territorial tang density was highest in the flat zone, lowest in the spur and groove zone and negatively related to adult damselfish density. A higher proportion of tangs formed schools in reef zones with the highest densities of territorial damselfishes (<b>spur</b> and groove, <b>crest).</b> In the back reef and flat zones, where damselfish densities were very low, tangs rarely formed schools. Tangs in the wandering mode were most abundant in the back reef. The density of territorial tangs did not change with time of day, but non-territorial tangs tended to wander more {{in the morning and}} to form schools more at midday. Small yellow-phase juveniles were always territorial, and the incidence of territoriality decreased in the larger size classes, while schooling and wandering increased. Among similar fringing reefs, the incidence of territo-riality increased with increasing population density. These data suggest that life history stage, damselfish density, and conspecific population density are important determinants of blue tang social organization...|$|R
40|$|General Description: Perennial from deep-seated, fleshy roots, {{the stems}} {{succulent}} and strongly fistulose, 12 to 44 inches tall, simple to branched; leaves several, yellowish-green, glaucous {{on the lower}} surface, the lower cauline ones up to 24 inches long often equaling the racemes, from 4 to 6 times pinnate, the ultimate segments very numerous, more or less elliptic, mostly 3 / 16 to inch long and 1 / 16 to 3 / 16 inch broad; racemes simple to well compounded, conspicuously bracteate, rather compactly 30 to 60 flowered, ultimately elongate and up to 9 inches long; corolla to inch long, pale to deep pinkish with a slight trace of purple, the inner petals more deeply colored at the tip; <b>spurred</b> petal conspicuously <b>crested,</b> usually without free margins or the margins very slightly upturned; spur d inch long; capsule ellipsoid, d to inch long, about a as thick, the style to as long; seeds about 1 / 16 inch long. Identification Tips: Corydalis scouleri occurs {{within the range of}} C. aquae-gelidae. C. aquae-gelidae has shorter ultimate leaf segments (3 / 16 - inch versus - 3 inches), more flowers per raceme (30 - 60 versus 15 - 30), and a smaller flower (d- inch versus - 1 inch) than C. scouleri. Phenology: The flowering period for this species is long, lasting from June to September. Plants may senesce in late August or September, often somewhat early compared to other species in the area. Phenology seems to be controlled by microsite warmth. © 1964 University of Washington Press. Illustration by Jeanne R. Janish. Known distribution o...|$|R
50|$|The trail {{originates}} at the La Luz Trailhead, {{which has}} an elevation of 7050 ft. The lower reaches of the trail are a wide dirt path that climbs at a moderate slope. This part of the trail passes through the Upper Sonoran Zone, where juniper and piñon trees, prickly pear cactus, and cholla cactus are found. About {{a mile from the}} trailhead is the junction of La Luz Trail and the Tramway trail. The Tramway trail connects to the lower tram terminal, and allows hikers to use the tram to return to their vehicles instead of hiking the 15 mi round trip. As the trail climbs the mountain, the scrub forest is replaced by the alpine forest of the Transition Zone, with ponderosa pines, blue spruce trees, and assorted wildflowers in the summer months. A scenic overlook is found at around 8900 ft and a distance of about 4.35 mi. Just past this overlook is a sign that warns hikers that the trail beyond is snowy and impassable in the winter months. The trail becomes narrower and more rocky after the overlook. The trail travels through a steep, rocky draw with the many quaking aspen and pines of the Canadian Zone. Hikers traverse 19 switchbacks in this area as they {{near the top of the}} trail. Approximately 6.7 mi from the trailhead, the La Luz trail forks. The right (south) fork leads to the Sandia Peak Tramway and a final elevation of 10378 ft. The left (north) fork is the <b>Crest</b> <b>Spur</b> Trail (Trail 84) and travels approximately 0.6 mi up a very steep slope to Sandia Crest and a final elevation of 10678 ft.|$|R
5000|$|During the Coronation Ceremony, {{members of}} the College form part of the Royal {{procession}} as it enters Westminster Abbey. The {{members of the}} College walk in the procession in virtue of them being Her Majesty's [...] "Kings, Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of England." [...] They do so alongside their Scottish colleagues: the Lord Lyon, the Heralds and Pursuivants of Arms of the Lyon Court. The Garter King of Arms is usually placed next to the Lord Great Chamberlain in the procession, he has the duty of guiding, but not performing the ceremony. Garter's duties during the coronation ceremony are therefore not unlike those of a Master of Ceremonies. It is only during this ceremony that the Kings of Arms are allowed to wear their distinctive crowns, the only group of individuals, apart from the King and Queen, authorised to do so.At State funerals the heralds once again take their place {{at the front of}} the royal procession as it enters the place of worship.
