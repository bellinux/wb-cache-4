25|$|The atomic form factor, or <b>scattering</b> <b>power,</b> of {{an element}} {{depends on the}} type of {{radiation}} considered. Because electrons interact with matter though different processes than for example X-rays, the atomic form factors for the two cases are not the same.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{demonstrated}} that dark-field imaging with the grating interferometer {{can be used to}} extract orientational information of structural details in the sub-micrometer regime beyond the spatial resolution of the detection system. While the scattering of X-rays in a direction perpendicular to the grating lines provides the dark-field contrast, the scattering in a direction parallel to the grating lines only lead to blurring in the image, which is not visible at the low resolution of the detector. This intrinsic physical property of the setup is utilized to extract orientational information about the angular variation of the local <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> of the sample by rotating the sample around the optical axis of the set-up and collecting a set of several dark-field images, each measuring the component of the scattering perpendicular to the grating lines for that particular orientation. This can be used to determine the local angle and degree of orientation of bone and could yield valuable information for improving research and diagnostics of bone diseases like osteoporosis or osteoarthritis.|$|E

30|$|The {{goal here}} is to {{estimate}} {{the influence of the}} resolution used on synthesised <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> time series. In this case, representative urban scenarios, as described in Section 2.3, have been created using multiple canonical buildings.

40|$|<b>Scattered</b> <b>power</b> {{profiles}} {{from the}} Urbana VHF radar have been analyzed. Coherent power {{returns from the}} mesosphere (60 - 90 km) show that {{a large portion of}} these returns occur in well-defined stable layers lasting for more than 6 hours in some cases. It is concluded that some of these layers may be caused by standing diurnal tides. Short time variation in <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> is attributed to internal gravity waves modifying the amplitude and altitude of maximum vertical shear in the horizontal wind. Correlation time of the scattered signal varies with altitude as well as with <b>scattered</b> <b>power.</b> Seasonal averages of the <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> show a broad peak around 76 km. The decrease in <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> below 76 km appears because of a decrease in the electron density gradient, while the decrease above 76 km is due to a decrease in the intensity of turbulence. The amplitude of short-period gravity waves shows a decrease with altitude below 66 km, attributed to the Brunt-Vaisala barrier, and a slight increase with altitude above 70 km. The dominant period of the vertical oscillations shows an increase above 63 km, giving further evidence that the high-frequency oscillations present below 63 km cannot propagate to higher altitudes...|$|R

60|$|I {{had once}} been told {{that it would be}} {{impossible}} to shoot wild duck or anything with the blunderbuss unless one could get within a dozen yards of them, on account of its tremendous <b>scattering</b> <b>power.</b> Well, by going along the bottom of the moat, which was luckily without water just then, I could get as near the birds as I liked and kill the whole flock. When I arrived abreast of the pool I crept up the grassy crumbling outside bank, and resting the ponderous barrel on the top of the bank, fired at the shovellers at a distance of about fifteen yards, and killed nothing, but received a kick which sent me flying to the bottom of the foss. It was several days before I got over that pain in my shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also an}} {{improved}} method using the four-component decomposition algorithm, which was introduced for the general POLSAR data image analyses. The SAR data is first filtered which is known as speckle reduction, then each pixel is decomposed by four-component model to determine the surface <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> (...) , double-bounce <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> (...) , volume <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> (...) , and helix <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> (...) [...] The pixels are then divided into 5 classes (surface,double-bounce,volume,helix,and mixed pixels) classified with respect to maximum powers. A mixed category is added for the pixels having two or three equal dominant scattering powers after computation. The process continues as the pixels in all these categories are divided in 20 small clutter approximately of same number of pixels and merged as desirable, this is called cluster merging. They are iteratively classified and then automatically color is delivered to each class. The summarization of this algorithm leads to an understanding that, brown colors denotes the surface scattering classes, red colors for double-bounce scattering classes, green colors for volume scattering classes, and blue colors for helix scattering classes.|$|E

30|$|As a recommendation, {{modelling}} {{the environment}} with {{details in the}} range of one wavelength and larger is advised for slow motion and extreme incidences. For other cases, only details larger than the wavelength could be sufficient to represent the environment if empirical adjustments are applied to the obtained MP <b>scattered</b> <b>power.</b> From our experience, + 2 dB would be a typical offset value. The canonical plate representation is hardly acceptable even for a first estimation of the MP <b>scattered</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R
40|$|Equations {{describing}} the wave number spectra of wind shear-generated turbulent velocities and refractive index irregularities are discussed, and relations between radar echo power and signal correlation time are derived. If the radar backscatter wavelength {{is within the}} inertial subrange of the spectrum, {{a positive correlation between}} the <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> and the signal correlation time is expected. For radar Bragg wavelengths within the dissipative subrange of turbulence, the correlation between <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> and signal correlation time will be negative as usually expected in turbulence...|$|R

50|$|In {{general the}} X-ray form factor is complex but the {{imaginary}} components only become large near an absorption edge.

50|$|One major {{advantage}} of neutron diffraction over X-ray diffraction {{is that the}} latter is rather insensitive {{to the presence of}} hydrogen (H) in a structure, whereas the nuclei 1H and 2H (i.e. Deuterium, D) are strong scatterers for neutrons. The greater <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> of protons and deuterons means that the position of hydrogen in a crystal and its thermal motions can be determined with greater precision by neutron diffraction. The structures of metal hydride complexes, e.g., Mg2FeH6 have been assessed by neutron diffraction.|$|E
50|$|Plane-wave {{topography}} {{can be made}} {{to extract}} an additional wealth of information from a sample by recording not just one image, but an entire sequence of topographs all along the sample's rocking curve. By following the diffracted intensity in one pixel across the entire sequence of images, local rocking curves from very small areas of sample surface can be reconstructed.Although the required post-processing and numerical analysis is sometimes moderately demanding, the effort is often compensated by very comprehensive information on the sample's local properties. Quantities that become quantitatively measurable in this way include local <b>scattering</b> <b>power,</b> local lattice tilts (crystallite misorientation), and local lattice quality and perfection. Spatial resolution is, in many cases, essentially given by the detector pixel size.|$|E
5000|$|Diffraction {{topography}} (short: [...] "topography") is an quantum beam {{imaging technique}} based on Bragg diffraction.Diffraction topographic images ("topographies") record the intensity {{profile of a}} beam of X-rays (or, sometimes, neutrons) diffracted by a crystal.A topography thus represents a two-dimensional spatial intensity mapping of reflected X-rays, i.e. the spatial fine structure of a Laue reflection.This intensity mapping reflects the distribution of <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> inside the crystal; topographs therefore reveal the irregularities in a non-ideal crystal lattice.X-ray diffraction topography is one variant of X-ray imaging, making use of diffraction contrast rather than absorption contrast which is usually used in radiography and computed tomography (CT). Topography is exploited to a lesser extends with neutrons and other quantum beams. In the electron microscope community, such technique is called dark field imaging or diffraction contrast imaging.|$|E

Several roads and streams were flooded throughout the region, including low-lying areas {{adjacent to the}} Hoosic River in Bennington County. Strong winds downed water-laden tree branches onto wires, causing <b>scattered</b> <b>power</b> outages across the area. Further north, dirt roads around Ludlow were washed out and a mudslide was reported on Route 14 near Royalton. In New Hampshire, precipitation totals included 4.5 in in Derry, 4.2 in in Milfold, 3.5 in in East Derry, 3 in in Manchester, and 2.77 in in Jaffrey.

50|$|Unlike X-rays, {{neutrons}} scatter {{mostly from}} the nuclei of the atoms, which are tiny. Furthermore, {{there is no need}} for an atomic form factor to describe the shape of the electron cloud of the atom and the <b>scattering</b> <b>power</b> of an atom does not fall off with the scattering angle as it does for X-rays. Diffractograms therefore can show strong well defined diffraction peaks even at high angles, particularly if the experiment is done at low temperatures. Many neutron sources are equipped with liquid helium cooling systems that allow data collection at temperatures down to 4.2 K. The superb high angle (i.e. high resolution) information means that the atomic positions in the structure can be determined with high precision. On the other hand, Fourier maps (and to a lesser extent difference Fourier maps) derived from neutron data suffer from series termination errors, sometimes so much that the results are meaningless.|$|E
