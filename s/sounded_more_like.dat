5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first motorized vehicle, an American LaFrance pumper truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was motorized and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations at Mrs. Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the motorized vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was motorized in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An electric siren was installed in 1928 after a complaint that the previous alarm <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{incorporates}} the song [...] "Wonderful! Wonderful!" [...] by musician Johnny Mathis. Having read the screenplay Mathis {{refused to allow}} his version to be used, owing to the episode's graphic content, and a cover version had to be created. Producer David Nutter, who had a background as a singer, intended to record the vocals {{but at the last}} minute another singer, who <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Mathis, was used.

Dinosaur Jr and Sebadoh member Lou Barlow said of Spiderland, [...] "It was quiet-to-loud without sounding like grunge or indie rock. It <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a new kind of music." [...] PJ Harvey has included Spiderland in a list called Ten For Today, which were records she was enjoying listening to in 1992. Bob Nastanovich of Pavement and Mark Clifford of Seefeel have also cited Spiderland as among their favorite albums.

[...] Chris Richards for The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Stupid in Love", along with the lead single released from the album [...] "Russian Roulette", consisted of [...] "plodding beats" [...] and [...] "forgettable hooks".

500|$|Nixon's {{approach}} ultimately {{impressed the}} studio and her recording was kept, which took the singer only thirty-two minutes to complete. However, she approached it {{as though she was}} performing the entire score. Although Nixon performs only one verse in the song, her musical contribution to [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] marked the singer's return to film roles following her lengthy hiatus. Mulan was also Nixon's first Disney film in 10 years; she had previously performed in the musical film Mary Poppins (1964). Nixon was eventually joined by Broadway performers Beth Fowler and Lea Salonga, although the three singers never recorded together. The studio enjoyed Nixon's performance so much that they ultimately decided to recast the actress who had been providing Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time with someone who <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> her, replacing her with voice actress June Foray. Disney had been considered hiring actresses Lauren Bacall and June Havoc to record [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] prior to Nixon's. The songwriters first based [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] on a rough cut they had seen of the scene; the animators eventually synced the animated characters with the singers' voices.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 1988, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies". The song {{features the}} lyrics of The Beverly Hillbillies theme song altered slightly and set {{to the tune of}} [...] "Money for Nothing". The song appears in its entirety within UHF as a computer-animated dream sequence, framed as if it were part of a music video. As part of his terms that allowed Yankovic to record this parody, Dire Straits lead singer and guitarist and [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] songwriter Mark Knopfler insisted that he be allowed to play the guitar featured in the parody. As a result, both he and Guy Fletcher — Dire Straits' keyboardist — recorded their parts on guitar and synthesizer respectively. According to Yankovic, his guitarist Jim West had practiced the song for weeks, and, as a result could recreate the original; Knopfler, on the other hand, had been playing the song for several years and was much more relaxed with his playing. As a result, West's version <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the original version, although Knopfler's track was the one used. Yankovic revealed in the DVD commentary for UHF that the concept [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] was originally a parody of Prince's 1984 hit [...] "Let's Go Crazy". Prince, however, refused, and has been unreceptive to any parody ideas Yankovic has ever presented him with. The fractured titled [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] is a result of Dire Straits' lawyers insisting that [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] remain in the parody's title. Yankovic was unhappy with the title and stated that he would rather have had the title be either [...] "Money for Nothing for the Beverly Hillbillies" [...] or [...] "Beverly Hillbillies for Nothing". The legal title for the song features an asterisk after the word [...] "Hillbillies", although it is often printed without the marking.|$|E

A replacement bell donated to the church by a Colonel Rutgers, {{a friend of the}} congregation, was not popular, as it <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a ship's bell than a church's. Eventually it was supposedly donated to the courthouse, and Rutgers arranged for the casting of a new bell. The [...] replacement was brought over from Amsterdam in 1794.|$|E
2500|$|Genie {{had very}} little control of her voice during this time, so it was [...] {{completely}} monotonic, abnormally high-pitched, and very soft, with many of her early utterances completely silent and others so quiet that they sounded like whispers. Throughout 1971 her voice was extremely glottalized, and when she spoke she frequently pronounced only a few sounds; for instance, the word [...] "doctor" [...] <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "dert". Despite knowing how to ask questions, she could only indicate them through facial expressions. Despite the lack of variability in her own voice, she clearly understood different tones of voice in other peoples' speech.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of those}} [...] "old shore" [...] moments was the large monastery bell {{in the scene}} in the monk's cell. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov both use the gong. To Shostakovich, this was too {{elemental}} and simplistic to be effective dramatically, since this bell showed the atmosphere of the monk's estragement. [...] "When the bell tolls," [...] Shostakovich told Solomon Volkov, [...] "it's a reminder that there are powers mightier than man, that you can't escape the judgment of history." [...] Therefore, Shostakovich reorchestrated the bell's tolling by the simultaneous playing of seven instruments—bass clarinet, double bassoon, French horns, gong, harps, piano, and double basses (at an octave). To Shostakovich, this combination of instruments <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a real bell.|$|E

[...] "He [...] settled the affairs of the Slavs and of Heriold, and, leaving Heriold behind in Saxony, returned to his palace in Frankfurt." [...] Harald apparently continued operations against his rivals. An 817 entry of the Royal Annals reports [...] "Because of the persistent aggression of Heriold, the sons of Godofrid, king of the Danes, also sent an embassy to the emperor , asked for peace, and promised to preserve it. This <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> hypocrisy than truth, so it was dismissed as empty talk and aid was given to Heriold against them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beneath the {{constant}} rhythmic improvisation, Dodds played {{a pattern that}} was only somewhat more sophisticated than the basic one/three roll, but was, in fact, identical {{to the rhythm of}} today, only inverted. The rhythm was as follows: two [...] "swung" [...] eighth notes (the first and third notes of an eighth note triplet), a quarter note, and then a repeat of the first three beats (sound sample [...] "Inverted ride pattern" [...] at right). Aside from these patterns, a drummer from this time would have an extremely small role in the band as a whole. Drummers seldom soloed, {{as was the case with}} all other instruments in earliest jazz, which was based heavily on the ensemble. [...] When they did, the resultant performance <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a marching cadence than personal expression. Most other rhythmic ideas came from ragtime and its precursors, like the dotted eighth note series.|$|E
2500|$|On Instruments of Mercy, Beautiful Eulogy {{exhibited}} {{a fusion of}} folk and hip hop music mixed with electronic, indie, hymn tunes, contemporary worship music, and spoken word passages. Michael Wildes The Christian Manifesto noted that [...] "lyrically a hip-hip album, it is rich in folk, electronic and indie inspired music with a feel of the Portland environment, complemented by the natural elements of that city." [...] He further explained that many songs <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> worship music than hip-hop. Christian Today considered the electronic facet of the group [...] "the glue, effortlessly synchronising the cocktail {{which is to be}} found in the instrumentation of their music." [...] However, they further noted that [...] "The style [...] have adopted in their quest to present absolute truths found in the Word of God cannot be pocketed, yet tends to gravitate between a generic rap style and spoken word." [...] HMs Jamie Lee Rake described that album as [...] "alt like crazy", with [...] "musical textures to draw heads deep in their given genre, as well as neo-folkies and aficionados of downtempo EDM", and that Beautiful Eulogy also [...] "venture to reinvent hip-house, albeit in a more glitchy manner." [...] Several critics highlighted [...] "Blessed are the Merciful", which consists of a three-minute sermon clip from Art Azurdia backed by instrumental music.|$|E

2500|$|Fitzmaurice found [...] "Polish Girl" [...] to {{be similar}} to the song [...] "Reunion" [...] by Canadian band Stars, as both songs depict someone trying to recover, and yearning for, young love. Palomo asks {{questions}} in the song that are likely to be unanswered, such as [...] "Do I still cross your mind?/ Your face still distorts the time". Cooke noted the [...] "dazzling syncopated pulse" [...] {{to be similar}} to the coin sound effect in games from the Mario series, and has melodies that [...] "splash and slide around sickly-sweet flurries of arpeggios and a family-friendly feel-good beat". Blurt said that the song includes what sounds like samples from the game Super Mario World, and has the joyful energy of Cut Copy's album Zonoscope. Beats per Minute writer Aurora Mitchell said the song [...] "sounds like 80s disco distorted through an old computer", while AllMusic noted the song <b>sounded</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Palomo's other project Vega than Neon Indian. [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] includes elements of alternative rock, grunge and garage rock. Club Fonograma writer Blanca Méndez said that [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] is about the [...] "staying-at-home-and-staring-at-ceilings early stage" [...] of a breakup, which is [...] "the one in which you allow yourself to wallow in the pain because you deserve at least that much". Méndez noted the song's [...] "tinny layers of sound" [...] and Palomo's [...] "breathy, almost frustrated vocals". The electro-shoegaze song [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] addresses an ex-girlfriend, and includes video game synth timbres similar to those on Psychic Chasms opener [...] "(AM)". Both [...] "The Blindside Kiss" [...] and [...] "Hex Girlfriend" [...] are filled with [...] "buzzsaw"-toned guitars, which BBC Music's John Aizlewood compared to the Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
