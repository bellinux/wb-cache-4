In the Newtonian case, the resulting variational formulation, although classical, uses non-standard functional spaces which include the rigidity constraints. From the numerical point of view, these constraints can be addressed by penalty methods, leading to the possible use of standard finite elements solvers with fixed structured meshes.

The spheres on these new trajectories do not pass each other (as they would in free space) but instead they swap their cross-streamline positions. To determine the significance of the wall-induced particle migration, we have evaluated the hydrodynamic self-diffusion coefficient associated with a sequence of uncorrelated particle displacements due to binary particle encounters. The results of our calculations quantitatively agree with the experimental value obtained by Zarraga-Leighton: 2002 for the self-diffusivity in a dilute suspension of spheres undergoing shear flow in a Couette device.

In order to realistically simulate fault gouge processes {{it is important to}} characterise differences between 2 D and 3 D models and be able to assess whether 2 D models are adequate for approximating 3 D gouge dynamics. In this paper, 2 D and 3 D fault gouges are simu-lated as two rectangular elastic blocks of bonded particles, separated by a region of randomly sized non-bonded <b>spherical</b> gouge particles, <b>sheared</b> in opposite directions by normally-loaded driving plates. The dynamic behav-ior of multiple model parameterisations is analysed by examining instantaneous macroscopic fault friction (µI) statistics. The response of the mean macroscopic friction is characterised for varying values of inter-particle (microscopic) friction µP in 2 D and 3 D and for non-rotational and rotational particle dynamics. In the non-rotational models, realistic angular gouge mean macroscopic friction values (E[µI] ≈ 0. 6) are obtained in the simulations for a 2 D inter-particle friction value of µP = 0. 3 and 3 D value of µP = 0. 2.

Through {{a combination of}} experiments and simulations, we investigate the effect of shear-induced particle diffusion on the transfer of heat across suspensions. The influence of particle size, particle volume fraction and applied shear are examined. By applying a heat pulse to the inner copper wall of a Couette cell and analysing its transient temperature decay, the effective thermal diffusivity of the suspension, α, is obtained. Using index matching and laser-induced fluorescence imaging, we measured individual particle trajectories and calculated their diffusion coefficients. Simulations that combined a lattice Boltzmann technique to solve for the flow and a passive Brownian tracer algorithm to solve for the transfer of heat are in very good agreement with experiments. Fluctuations induced {{by the presence of}} particles within the fluid cause a significant enhancement (> 200 %) of the suspension transport properties. The effective thermal diffusivity was found to be linear with respect to both the Péclet number (Pe = ˙ γ d 2 /α 0 100) and the solid volume fraction (φ 40 %), leading to a simple correlation α/α 0 = 1 + βφPe where β = 0. 046 and α 0 is the thermal diffusivity of the suspension at rest. In our Couette cell, the enhancement was found to be optimum for a volume fraction, φ ≈ 40 %, above which, due to steric effects, both the particle diffusion motion and of the effective thermal diffusion dramatically decrease. No such correlation was found between the average particle rotation and the thermal diffusivity of the suspension, suggesting that the driving mechanism for enhanced transport is the translational particle diffusivity.

All alloys have been studied as bulk wave soldering bars, as-received solder balls and solder joints. Ball Grid Array (BGA) solder joints in a typical electronic configuration were manufactured in-house using both Cu and Pd-Ag metallizations. Microstructural characterisation of all configurations used various types of optical and electron microscopy and showed that the solder pad metallization type {{played a major role in}} intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. There were comparatively fine and coarse-grained microstructures in both as-received solder balls and BGA solder joints depending on ball diameter. Nanoindentation creep measurements in the stress range 20 - 500 MPa showed that grain boundary sliding occurred together with dislocation glide and dislocation climb in the low temperature (25 - 50 °C) and high temperature (100 - 150 °C) regimes respectively. Smaller grain sizes (New elevated temperature mechanical tests were developed using the nanoindentation platform to enable testing of entire solder joints in shear and compression, with stresses in the 1 E- 2 - 3 MPa range, more relevant to in-service conditions than those in nanoindentation. Meso-scale spherical indentation creep behaviour in compression on as-reflowed solder balls showed good agreement with that obtained by conventional nanoindentation.

40|$|Pile {{installation}} is a complicated, {{energy intensive}} process where codes and regulatory standards provide some guidance, but little is understood about coupling and transmission of pile driving energy into {{and through the}} ground in the form of vibrations. These vibrations can cause direct structural damage and damage due to settlement of granular soils. This thesis presents results that give insight to concepts that are still in question concerning pile driving induced vibrations using impact hammers. These results are the outcome of an innovative research comprised of three components: (1) full-scale ground monitoring during impact driving of H-piles in the field, (2) small scale pile driving testing in a controlled laboratory environment and (3) numerical analysis of the impact pile driving process using 3 D finite element analysis. Field pile driving vibration data were collected from five project sites. The mechanisms of energy propagation during impact pile driving were evaluated by installing sensors in the ground, starting very close from the pile (0. 5 ft) and moving away at different radial distances and depths, generating the first data set of its kind. Analysis of the data reinforces the hypothesis of the wave propagation field generated by impact driven piles. Body waves radiate from the pile tip in a <b>spherical</b> wave front. <b>Shear</b> waves propagate outwards from the pile shaft in a cylindrical wave front. The shaft transfer starts only after the pile tip passes below and observation point (sensor). The Rayleigh wave development reported by various researchers is not verified. Attenuation of the peak particle velocity and increase of the shear wave velocity at increasing distances from the pile is also confirmed. A widely used attenuation formula (Bornitz equation) was fitted to the recorded measurements and was found to be a good model to describe the energy degradation through the soil when impact driven piles are used as a source. The attenuation coefficients are in agreement with earlier documented findings. A process to evaluate the potential for a granular soil to undergo shakedown settlement is presented based on the field measurements from the tested sites. This concept can serve as a first guide for identifying potentially troublesome sites with similar site conditions. A decrease of particle velocity and an increase of shear wave velocity with increasing distances from the pile is also verified. Reduced-scale physical experiments of pile driving were conducted in the laboratory. The controlled environment of a homogeneous and properly characterized soil profile allowed for investigation of the mechanisms of energy transfer from the pile to soil without the complexities encountered in the field. The generated wave field follows the pattern found for field testing measurements. The contribution from shear waves is not “seen” by the installed sensors until the pile tip reaches their elevation. These trends substantiate the existence of two wave fields, spherical and cylindrical, generated from a linear source as the pile, a behavior also observed in the field. The pile driving induced vibration field was modeled using a 3 D finite element dynamic analysis. It is clearly shown that a cylindrical wave front emanates from the shaft and a spherical wave front radiates from the pile tip. Preliminary results of calculated ground motions in the very close proximity of the pile showed good agreement with recorded ground motions in the laboratory...|$|R
