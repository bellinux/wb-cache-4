50|$|The spans {{are made}} out of precast concrete, with hollow box-units {{post-tensioned}} to form a <b>spine</b> <b>beam.</b> Each of the 105 ft spans is {{made out of}} 14 precast concrete hollow box-units 7 ft 3in long. Freyssinet (named after Eugène Freyssinet) multi-strand prestressing cables were threaded through ducts in the box sections. Testing of the design was carried on a 1/12th model at the Research Station of the Cement and Concrete Association at Wexham Springs in South Bucks. The design was made by the consulting engineers G. Maunsell (Guy Maunsell) & Partners, who had designed the similar Hammersmith flyover in 1961. The company was known for prestressed concrete flyovers. Maunsell is now part of AECOM. The design received a Concrete Society award.|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} aim of expert systems is {{to emulate the}} expert. The majority of existing expert systems for design try to achieve this by integrating the phases of the design process within one software environment thus achieving an overall automation. These integrated systems tend to support design by numerous repeated analysis due to their inability to suggest good preliminary solutions. The feedback from numerical analyses is needed to modify the preliminary solutions. It is argued here that human experts have {{a different approach to}} design problems. They try to minimize the iterative nature of design by suggesting preliminary solutions which have a higher chance of succeeding at the subsequent detailed design stage. Expert systems {{should be able to do}} the same. Ideally, good preliminary solutions should be tailored to the requirements; this means that they should take account of the majority of constraints and structural behaviors quantitatively while selecting the values for key design parameters. It is suggested here that the numerical processing power of the computer should be used to obtain good preliminary solutions by developing design algorithms, which can take account of governing factors at an early stage of the design process. These in turn can be used to encapsulate knowledge in the expert systems instead of the 'heuristics' which are used to incorporate past experience in existing expert systems. In order to develop these design algorithms, it is necessary to unravel the rationale behind each decision made during the preliminary design stage. In this thesis, the work carried out to rationalize the philosophy of the design process of prestressed concrete <b>spine</b> <b>beams</b> is explained in detail. The main advantage of this approach is that the expert system is compact and fast in execution. It is also capable of guiding the designer in a consultation session either by suggesting appropriate values or allowable ranges for key design parameters, as is done by a human expert.

50|$|As on the ER1, the ER2 car {{bodies are}} of a welded {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque load-bearing design (the entire car body bears all structural loads). The framework is built up from bent and extruded steel profiles, and consists of ring frames which are covered with corrugated sheet steel 1.5-2.5 mm thick. The automatic couplers and their shock absorbers are mounted on short <b>spine</b> <b>beams</b> {{at each end of}} the car. The doors and wire conduits are made of aluminum, which helped to keep the weight down and resulted in the cars being only slightly heavier than those of the ER1. Footboards are fitted under the outside of each door for boarding and alighting to/from low platforms; when boarding/alighting passengers to/from high platforms, these are covered by metal aprons (gap fillers). The end bulkheads of each car (except for the head end of the driving trailer, which is occupied by the engineer's cab) incorporate swing-down transfer platforms which allow passengers to walk between cars; these also damp the cars' pitching motion when the train is moving. The cars are 19.600 m long and 3480 mm wide. The power cars weigh 54.6 t, the driving trailers 40.9 t, and the intermediate trailers 38.3 t.|$|R
40|$|The National Road {{network of}} Sri Lanka {{consists}} of 4326 bridges. There are 365 bridges which Have the length more than 30 m. Only 800 bridges {{are made of}} prestressed concrete superstructures and all others are with reinforced concrete, steel and arches. The most popular types of prestressed beams used in Sri Lanka are inverted T, M, I, and the box beams. The inverted T and M beams are widely used. Further, for 30 m span simply supported bridges, space rectangular box beams and spaced trapezoidal box beams were used. For the continuous bridges big <b>spine</b> <b>beams</b> also have been used with post tension pre-stressing system in recent bridge constructions. For longer span bridges, box beams are highly suitable. Generally box beam has higher torsional capacity because of its closed geometry. The enhanced torsional stiffness of the box beam sections improves the load distribution properties for the superstructure. It has higher bending carrying capacity and requires reduced beam height compared to other beam section for a particular span. Hollow spaces in box beams {{can be used for}} services and it is also aesthetic. In Sri Lanka 19 % of the existing bridges are with prestressed concrete and presently many highway projects are under construction. Therefore, the usage of box beams will improve the effect on the time of construction, cost, construction easiness, aesthetic considerations and utility services. There are different types of box beams available {{that can be used for}} this simply supported span range. They are standard box beam, standard U beam and spaced box beams. The rectangular spaced box beam has been used for a two lane bridge in a 30 m simply supported span and the trapezoidal spaced box beam has been used for a four lane elevated flyover in Sri Lanka. Comparative analysis and design on all these box beams are useful for future bridge constructions. This research is concentrated on the design of 30 m simply supported four lane bridge super structures using the above different types of prestressed box beams separately. The results of analysis and design and the properties of the beams are compared. The total width of the designed bridges is 17. 4 m. It has a central reserve of 1. 2 m. There are four lanes; each lane is 3. 5 m width. There are two pedestrian walk ways of 1. 1 m width. All the bridge decks were modeled in SAP 2000 for the grillage analysis. Loading was done according to BS 5400 : Part 2, 1978, and bending moments, shear forces and torsional moments were found for critical load combination. Prestressing designs were carried out for all beams and the final results are compared. Cost for each deck also compared. The different launching methods adapted for these Bridges are also compared. Conclusions and recommendations are laid down based on these compared results...|$|R
40|$|To {{accurately}} predict buffeting-induced stresses in a long-span {{cable-stayed bridge}} with a twin-box deck, buffeting analyses should {{take into account}} the cross-sectional distribution of both aerodynamic and aeroelastic forces over the surface of the bridge deck. They should also be performed on an accurate multi-scale model rather than a spine-beam model of the bridge. This paper proposes a framework for stress-level buffeting analysis of a long-span cable-stayed bridge with a twin-box deck under distributed wind loads. Methods to obtain distributed aerodynamic and aeroelastic forces on the bridge deck are introduced. The proposed framework synthesizes the buffeting analysis with distributed wind loads and the multi-scale modelling and model updating of long-span bridges. The proposed framework is applied to the Stonecutters cable-stayed bridge in Hong Kong. The responses computed using the proposed buffeting analysis framework are compared with those computed using the sectional-force-based traditional method on a spine-beam model. The comparative results show significant differences in stress distribution on the twin-box deck and the multi-scale model yields larger maximum stress responses compared with the <b>spine</b> <b>beam</b> model.

40|$|A Thesis submited to the Departmenrt of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of Structural Engineering DesignABSTRACT There {{are about}} 3800 bridges on National Road Network with length varying from 3. 0 m to 300. 0 m. These bridges have varying widths about 3. 0 m to 20. 0 m {{and some of}} these have been {{constructed}} more than 50 to 100 years back. Most of the bridges span 30 m and above. They were constructed using steel concrete composite or steel. Steel is a very costly material, even though it has some very good structural advantages. / Few bridges have been constructed in the recent past using T,M,Y,I beams in the span around 30 m by launching side by side. And this was a very tedious procedure. Aesthetic view of a bridge has been neglected during the past 50 years or more due to the design complexity. Time for completion of a bridge has become an uphill task these days due to the price fluctuation and other constrains such as traffic and utility services. / This study is concentrated on the design of a simply supported 30 m pre-stressed post tensioned box girder and comparing the properties and other advantages mainly with the Double T beams. Mainly the geometry of the box girder was selected with the help of past research papers and the geometry of the double T beam was selected where the cross sectional area is approximately equal to the cross sectional area of the box girder. Design of the box girder is done using three dimensional finite element method and the <b>spine</b> <b>beam</b> method. Although the Finite Element method is very versatile and powerful manual, calculations is also done as box girders designs are very rare. As the history of the double T beams arc also very rare, it is also designed using SAP 2000, <b>spine</b> <b>beam,</b> and three dimensional Finite Element methods. / Both beams are analyzed for HA,HB moving loads. Load combinations are considered, dead plus HA live load as load combination 2 and dead plus HB as load combination 3 Shear force, bending moment, tortional moment, support reactions, stresses, amount of tendons were compared. In spite of that, the launching method, capability for utility services were also compared. Conclusions and the recommendations of the study will be laid down based on the results in the stud...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{vibration}} due to earthquake {{can damage}} the curved bridges that are the main interconnecting component for traffic separation structures of the urban highway system. Failure of bridges during and after a seismic event is vulnerable as bridges are lifeline structures. This work investigates the application of semi-active variable stiffness damper for a seismic control of the horizontally curved bridge isolated with different passive devices. The main objectives of the study are to investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} hybrid system and to find the optimum hybrid system for the seismic control of the curved bridge with different control laws of a damper. The selected bridge is a three-span continuous concrete box girder supported on pier and rigid abutment. The bridge deck is modeled as a single <b>spine</b> <b>beam</b> and the supporting pier is modeled as linear lumped mass system. The bridge is excited with four different ground motions having different ground motion characteristics with all three-ground motion components (horizontal as well as vertical). The results of the analysis demonstrate that the use of semi-active variable stiffness damper with different isolators is very effective in controlling the response of the curved bridge. The combination of semi-active variable stiffness damper and lead rubber bearing can provide an effective way for overall seismic control of the curved bridge. The use of modified switching control law for damper is as effective as switching control law with less number of sensors...|$|E
50|$|The viaduct {{was opened}} in March 1968 and cost £6 million to build. The {{structure}} {{is unusual in}} that it is built as steel box girders, {{at a time when most}} long span bridges were being built of post-tensioned concrete deck design. This use of steel allowed a significant cost saving over alternative methods, but became controversial after three serious disasters, when new bridges collapsed in 1970 (West Gate Bridge and Cleddau Bridge) and 1971 (South Bridge (Koblenz)). Fifty-one people were killed in these failures, leading in the UK to the formation of the Merrison Committee. The report of the Merrison committee resulted in the temporary closure of two of the carriageways on the lower deck and two on the upper deck, the installation of extra steel strengthening bands around the bridge's support columns and other works which were completed in 1983. A further program of strengthening was completed in 2006. The recent work to strengthen the bridge was a very complex operation, with a lot of the work happening inside the box <b>beam</b> <b>spine.</b> The works took over 3 years and cost £82 million (14 times the original bridge building cost). The strengthening project won the British construction industry's Major Project Award in 2005.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: In {{this study}} factors are {{analyzed}} that may potentially influence {{the site of}} failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related, and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972 - 1991. Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to the cribiform plate and {{to the floor of}} the temporal fossa was carefully assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19 children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47 %) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36 children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0. 049). Neither the total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size, or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach this goal. Treating the <b>spine</b> with electron <b>beams</b> was not deletereous. A significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach...|$|R
40|$|Ivo Maoík M. D. {{has treated}} many child {{patients}} with scoliosis at the "Centre for Locomotor Defects", Olšanská 7, 130 00 Prague 3. The author has cooperated with him, and composed {{the computer program}} for the spine stress state under brace effects and for simulating scoliosis treatment. The program simulates the spinal curve remodelling {{in time for a}} specific child patients, and the algorithm for stress state calculation and treatment simulation is given. Orthopaedists in the Czech Republic use Cheneau-type or Cerny-type corrective braces. The brace exerts force effects on the skeleton of a child. The brace is made individually for each patient, in the following way: first, a negative plaster form of the child`s trunk is made, and then the positive plaster form is created. The orthopaedist determines the places where brace has to load the patient`s trunk, and the plaster form deepened in these places {{on the basis of his}} advice. The laminate brace made according to this plaster form constricts the child`s trunk (like a tight shoe). This paper shows how the stress state is determined in vertebrae and in inter-vertebral discs, and the solution of spinal curvature correction under brace force effects for a specific child patient. The project aims to find the dependence of the activation and velocity of spinal curvature correction in the spinal stress state for many patients. The paper shows the computing algorithms for spinal deformations and the stress state under brace force effects, and a simulation of spinal curvature correction. Spinal curvature is determined according to measured values on an X-ray of a patient before a brace is applied. The stress state in the spine and the spinal deformation are investigated by the finite element method as <b>beam</b> (<b>spine)</b> in an elastic ground (soft tissue). Two algorithms are used. The first algorithm deals with the spine above and below the soft tissues, and it is loaded by given displacements of the trunk surface. The second algorithm determines from the X-ray of a patient with and without a brace the spine deformation and the spine stress state, and the necessary trunk surface displacement is determined from this deformation. The calculation algorithm and parameters were compared with contest of treatment. The trunk surface load was checked by sensor that plates were placed into the braces to measure the load values between the brace and the surface of the child. The simulation program assesses the spinal curvature correction according to the spinal curvature type, the spinal stress state and the period of time for which the brace will be applied...|$|R
40|$|Design of {{continuous}} prismatic prestressed concrete continuous spine beams {{is a complex}} task, primarily due to the secondary moments that occur {{as a result of}} the prestressing effects. In prestressed concrete members, it is useful to select the smallest possible section while satisfying the criteria like the use of a particular construction technique, constructability and stress limits. The methods that can be employed for selecting the smallest section dimensions by considering the global and local bending, constructability, restrictions on depth etc. are highlighted. It is advantageous to minimise the total cable force (∫Pds) used for a continuous prestressed concrete prismatic <b>spine</b> <b>beam</b> with respect to economy and constructability. It is shown in this paper that the total cable force cannot be minimised by using a constant cable force throughout the length. For that, different cable forces could be used in span and support regions. It is also shown that for any given section, there is a maximum cable force that should not be exceeded over the supports. The selection of secondary moments to ensure that the cable profile zone resulting from the minimum cable forces will lie within the section is also highlighted. When the cable force changes, there will be point moments and point forces that will act at those sections. A straight forward method is presented for dealing with these when finding the cable profile that will satisfy the stress limits and also generate the secondary moment distribution already selected at the beginning of the design...|$|E
