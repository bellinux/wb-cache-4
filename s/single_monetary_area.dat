40|$|Abstract: From {{historical}} {{point of}} view, each country {{used to have}} its own currency, but from economic point of view, we can ask the following question: why does a <b>single</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>area</b> have to correspond with the space of a nation? Practically, national currencies are useful because they make trade and financial transactions easier. The introduction of a single currency in a certain space must take into account certain criteria, because the space for a single currency is not infinite. The Central Bank of the area cannot react to local changes, therefore some costs will appear if we use a single currency...|$|E
40|$|The {{thematic}} {{framework of}} this work is the nominal and real convergence as a determinant for joining the European monetary union. The focus {{of the work is}} to prove that realising the criteria of the convergence affects the stability of the European monetary union, that is, that the cause of destabilisation is exactly the fact that certain member nations have not realised the assigned convergence criteria. The financial integration is an important question because it contributes to the economic growth affecting free exchange with the goal of a more efficient allocation of capital; it {{is the result of the}} economic theory and the empirical research. Introducing the Euro as a single payment method while losing the monetary sovereignty of the countries which have accepted it is the main reason for forming the European Central Bank. The mission of the European Central Bank is to define and conduct a single monetary policy within the Eurozone. Because of the already mentioned facts, the challenges of conducting the fiscal policy within the Eurozone as well as the key aspects of the monetary unification of Europe have been analysed.

40|$|European {{monetary}} {{integration policy}} nowadays {{centers on the}} search for a common money by opposition to a <b>single</b> <b>monetary</b> unit; but many problems remain as to the means of achieving this end. After reviewing the perennial discussions concerned with the foundations of this monetary integration (e. g. the problems of the optimum of a <b>monetary</b> <b>area,</b> where Mr. Bourguinat challenges the criteria based on differential factor mobility or on the relative degree of "openness"), the study analyses the narrowing of margins in the light of recent experience. Considering the events of 1972 and 1973 the narrowing of margins is a very difficult task; it means nothing less than creating for the E. E. C. members an island of stability in a world environment becoming evermore flexible. The freedom which has been lost on exchange rate fluctuations seems to have resulted in an increased instability of par values (e. g. the successive revaluations of the deutschmark, the florin, etc.). For the achievement of a truly common money the author suggests an alternative approach: it consists in issuing, side by side with national currencies, a unit called an Europa; serving initially as a unit of account, the Europa would gradually become a true means of payment...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} studies analyzing {{the relevance of}} the theory on the optimal <b>monetary</b> <b>areas</b> for the excommuniststates reach different conclusions, estimating the economic convergence on the basis of various factors:economic structure, intensity of trade linkages, exchange rate volatility, size of the national economy, foreign directinvestment, and exports structure based on products and from a geographical point of view. As for the business cyclecorrelation between {{the old and the new}} EU members, these studies led to contradictory results, but the relevance itselfof this criterion concerning the lack of asymmetric shocks is being questioned. In a monetary union, on the one hand,the business cycle synchronization makes the <b>single</b> <b>monetary</b> policy work efficiently and on the other hand, theasymmetry of the economic shocks makes the single currency more stable. Starting from the results of the studyconducted by Bayoumi and Eichengreen in order to establish the Optimum Currency Area indices and taking intoaccount the size of the countries included in this analysis, we reach the conclusion that the size of a national economy isan important indicator in establishing the degree of monetary optimality of a certain region, influencing in inverse ratiothe monetary optimality of the region. The larger a country is, the lower economic convergence is in comparison with agroup of states, because of the extremely diversified production, that in its turn will lead to a lower level of economicopenness...|$|R

40|$|The Euro area {{economic}} activity and banking sector have shown substantial fragility {{over the last}} years with remarkable country heterogeneity. Using detailed data on lending conditions and standards, we analyse how financial fragility has affected the transmission mechanism of the <b>single</b> Euro <b>area</b> <b>monetary</b> policy during the crisis until the end of 2011. The analysis shows that the monetary transmission mechanism has been time-varying and influenced by the financial fragility of the sovereigns, banks, firms and households. The impact of monetary policy on aggregate output is stronger during the financial crisis, especially in countries facing increased sovereign financial distress. This amplification mechanism, moreover, operates mainly through the credit channel, both the bank lending and the non-financial borrower balance-sheet channel. Our results suggest that the bank-lending channel has been partly mitigated by the ECB nonstandard monetary policy interventions. At the same time, when looking at the transmission through banks of different sizes, it seems that, until the end of 2011, the impact of credit frictions of borrowers have not been significantly reduced, especially in distressed countries. Since small banks tend to lend primarily to SME, we infer that the policies adopted until the end of 2011 might have fall short of reducing credit availability problems stemming from deteriorated firm net worth and risk conditions, especially for small firms in countries under stress...|$|R
