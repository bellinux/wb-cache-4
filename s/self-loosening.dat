50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct torque. The inner nut is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the bolt threads and preventing <b>self-loosening.</b> When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a thin nut (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is proposed for investigating {{the effect of}} non-parallel (wedge) contact on the loosening performance of a preloaded bolt-nut connection under transverse cyclic excitation along the wedge direction.

40|$|By {{considering}} the tightening process, a three-dimensional elastic {{finite element analysis}} is conducted to explore the mechanism of bolt <b>self-loosening</b> under transverse cyclic loading. According to the geometrical features of the thread, a hexahedral meshing is implemented by modifying the node coordinates based on cylinder meshes and an ABAQUS plug-in is made for parametric modeling. The accuracy of the finite element model is verified and validated by comparison with the analytical and experimental results on torque-tension relationship. And, then, the fastening states acquired by different means are compared. The {{results show that the}} tightening process cannot be replaced by a simplified method because its fastening state is different from the real process. With combining the tightening and <b>self-loosening</b> processes, this paper utilizes the relative rotation angles and velocities to investigate the slip states on contact surfaces instead of the Coulomb friction coefficient method, which is used in most previous researches. By contrast, this method can describe the slip states in greater detail. In addition, the simulation result reveals that there exists a creep slip phenomenon at contact surface, which causes the bolt <b>self-loosening</b> to occur even when some contact facets are stuck...|$|E
40|$|<b>Self-loosening</b> of {{bolts and}} nuts is a {{significant}} issue for bolted fasteners. In recent years, this problem has been a hot topic {{in the field of}} pressure vessels and piping. Several research papers have been presented from several institutes and the mechanism and phenomena have been almost understood. This paper offers a countermeasure based on the authors ’ long time research activity on the non-loosening performance of various types of nuts. Their research has indicated that prescribed plastic deformation of nut heads may prevent or decrease loosening. This phenomenon was reproduced using Finite Element Analysis...|$|E
40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and <b>self-loosening</b> of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The <b>self-loosening</b> characteristics of prevailing torque nuts were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of prevailing torque when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the prevailing torque when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for prevailing torque nuts on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist <b>self-loosening.</b> This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, prevailing torque nuts can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the loosening torque acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the loosening torque range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory. It was also found that the friction coefficient in the circumfrential direction in the threads is greated than that on the nut face bearing surface during conditions of transverse slip...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} Finite Element {{model is}} used to investigate the loosening behavior of countersunk threaded fasteners subjected to cyclic shear loading applied through prescribed transverse excitation to the fastener head. Fasteners with conical head profile require precision machining of both the fastener head and the mating joint hole. Any mismatch between the head and the joint conical angles affects the torque tension relationship {{as well as the}} loosening performance. Investigation focuses on the loosening behavior in its early stages. Factors investigated include the effect of the bolt head/joint hole contact location, joint elastic modulus, and tapped hole clearance for different combinations of thread fit, on the loosening performance of preloaded countersunk-head bolts.

Bolted joints are the most commonly used components in machines and structures. The two failure modes that are found in bolted joints subjected to cyclic loading are fatigue and <b>self-loosening.</b> Fatigue is the major failure form for a bolted joint subjected to tensile load. In this thesis, experimental and finite element analysis has been performed to comprehend the behavior of the bolted joint, loosened due to severe vibrations, and the parameters needed for detecting the loosening process.

30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>self-loosening</b> of {{threaded}} fasteners subjected to dynamic shear load. Three kinds of typical coatings, PTFE, MoS 2, and TiN applied to bolts and nuts, are tested in this investigation. The study experimentally examines the loosening mechanisms of fasteners and assesses the anti-loosening {{performance of the}} three tested coatings based on their tightening characteristics, loosening curves, and the damage of thread surface. Additionally, the anti-loosening performance of the three coatings is compared under different load forms. The {{results indicate that the}} PTFE and MoS 2 coatings have significant anti-loosening effect, whereas the anti-loosening performance of TiN coating is not satisfactory. It is also found that an appropriate increase of the initial tightening torque can significantly improve the anti-loosening effect. In addition, the microscopic analyses of PTFE and MoS 2 coating reveal that a reduced initial tightening torque leads to fretting wear on the thread contact surfaces of fasteners, thereby aggravating the damage.|$|E
40|$|Prevailing {{torque nuts}} are an {{extremely}} popular method of providing resistance to vibration-induced <b>self-loosening</b> of fasteners. Such nuts have a self-contained prevailing torque feature {{that provides a}} degree of resistance to rotation. Although such nuts are frequently used, it is not widely realized that they can occasionally come completely detached from bolts. The mechanism by which this can occur has hitherto been unidentified since {{it has not been}} possible to replicate detachment under laboratory testing. This article identifies a general condition that can result in the complete loosening and detachment of prevailing torque type nuts. This mechanism involves the application of an axial load when transverse joint slip is occurring. This article describes a modified Junker test machine that allows the application of axial loading to a joint while experiencing transverse displacement. Tests have been completed using an intermittent as well as a constant axial load. Loading in both modes has been demonstrated to result in the complete detachment of this nut type. Based on this investigation, if the magnitude of the axial loading exceeds the residual preload in the bolt retained from sustaining transverse movement alone, the all-metal type of prevailing torque nut can completely detach. Applications that involve shear and axial loading being simultaneously applied to a joint are numerous in engineering...|$|E
40|$|Nuts {{and bolts}} used in aero-engines are {{manufactured}} from heat-resistant super-alloys. These materials {{have a high}} CoF, and frequently seizure occurs. In order to prevent this, a silver coating {{is applied to the}} nut threads, providing a low friction boundary at the interface. Additionally, a radial crimp is applied to the nut, in order to provide a self-locking feature preventing vibration <b>self-loosening.</b> In this study, the CoF of the thread contact will be investigated both during initial joint assembly, and after thermal ageing. Additionally, a finite element model will be employed to investigate the contact mechanics {{as a consequence of the}} crimp. The low CoF observed during initial assembly was found to be a consequence of shear flow of the silver coating, with an approximate doubling of this value once the coating aged. Areas of silver removal were found to be coincident with areas of high contact pressure in the joint, attributable to the crimp feature. Additionally, new alternatives coating were tested in order to identify a replacement for the electroplated silver. Through a series of analyses, similarly done for the silver coating, from a list of 19 different thin films and paints, the list is reduced to three possible films, Chromium, Titanium and Nickel-Titanium. Finally, through the FEA approach, a new self-locking design was developed, with an axial deformation instead of the radial crimp typically used. Thereafter, few nuts were manufactured, tested and compared to the elliptical, demonstrating it is a promising design with respect to the contact pressure distribution and silver removal. ...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{execution}} of joints with lock-bolts for steel structures. A large number of mechanical joints for steel structures is generated with conventional bolts. Still, this proven joining technology has some significant disadvantages. These include the big scattering of inserting the preload using the torque-tightening method, the risk of <b>self-loosening</b> by cyclic loads causing a cross movement of the components {{as well as the}} low fatigue resistance for axial loads. The lock-bolt technology was already invented in the 1930 s and mainly used for the aviation and space industry in support of its evident advantages. Due to demands from different industrial markets, like aviation, truck, trailer, rail, bus, agriculture, mining, military and steel construction industry, the lock-bolt technology was further developed and applied. Its application, particularly in the mechanical engineering sector, was mainly possible due to individual investigations performed by the users of the technology. These investigations were costly but necessary {{due to the lack of}} consistent design rules, which hindered a broader implementation and the calculation of lock-bolt connections in the construction and building industry. Within the scope of several research projects funded by the AiF (German Federation of Industrial Research Associations) the Fraunhofer-Application Center for Large Structures in Production Engineering successively developed calculation rules, which will be introduced to the reader within the scope of this paper with the aim to utilise the advantages of this joining technique. Furthermore, the applicability in the building industry with general technical approvals will be exemplified and current applications demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the characteristics and structural properties of bolted connections in steel structures with the main focus on the design adequacy and failure mechanisms of high-strength friction-grip (HSFG) bolted connections.  As a case study, the bolted connections on the Mary River Bridge along Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory have been investigated. The composite highway bridge is composed of reinforced concrete deck over five simply supported spans of structural steelwork. The structural steelwork includes five main UB girders connected to diaphragms and horizontal bracings by HSFG bolted connections. Initial inspection of the bridge found {{that a number of}} bolts were loosened, missing or had already fractured and most were heavily corroded. Remedial works in which the original bolted connections have been replaced and the new ones ensured to be installed at the correct tension have been recently completed.  The structural and environmental factors that {{may have contributed to the}} eventual failure of the bolts have been investigated. The design adequacy of the bolted connections compared to the externally applied loads on the bridge superstructure was checked in accordance with current standards: AS 5100 and AS 4100. The failure mechanisms of the fractured bolts were investigated. The residual loads on the original bolts have been identified through slip testing on both the original bolts and new HSFG bolts in double shear configuration. The fractured bolts were analysed through optical and scanned electron microscopy. The design fatigue life of the bolts were identified through fatigue testing of the M 16 bolts in double shear configuration and the M 22 bolts subjected to cyclic tensile load. The difference of the rate of corrosion of the bolts with and without the zinc plate corrosion protection was also identified.  It was found that the main factors the contributed to the failure of the bolted connections at the Mary River Bridge include overstressing of the bolts, the fluctuating loads, the eventual abrasion and wear of the corrosive protection and the corrosive environment it was subjected to. The failure mechanisms of the fractured bolts were mainly due to corrosion and fretting fatigue. Similarly, the bolts subjected to tension, have failed due to <b>self-loosening</b> over time...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} the phenomena which characterize threaded connections. This type of joint {{has been known}} for thousands years (one of the first applications is attributable to Archimedes) allows transforming a torque into an axial force, typically used to lock two or more components thanks to the friction forces that arise between the connected bodies. One of the main strengths of this type of coupling is the possibility to assemble and disassemble the assembled parts; in addition, it can be applicable to almost any type of material. However, the joint system is characterized by a low efficiency: only a modest amount of the tightening torque is actually converted into axial force. In addition, the obtained axial force is typically affected by a large scatter. This behavior is due to the combined effect of two different friction effects that arise between the under-head of the screw (or nut) and the surface of the elements to be locked in the first case, and between the screw threads and female screw in the second one. The relationship between tightening torque and preload axial force is very sensitive to the effect of the various friction coefficients that rule the tribological behavior of the joint:, these coefficients have a significant variability due to the processes used to manufacture the components, and to the different tightening parameters, such as the presence of lubrication or the tightening speed. Threaded connections do have a wide array of applications, both in the field of civil engineering and in mechanics. For instance, in the automotive compartment, due to a steadily growing strive towards weight reduction and increased automation of assembly procedures, an accurate knowledge of the performance of threaded connections has recently become critical in order to achieve the safety of the junction at an adequate production cost. In order to control a threaded connection, it is necessary to focus on the three main factors that characterize its behavior: the coefficients of friction at tightening, the self-relaxation phenomenon (decrease of axial preload in the first few seconds after tightening, due to sinking of the load bearing area in the clamped parts), <b>self-loosening</b> (loss of axial preload, typically due to the action of external shearing forces). In the following, literature review will be presented first, then it will be shown an experimental investigation on the effect of solid lubrication on the friction coefficients, carried out for repeated tightenings and different surface treatments. Moreover, the effect of the number of engaged threads on the performance of an anaerobic threadlocking adhesive will be examined. The need for these analyses arose from the study of an in-field failure occurred in a pinion shaft of a transmission for earth moving machines, which, as it will be shown in the following, probably failed due to a combination of the aforementioned typical issues of threaded components. The research has the aim of increasing the knowledge about the effect of lubrication on the different phenomena that contribute to determining the performance of a bolted connection...|$|E
