The factory has about 250 workers, over a quarter are residents of the kibbutz, and manufactures plastic netting used for bundling crops. Tama {{is one of the biggest}} players in the worldwide market for this product and works with equipment makers such as John Deere. It has factories in three countries with a total number of 900 workers.

5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy {{and the rights of}} teachers. In The Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not to live up to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as men. However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E

5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E

While CASA fully endorsed the foundation's renewal, {{on the basis that}} non-renewal would constitute a significant cut to student financial assistance, the CFS had called for the organization to be replaced with a system of grants based purely on financial need. After the announcement was made, the CFS noted that the new grant program was just “splitting the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> grant <b>money</b> among more students”.|$|R
25|$|On July 8, 2014, {{at around}} 13:30, National Security Agency {{operatives}} {{carried out a}} raid at the City King Hotel in Monrovia without a warrant. Five NSA operatives burst into a hotel room where the Korean businessmen and Aly had been holding a discussion for a few minutes. Cash {{in the amount of}} US$247,500 and other possessions including a gas dish, melting dish, two packs of gold testing chemicals, an electronic gold scale, and two pocket wallets containing money and credit cards were seized by the NSA.

25|$|In 1929 Alfredo Binda won {{a record}} eight {{consecutive}} stages {{on the way}} to his third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory. This Giro began in Rome, which was the second time that the Giro had not started in Milan in the history of its running. When Binda came to the finish in Milan, he was booed by some of the spectators. The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire— the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> the winner of the Giro would get— not to participate in the Giro. Binda's absence left the field open for everyone else. The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race. Marchisio held a slim fifty-two second lead for the last six stages of the race to the finish in Milan. Marchisio became the youngest rider to win the Giro at 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days; his record stood for ten years before being broken by Fausto Coppi.|$|E
25|$|A nine-point game {{is another}} variant of match play {{typically}} played among threesomes, where each hole {{is worth a}} total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format {{can be used to}} wager on the game systematically; players each contribute the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> to the pot, and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.|$|E

25|$|After World War I, the UK Government {{set up a}} {{committee}} to investigate the various systems of railway electrification; in 1921, it recommended that 1,500VDC overhead should be the future national standard. Several schemes were implemented in its wake, but the Great Depression and World War II meant that very little work was done. Technological advances after 1945 meant that the 25kVAC system was adopted instead for the West Coast Main line and Glasgow suburban electrification (as {{set out in the}} BR 1955 Modernisation Plan).

25|$|The cost of {{preparing}} and filing all business and {{personal income tax}} returns {{is estimated to be}} $250–$300 billion each year. Approximately the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> was estimated for calculating the tax implications of business decisions. That means approximately $500 to $600 billion was spent in the process of collecting roughly four times as much in taxes. According to a 2005 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the efficiency cost of the current tax system—the output that is lost over and above the tax itself—is between $240 billion and $600 billion every year. Supporters argue that the FairTax system would reduce these compliance and efficiency costs by 90% and return a larger share of that money to the productive economy. With the FairTax system, the cost of compliance would be built into the tax by allowing the business and the State to keep 1/4 of 1% of taxes collected. A 2007 study by the Beacon Hill Institute found that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system {{from the point of view}} of the administration, collection, and filing costs.|$|E
25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E

50|$|Parenthood is {{seemingly}} {{the type}} of care work that evokes the most significant, and most common, care penalty. Since the mere cost in dollars of raising a child increases constantly, the sacrifices one has to make to raise children are increasing at the <b>same</b> rate. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> parents give up to their children is only money they are taking away from themselves; this is an extreme care penalty. Separate from the issue <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> children tend to cause parents to make many other sacrifices. Being responsible for a child can dictate a person’s decisions on where to live, {{what to do in}} their free time, and what jobs to take. There are opportunities that are necessary to turn down when one is held accountable for another person’s well being, which is the perfect definition of the care penalty.|$|R
3000|$|Meanwhile, some {{scholars}} have explored more explicitly the mechanisms underlying the linkage between political decentralization and innovation. Taylor (2007) summarized the linkages of decentralization and innovation into four mechanisms, focusing {{on the effects of}} vertical decentralization (Lijphart, 1999). 1 Firstly, vertical decentralization of power from central to local governments tend {{to increase the number of}} actors performing as well as participating in R&D activities. This proliferation of stakeholders in the national R&D system helps to multiply technological experimental efforts. Secondly, as in the Delaware Effect, the increase of political unit leads to higher competition for investment or other resources among them, which should in turn encourage greater innovation to attract more investment (Cary, 1974; Oates, 1972). Thirdly, local governments have greater and better information and knowledge on local conditions than remote central governments, which would lead to innovations that reflect better local preferences and constraints (Hayek, 1945; Tiebout, 1956). As an example, with the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> R&D <b>money,</b> some states may use it to advance basic research, while others use it to fund more practical initiatives. Finally, under decentralized governance, it is hard for interest groups to capture bureaucracies, as there are more veto players in the political system. Technological innovation would be facilitated more in decentralized systems more resistant to capture by vested interests (Weingast, 1995). 2 [...]...|$|R
500|$|Lucas's {{choice of}} {{background}} music {{was crucial to}} the mood of each scene, but he was realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances and suggested a number of alternative tracks.

Her husband, meanwhile, served in the Home Guard, besides continuing as a barrister. As he was new to his career, Rougier did not earn much money, and paper rationing during the war caused lower sales of Heyer's books. To meet their expenses Heyer sold the Commonwealth rights for These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, and Regency Buck to her publisher, Heinemann, for £750. A contact at the publishing house, her close friend A.S. Frere, later offered to return the rights to her for the <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> she was paid. Heyer {{refused to accept the}} deal, explaining that she had given her word to transfer the rights. Heyer also reviewed books for Heinemann, earning 2guineas for each review, and she allowed her novels to be serialized in Women's Journal prior to their publication as hardcover books. The appearance of a Heyer novel usually caused the magazine to sell out completely, but she complained that they [...] "always like my worst work".|$|E
500|$|On being {{filed on}} September 8, 1981, District Judge Lee Roy West recused {{himself from the}} case, being an alumnus of the University of Oklahoma for both his {{undergraduate}} and law degrees.

[...] During the trial, the NCAA claimed {{that it was a}} voluntary organization and if the plaintiffs or other schools did not wish to abide by the NCAA rules, they were free to terminate their membership. [...] It was shown that the amount of money paid by ABC to teams appearing on television was established by Thomas C. Hansen, the NCAA Television Program Director. [...] Universities were not allowed to negotiate their own terms. Burciaga pointed out an example of the control and price fixing by noting that in 1981, Oklahoma and the University of Southern California (both then ranked in the top 5 of the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll) appeared on 200 stations in a regional broadcast.

40|$|The {{economic}} crunch {{created a}} specific context for activity and profitability failing. The corruption {{is more and}} more common in our days. In the <b>same</b> time, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> lost by businesses and the public sector to larger frauds increased last year to unthinkable limits. The shareholders expect the directors to take care to protect their company’s assets. This is why the financial controller has a very important role in each organization. The techniques to detect corruption or a fraud are developing every year. Thus, the introduction of computerized accounting has created the opportunities to conduct very comprehensive tests at relatively little cost. However, the fraudsters became more and more clever, and the controllers are responsible for the prevention and detection of fraud. The procedures that controllers should adopt with regard to fraud depend on the risk that fraud could occur and remain undetected and also the risk of that fraud impairing the truth and fairness of the statement. corruption; fraud; internal control; internal audit; business fraud...|$|R
5000|$|Financial innovations, such as credit default swaps and {{synthetic}} CDO. Credit default swaps provided insurance to investors against {{the possibility of}} losses {{in the value of}} tranches from default in exchange for premium-like payments, making CDOs appear [...] "to be virtually risk-free" [...] to investors. [...] Synthetic CDOs were cheaper and easier to create than original [...] "cash" [...] CDOs. Synthetics [...] "referenced" [...] cash CDOs, replacing interest payments from MBS tranches with premium-like payments from credit default swaps. Rather than providing funding for housing, synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance against mortgage default. If the CDO did not perform per contractual requirements, one counterparty (typically a large investment bank or hedge fund) had to pay another. [...] As underwriting standards deteriorated and the housing market became saturated, subprime mortgages became less abundant. Synthetic CDOs began to fill in for the original cash CDOs. Because more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the <b>same</b> original, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> that moved among market participants increased dramatically.|$|R
40|$|The {{retirement}} income landscape is changing dramati-cally.

At the <b>same</b> time, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> people will have in retirement relative to their pre-retirement earnings is likely to decline as Social Security becomes less generous and people have to rely increasingly on 401 (k) balances, which to date have been quite modest. Given these changes, {{this is a good}} time to take stock of where Americans are today and where they will be in the future as they approach retirement. The National Retirement Risk Index does just that. It measures the percentage of working-age households who are at risk of being financially unprepared for retirement at age 65. The Index is calculated by com-paring projected replacement rates for a nationally rep-resentative sample of households — projected retire-ment income as a percent of pre-{{retirement income}} — with target rates. The target rates — which vary by household type — would allow the household to main-tain its pre-retirement living standard in retirement.
