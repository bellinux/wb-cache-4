30|$|Most of the {{photocatalytic}} {{water splitting}} is conducted at neutral pH {{due to the}} stability issue of most semiconductor photocatalysts. Therefore, {{it is important to}} study the electrolysis of water under neutral pH. In acidic or alkaline conditions, pH 0 and 14, respectively, one H+ or OH− ion is present among approximately 55 H 2 O molecules. In terms of kinetics, the reaction with hydronium ions (protons) or hydroxyl ions that have a very large diffusion coefficient is more facile than that with water molecules for reduction and oxidation, respectively [26, 100]. In neutral conditions, however, a different reaction mechanism has been observed [26, 101]. Insufficient hydronium/hydroxyl ion activities at near-neutral pH induced the limiting diffusion currents of reactions with these ions. In this condition, buffering actions are effective based on the reactant switching over varied pH [101]. In addition, for electrochemical measurements, the supporting electrolyte is an essential component for avoiding <b>solution</b> resistance (<b>iR</b> <b>drop).</b> We recently reported a rigorous study on the effect of a supporting electrolyte for electrochemical hydrogen evolution under neutral conditions in a buffered system [102].

While power planning tools can optimize a power grid for a specified maximum <b>IR</b> <b>drop,</b> this level of detail omits two important factors from analysis.

High on-chip currents, required to charge and discharge large on-chip loads while operating at high frequencies, produce significant transient <b>IR</b> voltage <b>drops</b> within a power distribution network.

The impact {{of the increase in}} power is multi-discipline to researchers ranging from power supply design, power converters or voltage regulators design, system, board and package thermal analysis, power grid design and signal integrity analysis to minimizing power itself. This work focuses on challenges arising due to increase in power to power grid design and analysis. Challenges arising due to lower geometries and higher power are very well researched topics and there is still lot of scope to continue work. Traditionally, designs go through average <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> analysis. Average <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> analysis is highly dependent on current dissipation estimation. This work proposes a vector less probabilistic toggle estimation which is extension of one of the approaches proposed in literature. We have further used toggles computed using this approach to estimate power of ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. This provides insight into quality of toggles being generated. Power Estimation work is further extended to comprehend with various state of the art methodologies available i. e. spice based power estimation, logic simulation based power estimation, commercially available tool comparisons etc. We finally arrived at optimum flow recommendation which can be used as per design need and schedule. Today’s design complexity – high frequencies, high logic densities and multiple level clock and power gating - has forced design community to look beyond average <b>IR</b> <b>drop.</b> High rate of switching activities induce power supply fluctuations to cells in design which is known as instantaneous <b>IR</b> <b>drop.</b> However, there is no good analysis methodology in place to analyze this phenomenon. Ad hoc decoupling planning and on chip intrinsic decoupling capacitance helps to contain this noise but there is no guarantee. This work also applies average toggle computation approach to compute instantaneous <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> analysis for designs. Instantaneous <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> is also known as dynamic <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> or power supply noise. We are proposing cell characterization methodology for standard cells. This data is used to build power grid model of the design. Finally, the power network is solved to compute instantaneous <b>IR</b> <b>drop.</b> Leakage Power Minimization has forced design teams to do complex power gating – multilevel MTCMOS usage in Power Grid. This puts additonal analysis challenge for Power Grid in terms of ON/OFF sequencing and noise injection due to it.

It further suggests a simple approach to quickly access the impact of MTCMOS gates in Power Grid in terms of peak currents and <b>IR</b> <b>drop.</b> Alternatively, the approach suggested also helps in MTCMOS gate optimization.

40|$|Abstract–Due to {{the high}} {{integration}} on vertical stacked layers, power/ground network design becomes one of the critical challenges in 3 D IC design. With the leakage-thermal dependency, the increasing on-chip temperature in 3 D designs has serious impact on <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> due to the increased wire resistance and increased leakage current. Power/ground (P/G) TSVs can help to relieve the <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> violation by vertically connecting the on-chip P/G networks on different layers. However, most previous work only fulfills a margin of the full potential of PG TSVs planning since the P/G grids are restricted in a uniform topology. Besides, the overlook of resistance variation and leakage current will make the results less accurate. In this paper, we present an efficient thermal-aware P/G TSVs planning algorithm based on a sensitivity model with temperature-dependent leakage current considered. The proposed method can overcome the limitation of uniform P/G grid topology and make full use of P/G TSVs planning for the optimization of P/G network by allowing short wires to connect the P/G TSVs to P/G grids in non-uniform topology. Moreover, with resistance variation and increased leakage current caused by high temperature in 3 D ICs, more accurate result can be obtained. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show the efficiency of our approach. Results show that neglecting thermal impacts on power delivery can underestimate <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> by about 11 %. To relieve the severe <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> violation, 51. 8 % more P/G TSVs are needed than the cases without thermal impacts considered.

Furthermore, the threshold voltage scales nonlinearly, raising the ratio of the threshold voltage to the supply voltage and making the voltage (<b>IR)</b> <b>drop</b> in the power/ground (P/G) network a serious problem in modern IC design. Traditional P/G network-analysis methods are often very computationally expensive, and it is, thus, not feasible to cosynthesize P/G network with floorplan. To make the cosynthesis feasible, we need not only an efficient, effective, and flexible floorplanning algorithm but also a very efficient yet sufficiently accurate P/G network-analysis method.
