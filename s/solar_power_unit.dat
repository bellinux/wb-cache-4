2500|$|The David Gordon Memorial Hospital (DGM) – Livingstonia {{is located}} in an {{isolated}} northern region of Malawi and was established in 1910. [...] With 100 beds, it serves 10,000 patients per year out of a population of 70,000. [...] One quarter of the patients seen are admitted. [...] The most common diseases treated are complications due to malaria, pneumonia, AIDS, and TB. [...] One-third of the operating budget of the hospital comes from outside donations, which include those from the EMMS. [...] The EMMS supports the DGM Hospital through such projects as building staff houses, training its staff, and buying nessary equipment. [...] This equipment has included an ultrasound scanner, a <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> and a water supply purifier for the hospital facilities. [...] Through its financial support, the hospital has expanded its treatment capabilities to include four clinics in neighboring towns of Luwichi, Mlowe, Zunga, and Tcharo.|$|E

40|$|Exposing {{wind and}} <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> {{to the market}} price signal allows for {{cost-efficient}} investment decisions, as it incentivizes investors {{to account for the}} marginal value (MV el) of renewable energy technologies. As shown by Lamont (2008), the MV el of wind and <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> depends on their penetration level. More specifically, the MV el of wind and <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> {{is a function of the}} respective unit's capacity factor and the covariance between its generation profile and the system marginal costs. The latter component of the MV el (i. e., the covariance) is found to decline as the wind and <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> penetration increases, displacing dispatchable power plants with higher short-run marginal costs of power production and thus reducing the system marginal costs in all generation hours. This so called `system price effect' is analyzed in more detail in this paper. The analysis complements the work Lamont (2008) in two regards. First of all, an alternative expression for the MV el of wind and <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> is derived, which shows that the MV el of fluctuating renewable energy technologies depends not only on their own penetration level but also on a variety of other parameters that are specific to the electricity system. Second, based on historical wholesale prices and wind and <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> generation data for Germany, a numerical `ceteris paribus' example for Germany is presented which illustrates that the system price effect is already highly relevant for both wind and <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> generation in Germany...|$|R

Recent work suggests that irregular spacing can improve efficiency (Cumpston and Pye 2014).

Other layout patterns {{can be obtained by}} shifting the column by s (see Fig.  6 b) and rotating it by θ (see Fig.  6 c). In order to set the land cover ratio unchanged, a scale factor γ is introduced. With these mathematical representations, the search for optimized layout turns into a search in parameter space δ x,δ y,θ and s that gives the lowest shading effect.|$|R

2500|$|Installation of <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> PV plants require nearly 2.0 {{hectares}} (5 acres) land per MW capacity {{which is}} similar to coal-fired power plants [...] when life cycle coal mining, consumptive water storage & ash disposal areas are also accounted and hydro power plants when submergence area of water reservoir is also accounted. 1.6 million MW capacity solar plants can be installed in India on its 1% land (32,000 square km). There are vast tracts of land suitable for <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> in all parts of India exceeding 8% of its total area which are unproductive barren and devoid of vegetation. Part of waste lands (32,000 square km) when installed with <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> plants can produce 2400 billion kWh of electricity (two times the total generation in 2013-14) with land productivity/yield of 0.9 million Rs per acre (3 Rs/kWh price) which is at par with many industrial areas and many times more than the best productive irrigated agriculture lands.

40|$|Lorentz 1 helical pumps (Henstedt-Ulzburg, Germany) {{have been}} <b>powered</b> by <b>solar</b> energy for remote water pumping {{applications}} for many years, but from Oct. 2005 to Mar. 2008 a Lorentz helical pump was powered by wind energy at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) near Bushland, TX.

The wind powered version required an additional controller manufactured by Lorentz {{to rectify the}} electricity to DC before entering the primary controller. For the Bushland, TX site, the wind powered helical pump system demonstrated the ability to pump enough water at a 50 m (164 ft) pumping depth to meet the daily requirements of 120 beef cattle and 60 beef cattle at a 100 m (328 ft) pumping depth.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{simultaneous}} optimization of {{transmission and distribution}} grid has been proposed. The dynamic model of the grid consists of turbine governors (TG), automatic voltage regulators (AVR) as well as wind turbines, <b>solar</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> and energy storage units. Grid stability is obtained by line stability and voltage stability indices and also by conducting eigenvalue analysis of the complete power system grid. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm adjusts the grid control settings (active and reactive power management) to maximize the renewable penetration at all layers of the grid. IEEE 14 bus system in conjunction with a micro grid is used as the test system. The results demonstrate that simultaneous reactive power management of {{transmission and distribution grid}} can maximize the renewable penetration at transmission and distribution layers of the grid. However different case studies with different renewable power pro-files at each layer of the grid are remained to be optimized, this study recommends that real-time management of reactive power at all layers of the grid can be a good candidate to deal with intermittency of renewable sources...|$|R
