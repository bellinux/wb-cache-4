5|$|Changes in Directive Principles {{require a}} Constitutional {{amendment}} {{which has to}} be passed by a <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> of both houses of the Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting and by the absolute majority of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|Changes to the {{fundamental}} rights require a constitutional amendment, which has to be passed by a <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> of both houses of Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. However, the number of members voting should not be less than the simple majority of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
25|$|To pass legislation, a {{majority}} of the members of a legislature must vote for a bill (proposed law) in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).|$|E
50|$|Another main {{function}} of constitutions {{may be to}} describe the procedure by which parliaments may legislate. For instance, <b>special</b> <b>majorities</b> {{may be required to}} alter the constitution. In bicameral legislatures, there may be a process laid out for second or third readings of bills before a new law can enter into force. Alternatively, there may further be requirements for maximum terms that a government can keep power before holding an election.|$|R
50|$|By definition, the {{difference}} between a confederation and a federation is that the membership of the member states in a confederation is voluntary, while the membership in a federation is not. A confederation is most likely to feature three differences when constrasted with a federation: (1) No real direct powers: many confederal decisions are externalised by member-state legislation; (2) Decisions on day-to-day-matters are not taken by simple <b>majority</b> but by <b>special</b> <b>majorities</b> or even by consensus or unanimity (veto for every member); (3) Changes of the constitution, usually a treaty, require unanimity.|$|R
5000|$|Article 4 of the {{constitution}} states that each municipality must belong to {{only one of the}} four official language areas that were established in 1962-63. In the three officially unilingual language areas, a couple of dozen municipalities in the vicinity of another language area must provide limited facilities for speakers of that other language. As only a law carried by <b>special</b> <b>majorities</b> can change the language status of any municipality, these arrangements have prevented some small municipalities with facilities to be merged in the 1970s, and thus the most minute Belgian municipalities are still found in this group, notably Herstappe with only 84 inhabitants (in 2006).|$|R
25|$|A {{resolution}} to impeach the President {{has to be}} passed by a two-third majority {{of the total number}} of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the President has the right to defend oneself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> again, the President stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.|$|E
50|$|Every {{resolution}} {{approving the}} proclamation of emergency or its continuance must be passed by either House of Parliament by a <b>special</b> <b>majority,</b> that is, (a) {{a majority of}} the total membership of that house, and (b) a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that house present and voting. This <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> provision was introduced by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978. Previously, such resolution could be passed by a simple majority of the Parliament.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{subsequent}} {{versions of the}} Constitution, the 1954 Constitution was not entrenched. It could be amended by the National People's Congress (Article 27(1)) by a <b>special</b> two-thirds <b>majority</b> (Article 29) without recourse to a referendum or other such mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The formal {{appointment}} of the Head of State {{would have been}} made in a joint sitting of Parliament, attended by members of both the Senate and House of Representatives. A <b>special</b> two-thirds <b>majority</b> would have been required to ratify the candidate's appointment as Head of State.|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{its unique}} nature, and the {{political}} sensitivities surrounding it, there is no common or legal classification for the European Union (EU). However, it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation (or a [...] "new" [...] type of confederation) and a federation. The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a single economic market, open internal borders, a common currency among most member-states and allow for numerous other areas where powers have been transferred and directly applicable laws are made. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence and taxation. Furthermore, laws sometimes must be transcribed into national law by national parliaments; decisions by member states are taken by <b>special</b> <b>majorities</b> with blocking minorities accounted for; and treaty amendment requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force.|$|R
50|$|The visual {{centerpiece}} of Spivey’s design is the Albert Schweitzer Memorial Organ, a 79-rank, 3-manual, 4,413-pipe organ, built and installed by Fratelli Ruffatti of Padua, Italy. The creation of this organ {{was the subject}} of a PBS <b>special.</b> The <b>majority</b> of Spivey's finishes were designed to be acoustically reflective, in an effort to preserve the sound within and prolong its reverberation.|$|R

50|$|The {{constitution}} can {{be viewed}} as entrenched, because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present. This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.|$|E
50|$|The bill then {{returned}} to Parliament and a further eleven petitions were placed before the Supreme Court challenging the bill's constitutionality. Amongst these petitions was one filed on 4 October 2012 by opposition MP Mavai Senathirajah challenging the legality of Chandrasiri's approving the bill. The court (Bandaranayake, N. G. Amaratunga and K. Sripavan) met on 18, 22, and 23 October 2012 to hear the petitions. The Supreme Court's determinations were passed to the president on 31 October 2012. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa announced the Supreme Court's determinations to Parliament on 6 November 2012: clause 8(2) was unconstitutional {{and needed to be}} approved by a referendum; twelve other clauses were inconsistent with the constitution and needed to be passed by <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> (two-thirds) of Parliament; the governor of the Northern Province does not have the power to endorse the bill and therefore Parliament needed to pass the bill by <b>special</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary. In the {{classical}} theory of social choice, there exist many voting proce-dures for determining a collective preference {{on a set}} of alternatives. The simplest situation happens when a group of individuals has to choose between two alterna-tives. In this context, some voting procedures such as simple and absolute <b>special</b> <b>majorities</b> are frequently used. However, these voting procedures do {{not take into account the}} intensity with which individuals prefer one alternative to the other. In order to consider this situation, one possibility is to allow individuals showing their preferences through values located between 0 and 1. In this case, the collective preference can be obtained by means of an aggregation operator. One of the most important matter in this context is how to choose such aggregation operator. When we consider the class of OWA operators, it is necessary to determine the associated weights. In this contribution we survey several methods for obtaining the OWA oper-ator weights. We pay special attention to the way the weights are chosen, regarding the concrete voting system we want to obtain when individuals do not grade their preferences between the alternatives. ...|$|R
50|$|The Constitution {{empowers}} Parliament of India to make laws on {{the matters}} reserved for States (States List). However, this can only be done if Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by two-thirds <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for states without any authorisation from Rajya Sabha.|$|E

50|$|A special law, or {{qualified}} majority law, {{is a type}} of legislation in Belgium which requires a {{qualified majority}} in both chambers of the bicameral Belgian Federal Parliament to be adopted, amended or repealed. The Belgian Constitution determines which laws require a qualified or <b>special</b> <b>majority.</b> Special laws are primarily used in institutional matters and in matters concerning the competences of the communities and regions of Belgium. One of the best known examples is the Special Law of 8 August 1980 on the Reform of the Institutions.|$|E
50|$|Article 130 {{establishes}} the competences of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community. It stipulates that the Parliament of the German-speaking Community {{is responsible for}} cultural matters, the matters related to the individual, education, within the same limits as the other community parliaments, the cooperation between the communities and international cooperation, including {{the power to make}} treaties with regard to its competences, and the use of languages in education. Unlike for the other communities, the laws regarding the competences of the German-speaking Community don't require a <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> in the Federal Parliament.|$|E
50|$|This it {{achieves}} {{mainly through}} {{its power to}} annul statutes (or parts of them) {{if they are in}} conflict with the constitutional order (most important of them, the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms). This is because laws {{that are part of the}} constitutional order are legislative acts of the highest force, their enactment also requires a <b>special</b> <b>majority</b> in the parliament. Any other legislation is subordinate. This process is called the judicial review. Related to this is the power of the court to decide about the conformity with the constitutional order of an international treaty prior to its ratification.|$|E
50|$|Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, {{serving a}} second presidency, is constitutionally barred from {{standing}} in the 2015 election, and the Front for Victory lacks the <b>special</b> two-thirds <b>majority</b> needed for a constitutional amendment. The support for Front for Victory dropped from 54% in 2011 to 33% in 2013. The government faces increasing popular discontent, and the vice-president Amado Boudou (currently acting as president while Fernández de Kirchner recuperates after surgery) is under investigation for the so-called Boudougate. Analysts for the BBC consider the poll results suggest Sergio Massa, Mauricio Macri and Daniel Scioli are likely candidates for the presidency in 2015.|$|R
