40|$|Due to {{the effects}} of the global {{economic}} crisis, manufacturing companies have been forced to look for savings in all areas. Many manufacturing entities in recent years have not sufficiently optimized their purchasing processes. Effective and cost-optimised purchasing, however, is a crucial factor in a company’s success. Assessing the quality of suppliers and their services therefore appears to be a key aspect. Deciding on which <b>supplier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> is not easy, because there are multiple criteria that concern the complete marketing purchasing mix and other inner and outer factors that need to be taken into account. The final decision may have a significant impact not only on the entire manufacturing process, but also on the competitiveness of the respective product or the company as a whole...|$|E
40|$|This paper tackles {{the need}} for {{information}} sharing between retailer and supplier in the fast moving consumer goods industry. Satisfying the end customer demand strains both the supplier and the retailer’s supply chain. Uncertainty and randomness of orders at every level requires every player to forecast future demand. Inaccuracy of these forecasts increases costs in the supply chain, whenevery player tries to minimize its own costs independently. In order to decrease overall cost, collaboration is required. Collaboration can only be achieved through an exchange of information between the considered players. This investigation focuses {{on how to use}} information sharing to increase forecast accuracy at the supplier. Using end customer demand allows the <b>supplier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> new indicators to measure its performance; up to taking control of its brand inventory at the retailer’s. The goal is to decrease overall costs by decreasing the demand amplification effect and increasing service levels along the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|Platforming is {{not only}} a {{powerful}} approach to new product development by sharing common and modular components and processes but also allows the supply chain to gain benefits from risk-pooling effect through shared resources. Analytical target cascading (ATC) is a decentralised method suitable for configuring a hierarchical supply chain of an assembled product while accommodating necessary degree of decision autonomy and information privacy of individual enterprises. Because product variants in a family share platform components, the supply chain structure becomes a weakly networked hierarchy where a small number of elements are laterally linked. In addition, multiple customers who share a common platform component may require the corresponding <b>supplier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> different strategies such as just-in-time (JIT) and lowest price to supply the component. As a result, different decision variables may be involved in the interaction between a shared lower-level element and its different parental elements. This paper develops a new ATC method suitable for dealing with these two special characteristics in supply chain configuration (SCC) for a product family. Numerical results demonstrate that the new method produces better results than those obtained from using the ATC method that only allows a supplier to optimise the supply of the platform component to all its customers with the same strategy...|$|E
40|$|As the {{likelihood}} increases that Russia will dominate the European Union's (EU) energy supply, questions {{have emerged as}} to whether Russia would use the energy weapon to influence EU member policies and extract political concessions. Countervailing voices argue that Russia would be restricted by interdependence and market forces. As of yet, no one has analyzed the assumptions underlying the energy weapon thesis. Moreover, many scholars examining EU-Russian energy relations rely on non-Russian data. This article seeks to fill several informational and theoretical gaps by including Russian sources and first-hand data and by systematically analyzing the conditions that must obtain before an energy supplier can successfully convert its energy resources into political power. The resulting model can be utilized to analyze the capacity of a <b>supplier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the energy weapon'whether it be Russia, Iran, Venezuela or any other energy heavyweight'and to assess whether the deployment was successful. Five purported cases of Russian manipulation are analyzed in this article and the findings indicate that, more often than not, Russia failed to achieve political concessions. Looking to the future, the plausibility of Russia using the energy weapon to exploit Europe's dependence, particularly on gas, is also examined. Energy weapon Supply security Russia...|$|E
40|$|American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. (AAM) {{is still}} in the process of {{transitioning}} to a culture of "lean manufacturing" as opposed to the current culture of "mass production". This thesis involved working with AAM employees and suppliers at various locations to understand how material flows between and within AAM's plants, the reasons for and analysis of the current state of material management, and opportunities for improvement. Attention is also given to the cultural and business context in which this work takes place, and the issues relating to efforts to implement change in large industrial organizations. This work produced two strategic-level products and one tactical-level product to improve lean material management at AAM described herein. Cultural observations are also provided. At the strategic level, one project focused upon making extended value stream maps of material flow between AAM plants and suppliers/processors. This information allows all decision-makers at AAM to objectively examine a common set of information, information which was previously unavailable to any one individual. Extended value stream mapping allowed supply chain inventory and lead time-reduction opportunities to be identified. (cont.) The focus upon extended value streams increased awareness of the need to more fully account for costs in making part procurement decisions. Therefore, a second strategic project involved the development of a total cost decision tool, and its use in making sourcing decisions. This computer spreadsheet-based tool uses simple inputs to quickly produce a more all-encompassing estimate of the total costs of purchasing parts from a given supplier. Traditionally, only piece-price plus freight costs were used to determine sources of supply. Other, additional factors may alter the decision of which <b>supplier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> if they are considered. The tactical-level project involved implementation of a lean pull system. This project involved coordinating teams at two separate axle shaft manufacturing plants to implement a more effective visual pull system between and within the plants, using lean concepts for material management and flow. A final aspect of the thesis was to examine the current business context in which the lean systems are to operate, as well as the strategic, cultural, and political aspects that influence change management in large organizations. (cont.) One conclusion drawn from the internship is that the firm should start emphasizing visual control on the plant floor, and less supervisor work on paper in their offices after their shifts end. If the production boards and visual controls are in constant disarray, this needs to be resolved as quickly as a failed customer delivery, because it is fundamentally undercutting the ability of the organization to improve what it provides to customers through better quality and productivity. It also hinders efforts to reduce costs to bid for new work. Failing to attract new work is as damaging as a failed customer delivery, except that it will happen a year from now rather than today. by Justin Harper. Thesis (S. M.)

Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and poultry <b>suppliers</b> <b>to</b> upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the interaction of}} storage, gaming and forward contracts as mechanisms of risk management in a deregulated electricity market. To date, analyses of imperfect electricity markets have established the "tactical" effect of contracts, that under certain conjectural assumptions, forward contracts {{have a significant impact}} on the gaming behaviour of dominant firms in the spot market. However, little work has considered contract strategy, incorporating factors such as the feedback of spot market behaviour on contract market equilibria. This thesis assesses the risk that market participants are exposed to, establishes a measure of risk, and analyses the role that forward contracts play in hedging that risk. Finally, assuming participants are averse to financial risk only, a multi-period model will be provided that examines whether incentives exist for dominant <b>suppliers</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> their market power to amplify the risk faced by consumers in order to increase profit through contract revenue...|$|R
