5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones {{start at the}} <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> and without them the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast mitochondria have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two {{amino acids}} are {{naturally}} incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, {{are incorporated into}} proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> in other organisms. This UAG codon {{is followed by a}} PYLIS downstream sequence.|$|E

5000|$|Although these <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> are {{triplets}} {{just like}} ordinary codons, {{they are not}} decoded by tRNAs. It was discovered by Mario Capecchi in 1967 that, instead, tRNAs do not ordinarily recognize <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> at all, and that what he named [...] "release factor" [...] was not a tRNA molecule but a protein. Later, it was demonstrated that different release factors recognize different <b>stop</b> <b>codons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Given the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> patterns to amino acid coding patterns.|$|E
5|$|The two {{non-standard}} proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are selenocysteine (present in many non-eukaryotes {{as well as}} most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and pyrrolysine (found only in some archaea and one bacterium). The incorporation of these non-standard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> and SECIS element.|$|E
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E

The main splice form that was analyzed had the ten <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> interspersed throughout the 5' and 3' UTR, which was why this splice form was utilized to further analyze (refer to Table 1 for details of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> and exons).

50|$|Nonsense {{suppressor}} is {{a useful}} genetic tool, but can also result in problematic side effects, since all identical <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the genome will also be suppressed to the same degree. Genes with different or multiple <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> will be unaffected.|$|R
40|$|Splice-junction {{sequence}} {{signals are}} strongly conserved structural components of eukaryotic genes. These sequences border exon/intron junctions and {{aid in the}} process of removing introns by the RNA splicing machinery. Although substantial research has been undertaken to understand the mechanism of splicing, {{little is known about the}} origin and evolution of these splice signal sequences. Based on the previously published theory that the primitive genes evolved in pieces from primordial genetic sequences to avoid the interfering <b>stop</b> <b>codons,</b> a "stop-codon walk" mechanism is proposed in this paper to have assisted in the evolution of coding genes. This mechanism predicts the presence of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in splice-junction signals inside the introns. Evidence of the consistent presence of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the splice-junction signals, in a position where they are expected, is shown by the analysis of codon statistics in these signal sequences in the GenBank databank. The results suggest that the splice-junction signals may have evolved from <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> as a consequence of a selective pressure to avoid <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> during the original evolution of coding genes. They also suggest that other splice signals within the introns, such as the branch-point sequence, may have evolved from <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> for similar reasons...|$|R
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature <b>stop</b> <b>codon).</b> Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
5|$|A {{receptor}} for tomato systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of tomato, a null allele with a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} small {{molecules}} that aim at compensating various mutations of the CFTR gene are under development. One approach is to develop drugs that get the ribosome to overcome the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> and synthesize a full-length CFTR protein. About 10% of CF results from a premature <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> in the DNA, leading to early termination of protein synthesis and truncated proteins. These drugs target nonsense mutations such as G542X, which consists of the amino acid glycine in position 542 being replaced by a <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with protein synthesis and error-correction. In some cases, they can cause the cell to overcome a premature <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> by inserting a random amino acid, thereby allowing expression of a full-length protein.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two more}} {{mammalian}} LDH subunits {{that can be}} included in LDH tetramers: LDHC and LDHBx. LDHC is a testes-specific LDH protein, that is encoded by the LDHC gene. LDHBx is a peroxisome-specific LDH protein. LDHBx is the readthrough-form of LDHB. LDHBx is generated by translation of the LDHB mRNA, but the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> is interpreted as an amino acid-encoding codon. In consequence, translation continues to the next <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> This leads to the addition of seven amino acid acids to the normal LDH-H protein.

25|$|Pre-mRNAs of the Transformer (Tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster undergo {{alternative}} splicing via the alternative acceptor site mode. The gene Tra encodes a protein that is expressed only in females. The primary transcript of this gene contains an intron with two possible acceptor sites. In males, the upstream acceptor site is used. This causes a longer version of exon 2 {{to be included}} in the processed transcript, including an early <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> The resulting mRNA encodes a truncated protein product that is inactive. Females produce the master sex determination protein Sex lethal (Sxl). The Sxl protein is a splicing repressor that binds to an ISS in the RNA of the Tra transcript near the upstream acceptor site, preventing U2AF protein from binding to the polypyrimidine tract. This prevents the use of this junction, shifting the spliceosome binding to the downstream acceptor site. Splicing at this point bypasses the <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> which is excised as part of the intron. The resulting mRNA encodes an active Tra protein, which itself is a regulator of {{alternative splicing}} of other sex-related genes (see dsx above).|$|E
