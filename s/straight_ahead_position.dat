2500|$|Because wheel flop {{involves}} the lowering {{of the front}} end of a bicycle or motorcycle, the force due to gravity will tend to cause handlebar rotation to continue with increasing rotational velocity and without additional rider input on the handlebars.

[...] The rotational inertia of the front wheel will lessen the severity of the wheel flop effect because it results in opposing torque being required to initiate or accelerate changing the direction of the front wheel.|$|E

50|$|In {{a recent}} study, {{researchers}} asked patients with left neglect to project their midline with a neon bulb {{and found that}} they tended to point it <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> but <b>position</b> it rightward of their true midline.

The result is not only the amelioration of visual neglect, but also of tactile, motor, and even representational neglect.|$|R

50|$|SAI urges {{the wheels}} to a <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position</b> after a turn. By inclining the {{steering}} axis inward (away from the wheel), it causes the spindle {{to rise and}} fall as the wheels are turned in one direction or the other. Because the tire cannot be forced into the ground as the spindle travels in an arc, the tire/wheel assembly raises the suspension and thus causes the tire/wheel assembly to seek the low (center) return point when it is allowed to return. Thus, since it {{has a tendency to}} maintain or seek a <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position,</b> less positive caster is needed to maintain directional stability. A vehicle provides stable handling without any of the drawbacks of high positive caster because of SAI.|$|E

50|$|The {{direction}} of a point relative to the head (the angle between the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position</b> and the apparent position of the point, from the egocenter) is called visual direction, or version. The angle between the line {{of sight of the}} two eyes when fixating a point is called the absolute disparity, binocular parallax, or vergence demand (usually just vergence). The relation between the position of the two eyes, version and vergence is described by Hering's law of visual direction.|$|E
50|$|The varying {{pitch of}} the cam results in the {{variable}} steering ratio, with the lowest gearing being at the straight ahead, rising rapidly to either lock. The rise in gearing (which in the Jaguar 420 was equivalent to a drop in ratio from 21.6:1 to 13:1) occurs almost entirely within the first half turn of the steering wheel from the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position.</b> The effect is to give very light and relaxed steering at the straight ahead, with increased reaction when cornering.|$|E

Turn to keep the ADF heading indicator pointing directly ahead. Homing is regarded as poor piloting technique because the aircraft may be blown significantly or dangerously off-course by a cross-wind, and will have to fly further and for longer than the direct track.|$|E

50|$|The lift tow is {{the most}} common modern method for short {{distance}} transportation. The casualty is winched onto a lifting grid and then raised by lifting the grid, with the casualty’s tires strapped to the grid. The grid is shaped like a large pair of spectacles, which accounts for the common name of this type of vehicle, the speclift or spectacle lift. With commercial vehicles, it is more common to use a set of lifting forks to attach to the suspension, axle or chassis of the casualty. In many cases, e.g., with automatics, it is the 'driven' wheels that need to be lifted. This will sometimes result in a rear lift, if the driven wheels are at the rear. In this case the casualty's steering must be locked in the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Straight</b> <b>Ahead</b> was the {{follow-up}} to Grant's ground-breaking 1982 album Age to Age. Containing songs {{that were more}} aggressive than the ones found on Age to Age, <b>Straight</b> <b>Ahead</b> was not as commercially successful as its predecessor. Nonetheless, it still topped Billboard's Christian album chart for sixty-one weeks, knocking Age to Age from the number-one position. The song [...] "Angels" [...] was also a No. 1 Christian radio hit for thirteen weeks, and won a Grammy Award for [...] "Best Gospel Performance, Female." [...] <b>Straight</b> <b>Ahead</b> would be certified gold in 1985. The song [...] "Thy Word" [...] is based on Psalm 119:105.|$|R
5000|$|The {{steering}} {{actually had}} the same [...] "assist" [...] at all speeds — the steering was hydraulically locked against steering movement of the wheels from the road ("feedback") up to {{the capacity of the}} unit. The reduction in 'assist' was achieved by a piston/roller pushing on a heart shaped cam geared to the steering shaft (hence the one turn to full lock), which was fed with system pressure so that as its pressure rose with increasing road speed, the steering assistance seemingly reduced and the steering centering effort rose. However, full steering wheel turning was available at all speeds, though considerable force was necessary to turn the steering wheel at high road speed. Enough pressure was admitted to the centering unit to return the wheels to the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position</b> when the car was not moving. The centering pressure was regulated by a flyweight centrifugal governor driven by the pinion (secondary) shaft of the manual gearbox and by a proportioning valve connected to the fluid pressure in the automatic gearbox, which pressure was proportional to the speed of the output shaft. The pressure increased all the way to 120 mph, and a subsidiary function of this feed was to turn off the air conditioning fans above 50 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|The 1932 Series 355B {{was even}} longer and lower, with an entirely restyled front assembly. The roof line was lowered 1 - 3 in. The longer hood now had six hood ports. The new front end styling {{included}} a flat grille {{built into the}} radiator shell, head and side lights of streamlined bullet shape {{and the elimination of}} the fender tie bar and monogram bar. The trumpets of the dual horns projected through the headlight stanchions. The headlight lenses were 9.5 in in diameter. The dual taillights matched the headlights. Super safe lighting featured three filament bulbs and four contour positions for degree and angle of illumination. The front license plate was mounted on the bumper. Runningboards curved to match the sweep of the front fenders and blended into the rear fenders. The tail of the rear fenders blended into the fuel tank valence. The trunk on the town sedan, town coupe and five-passenger convertible coupe was integral with the body. The vision of the driver was improved by 30 percent {{as a result of the}} elimination of the outside visor and the construction of a 12 degree sloping windshield and corner posts. There was a large ventilator on top of the cowl and none on the sides. All separate body moldings were eliminated. A three spoke steering wheel enabled an unobstructed view of the instrument cluster when in the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position.</b> The right side of the instrument panel was occupied by a [...] "locker." [...] Engine horsepower increased to 115. The deepening Great Depression helped sales plummet to 2,700.|$|E
5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>position</b> is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|E
