5000|$|In Nokia N900, {{there is}} no <b>SIM</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> {{available}} (also known as [...] "operator menu"), {{so it is not}} possible to use any services that require it. As a result, {{there is no}} support for a SIM to interact directly with the outside world and initiate commands independently of the handset and the network, making N900 not vulnerable to installation of malicious SIM Java applications via text messages.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{describe}} a Problem Solving Environment (PSE) tool called BioGrid <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> and its architecture over a grid environment. BioGrid <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> {{is a general}} purpose grid access tool that provides a parallel and distributed programming environment; it provides an efficient web-based user interface that allows users to develop, run and visualize parallel/distributed applications running on heterogeneous computing resources connected by networks. BioGrid <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> is {{easy to use and}} has two execution models: streaming and data parallel mode. The system transparently schedules the submitted jobs and gives user feedback on the job status. The relevant components for the success of this parallel processing system will focus in how effective the scheduler and interface is. We also discuss some of the reasons for our design, present the initial results and discuss issues that we consider relevant for future research...|$|R

50|$|USIM <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> (USAT) is the {{equivalent}} of STK for 3G networks. USAT enables the USIM to initiate actions which can be used for various value-added services delivered over mobile devices.|$|R
50|$|The <b>SIM</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> {{consists}} {{of a set of}} commands programmed into the SIM which define how the SIM should interact directly with the outside world and initiates commands independently of the handset and the network. This enables the SIM to build up an interactive exchange between a network application and the end user and access, or control access to, the network. The SIM also gives commands to the handset such as displaying menus and/or asking for user input.|$|E
5000|$|In {{introduction}} of the Finnish Mobiilivarmenne service in 2010, {{only one out of}} three operators chose to use this [...] "On Board Key Generation" [...] capability with user interaction. Cited reasons claimed it to be too hard for the user. Actual experience did show that those without it created easily non-functional registrations without any online indication of the status, while usage of [...] "On Board Key Generation" [...] always resulted in positive indication of success when the service became fully functional for the user. Also if a mobile phone version had issues with <b>SIM</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> protocol, that became evident immediately during a registration process using [...] "On Board Key Generation." ...|$|E
50|$|Modern SIM cards allow {{applications}} to be loaded when the SIM is in {{use by the}} subscriber. These applications communicate with the handset or a server using <b>SIM</b> <b>application</b> <b>toolkit,</b> which was initially specified by 3GPP in TS 11.14 (there is an identical ETSI specification with different numbering). ETSI and 3GPP maintain the SIM specifications; the main specifications are: ETSI TS 102 223, ETSI TS 102 241, ETSI TS 102 588, and ETSI TS 131 111. SIM toolkit applications were initially written in native code using proprietary APIs. In order to allow interoperability of the applications, Java Card was taken as the solution of choice by ETSI. Additional standards and specifications of interest are maintained by GlobalPlatform.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a prototype of}} the accelerator commissioning and simulation <b>application</b> <b>toolkit</b> based on the Unified Accelerator Libraries (UAL) framework. The existing UAL 1. x environment has been implemented as an open collection of C++ and Perl packages that address various tasks of accelerator physics. The UAL 2. 0 <b>application</b> <b>toolkit</b> has been developing {{on the top of}} the Java infrastructure for integrating it with distributed accelerator control systems. The core part of the toolkit is composed of the Common Accelerator Objects (such as Accelerator, Algorithms, etc.) that form the framework for developing project-specific <b>applications.</b> The <b>toolkit</b> environment is not only limited to Java applications, but also supports the development and integration of high-level scripting codes (e. g. Java Python scripts) and existing C/C++ libraries. The configuration and navigation of the project-specific application system is provided by the XML-based Application Manager.

40|$|Abstract—Next {{generation}} {{services are}} provided by applica-tions that leverage packet-based domains. A challenge faced by such services is the support for multiple devices, including legacy devices. Our paper examines a strategy {{for the provision of}} next generation services on legacy cellular network devices. We advocate that the provision of next generation services via applications on the SIM card allows for the deployment of such services on legacy devices. We demonstrate this assertion through a proof of concept application, SIMPre, that resides on a SIM card. SIMPre implements a presence service by leveraging Java Card, the <b>SIM</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> and the OMA IMPS standard. We show {{that it is possible to}} provide a next generation service on the SIM card such that it ubiquitously integrates with the functionality of a legacy device. We conclude through this demonstration that the SIM card is a viable option for providing backward compatibility to legacy devices in the implementation of next generation services...|$|E
40|$|New {{applicative}} {{methods have}} to be studied and implemented {{in the area of}} information technology to provide qualitative, fast and secure financial services for all. Many researches’ results show that broad access to financial services helps reduce poverty. The present paper analyzes various data collected by request and from face-to-face interviews to identify the underserved population in Albania in terms of financial services. Traditional techniques are applied in the last Living Standards Measurement Survey to identify the needs of underserved population about financial services and their living conditions. The information is of great interest to identify the most appropriate information system which provides secure financial services for all. Reliable financial services are of crucial importance. Further investigations are made to identify the most secure application that works out on a standard phone. Study of the most appropriate user interface and way of communication led us {{to the conclusion that the}} use of the <b>SIM</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit,</b> which offers a simple menu stored on the SIM to the user, is the most secure way to communicate as the best end-to-end security is achieved through it. The functional requirements were created and business process modeling was made. Services needed by users are created using java card programming language. Agents and mobile operators will make a major contribution in the proposed information system...|$|E
50|$|In a GSM network, the UICC {{contains}} a <b>SIM</b> <b>application</b> {{and in a}} UMTS network it is the USIM application. A UICC may contain several applications, {{making it possible for}} the same smart card to give access to both GSM and UMTS networks, and also provide storage of a phone book and other applications. It is also possible to access a GSM network using a USIM application and it is possible to access UMTS networks using a <b>SIM</b> <b>application</b> with mobile terminals prepared for this. With the UMTS release 5 a new application, the IP multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIM) is required for services in the IMS. The telephone book is a separate application and not part of either subscriber identity module.|$|R

40|$|GSM {{has changed}} the face of {{communication}} and information exchange, much as the Internet did. With the advances made in the mobile technology arena, new opportunities are created. Mobile Commerce (m-Commerce) is one such opportunity. Each new advance in technology brings with it associated risks. This dissertation focuses on the risks involved with m-Commerce for the banking industry. This dissertation provides a detailed overview of basic services that any m-Commerce application should provide to the banking industry. These principles provide the foundation for securing any financial transaction over untrusted networks. Several mechanisms to provide these services are also discussed. Examples of such mechanisms include hash functions, Message Authentication Codes and Digital Signatures. The security of GSM networks has come under attack in the past. This is largely {{due to the fact that}} the GSM consortium opted to develop their security technologies in secret, rather than in the public domain. This dissertation aims to evaluate the security offered by GSM and assess potential attacks in order to further understand risks associated with m-Commerce applications over GSM. In recent years there have been significant additions to the GSM enabling technology family. The arrival of the <b>SIM</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Toolkit</b> and the Wireless Application Protocol promised to again change the face of commerce. Although market acceptance of these technologies proved to be initially slow, usage is set to increase exponentially within the next couple of years. A detailed analysis of these enabling technologies is presented in the dissertation. Possible attacks on these technologies are discussed in the latter part or this document. Based on the findings of the research, some changes to either the application architectures or the processing of the data have been suggested in order to enhance the security offered by these services. It is not the intent of this dissertation to redesign these applications, but to rather leverage off the current technologies in order to enable secure m-Commerce over these channels.
