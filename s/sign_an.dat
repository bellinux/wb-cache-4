5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E

5|$|The {{order of}} the Junta not to proceed to the Viceroyalty of Peru was a de facto truce that would last while Castelli did not attack Goyeneche's army. Castelli tried to turn the {{situation}} into a formal agreement, which would imply recognition of the Junta as a legitimate interlocutor. Goyeneche agreed to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> armistice for 40 days to allow time for Lima to ratify the agreement, but he actually used the time to reinforce his army. On 19 June, with the truce still in effect, an advanced royalist troop attacked positions at Juraicoragua. Castelli declared the truce broken and declared war on Peru.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's <b>sign,</b> <b>an</b> electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking for payment to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As {{part of an effort}} to assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E

It was signed by leading opposition figures, {{as well as by}} director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a supporter of Putin, and actors Chulpan Khamatova and Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom had appeared in campaign videos supporting Putin's re-election.

Meanwhile, Nikita Mikhalkov, head of the Russian Cinematographers' Union, stated that he would gladly <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> open letter against them.|$|E
5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E

He also frames Declan for an accident at a building site, that he himself caused. Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) comes to Erinsborough to find evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Paul asks her to take over Lassiter's with him and they have sex. Rebecca gives Paul an ultimatum; leave Lassiter's or leave the family. He then hands over management of the hotel to Declan for six months. Paul discovers Diana is working with Declan to remove him from the company and he contacts Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), who fires Diana. Meanwhile, Paul threatens Declan. When Rebecca finds out about Paul's affair and threats towards Declan, she pushes him from the Lassiter's mezzanine.

Rebecca later convinces Paul to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> affidavit, which states that his fall was an accident, and she leaves him and the country. Paul falls out with local councillor Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) and plots to ruin Ajay's career, after the local police station is closed down and merged with another.|$|E

5|$|The Czech Catholics, {{who were}} led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened {{negotiations}} with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including {{the appointment of a}} Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady.|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} {{between these two}} competing historical and cultural traditions erupted into political and social conflict during the Ukrainian crisis, which began when then Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych refused to <b>sign</b> <b>an</b> association agreement with the European Union on 21 November 2013. Support for closer ties with Europe was strong in western and central Ukraine, whilst many in eastern and southern Ukraine traditionally favoured stronger relations with Russia. President Yanukovych, who drew most of his support from eastern regions, was forced out of office in February 2014. His ouster was followed by protests in eastern and southern Ukraine that placed {{a strong emphasis on}} the importance of historical ties to Russia, the Russian language, and antipathy towards the Euromaidan movement.|$|E
5|$|York manager Billy McEwan {{hoped to}} re-sign him {{following}} {{the end of}} the season and McGurk declared he wanted to join the club permanently. After turning down a new contract at Darlington he signed for York permanently on 28 June 2006.
