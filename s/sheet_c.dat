6000|$|The Wycherley {{correspondence}} furnishes fresh {{illustrations of}} the malpractices of the poet. For Pope's own share {{in it the}} published version is our only authority. The originals of Wycherley's part in it were placed in Lord Oxford's library in October, 1729, and withdrawn in June, 1735; but there still exist among the Oxford papers copies of six out of the eighteen published letters, besides six which are unpublished.[167] Imperfect as is the series, it is sufficient to show the infidelity of the work Pope put forth to the world. The letter borrowed from the Caryll group may conveniently be considered {{in connection with the}} rest. It was probably not included in the original volume of the Wycherley correspondence, which Pope published in 1729, for it is printed in the edition of 1735 on an interpolated half sheet signed * C. This is placed between sheet B and <b>sheet</b> <b>C,</b> and the numbers of its four pages--11 to 14--are repeated on <b>sheet</b> <b>C.</b> The space being greater than was required the letter has been divided into an unusual number of paragraphs, which are double the ordinary distance from each other, and as this device for spreading out the matter only brought it three or four lines {{over the top of the}} fourth page the remainder is left blank, contrary to the plan adopted in the rest of the book.[168] Pope we may presume had not completed in 1729 his task of reconstructing his letters to Caryll, and first introduced the manufactured letter into the old sheets of the Wycherley when he incorporated them into the volume of 1735. A single circumstance is enough to prove that the letter is fictitious. It is made up of extracts from two letters to Caryll of July 31, 1710, and January 25, 1711, and in the former of the two the poet quotes a remark from the [...] "Tatler" [...] on the reason why women are vainer than men. The passage is repeated in the letter to Wycherley which is dated June 23, 1705, nearly four years before the [...] "Tatler" [...] commenced, and Pope imagined he had obliterated the anachronism by changing the phrase [...] "the 'Tatler' observes of women" [...] into the general formula [...] "it is observed of women." ...|$|E

Above a {{regionally}} autochthonous Tauride carbonate platform the Beyşehir–Hoyran Nappes {{begin with a}} thrust <b>sheet</b> (<b>c.</b> 400 m) of mainly redeposited carbonates, quartzose sandstones and mudstones of Mid–Late Triassic age, interpreted as a proximal slope–base-of-slope succession. Above is a thrust <b>sheet</b> (<b>c.</b> 1 km) of Middle–Upper Triassic intermediate–acidic extrusive rocks, volcaniclastic rocks and minor pelagic carbonates, interpreted as a continental rift. Thin (, 100 m) Upper Triassic–Upper Cretaceous pelagic carbonate and radiolarian chert lie depositionally above. The uppermost thrust sheet comprises broken formation and mélange, including Jurassic shallow-water carbonate, radiolarian chert and Upper Cretaceous pelagic limestone. Zones of tectonic– sedimentary mélange separate higher units. The Beyşehir–Hoyran Nappes document Triassic rifting and Jurassic–Cretaceous passive margin subsidence bordering the Northern Neotethys. A harzburgitic ophiolite probably formed above a north-dipping subduction zone within the ocean basin. The ophiolite was emplaced southwards onto the northern margin of the Tauride platform in latest Cretaceous time. The nappe pile and underlying platform (Hadim Nappe) were thrust further south in Late Eocene time. Assuming in-sequence thrusting, the Beyşehir–Hoyran Nappes restore to a location north of a Neotethyan spreading axis. More probably, they originated near the south margin of the Northern Neotethys, but reached their position by out-of-sequence thrusting. Formation within a southerly strand of the Northern Neotethys (Inner Tauride ocean) is more probable than within the main Northern Neotethys further north...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{branched}} covering originated from {{the theory of}} ramified surfaces, introduced by Riemann for describing multivalued complex functions. The basic example arises from the map z → w = zk with k> 1. This map is singular only at z = 0, and its restriction to z, w = 0 is a cyclic ordinary covering of degree k. In fact the z-plane can be decomposed into k angles each {{one of which is}} bijectively mapped onto the w-plane. So, we can think of the z-plane as the union of k sheets over the w-plane, {{in such a way that}} the multivalued map w → z = k√w takes a single value on each <b>sheet.</b> <b>C...</b>|$|E

The formation energies as well as the barriers in both the cases are significantly lower than those of graphene. Furthermore, compared with the infinite sheets, the energy barriers and formation energies are lower for finite sheets.

We show that multilayer structures of hydrogen can be stabilized at low temperatures in pores larger than 1 nm. Furthermore, chemical substitution of carbon atoms by boron leads to increased adsorption.

The excitation of an electric current at the boundary of the computation region results in self-consistent plasma flows and change {{in the structure of the}} magnetic field. Generally, {{in the vicinity of}} a null point, an MHD singularity arises that manifests itself in the formation of locally plane current sheets. It is shown that the current sheet can be oriented either along the separatrix surface of a magnetic configuration or perpendicular to it, except for axisymmetric configurations (or close to them), when the excitation of an electric current in the direction orthogonal to the separatrix surface does not lead to the formation of a current <b>sheet.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2001 MAIK "Nauka/Interperiodica"...|$|E

The flexural behaviour of RC beams strengthened using this new material was compared with RC beams strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheet. In addition, the structural performance of a beam strengthened using a hybrid of wire mesh-epoxy and CFRP sheet was investigated. The results showed that the use of wire mesh-epoxy composite provides considerable enhancement in the performance of strengthened beams. Compared to CFRP, the wire mesh-epoxy strengthened beams showed more improvement in the first crack load, stiffness and yield strength.

Also, effects of charge transfer and aromaticity were estimated to determine how curvature of graphene influences on simultaneous anion-π and π-π stacking interactions.   Results indicate that curvature of graphene leads to structural changes in SWCNTFs which effects on simultaneous interactions of F - anion and benzene with SWCNTFs.
