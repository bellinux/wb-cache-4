5000|$|McDonald's UFO {{efforts were}} {{exacting}} a toll: {{he was becoming}} professionally isolated, and his marriage was faltering. Beyond Klass and Condon, McDonald butted heads with many other prominent figures, including Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University. McDonald's personality {{may have been a}} factor in these confrontations; even his friends described him as sometimes forceful and impatient, while others, less charitably, called him blunt and abrasive. Additionally, McDonald suffered a public humiliation when in 1970, he agreed to appear before a committee of the United States Congress to provide evidence against the development of the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> (SST) <b>plane.</b> Like many other atmospheric physicists who testified with him, McDonald was convinced that the plane could potentially harm the Earth's vital but fragile ozone layer. During his testimony Congressman Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts — whose district contained factories that would help build the SST — tried to discredit McDonald's SST testimony by switching the hearing to a discussion of McDonald's UFO research. Although McDonald defended his UFO work and noted that his evidence regarding the SST {{had nothing to do with}} UFOs, Conte bluntly stated that anyone who [...] "believes in little green men" [...] was, in his opinion, not a credible witness. McDonald was deeply humiliated by Conte's mocking attitude, and by the open laughter of some committee members.|$|R

40|$|Long-haul <b>transport</b> <b>plane</b> {{configurations}} {{are discussed}} {{that are considered}} technically feasible within a practical level of near-term technology. Supersonic and transonic aircraft are considered, as well as different types of subsonic transports. It is indicated that superior second-generation <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports</b> are quite feasible technically; in particular, it is shown that problems of fuel consumption, efficient overland flight, and questions on noise and nitric oxides have straightforward engineering solutions. Transonic aircraft are practical but {{would have to have}} a different geometry than subsonic aircraft to provide the versatility necessary to compete at one end of their capability with <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports</b> and at the other end, for shorter ranges, with subsonic transports. The shape of subsonic transports is not expected to change noticeably, although recent advances of airfoil technology imply that new subsonic transports would have wings with higher aspect ratios and somewhat less sweep. But large specialized freighter aircraft and very long range laminar flow control or nuclear-powered aircraft with radically new shapes are possible...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{promising}} avenues {{of research and}} development are considered in relation to an advanced <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> which has improved range/payload characteristics and lower airport noise and sonic boom than current-generation <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports.</b> The prospects for advanced technology suggest that a high lift-to-drag-ratio configuration incorporating advanced materials and control concepts and utilizing a variable-cycle engine or perhaps an advanced dry turbojet, will yield an advanced <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> which is economically viable and socially acceptable. Hydrogen fuel offers great promise for future supersonic aircraft, however, the formidable problems {{associated with the use of}} such fuel probably precludes its use on any near term second-generation <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport.</b> The state of technology in some of the areas discussed is not very far advanced and, consequently, a major effort will be required to bring these technologies to a state of readiness on a timely basis...|$|R
40|$|A {{system and}} method are {{disclosed}} for position locating, deriving centralized {{air traffic control}} data, and communicating via voice and digital signals between a multiplicity of remote aircraft, including <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports,</b> and a central station. Such communication takes place through a synchronous satellite relay station. Side tone ranging patterns, {{as well as the}} digital and voice signals, are modulated on a carrier transmitted from the central station and received on all of the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transports.</b> Each aircraft communicates with the ground stations via a different frequency multiplexed spectrum. <b>Supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> position is derived from a computer at the central station and supplied to a local air traffic controller. Position is determined in response to variable phase information imposed on the side tones at the aircrafts. Common to all of the side tone techniques is Doppler compensation for the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> velocity...|$|R
40|$|Two {{laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted on}} the relative noisiness of takeoff and landing operations of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> and several other aircraft in current commercial service. A total of 96 subjects made noisiness judgments on 120 tape-recorded flyover noises in the outdoor-acoustic-simulation experiment; 32 different subjects made judgments on the noises in the indoor-acoustic-simulation experiment. The judgments were made by using the method of numerical category scaling. The effective perceived noise level underestimated the noisiness of the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> by 3. 5 db. For takeoff operations, no difference {{was found between the}} noisiness of the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> and the group of other aircraft for the A-weighted rating scale; however, for landing operations, the noisiness of the <b>supersonic</b> <b>transport</b> was overestimated by 3. 7 db.
