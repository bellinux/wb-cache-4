40|$|Abstract – Scale {{relativity}} is a {{new approach}} to the problem of the origin <b>of</b> fundamental <b>scales</b> and <b>of</b> <b>scaling</b> laws in physics, which consists in generalizing Einstein’s principle of relativity to the case <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> <b>transformations</b> <b>of</b> resolutions. We recall here how it leads one to the concept of fractal space-time, and to introduce a new complex time derivative operator which allows to recover the Schrödinger equation, then to generalize it. In high energy quantum physics, it leads to the introduction of a Lorentzian renormalization group, in which the Planck length is reinterpreted as a lowest, unpassable scale, invariant under dilatations. These methods are successively applied to two problems: in quantum mechanics, that of the mass spectrum of elementary particles; in chaotic dynamics, that of the distribution of planets in the Solar System. 1...|$|R

40|$|Assessment {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges of urban resilience research. The difficulty of this task arises from the increasing complexity of urban environments and from the unpredictability of external changes, two trends that have raised environmental awareness and, consequently, led to a growing debate on the relationship between city and nature. We join this debate by looking at urban resilience through the lens of urban form. We refer to urban form as a product of the continuous tension between recovery and adaptation on several spatial and temporal <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>transformation.</b> Although recent resilience approaches, such as spatial resilience, general resilience, and urban resilience, have dealt with urban form indirectly, and, conversely, some studies in urban morphology have tried to grasp the complexity of urban-natural environments, an explicit morphological perspective on urban resilience is still lacking in research. The paper is divided in three main parts: formal treatments of resilience (spatial, urban, and general), resilience of urban form (fitness, performance, and sustainability), and a network perspective on the two concepts. It concludes with a discussion on the possibility of a spacemorphological approach to general urban resilience. UrbanismArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} to study the momentum and mass transfer characteristics in a visco-elastic fluid flow over a porous stretching sheet {{in the presence of}} a transverse magnetic field. The flow is generated solely due to the linear stretching of the sheet. The symmetry groups obtained using a special form <b>of</b> Lie group <b>transformations</b> viz. <b>Scaling</b> group <b>of</b> <b>transformations,</b> reduce the momentum equation and the concentration conservation equation into fourth order and second order ordinary differential equations respectively. Closed form analytical solutions have been derived for non-dimensional concentration and mass flux profiles in the form of confluent hyper geometric (Kummer’s) functions, for two different cases of the boundary conditions, namely (1) Prescribed Sheet Concentration (PSC) and (2) Prescribed Mass Flux (PMF). The main emphasis of this paper is to derive the final equations using the <b>scaling</b> group <b>of</b> <b>transformations</b> and to study the effects of the visco-elastic parameter, suction/blowing parameter, magnetic parameter, concentration and mass flux parameters and Schmidt number on the mass transfer characteristics. It has been observed that, for the case of suction and for the values of the parameters considered, an ideal combination to obtain a reduced concentration boundary layer thickness would be to choose smaller values of the visco-elastic and magnetic parameters and relatively larger value for the Schmidt number. This is seen to be more significant in the PMF case. An increase in the concentration and mass flux parameters has shown a steep decrease in the concentration boundary layer thickness...|$|R
