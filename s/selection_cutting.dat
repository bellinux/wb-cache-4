40|$|Growth and yield {{simulators}} {{are often}} {{used to assess the}} long-term sustainability of <b>selection</b> <b>cuttings</b> in northern hardwood stands. Because residual tree growth is affected by tree removal, growth simulators must be coupled with a harvest model to adequately predict future stand development. Harvest models may consider variables such as species, diameter at breast height (DBH), spatial coordinates of the trees and indicators of stem quality and vigour. Through the development of a harvest model applicable to <b>selection</b> <b>cuttings</b> in northern hardwood stands, we aimed to quantify the loss of accuracy caused by the omission of either tree spatial coordinates or tree quality/vigour descriptors from the predictor variables. Spatial correlations were handled using both generalized linear mixed-effect models and a copula approach. Tree vigour and quality were assessed using three different classification systems used in practice. The inclusion of tree vigour and spatial correlations through the copula approach led to a 12 per cent improvement in maximum log-likelihood. However, the inclusion of the spatial coordinates of each tree only accounted for one quarter of this 12 per cent. In cases where a growth simulator uses tree vigour class as input, we recommend the inclusion of this variable in the associated harvest sub-model...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: During {{machining}} operation, {{friction between}} workpiece-cutting tool and cutting tool-chip interfaces result high temperature on cutting tool. The {{effect of this}} generated heat affects shorter tool life, higher surface roughness and lowers the dimensional sensitiveness of work material. This result is more important when machining of difficult-to-cut materials, due to occurrence of higher heat. Design/methodology/approach: Different methods {{have been reported to}} protect cutting tool from the generated heat during machining operations. The <b>selection</b> of coated <b>cutting</b> tools are an expensive alternative and generally it is a suitable approach for machining some materials such as titanium alloys, heat resistance alloys etc. Another alternative is to apply cutting fluids in machining operation. They are used to provide lubrication and cooling effects between cutting tool and workpiece and cutting tool and chip during machining operation. Hence the influence of generated heat on cutting tool would be prevented. Findings: As a result, important benefits would be achieved such longer tool life, easy chip flow and higher machining quality in the machining processes. The <b>selection</b> of <b>cutting</b> fluids should be carefully carried out to obtain optimum result in machining processes. Various factors are affecting the <b>selection</b> of <b>cutting</b> fluid type in machining operation such as type of workpiece materials, cutting tool material and the method of machining processes. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the <b>selection</b> of <b>cutting</b> fluids for machining processes was examined.

5000|$|In forestry, high grading is a {{selective}} type of timber harvesting that removes the highest grade of timber (i.e. the most merchantable stems [...] ) {{in an area}} of forest.

50|$|<b>Selection</b> <b>cutting</b> or {{systems are}} {{generally}} considered to be more challenging to implement and maintain than even-aged silviculture, due to the difficulty of managing multiple age classes in a shared space, but there are significant ecological benefits associated with it. Uneven-aged stands generally exhibit higher levels of vertical structure (key for many species of birds and mammals), have higher levels of carbon sequestration, and produce a more constant flow of market and non-market forest resources than even-aged stands.. Although a forest composed of many stands with varied maturity ages maybe comparable, this would be at the forest rather than the stand level. This silvicultural method also protects forest soils from the adverse effects of many types of even-aged silviculture, including nutrient loss, erosion and soil compaction and the rapid loss of organic material from a forested system. Selection silviculture is especially adept at regenerating shade-tolerant species of trees (those able to function under conditions of low solar energy, both cooler and less light), but can also be modified to suit the regeneration and growth of intolerant and mid-tolerant species. This is one of many different ways of harvesting trees. <b>Selection</b> <b>cutting</b> as a silvicultural system can be modified in many ways and would be so done be a forester to take into account varied ownership goals, local site conditions and the species mix found from past forest conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Selection</b> <b>cutting</b> is the {{silvicultural}} {{practice of}} harvesting trees {{in a way}} that moves a forest stand towards an uneven-aged or all-aged condition, or 'structure'. Using stocking models derived from the study of old growth forests, '"Selection cutting"', also known as 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture', manages the establishment, continued growth and final harvest of multiple age classes (usually three, but 5 or even 10 are possible) of trees within a stand. A closely related approach to forest management is Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF), which makes use of selection systems to achieve a permanently irregular stand structure.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Selection</b> <b>cutting</b> {{is often}} (sometimes deliberately) {{confused}} with [...] "selective" [...] cutting, a term {{synonymous with the}} practice of highgrading (the removal of the most economically profitable trees in a forest, often with a disregard {{for the future of}} the residual stand). Often the latter term is used by foresters or loggers to imply the former (which has a generally positive connotation in forestry circles) and mislead landowners into stripping their woodlot of its most valuable timber. Used correctly, the term 'selection cutting', 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture' implies the implementation of specific silvicultural techniques—usually either 'single tree selection', 'group selection' or a combination of the two—to create an uneven-aged or all-aged condition in a forest stand, one more akin to a late successional or 'climax' condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{vitality}} and regeneration of this Pinus ponderosa forest depends on ample seeds, adequate moisture, and {{a temperature of}} 55 F for germination and early survival. Once the seed germinates, it grows a tap root 20 in into the ground. This tree likes uneven aged stands and is shade intolerant. Management practices for the forest include group <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> and prescribed controlled burn fires. The bark of ponderosa pine is very thick so older trees can withstand fire to a certain extent. The Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) grow well in the forest. Sucker production after a fire is high (50,000 suckers per hectare) but survival is low. There is less canopy cover in a ponderosa pine community compared to a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and spruce/fir community, resulting in more grasses, forbs, and shrubs. The high species richness in this community makes it preferred by grazing animals such as elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and moose (Alces alces).|$|E

The foremost management objective in these stands is {{to establish and maintain}} stand structures that ensure a sustainable presence of the species in terms of uneven-aged management. The major threats are the proliferation of shade-tolerant tree species and the pitch canker (Fusarium circinatum) disease.

The results indicated that the {{sustainability of}} Monterey pine is not assured by existing stand structures. Monterey pine regeneration is almost completely lacking.
