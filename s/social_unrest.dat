5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E

40|$|The evident {{connection}} between human evolution and climatic changes has been concurred by scientists. Although {{many people are}} trying to forecast the impacts of climatic changes on our future society, there are not any studies to quantitatively scrutinize the interrelation between climatic changes and social developments by using historical data. In line with this knowledge gap, this study adopted a scientific approach to compare the paleoclimatic records with the historical data of wars, <b>social</b> <b>unrests,</b> and dynastic transitions in China spanned from the late Tang to Qing Dynasties. Results showed that war frequency in cold phases was much higher than that in mild phases. Besides, 70 %- 80 % of war peaks and most of the dynastic transitions and nationwide <b>social</b> <b>unrests</b> in China took place in cold phases. This phenomenon could be attributed to the diminishing thermal energy input in cold phases resulting in the fall of land-productivity and hence, the deficiency of livelihood resources across society. Accompanied with certain social circumstances, this kind of ecological stress was transformed into wars and <b>social</b> <b>unrests,</b> followed by dynastic transitions in most of the cases. By closer examination, it was even found that war frequency was negatively correlated with temperature anomaly series. As land carrying capacities vary from one climatic zone to another, the magnitude of war-temperature association also differed among different geographic regions. It is suggested that climatic change {{was one of the most}} important factors in determining the dynastic cycle and alternation of war and peace in ancient China. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued <b>social</b> <b>unrest,</b> the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of land from the aborigines to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E

5|$|The 14th {{century in}} England saw the Great Famine and the Black Death, catastrophic events that killed around half of England's population, {{throwing}} the economy into chaos and undermining the old political order. <b>Social</b> <b>unrest</b> followed, {{resulting in the}} Peasants' Revolt of 1381, while {{the changes in the}} economy resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} class of gentry, and the nobility began to exercise power through a system termed bastard feudalism. Nearly 1,500 villages were deserted by their inhabitants and many men and women sought new opportunities in the towns and cities. New technologies were introduced, and England produced some of the great medieval philosophers and natural scientists. English kings in the 14th and 15th centuries laid claim to the French throne, resulting in the Hundred Years' War. At times England enjoyed huge military success, with the economy buoyed by profits from the international wool and cloth trade, but by 1450 the country was in crisis, facing military failure in France and an ongoing recession. More <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> broke out, followed by the Wars of the Roses, fought between rival factions of the English nobility. Henry VII's victory in 1485 conventionally marks the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Early Modern period.|$|E

40|$|This {{book is a}} discourse-pragmatic {{study of}} media {{language}} in news headlines and leads.

The period between 1996 and 2002 viewed in this book as very crucial in the political development of Nigeria provided an environment that made highly critical and sensational news reports inevitable. The three most prominent Nigerian urban newsmagazines namely Newswatch, Tell and TheNews referred to as 'radical press,' are viewed as adopting a people-oriented approach to confront perpetrators of <b>social</b> <b>unrests</b> and political scandals in Nigeria, especially military dictators and corrupt politicians. In {{a wide range of}} stylistic variations, lexico-semantic and grammatical strategies that produced highly sensational headlines and overlines, the news conveyed clearly marked ideologically significant representations of people and situations.

In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well.

40|$|As the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) {{deadline}} {{approaches the}} world is {{looking back at the}} last 20 years. While policy makers hail the success in meeting the povery reduction target of the MDGs, <b>social</b> <b>unrests</b> in the Middle East and North African regions and some parts of Asia and Europe question current economic growth models. Developing countries have been catching up economically at unprecended rates, but economic growth does not automatically translate into positive social outcomes. Widening inequalities within countries, especially in fast-growing economies, threaten social cohesion. This issue paper describes the opportunities and challenges faced by developing countries due to the shift in economic gravity. It argues that reducing absolute povety is not enough and that inequality limits social mobility and restrict individual choice. Inequalities reinforce circumstantial factors such as inherited poverty, gender, ethnicity and location (Watkins, 2013). Policy making must go beyond targeted approaches aimed at absolute poverty reduction and consider broader social cohesion objectives that will reduce inequalities in terms of income as well as access to basic services and opportunities for decent jobs and mobility. New inclusive growth models that encompass more effective redistribution policies and comprehensive social protection programmes are needed t...|$|R
