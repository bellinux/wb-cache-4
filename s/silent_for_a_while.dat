His whole theory is simply based on the universal application {{of the right of}} self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs.

60|$|Master Leigh {{sucked in}} a shuddering breath, and was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
60|$|The man {{remained}} <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> {{his head}} still projecting through the wicket.|$|E
60|$|She {{remained}} <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> as if rendered breathless by {{this quiet}} statement.|$|E
60|$|Then we were <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while,</b> <b>silent,</b> {{with our}} eyes fixed upon the sky.|$|R
60|$|But having {{stood before}} him, <b>silent,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> it moved towards the fire; then stopped.|$|R
60|$|Then she stopped, and sat <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, <b>while</b> <b>a</b> {{flush of}} colour mounted to her cheeks.|$|R

60|$|The unseen crowds withdrew. His own {{dormitory}} rustled {{into bed}} and lay <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
60|$|After {{that answer}} they both remain <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> then {{rise from the}} bench and walk toward the house.|$|R
60|$|Mr Swiveller was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while.</b> By and bye, {{he began}} to talk again, inquiring how long he had been there.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jarvis rose, and, having {{inspected}} Mike with <b>silent</b> admiration <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> extended <b>a</b> well-buttered hand towards him. Psmith {{looked on}} benevolently.|$|R
60|$|He {{interrupted}} {{himself and}} remained <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> glaring about with set teeth and dilated nostrils.|$|E
60|$|He hid {{his face}} in his hands and groaned with agony. Mrs. Wallace was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
60|$|They were <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> {{and then}} he saw that Isabel was crying. Instinctively he seized her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... “Mild,” {{said the}} Assistant Commissioner without passion. He {{remained}} <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> “We’ve {{got hold of}} a man called Verloc,” he announced casually.|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head slowly, and then was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while.</b> At last, looking at him with solemn eyes, she whispered, 'To kill him.' ...|$|R

60|$|Another time he {{came and}} was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Then he put his head on one side, and looked at me.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jarvis's {{expression}} changed. He rose, and, having inspected John with <b>silent</b> admiration <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> extended <b>a</b> well-buttered hand towards him. Smith {{looked on}} benevolently.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's likely {{enough that}} I shall. There's this comfort, at any rate, I'm used to it." [...] And then Miss Jack was <b>silent</b> again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|R
60|$|A look of pain {{crossed her}} face, {{and she was}} <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> Then <b>a</b> fight came into her eyes, and with a smile she spoke again.|$|R

6000|$|... 'And was David good to you, child?' asked Miss Betsey, {{when she}} had been <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> and these motions of her head had {{gradually}} ceased. 'Were you comfortable together?' ...|$|R
