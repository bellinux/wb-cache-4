40|$|Due to the connection-oriented {{nature of}} the {{asynchronous}} transfer mode (ATM), {{one of the challenges}} in mobile wireless ATM (WATM) systems is the management of terminal handovers. When ATM connections are reestablished to follow terminals moving between areas covered by distinct base stations, seamless handover protocols are necessary to guarantee that ATM cells are delivered to terminals in the correct order, with <b>cell</b> loss <b>rate</b> and delay that satisfy the contracted quality of service (QoS). A promising approach to meet QoS requirements is based on the use of handover buffers at the (destination) base station, where transmitted cells are stored while the connection is being reestablished. Up to date, only simulation and experimental results are available to determine the performance of such protocols and buffering schemes. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an analytical modeling approach to estimate the performance of handover protocols making use of handover buffers at the base station. By incorporating several approximations, the proposed models allow designers to simultaneously take into account numerous system parameters, including handover buffer size, <b>sustainable</b> and peak <b>cell</b> <b>rates</b> of the ATM connection, terminal offered load, and time needed to reestablish the ATM connection. Analytical performance predictions are shown to closely match results of detailed simulation experiments, thus demonstrating the suitability of the proposed modeling framework for the selection of the most adequate solution to handle handover and provide the QoS required by end users...|$|R

These provide a conformance definition, using {{a form of}} the leaky bucket algorithm called the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA), which specifies how cells are checked for conformance with a cell rate, or its reciprocal emission interval, and jitter tolerance: either a Cell Delay Variation tolerance (CDVt) for testing conformance to the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) or a Burst Tolerance or Maximum Burst Size (MBS) for testing conformance to the <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (SCR).|$|E
50|$|A burst or {{clump of}} packets can {{arrive at a}} higher rate than {{determined}} by the emission interval T. This may be the line rate of the physical layer connection when the packets in the burst will arrive back-to-back. However, as in ATM, the tolerance may be applied to a lower rate, in that case the <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> (SCR), and the burst of packets (cells) can arrive {{at a higher rate}}, but less than the line rate of the physical layer, in that case the Peak Cell Rate (PCR). The MBS may then be the number of cells needed to transport a higher layer packet (see segmentation and reassembly), where the packets are transmitted with a maximum bandwidth determined by the SCR and cells within the packets are transmitted at the PCR; thus allowing the last cell of the packet, and the packet itself, to arrive significantly earlier than it would if the cells were sent at the SCR: transmission duration = (MBS-1)/PCR rather than (MBS-1)/SCR. This bursting at the PCR puts a significantly higher load on shared resources, e.g. switch output buffers, than does transmission at the SCR, and is thus more likely to result in buffer overflows and network congestion. However, it puts a lesser load on these resources than would transmitting at the SCR with a limit value, τSCR, that allows MBS cells to be transmitted and arrive back-to-back at the line rate.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to design a fuzzy logic {{controller}} {{that could be used}} to prevent congestion in Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks. The controller would be located at the User-Network Interface of the network and would be used to monitor the incoming traffic. The control action would be to allow conforming traffic through to the network unmodified, while tagging or dropping non-conforming traffic. Three fuzzy logic controllers are presented, the latter two being improvements on design(s) that preceded it. All three controllers are designed to police the <b>sustainable</b> <b>cell</b> <b>rate</b> of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic sources, and take the <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Rate</b> and Peak Cell Rate as input Parameters. The first two controllers require an additional parameter called the Burst Threshold, while the third controller takes the Initial Burst Size as its third traffic parameter. The controllers then continuously analyse the state of the traffic by applying a set of rules that it was given and decides whether the source is conforming or non-conforming, taking corrective action if required. The first controller included two buffers that were used to determine the state of the connection. It was however found that it would be too difficult to determine what sizes to make those buffers, and therefore that design was abandoned in favour of the second controller. The second controller eliminated the need for buffers in the design, while still being able to tag or drop non-conforming cells and allowing conforming cells through unmodified. This was done by including a token leaky bucket in the design and modifying the fuzzy sets and rule base of the fuzzy logic engine accordingly. ...|$|E
