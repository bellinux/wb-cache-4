Intralaminar and interlaminar damage prediction of the composites lay-ups are evaluated using a proposed damage model implemented as user defined material on ABAQUS Explicit multipurpose FEM code.

The Single Shell Model (SSM) used only shell elements {{to model the}} laminates and the delamination effects are neglected. To add the delamination effects on the numerical model the <b>Split</b> <b>Shell</b> Model (SpSM) is developed using a delamination contact-logic to predict the out-of-plane effects using the shell elements to model the sub-laminates.

40|$|Computations on an 80 -coefficient {{model of}} the earth's field {{illustrate}} the 'topography' of the magnetic equatorial surface and the geometry of the drift shells of geomagnetically trapped particles. Individual terms in the spherical harmonic expansion of the geomagnetic scalar potential V(r, theta, phi) are either even or odd in cos theta, where theta = 90 deg denotes the dipole equator. Terms that are even in cos theta tend to 'warp' the equatorial surface, but do not (in first order) distort particle drift <b>shells</b> radially nor <b>split</b> the drift <b>shells</b> of particles having different equatorial pitch angles.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of microseismic event locations, we developed a new inversion method with double-difference constraints for determining the hypocenters and the anisotropic velocity model for unconventional reservoirs. We applied this method to a microseismic data set monitoring a Middle Bakken completion in the Beaver Lodge area of North Dakota. Geophone arrays in four observation wells improved the ray coverage for the velocity inversion. Using an accurate anisotropic velocity model is important to correctly assess the height growth of the hydraulically induced fractures in the Middle Bakken. Our results showed that (1) moderate-to-strong anisotropy exists in all studied sedimentary layers, especially in the Upper and Lower Bakken shale formations, where the Thomsen parameters (ϵ and γ) can be greater than 0. 4, (2) all the events selected for high signal-to-noise ratio and used for the joint velocity inversion {{are located in the}} Bakken and overlying Lodgepole formations, i. e., no events are detected in the Three Forks formation below the Bakken, and (3) {{more than half of the}} strong events are in two clusters at approximately 100 and 150 m above the Middle Bakken. Reoccurrence of strong, closely clustered events suggested activation of natural fractures or faults in the Lodgepole formation. The sensitivity analysis for the inversion results showed that the relative uncertainty in parameter δ is larger than other anisotropy parameters. The microseismic event locations and the anisotropic velocity model are validated by comparing synthetic and observed seismic waveforms and by S-wave <b>splitting.</b> <b>Shell</b> Oil Compan...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method for}} modeling radiation belt electron diffusion, which solves the radiation belt Fokker-Planck equation using its equivalent stochastic differential equations, and presents applications of this method to investigating drift <b>shell</b> <b>splitting</b> effects on radiation belt electron phase space density. The theory of the stochastic differential equation method of solving Fokker-Planck equations is formulated in this thesis, {{in the context of}} the radiation belt electron diffusion problem, and is generalized to curvilinear coordinates to enable calculation of the electron phase space density as a function of adiabatic invariants M, K and L. Based on this theory, a three-dimensional radiation belt electron model in adiabatic invariant coordinates, named REM (for Radbelt Electron Model), is constructed and validated against both known results from other methods and spacecraft measurements. Mathematical derivations and the essential numerical algorithms that constitute REM are presented in this thesis. As the only model to date that can solve the fully three-dimensional diffusion problem, REM is used to study the effects of drift <b>shell</b> <b>splitting,</b> which gives rise to M-L and K-L off-diagonal terms in the radiation belt diffusion tensor. REM simulation results suggest that drift <b>shell</b> <b>splitting</b> reduces outer radiation belt electron phase space density enhancements during electron injection events. Plots of the phase space density sources, which are unique products of the stochastic differential equation method, and theoretical analysis further reveal that this reduction effect is caused by a change of the phase space location of the source to smaller $L$ shells, and has a limit corresponding to two-dimensional local diffusion on a curved surface in the (M,K,L) phase space...|$|R
