5|$|The game {{is played}} by first {{introducing}} the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage {{of his or her}} own, which is only revealed {{at the end of the}} show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} {{which measures}} 99 meters by 38.7 meters is rectangular in shape with one main dome and four <b>smaller</b> <b>ones,</b> one at each corner. As is seen now, the palace has two main domes and eight <b>smaller</b> <b>ones</b> located at each {{corner of the}} palace.|$|R
5|$|The {{review was}} carried out by the Assembly's Management Services Division, the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and Symonds Group Ltd. They {{considered}} the following options, cancel the project, continue with the existing design, design a building on Site 1E, improve the existing debating chamber, construct a <b>small</b> <b>one</b> in the courtyard of Crickhowell House, and relocate to Cardiff City Hall. On 21 June 2000 it was agreed that the original proposal using the RRP design should proceed.|$|E
5|$|Within an hour, White {{called his}} wife {{from a nearby}} diner; she met him at a church and was {{with him as he}} turned himself in. Many left flowers on the steps of City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a {{spontaneous}} candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; a <b>small</b> <b>one</b> at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.|$|E

50|$|The server {{provides}} two teacups {{for each}} diner: the bigger one for tea making, and the <b>smaller</b> <b>one</b> for drinking. Patrons need to steep {{tea in the}} larger cup and pour it into to the <b>smaller</b> <b>one.</b>|$|R

Each ESGR field committee presents the award to one <b>small,</b> <b>one</b> large, and one public-sector employer in each committee’s state or territory.|$|E
25|$|Differences in labour {{abundance}} {{would not}} produce a difference in relative factor abundance (in relation to mobile capital) because the labour/capital ratio would be identical everywhere. (A large country would receive twice as much investment as a <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> for instance, maximizing capitalist's return on investment).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{very small}} Ukrainian {{community}} in the country, numbering a few dozen. It includes businesspersons, journalists, diplomats and Ukrainian spouses married to Pakistanis. Most of them reside in metropolitan cities. The Russian community in Pakistan is a <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> and has been present since the Soviet era. There are some Romanians, concentrated in Islamabad.|$|E

25|$|Beta {{functions}} are usually computed {{in some kind}} of approximation scheme. An example is perturbation theory, where one assumes that the coupling parameters are <b>small.</b> <b>One</b> can then make an expansion in powers of the coupling parameters and truncate the higher-order terms (also known as higher loop contributions, due to the number of loops in the corresponding Feynman graphs).|$|E
25|$|The Jacobite {{army was}} {{originally}} arrayed between {{the corners of}} Culloden and Culwhiniac parks (from left to right): the three Macdonald battalions; a <b>small</b> <b>one</b> of Chisholms; another <b>small</b> <b>one</b> of Macleans and Maclachlans; Lady Mackintosh and Monaltrie's regiments; Lord Lovat's Regiment; Ardsheal's Appin Stewarts; Lochiel's Regiment; and three battalions of the Atholl Brigade. Murray who commanded the right wing, however {{became aware of the}} Leanach enclosure that lay ahead of him, a wall that would become an obstacle {{in the event of a}} Jacobite advance. Without any consultation he then moved the brigade down the moor and formed into three columns. It seems probable that Murray intended to shift the axis of the Jacobite advance to a more northerly direction, thus having the right wing clear the Leanach enclosure and possibly taking advantage of the downward slope of the moor to the north.|$|E
25|$|John Hulley was {{a patron}} of the Mercantile Assistants' Athletic Festival which took place at Spekeland Park, Smithdown Lane, Liverpool on 11 July 1868. There {{was no mention of}} him in the {{subsequent}} report, and compared with his organising abilities in previous athletic festivals, this event was a very <b>small</b> <b>one</b> and appeared to signal the end of his involvement in athletic festivals in Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|The Deposition {{from the}} Cross. Prior to the Apokathelosis, Vespers on the {{afternoon}} of Great Friday, the priest and deacon will place the Epitaphios on the Holy Table. The priest may also anoint the Epitaphios with perfumed oil. A chalice veil and the Gospel Book is placed on top of the Epitaphios. This may be either the large Gospel Book used at the Divine Liturgy, or it may be a <b>small</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 1989, Rangers {{owner and}} oil tycoon Eddie Chiles, sold {{the team to}} an {{investment}} group headed by George W. Bush, son of the President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell the team, Bush headed {{a group of investors}} that bought the team for $89 million. While his own equity in the team was a <b>small</b> <b>one</b> (approximately 1%), he was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment the following year.|$|E
25|$|Though the Port of Tuscaloosa is a <b>small</b> <b>one,</b> {{it is one}} of {{the larger}} {{facilities}} on the Black Warrior River at waterway mile marker 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry bulk commodities, including lignite, coal and coal coke. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.|$|E

25|$|Swift {{also has}} limited support for attributes, {{metadata}} that is {{read by the}} development environment, and is not necessarily part of the compiled code. Like Objective-C, attributes use the @ syntax, but the currently available set is <b>small.</b> <b>One</b> example is the @IBOutlet attribute, which marks a given value in the code as an outlet, available for use within Interface Builder (IB). An outlet is a device that binds {{the value of the}} on-screen display to an object in code.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in spite}} {{of more than a}} century of formal {{separation}} of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist Inari shrines. During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, shrine-temples (jingū-ji) were destroyed while temple-shrines (chinjusha) were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is Seiganto-ji), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still have at least a <b>small</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|As it was then, this {{election}} is still today shrouded in controversy, and there exist two popular stances in this discussion. On one hand, some people argue {{that there was a}} resolve in favor of independence, as there actually was a factual majority for secession, even if it was a <b>small</b> <b>one.</b> On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a qualified majority can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.|$|E
