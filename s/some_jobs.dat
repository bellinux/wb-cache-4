5|$|Gair has now {{developed}} a style {{as a body}} painter. Her typical job takes her and her team eight hours, but <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> take twice that. She does not charge by the hour. Gair is always well prepared for her jobs, but does not generally sketch her work on paper. In fact, she claims to have only had to do so twice in over twenty years of body painting. When she needs to test something out she usually uses her opposite (left) arm or hand.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Later at the Warsaw Tavern, Drew {{is hanging}} out with his friends when Mimi walks in and confronts him. Drew talks to her {{honestly}} about why she {{did not get the}} job, telling her that her attitude is the problem and she has to {{deal with the fact that}} her looks might stop her from getting <b>some</b> <b>jobs.</b> Mimi does not like Drew's advice and leaves the bar. Needing to fill the cosmetics position quickly, Drew believes he has found an ideal candidate in Natalie (Natasha Silver) until Kate turns up to apply for the job. Drew admits that he is worried that Kate will hate him if he has to fire her. However, Mr. Bell insists Drew hire Kate, having seen her in the lobby and Drew agrees. Kate later comes to Drew's house to ask him, Lewis and Oswald, which perfume samples to promote. The episode ends with Drew playing pool in his garden in the rain, while the others watch through the window.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> to be lost, it had not understood the exact nature of Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E

In a set of processes <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> are done by one person. Some are done by many and often many processes are done by the same person. Throughout the working day a participant, in completing a task, may find the focus shifts between internal and external Systems 1–5 from moment to moment.|$|E
25|$|A {{restructuring}} of the university was announced in September 2009, which would bring together all the academic schools into three faculties, these being the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Social sciences, and Henley Business School. The move was predicted to result {{in the loss of}} <b>some</b> <b>jobs,</b> especially in the film, theatre and television department, which will shortly be moving into a brand new £11.5million building on Whiteknights Campus.|$|E

25|$|Soon six of {{the eight}} Australian jurisdictions allow men charged or convicted under {{historical}} anti-homosexuality laws to apply for expungement, which clears the charge or conviction from their criminal record. After expungement, the conviction is treated as having never occurred, with the individual not required to disclose it and the conviction not showing up on a police records check. Without expungement laws, {{men who had been}} convicted of historical sodomy offences were at a disadvantage, including being subject to restrictions on travel and in applying for <b>some</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{segregation}} {{refers to}} the way that <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> (such as truck driver) are dominated by men, and other jobs (such as child care worker) are dominated by women. Considerable research suggests that predominantly female occupations pay less, even controlling for individual and workplace characteristics. Economists Blau and Kahn stated that women's pay compared to men's had improved because of a decrease in occupational segregation. They also argued that the gender wage difference will decline modestly and that the extent of discrimination against women {{in the labor market}} seems to be decreasing.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} only {{appeared in}} the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them. Commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{traditional}} for each Kent student {{to have a}} job while they are at school.This tradition dates back to {{the early days of the}} school when it was mainly self-sufficient. These are not jobs in the typical sense but are rather different duties and obligations that each student will have. <b>Some</b> <b>jobs</b> are very basic, such as washing tables after dinner or keeping a common room neat. Others are more involved, such as being a student tour guide or being a student computer technician. The job program is an integral part of the school's history and character even if many of the jobs are different than when they were originally created.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>jobs</b> for {{the court}} {{attracted}} extra payments: in 1606 he repainted, for 1,200 francs, the Galerie des Cerfs, the main public space of the palace, used as a law court among other things. He appears to have repeated the previous scheme of hunting scenes. In the same year he was commissioned (1,700 francs, shared) to execute, but not design, a temporary triumphal arch for the royal entry of Marguerite Gonzaga, the new wife of Henri, {{the heir to the}} duchy, who inherited upon {{the death of his father}} Charles in 1608. This was Lorraine's first classical triumphal arch, surmounted by a statue of Virgil in honour of the bride's Mantuan home. Bellange also produced a car for use in the ballet produced for the celebrations, with 12 papier-maché putti.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in <b>some</b> <b>jobs,</b> e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making the appraisal process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E

500|$|Other {{companies}} {{have also been}} affected. For example, the private Sterling Airlines declared bankruptcy on 29 October 2008. The national airline Icelandair has noticed a significant slump in domestic demand for flights. However, the airline states that year-on-year international demand is up from last year. Guðjón Arngrímsson, {{a spokesman for the}} airline, said [...] "we're getting decent traffic from other markets... we are trying to let the weak [...] help us." [...] He has also stated {{that it is impossible to}} predict whether the company will be profitable this year. Morgunblaðið, an Icelandic newspaper, is cutting <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> and merging parts of its operations with the media corporation 365. The newspaper 24 stundir has ceased publication due to the crisis, resulting in the loss of 20 jobs.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were pleased}} with {{graphics}} and visuals of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance; GameSpot {{adding that the}} battles are [...] "clear and colorful", and character jobs are easily identified, though gameplay becomes slow when too many character sprites are in one screen. The gameplay is also lauded for retaining the elements of Tactics Ogre yet offers freedom to players to develop characters as they wish. GameNOW said that the game [...] "lives up to its legacy—and then some", and called it [...] "easily {{one of the best}} GBA games around". Criticism was thrown to the game's menu, which was cluttered with complicated options in organizing the clan members, and did not detail out statistics for characters and equipment. Some reviewers thought there are too many character jobs since <b>some</b> <b>jobs</b> overlap one another and certain abilities are redundant.|$|E
