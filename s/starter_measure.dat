The thesis was engaged in the monitoring process of a souring curve of used starters. This monitoring was based on temperature, titrating acidity and pH measured in the time interval. The souring curve was evaluated as the indirect measurement change of acidity of the starter in the time period. Further, the activity of detached <b>starters</b> was <b>measured.</b> The measurement {{was based on the}} change of pH measured in the time period. The influence of the culture medium was monitored by changes in behaviour of the bacterial cultures. The monitored starters were compounded of mezophilic and termophilic bacterial strains...|$|R

In the present study, impact of calcium, lactation stage and curd acidification were investigated. Camel milk was shared into 6 samples (100 g each) submitted to 3 types of treatment (1. calcium chloride solution (500 g/L diluted 1 / 10 water); 2. powder of calcium phosphate; 3. no calcium) and 2 temperatures (200 C/ 360 C). Rennet 50 μL/L (Chy-Max) was added in all samples. Milk coagulation was faster at 36 °C and renneting pH lower. No difference in clotting time and curd firmness after calcium addition was observed. The curd firmness at 36 °C {{was stronger than}} at 20 °C. For measuring impact of lactation stage, coagulation capacity and curd yield on milk was tested in milk provided by one camel from 12 th to 25 th day postpartum. Milk was coagulated by Chy-Max (50 μL/L/ 20 °C). No coagulation was observed {{in the first days}} of experiment. Then curd start to be formed, but with low yield. The curd was correct and ready to use for cheese making only from the 20 th day post-partum. Acidification of camel cheese curd without <b>starters</b> was <b>measured</b> at 200 C and 360 C during 10 hours. Milk pH and curd pH were measured during all cheese processing. At the beginning, milk pH was 6. 38 whatever the temperature. Acidification was faster at 36 °C than at 20 °C. At the time of coagulation, pH of 200 C curd was 5. 80 vs 5. 08 at 360 C...|$|R

In Series I to IV concrete base specimens were loaded and column <b>starter</b> bar strains <b>measured</b> for different supporting conditions of the base. Curves indicating the distribution of steel compressive stresses and bond stresses in the columns and base slabs are given. Results from these tests indicate that the conventional design approach towards bond stresses in concrete bases is conservative and that the allowable bond stresses in BS CP 110 seem to be too low while the maximum stresses specified in ACI 318 - 71 and the CEB-FIP Recommendations {{seem to be more}} acceptable. In Series V pull-out tests were made on 60 concrete cube specimens subjected to biaxial normal pressure. The ultimate bond strength was found to increase with applied normal pressure in proportion to the square root of the normal pressure and square root of the concrete strength.

40|$|Quality of care {{measures}} are increasingly important to health plans, purchasers, physicians, and patients. Ap-propriate measures {{can be used}} to assess quality and evaluate improvement and are necessary components of pay-for-performance programs. Despite the broad scope of activity in the development of quality measures, migraine headache has received little attention. Given the enormous costs associated with migraine, especially in terms of lost productivity and preventable health care utilization, health plans could gain from a structured approach to measuring the quality of migraine care their beneficiaries receive. A potential migraine quality measurement set was developed through a review of migraine care literature and guidelines, interviews with leaders in migraine care, health care purchasing, and managed care, and the assembly of an advisory board. The board discussed candidate measures and established consensus on a testable measurement set. Twenty measures were developed, focused primarily on diagnosis and utilization. Areas of utilization include physician visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and imaging. Use of both acute and preventive medications is included. More complex aspects of migraine care are also addressed, in-cluding triptan overuse, the relationship between acute and preventive medications, and follow-up after emer-gency department visits. The {{measures are}} currently being tested in health plans to assess their feasibility and value. A compelling case can be made for the development of migraine-specific quality measures for health plans. This effort to de-velop and test a <b>starter</b> set of <b>measures</b> should lead to new and innovative efforts to assess and improve qual-ity of care for migraineurs.

40|$|Fifty six {{neonatal}} Holstein calves (22 {{male and}} 34 female) were fed calf starters and post weaning diets containing 35 and 21. 90 % Popped (PW), steam flaked (SFW), dry-rolled (DRW) or ground (GW) to 12 weeks of age. Particle size distribution of processed wheat grains, skeletal growth <b>measures,</b> <b>starter</b> digestibility, starter intake, health status, and blood metabolites of neonatal calves were assessed in weeks 4, 8 and 12 to assess rumen development {{and find the}} optimum method of wheat processing for calves. The experiment started when calves were 3 ± 1 d old and studied for 90 days. Calves were weaned {{at the end of}} 9 th week and a post weaning specific starter diets were fed for one month. PW and SFW dramatically decreased fine particles in comparison to GW or DRW. PW had the most proportion of larger particles (93. 52 % > 3. 38 mm) where GW had the finest texture (70. 71 % < 2 mm). Health status parameters of calves did not affected by treatments, but respiratory index was affected by time. Skeletal growth measures including body length, body barrel, wither height and hip width did not affected by treatments, but these measures progressed by age. Calves received PW had the highest body weight and daily gain, but feed; gain ratio was not affected by treatments. These parameters were also affected by age. Although, calves received DRW had the lowest starter intake, but the highest digestibility coefficients for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, NDF and energy. This higher digestibility was attributed to lower starter intake resulted in probably higher rumen retention time and thus the most rumen degradation of nutrients. Calves received PW, had the highest serum glucose, BHBA and insulin concentrations which may indicate that PW could cause a better rumen development and performance in comparison with other types of processed wheat...|$|R
40|$|A large social-housing sector, a large {{owner-occupier}} {{sector and}} a very small private rental housing sector. This phenomenon has already occurred in the Netherlands since WWII. The Netherlands have known times in which the LTV ratio of mortgages reached a height of 120 %, {{with the result that}} many residences nowadays have a lower market value than the value of their mortgage. Recently, the Financial Stability committee presented a report as advisory body of the Dutch Government in which they advocate for a step-by-step reduction of the mortgage limit to a maximum of 90 %. This should prevent significant residual debts from home-owners in times of a new crisis in the housing market. Due to this <b>measure,</b> <b>starters</b> will have to save for an additional three years on average before they are eligible for a mortgage. In the meantime {{they should be able to}} accommodate themselves in the private rental housing sector. The expected development of the private rental housing demand is between 80 % - 200 % and with the limitations of the maximum mortgage this demand relates to an increase of 90. 000 - 190. 000 dwellings. Investors have still not substantially invested in the private rental housing sector. What keeps them from investing in this particular housing sector? To which extent does the rent regulation play an inhibitory role? This research is focussing on adjustments within the rent regulation, which leads us to the following research question: How can adjustments within the rent regulation contribute to increase the private rental housing supply for low moderate income households? Research has shown that there are differences in effects from rent regulation on large investors and small/local investors and that there are different effects in regions with a high market pressure or a low market pressure. The Dutch housing market lends itself for attracting more small and local private investors with (temporary) laws and regulations following the examples from England (Buy to Let), France (Tax benefits) and Germany (Subsidies).

40|$|Tanya GressleyThis study {{compared}} {{conventional and}} accelerated milk replacer feeding regimens on growth, respiratory and digestive health, vaccination response, and neutrophil mRNA levels. Holstein calves (10 male and 5 female) {{were randomly assigned}} to a 10 -week study on their second day of life. Treatments were control (CON; n = 8) and accelerated (ACC; n = 7) milk replacer feeding programs. CON calves were fed a 20 % crude protein (CP) and 20 % fat milk replacer (Advance Calvita Supreme; Milk Specialities Global, Carpentersville, IL) at 1. 25 % birth body weight daily from weeks 1 through 6 of life and 0. 625 % birth body weight daily during week 7. A 28. 5 % CP and 15 % fat milk replacer (Advance Excelerate; Milk Specialities Global, Carpentersville, IL) was fed to ACC calves at 1. 5 % birth body weight daily during week 1, 2 % current body weight daily from weeks 2 through 6, and 1 % current body weight daily during week 7. All calves were given milk replacer twice daily during weeks 1 though 6, once daily during week 7, and were completely weaned during week 8. Calf <b>starter</b> intake was <b>measured</b> daily through week 8. Body weight and wither height were measured weekly. Fecal scores (1 = firm to 4 = liquid) and respiratory scores (1 = normal; 2 = abnormal) were recorded twice daily. Neutrophils were isolated from blood at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8. Quantitative PCR was used to measure neutrophil mRNA levels of 9 functionality genes: L-selectin, BPI, IL- 1 R 1, TNF-??R, TLR- 2, TLR- 4, SOD 1, MPO, and NCF 1. Adaptive immune function was measured by vaccinating calves against ovalbumin at weeks 1, 3, and 5 and measuring serum anti-ovalbumin IgG concentration at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8. There was no treatment effect on wither height, respiratory score, or serum anti-ovalbumin IgG concentration. Body weight during weeks 4 through 10 was greater for ACC than CON calves (P < 0. 01). Calf starter intake was greater for CON than ACC calves during weeks 4 through 7 (P < 0. 01), with no difference during week 8. CON calves had firmer feces than ACC calves (fecal score 1. 4 vs. 1. 7, P = 0. 02). Neutrophil Lselectin mRNA levels were 51 % greater in ACC than CON calves (P = 0. 03). Feeding calves a 28. 5 % CP and 15 % fat milk replacer in an accelerated feeding regimen increased growth and may enhance innate immune function, as indicated by the increased neutrophil mRNA levels of L-selectin.

[...] School of Dentistry and Henry W. Bloch School of Management. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2013 Lack {{of access to}} oral {{health care is a}} growing problem for low income children in the United States. One proposed solution to this problem is utilizing dental hygienists to the full extent of their education and training. In 2003, Kansas altered the dental hygiene scope of practice and supervision regulations through the creation of the extended care permit (ECP) dental hygienist. In 2008, a school-based oral health intervention, that utilized ECP dental hygienists to provide preventive oral health care and referrals, was established in a Midwestern city suburb. The purpose of this case study was to assess the quality of oral health care provided by ECP dental hygienists. The central hypothesis of this investigation was ECP dental hygienists provide quality oral health care that improves the oral health of underserved children in a school-based setting. Using a case-study design, electronic medical records of children (n= 986) who participated in the intervention were mined for data. Numerators and denominators from the Dental Quality Alliance Concept Set provided the framework for measurement. Patient-oriented outcomes were examined in a multi-encounter cohort (n= 295) using MANOVA and Kruskal Wallace. Results revealed 26. 3 % of the children eligible to participate in the intervention chose to do so. On average 96. 6 % of the children were provided a minimum of one topical fluoride application and 34. 0 % had at least one sealant placed. Nearly half (48. 7 %) of the program participants had two or more topical fluoride applications. On average 52. 8 % of the children had sealants placed. The number of encounters with ECP dental hygienists had a statistically significant effect on changes in decay (p= 0. 014), changes in restorations (p= 0. 002) and changes in treatment urgency (p= 0. 022). A statistically significant effect of the number of fluoride applications on changes in restorations (p. 0. 031) was also present. These results suggests ECP dental hygienists can provide access to and the provision of timely and appropriate quality oral health care for low income children in a school-based setting and oral health care provided by ECP dental hygienists can improve the oral health status of low income children who lack access to oral health care.
