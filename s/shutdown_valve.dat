It {{will be used as}} an internal engine of operator training targeting at pressure-regulating stations. The developed model was designed to take correct and prompt measures depending on the process upsets and accident scenarios via object linking and embedding (OLE). A representative scenario of ‘Hole & Release’ is studied as follows. When the instructor starts the scenario, the second pressure begins to rise due to a main valve malfunction. When it keeps rising with total failure of safety devices and reaches 202.6  kPa, gas release occurs near a pressure recorder via a hole of 10  mm diameter. The trainee who noticed this accident should shut off the emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>valve</b> manually. When this procedure is properly done, the training scenario terminates and the simulation results with respect to the lead time to take actions are used to rate the performance of the trainee. The model could be applied to a more complex process such as a petrochemical plant in the future, and higher effectiveness of training is expected as the operating procedure becomes more complex.|$|E
40|$|Fluid transients, {{also known}} as water hammer, can have a {{significant}} impact on the design and operation of both spacecraft and launch vehicle propulsion systems. These transients often occur at system activation and shutdown. The pressure rise due to sudden opening and closing of valves of propulsion feed lines can cause serious damage during activation and shutdown of propulsion systems. During activation (valve opening) and <b>shutdown</b> (<b>valve</b> closing), pressure surges must be predicted accurately to ensure structural integrity of the propulsion system fluid network. In the current work, a network flow simulation software (Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program) based on Finite Volume Method has been used to predict the pressure surges in the feed line due to both valve closing and valve opening using two separate geometrical configurations. The valve opening pressure surge results are compared with experimental data available in the literature and the numerical results compared very well within reasonable accuracy (< 5 %) for a wide range of inlet-to-initial pressure ratios. A Fast Fourier Transform is preformed on the pressure oscillations to predict the various modal frequencies of the pressure wave. The shutdown problem, i. e. valve closing problem, the simulation results are compared with the results of Method of Characteristics. Most rocket engines experience a longitudinal acceleration, known as "pogo" during the later stage of engine burn.

40|$|Safety {{instrumented}} systems (SISs) are {{of prime}} {{importance to the}} process industry to avoid catastrophic consequences or even loss of human life. The dangerous situations that any equipment may face should be analysed in order to quantify the associated risk and to choose a design of the SIS that reduces the risk to a tolerable level. The safe failure fraction (SFF) is a parameter defined in the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 61511, and is {{used to determine the}} need for additional channels that can activate the safety function if a failure is present. The standards consider a high SFF as an indicator of a safe design, and by increasing SFF, one may allow a lower redundancy level for a SIS and therefore reduce costs. Safety engineers discuss the suitability of this parameter, and some argue that the negative effects of safe failures on the reliability are so significant that the parameter should not be used. For a safety <b>shutdown</b> <b>valve</b> installed to prevent overpressure, a safe failure is defined as a spurious closure where the source of high pressure is isolated. This thesis examines the effects of safe failures on the reliability of such systems by using a Markov model. According to IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 the system reliability of a safety shutdown system is measured by the probability of failure on demand (PFD). From the results it can be concluded that the time needed to restore the system back to initial state after a safe failure does not {{have a significant effect on}} PFD. A long restoration time after a safe failure in combination with a high frequency of safe failures is negative with respect to production downtime. The main contributor to PFD is the long run probability of being in a state where a dangerous undetected (DU) failure is present. DU failures are normally detected by function tests or sometimes upon demand, but they can also be revealed by a spurious closure. This effect is based on the assumption of perfect repair of safe failures, which means that all possible failure modes are detected and the failed items are repaired or replaced after restoration of safe failures. The ability to reveal DU failures is clearly dependent on the frequency of a DU failure and safe failure occurring in the same test interval. This thesis demonstrates that safe failures only have significant effect when the dangerous failure rate is high. Other parameters affect the PFD to a greater extent, and the importance of exact parameter estimation is crucial and more important than the positive effects of safe failures. The SFF must be close to 100 % to have a significant effect on the PFD, and since it is always aimed at minimising the number of dangerous failures, the alternative is to add safe failures. This is probably not the intent of SFF and is negative with respect to production downtime. Safe failures does not justify a lower degree of redundancy. On the other hand, the positive effects of safe failures show a satisfactory reason for adopting a longer test interval. This is an optimisation of PFD and can reduce costs or even the frequency of dangerous situations during start-up and shutdown. This thesis demonstrates that the PFD is not affected by safe failures, and indicates no reason to be in doubt about this parameter as a measure of reliability. The SFF gives hardly any information and the choice of SIS architecture should not be based on SFF alone. An alternative parameter that considers different means of revealing DU failures seems to be a better choice. </p...|$|E

ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving.

40|$|Partial stroke testing (PST) is a {{technique}} that is regularly practiced in oil and gas industries to test the emergency <b>shutdown</b> (ESD) <b>valve</b> by closing {{a certain percentage of}} the valve position and stop any flow through the pipeline. Generally, it only functions when there is an emergency occurring in the production system. When the ESD valve remains in one position for a long period, there is a risk and potential of fail on demand which is, the ESD valve fail to operate during the emergency shutdown. This testing can reveal approximately 75 of unrevealed failures in valves. It can also provide predictive maintenance data that can contribute to the extension of the preventive maintenance for the ESD valve. The objectives of this paper are to design, simulate, build and test the performance of the automated PST system based on PLC. Four guidelines and methodology are used in this work.

40|$|Large water {{distribution}} networks greatly benefit from topological changes {{brought by the}} construction of loops. In fact, besides the reduction of pumping power, adding loops can smooth the overall effects of random malfunctions, making existing networks intrinsically robust.

40|$|Summary and Conclusion Emergency <b>Shutdown</b> (ESD) <b>valves</b> and High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) valves are final {{elements}} in Safety Instrumented Systems. Proof or functional testing are performed at specific intervals {{in order to}} ensure the valves’ function. For these type of valves, such tests may require costly shutdowns. For a final element, like a valve, the interval between proof tests are by performance based standards like IEC 61505 / 61511, related to the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) for the element’s complete function. Partial Stroke Testing (PST) can reduce the time between such tests. PST is performed by allowing the valve to start closing, and to start reopening before the process is interrupted. By performing a partial test at a shorter interval, a fraction of the dangerous undetected failures, the PST coverage, are tested more often. This will reduce the PFD and imply that the proof test interval can be extended, still achieving the same Safety Integrity Level (SIL). Three systems for PST have been evaluated: The Emerson FieldVue DVC 6000 SIS, the Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring and the Crane ValveWatch II. ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring provides leak testing in open and closed position, respectively. Leak testing on an open valve is treated as a partial test and is included in the PST coverage. FieldVue can not be used on hydraulic operated valves. Three ESD valves and one HIPPS valve on the Kollsnes gas processing plant have been analyzed. Two systems have been evaluated for each valve. A Failure Mode, E. ects and Diagnostic Analysis has been performed on the tested parts of each valve’s complete function. Based on this analysis, the PST coverage and increased test intervals are calculated. The PST coverage found for the hydraulic operated ESD gate valves are 66 % and 74 % for ValveWatch and Smart Valve Monitoring, respectively. For the pneumatic operated ESD ball valve, a PST coverage of 21 % has been found for FieldVue and 56 % for Smart Valve Monitoring. The calculated intervals between functional tests to achive a SIL 2 rating, are between 0, 54 and 0, 89 years for these ESD valves. SIL 2 corresponds to a PFD < 10 - 2. For the ESD valves, new control circuits with lower failure rates should be designed in order to improve the results. Today’s one year proof test interval on ESD valves seems not to be in accordance with the standard used in this project, i. e to achieve SIL 2 the proof test interval should be reduced. A PST coverage of 100 % and 0 % has been found on the HIPPS solenoid valve for Smart Valve Monitoring and FieldVue, respectively. The PST coverage for the valve and actuator is 53 % for both systems. Based on an inital annual test interval for the overall pressure protection system, is PST, by the system with best coverage, roughly estimated to increase the test interval by 76 %. The results are highly dependent on the choices and assumptions made in this project. A closer study of experience data could have increased the quality of the analysis. Such data is not found easily available. The results are assumed to be relatively conservative. Deeper involvement of professionals with operational experience from relevant areas would probably also have improved the quality. The Drallim Smart Valve Monitoring has achieved the best results in this analysis. ValveWatch and FieldVue would improve their PST coverage if ESD solenoids were tested. They are also able to monitor actual shutdowns and may contribute to document a shutdown as proof test. These systems also make more measurements and may be better suited for predictive maintenance purposes. ValveWatch has achieved the highest PST coverage for a valve separately, because of its leak test. All the evaluated systems will give increased knowledge about the valve’s condition, and thereby improve safety. The PFD will be substantially reduced. Future needs at Kollsnes should be analyzed further, and an eventual installation of such systems should be done according to these needs. </p...|$|R
