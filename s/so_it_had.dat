5|$|On September 29, 1944, Zinn {{received}} an urgent call from Samuel Allison, {{the director of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory. The B Reactor at Hanford had shut down shortly after reaching full power, only to come back to life again some hours later. Norman Hilberry suspected a neutron poison was responsible. If <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a half life of around 9.7 hours. Xenon-135 had a half life close to that, but had not been detected in Argonne or by the X-10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Zinn quickly brought Chicago Pile-3 up to full power, and within twelve hours, had made a series of measurements that confirmed the Hanford results.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, {{was unable to}} determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release.|$|E

25|$|The design {{principles}} {{developed for}} the AGC by MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, directed in late 1960s by Charles Draper, became foundational to software engineering—particularly {{for the design of}} more reliable systems that relied on asynchronous software, priority scheduling, testing, and human-in-the-loop decision capability. When the design requirements for the AGC were defined, necessary software and programming techniques did not exist <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be designed from scratch.|$|E

President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|The Tiverton line {{joined the}} D at Morebath Junction but its trains {{continued}} to Dulverton, the next station towards Barnstaple. A small, unstaffed station was {{opened at the}} junction on 1 December 1928. Trains on both lines called there, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a more frequent service than at Morebath station, and the halt was much nearer the village, but could be reached only by an often muddy footpath across fields.|$|E

25|$|The RWD 7 was {{constructed}} by the RWD team of Stanisław Rogalski, Stanisław Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in Warsaw. It was based upon their earlier designs, especially the RWD 2 and RWD 4. The RWD 7 {{was meant to be}} a record-beating plane, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a more powerful engine, while its mass was reduced. From its predecessors, it took the same fish-shaped fuselage without a direct view towards forward from the pilot's seat.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinctive}} structure {{became a}} Harvard Square landmark. In the late 1970s, the MBTA began planning {{an extension of}} the Cambridge Subway – by then known as the Red Line – further north in Cambridge, which involved completely rebuilding Harvard station. The original subway entrance structure was already overcrowded during peak hours and clearly could not handled the anticipated pedestrian flow of an expanded station, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be completely replaced for fundamental functional reasons.|$|E
25|$|The empire {{lacked the}} resources, {{and perhaps the}} will, to {{reconstruct}} the professional mobile army destroyed at Adrianople, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to rely on barbarian armies to fight for it. The Eastern Roman Empire succeeded in buying off the Goths with tribute. The Western Roman Empire proved less fortunate. Stilicho, the western empire's half-Vandal military commander, stripped the Rhine frontier of troops to fend off invasions of Italy by the Visigoths in 402–03 and by other Goths in 406–07.|$|E

After the war, in the West Bank, the group's activity was mainly social and religious, not political, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> relatively good relations with Jordan during the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank. In contrast, the group frequently clashed with the Egyptian government that controlled the Gaza Strip until 1967.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} decades, the Asturian {{dominion}} over the {{different areas of}} the kingdom was still lax and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelayo's daughter, was married to Alfonso, Dux Peter of Cantabria's son. Alphonse's son Fruela married Munia, a Basque princess from Alava, while his daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.|$|E

25|$|The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), {{a public}} {{authority}} presided by New York City, {{was created in}} 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations from the city, and placed under control of the state-level Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 1968. Soon after the MTA {{took control of the}} subway, New York City entered a fiscal crisis. It closed many elevated subway lines that became too expensive to maintain. Graffiti and crime became common, and equipment and stations fell into decrepit condition. The New York City Subway tried to stay solvent, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to make many service cutbacks and defer necessary maintenance projects. In the 1980s an $18 billion financing program for the rehabilitation of the subway began.|$|E
25|$|During the Austrian {{occupation}} of northern Serbia 1717-39, several hospitals {{were established in}} Belgrade. The City hospital of Saint John was built within the fortress walls, but its exact location is not known. Emperor Charles VI signed the Belgrade City Statute in 1724 ("Proclamation on organizing German Belgrade"), which mentions city hospital, city pharmacy, medics and midwives. The German municipality had low incomes <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to ask the state for help and beneficence. The hospital is mentioned in the 1728 Census. It was a hospital already in 1719, later becoming the residence of Thomas Berger, {{the head of the}} hospital. After his death, his daughter continued to reside in the building. The hospital (Stattspital) was moved to another location, into the newly constructed building in 1724. A small church was built next to it. This new hospital was quite small, with only 2 rooms, a kitchen and a basement, so it way not be the same city hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon was}} moved long {{distances}} via rail on {{a variant of}} a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground by lowering the suspension on its continuous track units' roadwheels on each side to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Gerät proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. It could only be loaded at zero elevation, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be re-aimed between every shot.|$|E

25|$|Aperiodic tilings were {{considered}} as mathematical artefacts until 1984, when physicist Dan Shechtman announced {{the discovery of}} a phase of an aluminium-manganese alloy which produced a sharp diffractogram with an unambiguous fivefold symmetry – <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be a crystalline substance with icosahedral symmetry. In 1975 Robert Ammann had already extended the Penrose construction to a three-dimensional icosahedral equivalent. In such cases the term 'tiling' is taken to mean 'filling the space'. Photonic devices are currently built as aperiodical sequences of different layers, being thus aperiodic in one direction and periodic in the other two. Quasicrystal structures of Cd-Te appear to consist of atomic layers in which the atoms are arranged in a planar aperiodic pattern. Sometimes an energetical minimum or a maximum of entropy occur for such aperiodic structures. Steinhardt has shown that Gummelt's overlapping decagons allow the application of an extremal principle and thus provide the link between the mathematics of aperiodic tiling and the structure of quasicrystals. Faraday waves have been observed to form large patches of aperiodic patterns. The physics of this discovery has revived the interest in incommensurate structures and frequencies suggesting to link aperiodic tilings with interference phenomena.|$|E
