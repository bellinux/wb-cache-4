5|$|Phenomena {{associated}} with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which {{are similar to}} <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a swimming pool. They only occur just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source.|$|E
5|$|High-altitude clouds on Neptune {{have been}} {{observed}} casting <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150km and lie about 50–110km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere. Unlike Uranus, Neptune's composition has a higher volume of ocean, whereas Uranus has a smaller mantle.|$|E

5|$|On the Reinanzaka House, the labourers were {{skilled in}} the use of wood, and helped Raymond engrain the texture of cedar onto the concrete. This was further {{explored}} on the Tetsuma Akaboshi and the Morinosuke Kawasaki houses, where the concrete walls of the luxurious interiors were imprinted with cypress textures. On the Karuizawa Studio, workmen polished the concrete with sand and straw to reveal the texture of the aggregate. Whilst at Nanzan University, the south facing facades were cast with checkerboard patterns, with applied metalwork casting abstract <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|E
5|$|In Cú Chulainn's youth {{he is so}} {{beautiful}} the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of <b>Shadows)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E

25|$|Hamner and Dawson {{proposed}} that the difference is caused by evolutionary change driven by the jellyfish-eating anemones (Entacmaea medusivora) that inhabit the eastern regions of Jellyfish Lake and Clear Lake. The jellyfish instinctively avoid shadows {{and in the morning}} with the <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern end the jellyfish also avoid the anemones. By moving east to west in the early afternoon the jellyfish avoid the time of day when the setting sun would eliminate <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake in the eastern end and thereby avoid the anemones in the afternoon.|$|E

25|$|The {{form of this}} {{sculpture}} {{appears to}} be harmoniously symmetrical at first glance. However, on further scrutiny, {{it is clear that}} the shape of the sculpture is deeply organic, revealing a varied contour of curves and edges.

25|$|<b>Shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon are {{complicated}} by reflected light, uneven ground, wide-angle lens distortion, and lunar dust. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon's surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted. Furthermore, shadows display {{the properties of}} vanishing point perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. From floor to ceiling expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interior.|$|E

25|$|Antonello da Messina painted mostly small meticulous {{portraits in}} glowing colours. But {{one of his}} most famous works also {{demonstrates}} his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. This is the small painting of St. Jerome in His Study, in which the composition is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tiled floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural light and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited Piero della Francesca. Antonello's work influenced both Gentile Bellini, who did a series of paintings of Miracles of Venice for the Scuola di Santa Croce, and his more famous brother, Giovanni, {{one of the most significant}} painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Ladyshore were intimately connected with the Fletcher family and their ties to local politics. The colliery was founded by Thomas Fletcher Senior, under the name Thomas Fletcher & Sons. Thomas Sr (1805–1893) {{was chairman of the}} Little Lever Local Board (effectively the town council) from 1872 until 1879. He had a brother John who, whilst part of the colliery business, kept in the <b>shadows.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> death of Thomas Sr, Thomas Junior took over the mines with his brother Matthew. Thomas Jr became the Mayor of Bolton in 1884 and remained in office until 1887. Thomas' brother Matthew kept out of direct control of the colliery but maintained the family links to politics by becoming the Chairman of the Little Lever Local Board (1893–1894) and then Chairman of the Little Lever Urban District Council in 1895. Thomas Sr died leaving £163,000, which was, in those days, a substantial sum of money. The activities of Thomas Sr and Thomas Jr meant that they could not devote all their time to the colliery, so John's son Herbert Fletcher (1842–1895), also a member of Bolton town council, took control of the colliery and was named as the owner in the infamous court case over safety lamps. Herbert {{died of a heart attack}} at the colliery on 16 September 1895. Despite owning a coal mine, Herbert was active in the area of preventing smoke pollution and published several papers on smoke control, his most read being in the Journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health.|$|E

Each walker is put through [...] "zombie school" [...] and is taught how to move like zombies. There are three levels of zombie makeup: Hero, Midground, and Deep Background. Hero zombies are featured walkers and are completely made over from head to toe. Midground zombies get highlights and <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face, but do not {{get close enough to}} the camera to require full makeup.

500|$|However, Phaeacius can adopt other, {{more active}} approaches, with {{different}} gaits for each. If an insect remains almost stationary while Phaeacius {{is in the}} flattened pose and facing the insect, the spider may step slowly forward to its prey, rocking and keeping its flattened pose. To rock, Phaeacius moves about half a body length forward then, without pausing, smoothly back almost to the previous position. It performs about 10cycles of those movements, progressing by [...] per cycle, and then rests. This rocking motion may disguise Phaeacius as <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree trunk. The insect occasionally keeps stationary until Phaeacius reaches within about half a body length and then lunges.|$|E
500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton {{were just beginning to}} describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E
500|$|In 1796, {{the plain}} {{on both sides}} of the river, some [...] wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, {{especially}} on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark <b>shadows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries meandered in rivulets through the flood plain to the river. The river itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the 21st century; engineers [...] "corrected" [...] (straightened) the passage from Basel to Iffezheim between 1817 and 1875. Between 1927 and 1975, engineers constructed a canal to control the water level. In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places four or more times wider than in the twenty-first century, even under regular (non-flood stage) conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged during floods. It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and Hüningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.|$|E
