5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> obey Agrippa.|$|E

As a result, the French army moved from Korçë on June 15, 1920. After the French army left Korçë, the fate of the territory that it administered was decided by the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E

After burning his personal mementos, Kelvin departs Earth to meet the Solaris scientists who have made reports that are equally confusing.|$|E

5|$|The Joint Commission was tasked {{to report}} on the {{implementation}} of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make recommendations {{from time to time to}} the president, the Treasury Secretary, and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include technological advances, the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as may be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word.

The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English {{because that was the}} language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E

By February 1983, consulting engineers Mott Hay and Anderson had submitted a recommendation to complete the M3 through Twyford Down. Following the completion of the motorway to Bar End in the summer of 1985, the junction at Hockley was the only set of traffic lights between London and Southampton.|$|E

Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When it became clear to both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E
5|$|With few modern tanks at {{the time}} of the Korean War, the Australian Army had to rely on British and US tank support. During the 1950s the Army {{standardised}} on the British Centurion tank, which saw action in Vietnam and remained in service until it was replaced with the German Leopard 1 in the mid-1970s. After an internal debate on whether the Army <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> operate tanks as part of its force structure, the Australian Government replaced the Leopards with a small fleet of American M1A1 Abrams tanks in 2007, which are now the Army's only tanks. In addition to these types, the Army has operated small numbers of other tank designs for training and evaluation purposes.|$|E

5|$|HMAS Waller, {{the third}} of the RAN's Collins-class {{submarines}} to enter service, was commissioned on 10July 1999. The attendees included John Waller, Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS Perth. On 13March 2010, a memorial to Waller was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, {{he was one of}} thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and two soldiers, including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrick—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the Victoria Cross for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name Waller (among others) <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, despite {{evolving}} {{trends in}} Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused {{to change their}} approach, insisting their students <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> paint in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism. Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, to paint the local fishermen. He became {{a friend of the}} Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.|$|E
5|$|Soon, however, Saladin's sons squabbled {{over the}} {{division}} of the empire. Saladin had appointed al-Afdal to the governorship of Damascus with the intention that his son <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> see the city as his principal place of residence in order to emphasize the primacy of the jihad (holy struggle) against the Crusader states. Al-Afdal, however, found that his attachment to Damascus contributed to his undoing. Several of his father's subordinate emirs left the city for Cairo to lobby Uthman to oust him on claims he was inexperienced and intended to oust the Ayyubid old guard. Al-Adil further encouraged Uthman to act in order prevent al-Afdal's incompetence putting the Ayyubid empire in jeopardy. Thus, in 1194, Uthman openly demanded the sultanate. Uthman's claim to the throne was settled in a series of assaults on Damascus in 1196, forcing al-Afdal to leave for a lesser post at Salkhad. Al-Adil established himself in Damascus as a lieutenant of Uthman, but wielded great influence within the empire.|$|E

5|$|Winkelman acted both in his {{capacity}} of commander of the Dutch Army and of highest executive power of the homeland. This created a somewhat ambiguous situation. On the morning of 14 May {{the commander of the}} Royal Dutch Navy, Vice-Admiral Johannes Furstner, had left the country to continue the fight; Dutch naval vessels were generally not included in the surrender. Eight ships and four unfinished hulks had already departed, some smaller vessels were sunk off, and nine others sailed for England in the evening of 14 May. The Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau was sunk by German bombers while crossing. The commander of the main Dutch naval port of Den Helder, Rear-Admiral Hoyte Jolles, concluded that his base, with a naval garrison of 10,000, its own air service, and extensive land defences, <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> resist also. Only with some difficulty did Winkelman convince him to obey the surrender order. Large parts of the Dutch Army were also reluctant to believe or accept the surrender, especially those units that hardly had seen any fighting, such as 3rd and 4th Army Corps and Brigade A.|$|E
