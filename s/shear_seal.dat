50|$|Blind shear rams (also {{known as}} <b>shear</b> <b>seal</b> rams, or sealing shear rams) are {{intended}} to seal a wellbore, even when the bore is occupied by a drill string, by cutting through the drill string as the rams close off the well. The upper portion of the severed drill string is freed from the ram, while the lower portion may be crimped and the “fish tail” captured to hang the drill string off the BOP.|$|E
30|$|Different {{preventer}} configurations provide {{different levels}} of performance for subsea BOP systems. Specifically, a blind shear ram preventer, which is regarded as an emergency device, is used to shear the pipe and seal the well. As shown in Fig.  1, the typical subsea BOP is equipped with two annular preventers and four or five ram preventers, including two blind shear rams {{and two or three}} pipe rams. The configuration of the stack is dependent on the expected operations, redundancy, flexibility and the trade-off between {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each configuration (Januarilham 2012). Besides the annular preventers, ram preventers, connectors and other components such as the flexible joint, choke/kill valves and choke/kill lines are integrated to form the whole subsea BOP stack (Cai et al. 2012). There are several types of rams which have different tasks in addition to sealing the well. One may be designed to grip and hold equipment lowered into the well, while others are designed to cut equipment and pipes which are blocking the ram. The latter is the <b>shear</b> <b>seal</b> ram (Østby 2008). The subsea BOP stack is usually equipped with two hydraulic connectors, the LMRP connector and the wellhead connector. The LMRP contains the control system of the BOP and one or two annular preventers, depending on the BOP configuration. The LMRP connector enables retrieval of the control system, and the annular preventer enables maintenance without the necessity of removing the whole BOP stack, therefore saving time and making it safer, besides being used to connect the LMRP to the BOP stack. The wellhead connector is used to connect the BOP stack to the wellhead (Cai et al. 2012).|$|E

40|$|A {{miniature}} capacitive {{force sensor}} for {{the measurement of}} shear- and normal force at the fingertip is designed and realized. The sensor has a circular design with a corrugated silicon ring around the force sensitive area. This ring provides the spring constant in <b>shear</b> direction and <b>seals</b> {{the interior of the}} sensor. Thin silicon pillars inside the sensitive area provide in-plane guidance for shear force measurement and provide the spring constant in normal direction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Shear {{strength}} tests are {{conducted in a}} model of a water well on four, commercially available, granular bentonite well sealing products. The time depen-dency of annulus <b>seal</b> <b>shear</b> strength and resistance to piping is examined. Dry bentonite samples are placed through water in the annular space between the casing and borehole and allowed to set for a specified time. Pressure is applied at a con-stant rate to one end of the clay <b>seal</b> until <b>shear</b> or piping failure occurs. Pressure and seal displacement data are recorded on a digital data acquisition system. An-nulus seal strength and resistance to piping increase with setting time. Ultimate shear strength is reached in 72 to 120 hours after placement. Differences between this laboratory scale study and field scale applications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} two electrosurgical vessel-sealing devices in biliary surgery. MethodsPorcine common bile ducts (CBDs) were sealed with two electrosurgical devices, an electrothermal bipolar vessel-sealing device (EBVS) and ultrasonic coagulation shears. Acute study animals underwent surgical bile duct sealing followed by immediate burst pressure testing. Chronic study animals were maintained for 1 week postoperatively and then tested. ResultsThe seal failure rate in the acute study was 50 % for both the EBVS device and shears, and 0 % for the laparoscopic surgical clip device used as a control. The latter had significantly higher burst pressures (646. 2 ± 281. 8 mmHg; P= 0. 006) than the EBVS device (97. 6 ± 86. 6 mmHg) and shears (71. 7 ± 89. 3 mmHg). No significant difference in burst pressures was noted between the EBVS device and shears (97. 6 ± 86. 6 mmHg vs. 71. 7 ± 89. 3 mmHg). In the chronic study, obvious bile leaks occurred in one of four pigs (25 %) in the EBVS device subgroup and two of four pigs (50 %) in the shears subgroup. The average proximal CBD pressure in seven pigs was 16. 1 ± 4. 1 mmHg. The average chronic burst pressure in the control subgroup was 1088. 0 ± 922. 6 mmHg. ConclusionsGiven the high rates of failure of the EBVS device and the <b>shears</b> in consistently <b>sealing</b> biliary ducts, we do not recommend their routine use in biliary surgery...|$|R
40|$|Wafer-level vacuum {{packaging}} is vital in the fabrication of many microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and enables significant cost reduction in high-volume MEMS production. In this paper, we propose a low-temperature wafer-level {{vacuum packaging}} method based on plastic deformation and low-temperature welding of copper sealing rings {{with a small}} footprint. A device wafer with copper ring structures and a cap wafer with corresponding metalized grooves are placed inside a vacuum chamber and pressed together at a temperature of 250 ̊C, resulting in low-temperature welding of the copper, and thus, hermetic sealing of the cavities enclosed by the sealing rings. The vacuum pressure inside the fabricated cavities 146 days after bonding was measured using residual gas analysis to be as low as 2. 6 × 10 - 2  mbar. Based on this value, the leak rate is calculated to be smaller than 3. 6 × 10 - 16  mbarL/s using the most conservative assumptions, demonstrating the excellent hermeticity of the <b>seals.</b> <b>Shear</b> testing was used {{to demonstrate that the}} seals are mechanically stable with over 90 MPa in shear strength for 5. 2 μm-high Cu sealing rings with widths down to 8 μm. The reported method is potentially compatible with complementary metaloxide-semiconductor (CMOS) substrates and may be applied to vacuum packaging of 3 -D heterogeneously integrated MEMS on state-of-the-art CMOS substrates.

40|$|Human factors (HFs) are {{important}} factors to the Macondo well blowout, but traditional risk assessment has not addressed them. Some common methodologies for offshore drilling risk assessment are fault tree, event tree and Bow-tie analysis, which are static structure and cannot consider common causes or conditional dependent factors. The Hybrid Causal Logic (HCL) {{model is a}} multi-layered, dynamic ever green model that can incorporate human factors. The HCL model enables the prediction of the probability of human errors and explains the reasons of human errors occurrence. This research applied the HCL model to offshore blowout risk assessment by using swabbing induced kick as a case study. The contribution of human factors to accidents in offshore industry has been identified based on literature review. They were categorized as individual factors, group factors and organization factors. The sub-heading human factors was considered as influencing factors in the HCL model. In the HCL model, an event tree was developed to display the links between kick and blowout. The safety barriers were identified as kick detection, kick control and shear ram. Basic events that could contribute to kick scenario, failure of kick detection, kick control and <b>shear</b> ram to <b>seal</b> the well were developed in fault trees. Then, the fault trees and event tree were mapped into Bayesian networks (BN). The human factors that could contribute to causal events in fault trees were also linked with BN. Objected-oriented BN was applied to link the fault trees models into a higher-level model with input and output nodes. This higher-level model was able to evaluate the impact of different HFs? levels on the probability of kick and blowout. The most influencing factors could also be tracked in this model for risk control and mitigation. Based on the assumptions and structure of this model, competence, pressure, communication and management were identified as the most influencing factors for blowout escalating by swabbing induced kick. The blowout probability could be decreased four times if the competence level of an operator was increased from a low level to a high level...|$|R
