40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} densification of aggregates within a suspension on thickener dewatering performance. The comparisons of the maximum permitted underflow solids flux calculated from both an initial undensified thickener and a densified thickener were achieved. Large underflow solids fluxes were attained in densified thickeners. The effects of densification on the bed heights and on the solids residence times required to achieve a given underflow solids flux and a given underflow <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction were also computed and compared. Substantial reductions in the bed heights and the solids residence times are possible in densified cases. Previous studies have assumed the functional form of the compressive yield stress in the suspension so as to give an exceedingly weak gel in the neighbourhood of the <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction {{at the top of}} the bed. The implications of considering a different gel rheology with a rather stronger gel were considered. The effects of this new rheology lead to a slightly less sharp spatial gradient in the <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction near the top of the bed. In addition, the effect of varying the underflow <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction was considered. The observations of substantial increases in underflow solids fluxes and substantial reductions in bed heights and solids residence times were only achieved when the underflow <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction was less than or comparable with the <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction within the aggregates. However, if the underflow <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction was considerably larger, aggregates were considered to be overlapping and interpenetrating. As a result, the improvements in thickener performance due to densification were insignificant...|$|R

40|$|A one {{dimensional}} dewatering {{model for a}} thickener consistent with time-dependent densification of aggregates within a sludge suspension has been developed in this paper. The effects of different densification rate parameters and different underflow solids fluxes on the predictions of the sludge rheological properties and thickener performance have been explored. Pre-shearing of aggregates (which leads to the aggregates densifying to some extent before entering the thickener consolidating bed) must occur if a large underflow solids flux is required in a densified thickener. This increases the suspension gel point, and hence the <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction {{at the top of}} the bed. The <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction {{at the top of the}} bed will however be the initial undensified gel point in the case of a small underflow solids flux, where no pre-shearing of aggregates needs to occur. The effects of densification and/or pre-shearing on the sludge rheological properties and thickener performance have been predicted. For a densified thickener, an algorithm has been developed to determine the maximum permitted underflow solids flux, qmax, assuming any possible <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction at the top of the bed and the maximum underflow solids flux, qmu, constraining to the initial undensified gel point at the top of the bed. Regarding the aggregate densification rate parameter, as this parameter was increased, the sludge rheological properties evolved significantly during thickening and thickener performance was substantially enhanced. Moreover, the total solids residence time required to achieve the desired underflow <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction was significantly reduced both for a higher densification rate parameter and in the presence of pre-shearing in a densified thickener...|$|R

The system is composed of two arrays of electrodes, separated by an axial distance of 50 mm and each array contains eights electrodes mounted over the internal circumference of the pipe carrying the flow. Furthermore every electrode in each array can be selected to be either “excitation”, “measurement” or “earth”. Changing the electrode configuration leads to a change in the electric field, and hence in the region of the flow cross section which is interrogated. The local flow velocity in the interrogated region is obtained by cross correlation between the two electrode arrays. Additionally, the local <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction can be obtained from the mean mixture conductivity in the region under interrogation.

40|$|Multiphase flow is the {{simultaneous}} flow {{of two or}} more phases, in direct contact, and is important in the oil industry, e. g. in production wells, in sub-sea pipelines and during the drilling of wells. The behaviour of the flow will depend on the properties of the constituent phases, the flow velocities and volume fractions of the phases and the geometry of the system. In solids-in-liquid flows, measurement of the local <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction distribution and the local axial solids velocity distribution in the flow cross section is important for many reasons including health and safety and economic reasons, particularly in oil well drilling operations. However upward inclined solidsliquid flows which are frequently encountered during oil well drilling operations are not well understood. Inclined solids-liquid flows result in non- uniform profiles of the <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction and axial solids velocity in the flow cross- section. In order to measure the solids volumetric flow rate in these situations it is necessary to measure the distributions of the local <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction and the local axial solids velocity and then to integrate the product of these local properties in the flow cross section. This thesis describes the development of a non-intrusive Impedance Cross-Correlation (ICC) device to measure the local <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction distribution and the local solids axial solids velocity distribution in upward inclined solids-water flows in which these distributions are highly non-uniform. The ICC device comprises a non-conductive pipe section of 80 mm internal diameter fitted with two arrays of electrodes, denoted „array A‟ and „array B‟, separated by an axial distance of 50 mm. At each array, eight electrodes are equispaced over the internal circumference of the pipe. A control system consisting of a microcontroller and analogue switches is used such that, for arrays A and B, any of the eight electrodes can be configured as an "excitation electrode" (V+), a "virtual earth measurement electrode" (Ve) or an "earth electrode" (E) thus enabling the local mixture conductance in different regions of the flow cross-section to be measured and thereby allowing the local <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction in each region to be deduced. The conductance signals from arrays A and B are also cross-correlated to yield the local solids axial velocity in the regions of flow under interrogation. A number of experiments were carried out in solids-in-water flows in a flow loop with an 80 mm inner diameter, 1. 68 m long Perspex test section which was inclined at three different inclination angle to the vertical (o 0, o 15 and o 30). The obtained results show good quantitative agreement with previous work carried out using intrusive local probes. Integration of the flow profiles in the cross section also yielded excellent quantitative agreement with reference measurements of the mean <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction, the mean solids velocity and the solids volumetric flow rate. Furthermore, this study also showed good qualitative agreement with high speed film of the flow. It is believed that the method of velocity and volume fraction profile measurement described in this thesis is much simpler to implement, more accurate and less expensive than the currently very popular technique of dual-plane Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). Finally, the thesis describes a mathematical model for predicting the axial velocity distribution of inclined solids-water flows using the <b>solids</b> <b>volume</b> fraction profiles measured by the ICC device. Good agreement was obtained between the predicted velocity profiles and the velocity profiles measured using the ICC device. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
