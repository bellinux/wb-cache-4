40|$|ObjectiveTo {{compare the}} age {{distributions}} and presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological markers between primary hepatic cancer (PHC) patients {{with and without}} liver cirrhosis. MethodsA total of 547 PHC cases were analyzed retrospectively. After dividing into two groups according to liver cirrhosis status, the between-group differences in age and HBV serological markers, such as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, were statistically compared using the Chi-squared test. ResultsThe number of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic PHC patients was 265 and 282, respectively. HBV infection was present in 221 cirrhotic PHC patients and 256 non-cirrhotic PHC patients (83  4 % vs. 90. 8 %). There was a substantial bias {{in the proportion of}} males to females in the cirrhotic PHC patients (7. 83 ∶ 1). The number of PHC patients ＜ 60 years old was similar between the cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic groups, but the non-cirrhotic group had significantly more patients ＞ 60 years old (P＜ 0. 005). In cirrhotic PHC patients, the HBV infection rate was highest in the ＜ 40 years old age group (96. 7 %) and the HBeAg <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> rate was highest in the 40 - 60 years old age group (89. 5 %). In non-cirrhotic PHC patients, the 40 - 60 years old age group showed the highest HBV infection rate (90. 3 %) but the lowest HBeAg <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> rate (80. 0 %). ConclusionPHC with liver cirrhosis mainly occurred in males, with the HBV infection rate being higher in individuals ＜ 60 years old. Non-cirrhotic PHC patients were more often ＞ 60 years old. Many of the HBV-infected PHC patients with cirrhosis had high HBeAg <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} a rapid, latex {{agglutination}} test to diagnose rubella infection and to measure immune status was evaluated by comparison with the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the neutralization (NT) test. The latex agglutination test accurately detected <b>serological</b> <b>conversions</b> in 74 pairs of sera representing 21 natural infections and 53 immunizations. The antibody levels of 276 sera {{from the general population}} were determined by latex agglutination, HAI, and ELISA. The correlation coefficients between the titers obtained by HAI and latex agglutination and by ELISA and latex agglutination were statistically significant. Results on 12 sera did not agree when measured by the three tests. These sera were included among the 196 specimens tested by NT. The correlation coefficient between NT and latex agglutination titers was statistically significant. There was one serum positive by latex agglutination but negative by NT, and five sera were negative by latex agglutination but had titers of 4 to 8 in the NT. The relative sensitivity of detecting antibody was greater by latex agglutination than by HAI. An additional 49 sera containing residual nonspecific hemagglutinin inhibitors were evaluated by latex agglutination and NT. The untreated sera showed no false positive reactions, and 36 of 39 NT positive sera were positive in the latex agglutination test...|$|R
40|$|Besides phage si', {{responsible}} for the antigenic conversion from 3, 10 to 3, 15 in group E Salmonella, S. thomasville was found to produce at least two additional types of temperate phage which differ from phages E" in plaque morphology, host range, responsibility for antigenic <b>conversion,</b> <b>serological</b> specificity, etc. This report deals with one of them, which forms large turbid plaque on S. anatum cells (Fig. 1) and has been designated as phage g 341, by the authors. {{in the process of}} single plaque isolation, a virulent phage C 341, which forms large clear plaque on S. anatum cells, was isolated from the phage gmi suspension. These two types of phage, g 341 and C 341, {{have been found to be}} indistinguishable from each other in serological specificity, host range and other pro- perties so far as examined, with the only exception of virulence. S. anatum cells which were lysogenized with phage ε 15 adsorbed neither phages and Cm nor phage ε 15, while S. anatum cells which were lysogenized with phage g 311 remained to be sensitive to phage ε 15 and to be of the same antigenic structure as that of the original S. anatum cells, though they were altered not to adsorb phages ｇ 341 and C 341. The observation that the above alteration resulted from lysogenization of S. anatum cells with phage g 341 was permanent and hereditary provides further evidence of the close relationship of prophage and bacterial nucleus, and suggests that the prophage either eliminates or in some way blocks the gene which controls receptor formation. In addition, the above findings, together with the lysogenic conversion in the antigens from 3, 10 to 3, 15, suggest that the alteration of the surface structure of bacterial cell by lysogenization is rather of usual happening...|$|R

40|$|A dosage {{equal to}} or greater than {{approximately}} 3. 4 Dex (decimal exponent, log 10) weanling mouse intracerebral 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) was sufficient to elicit a yellow fever antibody response, as determined by the plaque neutralization (PN) test, in better than 90 % of vaccinated rhesus monkeys. Lower dosages were progressively less effective in terms of PN titers and the PN and hemagglutination-inhibition <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> rates observed. A dose of between 3. 4 and 4. 2 Dex weanling mouse intracerebral LD 50, or one-tenth to one times the dosage recommended for man, provided an optimal antibody response in monkeys. In rhesus monkeys, in contrast to the findings for man, pre-existing yellow fever antibody did not interfere with the antibody response to yellow fever vaccine.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the incidence rate, <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> rate and basic case reproduction number (R 0) of Leishmania infantum from a cohort study of 126 domestic dogs exposed to natural infection rates over 2 years on Marajó Island, Pará State, Brazil. The analysis includes new methods for (1) determining {{the number of}} seropositives in cross-sectional serological data, (2) identifying seroconversions in longitudinal studies, based on both the number of antibody units and their rate of change through time, (3) estimating incidence and serological pre-patent periods and (4) calculating R 0 for a potentially fatal, vector-borne disease under seasonal transmission. Longitudinal and cross-sectional serological (ELISA) analyses gave similar estimates of the proportion of dogs positive. However, longitudinal analysis allowed the calculation of pre-patent periods, and hence the more accurate estimation of incidence: an infection–conversion model fitted by maximum likelihood to serological data yielded seasonally varying per capita incidence rates {{with a mean of}} 8 · 66 × 10 [minus sign] 3 /day (mean time to infection 115 days, 95...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} {{properties of}} {{bovine viral diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) strain Oregon C 24 V were studied after intranasal and subcutaneous infection of pregnant sows. This virus strain is widely used in Hungary for immunising cattle against bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD). Based upon {{the results of the}} clinical, gross pathological, histopathological and virological examinations it can be established that the given strain caused asymptomatic infection and <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> in sows that were in the second third of gestation. The virus caused clinically apparent disease in some of the piglets born at term, which indicates that it had crossed the placenta. More than half (57 %) of the live-born piglets died within 60 days of birth. The sows and their progeny did not shed the virus.

The search for anti-HIV antibodies in 693 samples of sera collected was carried out by two serological tests: (a) the Microparticle enzyme immunoassay-HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 (MEIA) (Abbott Laboratories) and (b) the Western Blot-HIV- 1 (WB) (Cambridge Biotech Corporation) to confirm positive results with MEIA. Sera reactivity for HIV antibodies was 14. 4 %. The highest frequency of anti-HIV antibodies was found in the A and B maximum-security prisons: 17 % and 21. 5 %, respectively. In prison C, the frequency of reagents was 10. 9 %. Seventy three inmates, initially negative in the MEIA test, were checked again five and seven months later. Three of them, all from the maximum-security facilities, became reactive in the MEIA test, with confirmation in the WB, suggesting that <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> had occurred after imprisonment...|$|E
40|$|Infection {{with any}} of the 4 dengue virus serotypes results in a diverse range of symptoms, from mild {{undifferentiated}} fever to life-threatening hemorrhagic fever and shock. Given that dengue virus infection elicits such a broad range of clinical symptoms, early and accurate laboratory diagnosis is essential for appropriate patient management. Virus detection and <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> have been the main targets of diagnostic assessment for many years, however cross-reactivity of antibody responses among the flaviviruses has been a confounding issue in providing a differential diagnosis. Furthermore, there is no single, definitive diagnostic biomarker that is present across the entire period of patient presentation, particularly in those experiencing a secondary dengue infection. Nevertheless, the development and commercialization of point-of-care combination tests capable of detecting markers of infection present during different stages of infection (viral nonstructural protein 1 and immunoglobulin M) has greatly simplified laboratory-based dengue diagnosis. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain in the clinical management of dengue-infected patients, especially in the absence of reliable biomarkers that provide an effective prognostic indicator of severe disease progression. This review briefly summarizes some of the complexities and issues surrounding clinical dengue diagnosis and the laboratory diagnostic options currently available...|$|E
40|$|Five mixed breed {{dogs were}} inoculated intradermally (ID) with cultured virulent {{stationary}} phase promastigotes of Leishmania infantum Nicole, 1908 stocks recently isolated. Parasite transformations {{in the skin}} of ID infected dogs were monitored {{from the moment of}} inoculation and for 48 h, by skin biopsies. Anti-Leishmania antibody levels were measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay, counterimmunoelectrophoresis and direct agglutination test, and clinical conditions were examined. Thirty minutes after ID inoculation the first amastigotes were visualised and 3 to 4 h after inoculation the promastigotes were phagocyted by neutrophils and by a few macrophages. These cells parasitised by amastigotes progressively disappeared from the skin and 24 h after inoculation parasites were no longer observed. Local granulomes were not observed, however, <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> for antibodies anti-Leishmania was achieved in all dogs. Direct agglutination test was the only technique positive in all inoculated dogs. Amastigotes were found in the popliteal lymph node in one dog three months after inoculation. This work demonstrates that, with this inoculum, the promastigotes were transformed into amastigotes and were up taken by neutrophils and macrophages.

40|$|Twenty {{young male}} Cebus apella monkeys were {{infected}} with CAl Trypanosoma cruzi strain and reinfected with CA l or Tulahuen T. cruzi strains, with different doses and parasite source. Subpatent parasitemia was usually demonstrated in acute and chronic phases. Patent parasitemia {{was evident in}} one monkey in the acute phase and in four {{of them in the}} chronic phase after re-inoculations with high doses of CAl strain. <b>Serological</b> <b>conversion</b> was observed in all monkeys; titers were low, regardless of the methods used to investigate anti-T. cruzi specific antibodies. Higher titers were induced only when re-inoculations were perfomed with the virulent Tulahuén strain or high doses of CAl strain. Clinical electrocardiographic and ajmaline test evaluations did not reveal changes between infected and control monkeys. Histopathologically, cardiac lesions were always characterized by focal or multifocal mononuclear infiltrates and/or isolated fibrosis, as seen during the acute and chronic phases; neither amastigote nests nor active inflammation and fibrogenic processes characteristic of human acute and chronic myocarditis respectively, were observed. These morphological aspects more closely resemble those found in the "indeterminate phase" and contrast with the more diffuse and progressive pattern of the human chagasic myocarditis.

40|$|Infection {{with the}} {{parasite}} Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), causing American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease, remains {{a major public}} health concern in 21 endemic countries of America, with an estimated prevalence of 8 million infected people. Chagas disease shows a variable clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic to chronic stages with low parasitaemias, whose severest form is heart disease. Diagnosis at the asymptomatic and chronic stages is based on serological detection of anti-T. cruzi antibodies, because conventional parasitological methods lack sensitivity. Current chemotherapies are more effective in recent infections than in the chronic adult population. The criterion of cure relies on <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> to negative, which may occur only years after treatment, requiring long-term follow-up. In this context, we aimed to develop a real-time PCR assay targeted to repetitive sequences of T. cruzi for sensitive quantitation of parasitic load in peripheral blood of infected patients. It was applied to monitor treatment response of infected children, allowing rapid evaluation of drug efficacy as well as detection of treatment failure. It was also used for early diagnosis of chagasic reactivation in end-stage heart disease patients who received immunosuppressive drugs after cardiac transplantation. This laboratory strategy may constitute a novel parasitological tool for prompt and sensitive evaluation of anti-parasitic treatment of Chagas disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recent and {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} guinea pigs can be infected with, and transmit, human influenza viruses. Therefore guinea pig may be a useful animal model for better understanding influenza infection and assessing vaccine strategies. To more fully characterize the model, antibody responses following either infection/re-infection with human influenza A/Wyoming/ 03 / 2003 H 3 N 2 or immunization with its homologous recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein were studied. Results Serological samples were collected and tested for anti-HA immunoglobulin by ELISA, antiviral antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and recognition of linear epitopes by peptide scanning (PepScan). Animals inoculated with infectious virus demonstrated pronounced viral replication and subsequent <b>serological</b> <b>conversion.</b> Animals either immunized with the homologous HA antigen or infected, showed a relatively rapid rise in antibody titers to the HA glycoprotein in ELISA assays. Antiviral antibodies, measured by HI assay, were detectable after the second inoculation. PepScan data identified both previously recognized and newly defined linear epitopes. Conclusions Infection and/or recombinant HA immunization of guinea pigs with H 3 N 2 Wyoming influenza virus resulted in a relatively rapid production of viral-specific antibody thus demonstrating the strong immunogenicity of the major viral structural proteins in this animal model for influenza infection. The sensitivity of the immune response supports the utility of the guinea pig as a useful animal model of influenza infection and immunization. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dengue {{is caused}} by an arthropod-borne flavivirus. Infection can be either primary or {{secondary}} based on serology, with each stage of the disease characterized by specific <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> and antibody formation. Further study is needed to fully identify the factors associated with and predisposing to dengue infection. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify socio-demographic factors associated with the prevalence of dengue serotypes in Kassala State in the eastern part of Sudan in 2011. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional community-based study with 530 participants who were randomly selected through multi-stage cluster sampling. Dengue serotype prevalence was determined using capture Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA IgG. A multivariate logistic regression model was designed to measure the strength of associations between socio-demographic factors and dengue serotype prevalence. All participants who tested negative for dengue were used as the statistical reference group. RESULTS: From this study, the prevalence of dengue in Kassala was estimated to be 9. 4 % (95 % CI: 7. 1 - 12. 3). Lack of knowledge about dengue fever disease (OR 2. 8, 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 6. 53) and a household density of more than 3 people per room (OR 2. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 06 - 4. 09) were the most important factors associated with dengue infection among the study population. CONCLUSIONS: Community-oriented interventions are needed to modify existing social behaviors to reduce the risk of dengue in the eastern part of Sudan. Additional studies are also required in this field...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Patients on chronic {{dialysis}} {{present a}} high prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection. Despite infection-control practices, surveillance of serological markers, and hepatitis B vaccination, {{there are still}} outbreaks of the disease in dialysis centers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the serologic and vaccination status for hepatitis B in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed serologic markers and hepatitis B vaccination status of chronic kidney disease patients on regular dialysis program in São Carlos, SP, Brazil. Patients without information about hepatitis B status (anti-HBc, HBsAg and anti-HBs) were referred for testing. Individuals with uncertain or incomplete immunization status and without <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> (anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL) were referred to vaccination, with adverse effects monitored. RESULTS: The study included 130 from a total of 181 dialysis patients. The majority were male (63. 8 %), mean age 53. 9 years. All patients were already screened and negative for HBsAg, and 73. 8 % were vaccinated against hepatitis B (59. 2 % complete and 14. 6 % incomplete schedule), with a seroconversion rate of 75. 3 %. Only 11 (8. 5 %) patients had prior dosage of anti-HBc (negative). Among the 47 patients referred for anti-HBc testing, four were anti-HBc positive and one indeterminate. Of the total of patients referred to immunization, 34 have actually received HBV vaccine; among them five had mild adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Despite the benefit of dosing of anti-HBc and anti-HBs before admission to dialysis, economic constraints have reduced the screening to only HBsAg. Since occult HBV infection has already been demonstrated in hemodialysis patients, the measure of anti-HBc should be encouraged...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is a {{zoonotic}} or anthropozoonotic disease {{caused by}} the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Predominantly affecting populations in poor areas of Latin America, medical care for this neglected disease is often lacking. Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has provided diagnostic and treatment services for Chagas disease since 1999. This report describes 10 years of field experience in four MSF programs in Honduras, Guatemala, and Bolivia, focusing on feasibility protocols, safety of drug therapy, and treatment effectiveness. METHODOLOGY: From 1999 to 2008, MSF provided free diagnosis, etiological treatment, and follow-up care for patients < 18 years of age seropositive for T. cruzi in Yoro, Honduras (1999 - 2002); Olopa, Guatemala (2003 - 2006); Entre Ríos, Bolivia (2002 - 2006); and Sucre, Bolivia (2005 - 2008). Essential program components guaranteeing feasibility of implementation were information, education, and communication (IEC) at the community and family level; vector control; health staff training; screening and diagnosis; treatment and compliance, including family-based strategies for early detection of adverse events; and logistics. Chagas disease diagnosis was confirmed by testing blood samples using two different diagnostic tests. T. cruzi-positive patients were treated with benznidazole as first-line treatment, with appropriate counseling, consent, and active participation from parents or guardians for daily administration of the drug, early detection of adverse events, and treatment withdrawal, when necessary. Weekly follow-up was conducted, with adverse events recorded to assess drug safety. Evaluations of <b>serological</b> <b>conversion</b> were carried out to measure treatment effectiveness. Vector control, entomological surveillance, and health education activities were carried out in all projects with close interaction with national and regional programs. RESULTS: Total numbers {{of children and adolescents}} tested for T. cruzi in Yoro, Olopa, Entre Ríos, and Sucre were 24, 471, 8, 927, 7, 613, and 19, 400, respectively. Of these, 232 (0. 9 %), 124 (1. 4 %), 1, 475 (19. 4 %), and 1, 145 (5. 9 %) patients, respectively, were diagnosed as seropositive. Patients were treated with benznidazole, and early findings of seroconversion varied widely between the Central and South American programs: 87. 1 % and 58. 1 % at 18 months post-treatment in Yoro and Olopa, respectively; 5. 4 % by up to 60 months in Entre Ríos; and 0 % at an average of 18 months in Sucre. Benznidazole-related adverse events were observed in 50. 2 % and 50. 8 % of all patients treated in Yoro and Olopa, respectively, and 25. 6 % and 37. 9 % of patients in Entre Ríos and Sucre, respectively. Most adverse events were mild and manageable. No deaths occurred in the treatment population. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing Chagas disease diagnosis and treatment programs in resource-limited settings, including remote rural areas, while addressing the limitations associated with drug-related adverse events. The variability in apparent treatment effectiveness may reflect differences in patient and parasite populations, and illustrates the limitations of current treatments and measures of efficacy. New treatments with improved safety profiles, pediatric formulations of existing and new drugs, and a faster, reliable test of cure are all urgently needed...|$|E
