500|$|Fabric {{shortage}} {{continued for}} some time {{after the end of}} the war. Two-piece swimsuits without the usual <b>skirt</b> <b>panel</b> and other excess material started appearing in the US when the government ordered a 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing. By that time, two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. The July 9, 1945, Life shows women in Paris wearing similar items. Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear. Pin ups of Hayworth and Esther Williams in the costume were widely distributed. The most provocative swimsuit was the 1946 Moonlight Buoy, a bottom and a top of material that weighed only eight ounces. What made the Moonlight Buoy distinctive was a large cork buckle attached to the bottoms, which made it possible to tie the top to the cork buckle and splash around au naturel while keeping both parts of the suit afloat. Life magazine had a photo essay on the Moonlight Buoy and wrote, [...] "The name of the suit, of course, suggests the nocturnal conditions under which nude swimming is most agreeable." ...|$|E
50|$|While {{hemisphere}} misalignment is an occasionally recurring {{feature of}} Daleks seen on television, this issue presents {{itself in a}} uniform manner with all of the film props.

50|$|An unusual {{version of}} the Mark 3 Dalek made an {{appearance}} in The Evil of the Daleks. It featured narrow skirt and shoulder sections, with the rear <b>skirt</b> <b>panel</b> having only a single vertical line of hemispheres down the middle. These differences are not alluded to in the story.

50|$|For {{the first}} time a Dalek command {{structure}} is introduced, with rank indicated by differing colour schemes.

2500|$|According to Anne-Marie Blondeau, {{marketing}} and communications coordinator for swimear company Maillot Baltex, [...] "There {{was a lot}} of swimsuits that looked like dresses and skirts, so when you think about skirtinis in that sense, yes it seems old... but the skirtini is a bit shorter than the average skirt." [...] Pre-bikini two piece beachwear used aprons, <b>skirts</b> or draped <b>panels</b> to conceal [...] "private areas". Two-piece swimsuits with usual <b>skirt</b> <b>panels</b> were popular the US before the government ordered a 10% reduction in fabric used in woman's swimwear in 1943 as wartime rationing. Playsuits were a beachwear popular in the 1950s that featured a [...] "modesty skirt" [...] and a bandeau top.|$|R
5000|$|New Paradigm Daleks are {{taller than}} {{previous}} variants, having a substantial fender reminiscent of Movie Daleks. The skirt section consists of raised panels with bevelled edges to which forty-eight hemispheres are fixed in twelve columns. The hemispheres are coloured grey {{with the exception}} of the Eternal Dalek, where they are black. The central rear <b>skirt</b> <b>panel</b> is enlarged to form a broad spine featuring a recessed horizontal louvre assembly. Published design drawings and commentary by concept artist Peter McKinstry indicates that this section is capable of opening to deploy alternative weapons which would traverse around the midsection to replace the standard armament, although this has not been portrayed on screen. The skirt is surmounted by a prominent, slatless shoulder section, divided by a horizontal groove and featuring integral appendage boxes. The neck is devoid of struts and consists of four flared rings detailed with small vertical slots, and is mounted towards the front of the Dalek giving the appearance of a prominent hump to the rear shoulder section. The dome, to which two cylindrical lights are fitted, is missing the chamfered lower section applied to previous variants. The gun is larger than that previously seen on the programme and is shown causing the complete disintegration of another Dalek. The eye design features five closely spaced discs of identical diameter behind an eyeball, inset with horizontal fins, on the front of which is a veined [...] "organic" [...] lens which glows with a yellow light. It is mounted to the dome on a ball joint.|$|E

50|$|Wartime {{production}} during World War II required {{vast amounts}} of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction {{in the amount of}} fabric in women's beachwear. To comply with the regulations, swimsuit manufacturers removed <b>skirt</b> <b>panels</b> and other attachments, while increasing production of the two-piece swimsuit with bare midriffs. At the same time, demand for all swimwear declined as there was not much interest in going to the beach, especially in Europe.|$|R

40|$|Development of {{thermally}} protected load-carrying structures of reusable launch vehicles capable {{to withstand the}} environment and manoeuvre loads during re-entry needs ground test facilities simulating at least the thermal input and mechanical loads under ambient atmospheric conditions. By this means, the predicted structural behaviour can be confirmed. As a consequence, the DLR-Institute of Structural Mechanics developed the THERMEX test facilities and still improves the test procedures. Within {{the first part of}} the presentation the recent challenging test series on European contributions to the X- 38 re-entry vehicle will be highlighted. Testing the rudder model surface temperatures up to 1175 °C have been achieved by enforcing infrared lamp radiation. A strongly curved panel, the so-called nose skirt, was heated by accommodation of the heater arrays to the geometry of the test article. Because the nose <b>skirt</b> <b>panel</b> was manufactured from C/SiC very small deformations were measured by high-resolution displacement transducers. Within the preceding FESTIP activities cryogenic tank wall panels with an outer high-temperature insulation were tested simultaneously by an outside heating up to 950 °C and an inside cryogenic cooling by liquid nitrogen. Within the second part new developments for forthcoming tests will be illustrated. Such as testing of structures with complicated shapes under combined hot and cryogenic temperature loading will be considered. The concept of modular assemblage of facility components will allow a variety of applications, e. g. ablation exclusively caused by heat irradiation and even brazing of stringers to a titanium panel by fast infrared heating. Another attempt of improvement will be the feasibility to study kinematics of hot structures such as flaps or rudders. Again, the hot gas test facility, part of the THERMEX assembly, will be used to simulate in addition to the thermal loading aerodynamic pressure and flow as well as acoustic excitation. Measurement and data recording will be refined by new amplifiers allowing also the use of type S thermo-couples. For temperature determination even the application of colour coating and infrared camera recording will be studied. The presentation will close with considerations on realisation of successful test procedures. The most important aspect is pre-testing on dummy structures to optimise thermal input and temperature distribution within the tested structure, to adapt the ranges of measurement, and to determine the control parameters of thermal and mechanical loading, especially in the case of kinematics...|$|E

Six crude, hollow, vacuum-formed Dalek props were also created. They were primarily used during location filming of the serial's finale, although several of them can also be seen in the background of some studio shots. They can be recognised by their thick neck struts and the absence of dome aerials and appendage ball joints.

50|$|Like {{all other}} coachbuilders, Burlingham had a bulging order book {{at the end}} of the War, many {{operators}} having placed orders for completion as soon as peacetime conditions applied. The first post-war coach was completed in January 1946 and was very similar to the 1939 design, but featured an extra window pillar in each body side. Burlingham was justifiably cautious. as adequately seasoned timber for framing was very hard to obtain at the time. During 1946, a standard single-deck and double-deck bus body was introduced. The double-decker was basically the Ribble-type pre-war outline, whilst the single-decker could be best described as the utility frame re-clothed with traditional refinements such as compound curvature on front and rear domes and outswept <b>skirt</b> <b>panels.</b> Output of all three types was large, with many operators, such as Ribble and Walter Alexander, not only buying new chassis (for which a substantial waiting list had built up) but also sending pre-war vehicles to Burlingham for new bodies.|$|R
