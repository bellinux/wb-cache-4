25|$|In {{northern}} latitudes, {{the effect}} {{is known as the}} Aurora Borealis or the Northern Lights. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind.

The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E
500|$|The aurora australis, {{commonly}} known as the <b>southern</b> <b>lights,</b> is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full solar winds that pass by the Earth.

2500|$|The {{demand for}} {{condensate}} for oil sands diluent {{is expected to}} be more than [...] by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about [...] of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US tight oil production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is [...] being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport [...] of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and Enbridge is considering the expansion of its <b>Southern</b> <b>Lights</b> pipeline, which currently ships [...] of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another [...]|$|E
