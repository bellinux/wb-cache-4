He went on to design the 183 m span Strömsund Bridge in Sweden, completed in 1955 and generally considered {{the first of the}} modern tradition of cable-stayed bridges, although there had been many isolated examples of the bridge form before then. This employed a steel deck and cables, with large spacings between the stays typical of the early designs. It appears in Strömsund's coat of arms.|$|R
50|$|From a {{structural}} perspective, the second extradosal characteristic is the reduced proportion of superstructure live load that is {{carried by the}} cables. On cable-stayed bridges, the stays commonly support at least 80% of the loading from vehicular traffic acting on the bridge superstructure, whereas on extradosed bridges, the stay cables typically support only between 20% and 60% of this load. In both cases, {{the remainder of the}} load is carried by the longitudinal girder element in spanning-action between the main bridge supports. This characteristic derives from the relative stiffnesses between the cable stays and the girder element. Cable-stay designs typically incorporate flexible deck structures without a stiff girder element, and such systems transfer the majority of any applied deck loads directly into the nearest stay cables. In comparison, extradosal designs utilise a substantially stiffer deck/girder structure, allowing the girder to support a significant proportion of any deck loads, and facilitating the distribution of the remaining load between a larger number of individual <b>stay</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R

40|$|In the Middle Ages, Pavia was {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} several masonry towers; some of them are still existing in the historic center, while many others failed or were demolished in the past centuries. Since 1989, when the collapse of the Civic Tower occurred, the municipality of Pavia started a huge program of analysis and verifications for all the survived towers, in order to evaluate their residual resistance and to prevent further collapses. Structural evidences required some consolidation interventions for three towers (San Dalmazio, Maino and Fraccaro). In this memory two similar interventions realized by the author on the tower of San Dalmazio and Maino are presented. The consolidation solution is called "tower in tower", and consists in the insertion of a steel truss tower inside the masonry one, connected to the perimeter walls through more than 300 steel <b>stays.</b> Such <b>elements</b> are able to transfer part of the self weight of the masonry to the inner steel truss, reducing the compressive stresses at the base...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{recognition}} that Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) leads to substantial increases in morbidity, mortality, {{and length of}} stay, accurate prognostication of these clinical events remains difficult. It remains unclear which approaches to variable selection and model building are most robust. We used data from a randomized trial of AKI alerting to develop time-updated prognostic models using stepwise regression compared to more advanced variable selection techniques. We randomly split data into training and validation cohorts. Outcomes of interest were death within 7 days, dialysis within 7 days, and length of <b>stay.</b> Data <b>elements</b> eligible for model-building included lab values, medications and dosages, procedures, and demographics. We assessed model discrimination using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and r-squared values. 2241 individuals were available for analysis. Both modeling techniques created viable models with very good discrimination ability, with AUCs exceeding 0. 85 for dialysis and 0. 8 for death prediction. Model performance was similar across model building strategies, though the strategy employing more advanced variable selection was more parsimonious. Very good to excellent prediction of outcome events is feasible in patients with AKI. More advanced techniques may lead to more parsimonious models, which may facilitate adoption in other settings...|$|R

The sophisticated technology and optimization algorithms had been focused on selling {{the right amount of}} inventory at a given price, not on the price itself. Realizing that controlling inventory was no longer sufficient, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) launched an initiative to better understand the price sensitivity of customer demand. IHG determined that calculating price elasticity at very granular levels to a high degree of accuracy still was not enough. Rate transparency had elevated the importance of incorporating market positioning against substitutable alternatives.

Earlier investigations have demonstrated that non-local and hierarchical network connectivity often induces complex synchronization patterns and chimera states in systems of coupled oscillators.

Half of these domains contain <b>elements,</b> whose potential <b>stays</b> near the threshold, while they are interrupted by active domains, where the elements perform regular LIF oscillations.

40|$|Height-time {{plots of}} {{the leading edge of}} coronal mass ejections (CME) have often been used to study CME {{kinematics}}. We propose a new method to analyze the CME kinematics in more detail by determining the radial mass transport process throughout the entire CME. Thus our method is able to estimate not only the speed of the CME front but also the radial flow speed inside the CME. We have applied the method to a slow CME with an average leading edge speed about 480 km s$^{- 1 }$. In the Lagrangian frame, the speed of the individual CME mass <b>elements</b> <b>stay</b> almost constant within 2 and 15 R$_S$, the range over which we analyzed the CME. Hence we have no evidence of net radial forces acting on parts of the CME in this range nor of a pile-up of mass ahead of the CME.

Our results also allow a much more precise estimate of the CME energy. Compared with conventional estimates using the CME total mass and leading-edge motion, we find that the latter may overestimate the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy.
