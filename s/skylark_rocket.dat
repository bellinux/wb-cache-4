40|$|A {{polished}} Kanigen coated beryllium {{mirror to}} be used in a glancing incidence X-ray telescope was evaluated. X-ray photographs of the image of a standard high resolution test target were recorded at 8. 34 A and the focal plane of the telescope was determined. Reflection efficiency data was obtained using proportional counters and sources at wavelengths of 8. 34, 13. 3, and 44 A. These data were compared with similar data taken with another metal mirror. The results of the comparison are that the mirror tested in this program shows better resolution and less scattering than the other mirror previously tested. This mirror was chosen as the flight mirror for the SL 1115 X-Ray Telescope to fly on a <b>Skylark</b> sounding <b>rocket.</b> Also, a position sensitive detector placed in the focal plane of the SL 1115 X-Ray Telescope (flight payload) was successfully calibrated using a 10 arc second point source and at wavelengths of 8. 34, 13. 3, 27, and 44 A...|$|R
40|$|Four <b>Skylark</b> {{sounding}} <b>rockets</b> {{were successfully}} launched from Esrange/Sweden on 6. March, 26. July, 2. August 1990 and on 9. April 1991 during the SISSI-project. Zenith radiances of thermal emissions of the atmospheric trace gases carbon dioxide, water vapor, ozone, methane nitric oxide and atomic oxygen were {{measured in the}} altitude regime 50 - 200 km using liquid helium cooled infrared spectrometers. The observed carbon dioxide emissions near 15 #mu#m were inverted to atmospheric temperatures. They {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the profiles measured by complementarly flown radiosondes, datasondes and falling spheres. Temperatures derived from the CO_ 2 14. 96 #mu#m fundamental band were compared to the CIRA 1990 Model atmosphere and were found to be in good agreement up to about 100 km. This means that the transition to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium is, at least occasionally, at this altitude which is in contradiction to common assumptions (70 - 75 km). Periodic disturbances occured in the spectra of water vapor and methane. The structures were found to be affected by outgassing of H_ 2 O. The impossibility to determine exact vertical intensity profiles allows to give upper limit mixing ratios of H_ 2 O and CH_ 4 only, they are not in contradiction to common values. From measured NO intensities in the 5, 3 #mu#m band cooling rates in the lower thermosphere were deduced. A comparison with profiles obtained during earlier campaigns demonstrate that the dependence of the emission on densities of atomic oxygen is weak. (orig.)

50|$|Many strides {{have been}} made by {{ground-based}} telescopes (such as the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, MLSO, in Hawaii) and eclipse observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the Earth's atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) Aerobee rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, spectrograms measured solar EUV and Lyman-Œ± emissions. Basic X-ray observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The British <b>Skylark</b> <b>rocket</b> missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray spectrometer data. Although successful, the rocket missions were very limited in lifetime and payload. During the period of 1962-1975, the satellite series Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-1 to OSO-8) were able to gain extended EUV and X-ray spectrometer observations. Then, in 1973, Skylab was launched and began a new multi-wavelength campaign that typified future observatories. This mission lasted only a year and was superseded by the Solar Maximum Mission, which became the first observatory to last the majority of a solar cycle (from 1980 to 1989). A wealth of data was accumulated across the whole range of emission.|$|E

In a series of launchings, already begun, data on the variation of short-wavelength solar X-radiation are being accumulated, whilst comparison with concurrent rocket ionospheric studies may add {{to an understanding of the}} role of solar X-radiation in this field.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, calibration {{and analysis of}} data from two experiments flown on <b>Skylark</b> sounding <b>rockets</b> to observe X-rays from celestial sources. The first experiment, SL 904, was flown in November 1970 from woomera, and carried a large-area X-ray proportional detector, sensitive over 1 - 14 Kev. The objectives were to observe the X-ray background radiation {{as well as the}} source M 87 and sources in Centaurus. Measurement of the degree of uniformity of the X-ray background is a valuable clue to its origin since if this is in discrete sources then, on a sufficiently small scale, spatial variations in the flux will be observable. Three scans were made with the instrument over an area lacking known sources, resulting in a lower limit of 7 x 104 for the number of sources which could produce the observed uniformity. The background spectrum over the range 1 - 10 KeV mas measured with a precision equal to previous results and mas in agreement. The second experiment, SL 1002, was carried out in September 1971, to obtain the position of the X-ray source GX 3 + 1 accurately, in one dimension, by observing the occultation of the source by the moon. The observation resulted in the source error box being reduced to 1. 6 arc sec by 3 arc min (1). However, no optical object was identifiable with the X-ray source, although the error box of a possible radio source overlapped. In conjunction with higher energy measurements, the source is shown to be of thermal origin. No temporal fluctuations mere observed. Work on a focussing X-ray collector to observe low energy (0. 1 - 1 KeV) X-radiation from sources is described. The characteristics of the mirror system are investigated and the calibration of the multi-mire detector is also described...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the design, testing and flight results from two <b>Skylark</b> <b>rocket</b> experiments which were primarily {{intended to make}} high-resolution searches for line emission in the X-ray spectrum of Scorpius X- 1. The observations of Sco X- 1, {{up to the end}} of 1968, over all frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum, are summarised, together with the astrophysical models of the object and their implications for the X-ray spectrum. The decision to search for line emission in the spectrum arose from the need to establish whether the X-rays are of bremsstrahlung or synchrotron origin. The first Bragg crystal spectrometer to study a non-solar X-ray source was flown on a sun-pointing British Skylark from Woomera in March 1970, and an improved experiment of the same kind was flown on an E. S. R. O. Skylark from Sardinia in March 1971. The payloads were the first to employ roll stabilisation on an X-ray star using proportional detectors. The proportional detector experiments confirmed the bremsstrahlung nature of the X-ray emission, while the high-resolution spectrometers established that Doppler-broadened Fe XXV line emission is at least an order of magnitude less intense than is expected from a low-density plasma. Fluctuations in the X-ray intensity were observed on 1 minute time scales, as found in the optical data. A summary is given of contemporary work on Sco X- 1, and the absence of narrow line emission is found to be consistent with those models of the X-ray source which envisage a high-density, toroidal plasma in orbit around a central white-dwarf or neutron star...|$|E
