Following a slowdown in 1991 – 92, the Dutch economy experienced a mild recession in 1993 with GDP growth falling to about Â½ percent. Output was sustained by external demand, which contributed nearly 1 percentage point to GDP growth, while domestic demand fell by Â½ percent.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom {{about the current}} behaviour of oil prices is essentially very simple. It is comprised of two assertions and then an inference. It runs as follows. First, there is no physical shortage in oil markets. Secondly, there is no <b>stockbuilding</b> (or “hoarding”) at least not by the important oil companies. The price rises in oil markets since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait can then only be due to “psychology” and “sentiment”. These latter terms have dismissive connotations. They suggest that oil prices are being pushed up either by speculation or by factors which are not easily amenable to “rational” analysis...|$|E

The conclusion of this research is the fact that despite significant differences between, for example, GDP per capita or the economic growth, there is still similarity in the business cycle or even GDP creation when private consumption and <b>stockbuilding</b> play the key role.

40|$|It {{seems that}} the level of {{economic}} activity in Scotland has passed its nadir, and that a slow recovery is under way. Among the forces stimulating recovery are overseas exports, <b>stockbuilding,</b> and the acceleration of manufacturing production {{in the rest of the}} UK. As the recovery gains force one can expect the underlying upward trend in unemployment to level off. Two factors will constrain any reduction in unemployment, however. Firstly, there is the problem, obvious from the July unemployment figures, of the absorption of school leavers into the workforce. There is now a strong case for an extension of the job creation programme to continue to act as a 'buffer' between full-time education and full-time employment. Secondly, further cuts in public expenditure, especially if they occur in housing or construction will to some extent counterbalance any reduction in unemployment through expansion in the private sector...|$|E
40|$|SummaryGross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1. 2 {{per cent}} {{in the second}} quarter of the year. The {{acceleration}} from the previous quarter reflected a pick up in household consumption, exports (net trade) and <b>stockbuilding</b> as businesses increased their holdings of inventories for the first time since late 2008. The UK corporate sector remains a net‐lender to the rest of the economy, mainly due the weakness of fixed capital spending. Cash reserves have been used to reduce liabilities (loans) rather than purchase new assets. The household sector became a net borrower in 2010 Q 2 for the first time since 2009 Q 1, mainly due to the fall in the saving ratio to 3. 2 per cent. Central government was a large net borrower, consistent with the large current budget deficit. The UK current account remained in deficit (� 7. 4 billion in 2010 Q 2 ), with recent movements driven by the balance in direct investment income. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{shed light}} on why the {{downturn}} in global trade during the intensification of the financial crisis in 2008 Q 4 - 2009 Q 1 was so severe and synchronized across the world, and also examines the subsequent recovery in global trade during 2009 Q 2 - 2010 Q 1. The paper finds that a structural imports function which captures the different and time-varying importintensities of the components of total final expenditure can explain the sharp decline in global imports of goods and services. By contrast, a specification based on aggregate total expenditure can not fully capture the global trade downturn. In particular, panel estimates for a large number of OECD countries suggest that the high import-intensity of exports at the country-level can explain a significant proportion of the decline in world imports during the crisis, while declines in the highly import-intensive expenditure category of investment also contributed to the remaining fall in global trade. At the same time, the high and rising import-intensity of exports also reflects and captures the rapid growth in “vertical specialisation”, suggesting that widespread global production chains may have amplified the downturn in world trade and partly explains its high-degree of synchronisation across the globe. In addition, the estimates find that <b>stockbuilding,</b> business confidence and credit conditions also {{played a role in the}} global trade downturn. Meanwhile, the global trade recovery (2009 Q 2 - 2010 Q 1) can only be partially explained by differential elasticities for the components of demand (although the results confirm that the upturn in OECD imports was also driven by strong export growth and the associated reactivation of global production chains, as well as the recovery in <b>stockbuilding</b> and the fiscal stimulus). This may be due in part to the many policy measures that were implemented to boost global trade at that time and which can not be captured by the specification.

40|$|SUMMARYGross Domestic Product rose by 1. 2 {{per cent}} {{in the second}} quarter due to strong rebound in {{construction}} output from the weather-affected level in the first quarter, and a pick up in services sector growth. This is despite the negative impacts of the volcanic ash cloud and industrial action in the air transport sector. On the demand-side of the National Accounts, GDP growth was supported by a return to positive <b>stockbuilding.</b> Net trade though made a negligible contribution to growth, suggesting that sterling depreciation has not yet had a positive effect. In the labour market, employment rose {{in the second quarter}} of the year, but remains below pre-recession levels and rates. There is evidence of a strong rise in parttime employment through the recession, with self-employment also strengthening during 2009. Recent output increases have been partly delivered through higher labour productivity. Producer prices inflation continues to be driven by the recent trend in oil prices, even the services producer price index through the impact on freight transport. ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe second {{estimate}} of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2010 Q 3 {{reports that the}} UK economy expanded by 0. 8 per cent. This is unrevised from the Preliminary GDP estimate published last month. Output growth has slowed from 1. 2 per cent in the second quarter, when a number of industries rebounded strongly from a weak {{first quarter of the}} year, especially the construction industry. First estimates for the demand‐side of the economy show that the slowdown in GDP growth was concentrated in domestic spending, as the pace of growth in household consumption, fixed investment and general government consumption all slowed. It also appears that the contribution of <b>stockbuilding</b> to growth peaked in the summer. However, net trade contributed positively to growth for the first time for over a year. In the labour market, unemployment fell in the latest quarter but the proportion unemployed for over 12 months continues to rise. Average weekly earnings growth remains muted, but has picked up from the lows of last year. Rates of producer prices inflation and services producer prices inflation have increased in 2010 reflecting an increase in commodity prices, depreciation of sterling, and the stronger cyclical position of the UK economy. ...|$|E
40|$|Electronics and {{microsystems}} are {{the driving}} force behind the global leadership of Europe's automotive industry. Today 90 % of all innovations are directly or indirectly influenced by electronics. The currently most pressing technological task is the integration of sensors, actuators and electronics at minimal costs and with high reliability, the management tasks are the integration of environmental aspects into the design process, material content declaration, recycling concepts and strategies for the supply of spare part over a period of 20 years. Environmental impacts should be evaluated and reduced for the entire car-lifecycle, starting with material selection, production and ending with the use phase as well as the recycling. The monitoring and reporting of material contents and information on the recycling of products dominate environmental management in the automotive industry at present. Solution concepts for more efficient data handling are the IMDS reporting based on SAP R/ 3 and recycling passports. A high level recycling of automotive electronics offers the opportunity to solve an upcoming problem in automotive electronics. Producers have to build up spare part stocks for app. 20 years. Gathering electronic spare parts from the recycling process seems to be a more economical solution than <b>stockbuilding</b> or post sale production. Procedures for reverse logistics, methods for extrapolation of failures and concepts for a reliable estimation of the remaining life time of used parts have to be developed...|$|E
40|$|After a {{temporary}} halt {{the business cycle}} will resume its upward trend. Firms in manufacturing industry still have a comfortable stock of outstanding orders with little spare production capacity left. However, the effect of higher interest rates is likely to slow the expansion of activity abroad and of international trade. Price competitiveness of Austrian exports is unlikely to increase much further and the stimulus to consumption from the tax reform is going to wear off. Therefore, as in the earlier forecast, GDP growth is seen to come down gradually from an average 4 percent in 1989 to 3 percent in 1990. Because of higher <b>stockbuilding</b> total domestic demand will rise unabated. At current import propensities the foreign sector real balance will be marginally negative. Assuming broadly unchanged terms of trade the current account forecast yields a small deficit of AS 7 billion. The greater part of the deterioration in the trade balance will again be compensated by higher net revenues from tourism. While in 1989 consumer prices were boosted by higher import prices of raw materials, wages and salaries will add to inflation in 1990. The number of employees {{is expected to increase}} by 30, 000 (+ 1 percent). As the supply of labour, particularly of foreigners, is very elastic registered unemployment is expected to fall insignificantly to a rate of 4. 9 percent of the dependent labour force.

40|$|In late spring, WIFO sampled 3, 000 {{enterprises}} in manufacturing, construction and public utilities for their investment plans for 1995. Interest {{in the results}} was heightened {{by the fact that}} some domestic and foreign business cycle indicators had recently pointed to a slower pace of recovery. The results of the survey suggest that investment spending in the areas sampled will increase by 14 percent in 1995, following a decline of 7 percent in 1994. In real terms, this would correspond to an expansion of about 12 percent. According to these figures, investment should give firm support to keeping the recovery on track, while in its early stages it was mainly driven by exports and <b>stockbuilding.</b> The profile of overall investment is mainly determined by manufacturing industry. Industrial investment shrank 7 percent in 1994 and may rise by about 11 ½ percent this year, corresponding to a fall by 8 ½ percent followed by a 9 ½ percent rise in volume terms. While investment is still low when compared with the level of the early nineties and also as a ratio of overall sales, the turnaround is important from a cyclical perspective. Firms are also optimistic as regards prospective sales. The latter may total sch 923 billion in 1995, implying a further rise by 5 ½ percent. Real output growth is expected at 4 ½ percent. Sales are set to increase most strongly in the basic goods and chemical industry following poor results over the last few years. The weakest sales increase is projected for the traditional consumer goods sector: while in the food and beverages industry the effects of EU membership are mainly responsible for the weak performance, it is the competition from central and eastern Europe {{in the case of the}} apparel industry. Planned investment activity is closely in line with sales performance and expectations, being buoyant for basic goods and technical manufactures, but weak for the food and the textile industry. The latest survey results for the construction industry suggest a cutback of gross capital spending by 5 percent at current prices in 1995, following a 3 ½ percent decline in 1994. This mirrors the slackening demand for new structures. The electricity companies envisage capital spending totalling sch 17. 4 billion in 1995, a plus of 28 percent year-on-year. For the last two years, original investment plans had subsequently been revised downwards substantially; this time, such a correction seems less likely given that most of the projects reported are well in progress. The strong trend rise in municipal infrastructure investment prevailing since the early eighties was interrupted in 1993 and 1994 by spending cuts for the Vienna underground construction works. For 1995, a resumption of growth is in sight. Additional expenditure will be concentrated on the supply of drinking water and district heating. Investitionen werden Aufschwung verlängern.

40|$|Confiscated Growth Département des {{diagnostics}} de l'OFCE In 1986 {{both the}} price of oil and the exchange rate of the dollar have come back to levels more in line with market equilibrium. But these have not had the expected stimulating effects. The improvements in the terms of trade — particularly large in Europe and Japan [...] have slowed down the growth of general government and corporate net debt {{at a time when many}} developing countries have been forced to adopt severe financial measures. The flow of capital to the OECD countries has been balanced by a sharp reduction of the demand from the rest of the world, while important losses of market shares were conceded to the newly-industrialising countries. The recovery of private consumption has been significant, but not enough to stimulate investment. An important portion of corporate resources has continued to flow to the financial markets, contributing to keeping real interest rates high. In 1987 and early 1988 the slackening of demand in the United States and then its contraction, will dominate the international environment. In such a context the persistence of the American external deficit will aggravate monetary, trade and financial tensions. Faced with increased external competition and weak world demand, Japan and above all Europe will suffer seriously from any additional drop of the dollar. In France the likelihood of significant growth appears limited. Household consumption growth will slow down because of low wage increases, not fully compensated by a strong growth in non-wage income. The recovery of private investment will accelerate but its pace will remain slower than the improvement in profits. The growth of final domestic demand will tend to benefit foreign more than French suppliers, who are facing hightened competition in domestic and world markets from the South-East Asian countries. The trade balance could turn negative. A 1. 7 per cent GDP growth in 1987 will not be enough to stop unemployment from rising. A more expansionist economic policy could curb this upward trend, but there is a continuing risk of any surge in demand being captured largely by foreign competitors. expected slowdown of household consumption, the near-stagnation of investment, and the weakness of exports. Destocking following involuntary <b>stockbuilding</b> in the second quarter of 1986 is expected to depress activity in the first part of this year, notwithstanding some strengthening of final demand. A modest pick-up is therefore not likely until the second quarter, led by investment and exports. Household consumption is likely to recover only moderately, given the weak growth of real incomes. The slowdown in the growth of world demand, projected for around the end of this year, will again limit growth in 1988. Overall, GNP seems likely to grow by 1. 7 per cent in 1987 and 1. 3 per cent in 1988. As a result only part of the considerable increase in profits in 1985 - 86 seems likely to be used for productive investment. The risk of an upturn in inflation in France in the coming quarters seems small. The policy of strict control of public sector salaries, combined with rising unemployment, seems likely to lead to moderation in the overall growth of incomes : hourly wage rates are likely to increase by a modest 2. 8 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Output prices seem likely to stop growing faster than unit costs, except in the tertiary sector, which has not yet restored its margins to the levels of the 1970 s. On the assumption that {{the price of}} oil will stabilize around $ 16 per barrel at the end of the second quarter, the growth of the consumer price index will be around 2. 7 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Under the assumption of a progressive increase in the oil price to $ 20 by the end of 1988, inflation could be around 3 per cent both this year and next. In either case disinflation, as measured by the GNP deflator, will continue, with inflation falling from 5 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent in 1987 and 2. 5 per cent in 1988. Despite the modest growth of domestic demand and inflation, the external surplus of goods and services recorded in 1986 (around FF 21 billion) seems likely to be smaller this year because of a reduction in the manufactures balance of FF 15 billion. The decline in international competitiveness, due to the fall of the dollar since 1985, could be expected to result in some loss of market share. Nevertheless this is likely to be limited to 1. 5 points in 1987 and 1 point in 1988, compared with 3 points over the course of the last two years. The slow growth of employment in the market sector seen in 1986 risks being interrupted because of modest growth of production and the perverse effect of the youth employment scheme "Emploi des Jeunes". It seems that a number of people were taken into employment in 1986 in anticipation of an exemption from social charges. Despite the recent new measures in respect of long-term unemployed, unemployment will continue to grow significantly. The number of unemployed could reach 2. 8 million in the spring of 1988. The pick-up of investment in industry in 1984 - 1985 seems likely to continue in the next two years (6. 5 per cent in 1987 and 5. 4 per cent in 1988 in 1970 prices for the total of non-financial enterprises). Is this likely to be sufficient ? It would seem to be so if compared with the likely growth of internal and external demand, but not if considered in relation to the now considerable capacity to finance productive investment out of retained earnings. The study reported in the last part of this article suggests that the reduction of corporation tax would probably not be effective in sparking off a significant increase in investment. For given budgetary cost a direct subsidy to productive investment in the form of a tax credit would be ten times as effective. But the benefits would be realised only over the medium term.
