Apart from conventional agriculture, cash cropping is also carried out such as the growing of tobacco, navel oranges, cotton, walnuts, and <b>silkworm</b> <b>farming.</b>|$|E
50|$|The village {{economy is}} {{dominated}} by commercial fishing and seasonal tourism. There is also some small-scale farming. In {{the middle of the}} 20th century, unsuccessful attempts were made to develop <b>silkworm</b> <b>farming.</b> Many tourists come for sports fishing and scuba diving. Its white sandy beaches make it an excellent place to swim in summer, since it receives considerably fewer visitors than the other islands in the Izu chain. There are many hiking courses around its volcano, Tenjō-san, which dominates the center of the island. However, winter visits are discouraged, cancellation of flights and ferries due to inclement weather can strand visitors. The island is also noted for its local Shōchū.|$|E

50|$|The area's mountainous {{terrain and}} paucity of flat land offered little {{opportunity}} for the traditional cultivation of rice. Farmers historically supplemented their yield with other grains such as buckwheat and millet. Nevertheless, agriculture was only {{at the level of}} subsistence farming. Of the marketable products coming from the area were Japanese paper (washi), nitre for gunpowder manufacture, and sericulture (<b>silkworm</b> <b>farming).</b> The production of silkworms has been traced back to the 16th century, but only got established as a side-industry in the late 17th century. It thrived right up until the 1970s (except for a period during the second World War) but has since entirely disappeared. It was the requirement for large quantities of indoor space for silkworm beds and for the storage of their food supply (mulberry leaves) that led to the Gassho-style house, with its multi-levelled division of their roof spaces to increase the functional area.|$|E
50|$|Her {{father and}} mother, both French in origin, had farmed in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, {{which had become}} the {{independent}} state of Haiti. Dispossessed {{as a result of}} the Haitian revolution, they moved to Paris where Cora Robinet, their first daughter, was born. Nothing is known of her childhood or education. In 1823 she married her mother's brother, lieutenant-colonel François Millet who, likewise born in Saint-Domingue, had recently been widowed and had come to live with his sister's family in Paris. He also owned a château and farm in Poitou, La Cataudière in the commune of Availles-en-Châtellerault (département of Vienne). After their marriage he and Cora took up farming there, eagerly experimenting with the latest scientific methods. In 1832 they were joined by Stéphane Robinet, Cora's elder brother, a well known chemist. All three took a special interest in <b>silkworm</b> <b>farming</b> and the production of silk, an industry which was then rapidly expanding in France.|$|E
40|$|Assam of {{the northeastern}} region of India {{is unique in}} terms of its rich {{biodiversity}} and multiple ethnicity of its people. The impact of the resultant socio-religio-cultural diversity is also reflected in the diverse traditional ways of <b>silkworm</b> <b>farming.</b> We report the genetic diversity of Persea bombycina “Som” from different locations of Goalpara district of Assam, India, where random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker was used in this study. RAPD analyses of ten genotypes of “Som” from Goalpara district of Assam, India with B 19 RAPD primer generated 86 bands, showing an average of 8. 6 bands per sample and 30. 2 % (26 bands) of these were polymorphic. The number of bands per accession ranged from 5 to 10 with a mean of 8. 6 and the size range of the amplified bands was 250 - 6000 bp. In a UPGMA phenetic dendrogram based on Jaccard’s coefficient, the P. bombycina accessions showed a high level of genetic variation, as indicated by genetic similarity and revealed 10 “Som” genotypes in to three major clusters. This study may be useful in identifying diverse genetic stocks of P. bombycina, which may then be conserved on a priority basis. The RAPD primer used in this study was able to distinguish all the 10 genotypes of “Som” plants, which can be used to assess genetic diversity...|$|E

50|$|The book of Ling-wai-tai-ta {{composed}} by Chinese author Chou K'u-fei in 1178, gave {{a glimpse of}} everyday life in Kediri that cannot be found in any other source material, about the government and people of Kediri. According to Chou K'u-fei, people wore clothes that covered them down to their legs, with a loose hairstyle. Their houses were clean and well arranged with floors made from green or yellow cut stones. Agriculture, animal farming, and trading flourished and gained full attention from government. He reported that <b>silkworm</b> <b>farms</b> to produce silk and cotton clothes had been adopted by Javanese by that time. There was no physical punishment (jail or torture) of criminals. Instead, the people who committed unlawful acts were forced to pay fines in gold, except for thieves and robbers who were executed. In marital customs, the bride's family received some amount of bride price from the groom's family. Instead of developing medical treatment, the Kediri people relied on prayers to Buddha.|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to improve farmers??? income as well as animal productivity by exploring some applicative models. There were three applicative models which were tested: the P 1 Model= introduction of two goats into the <b>silkworm</b> <b>farming</b> system to enable them to utilize mulberry leaves that are not consumed by the silkworms; the P 2 Model= Using the whole mulberry plants as feed ingredients for two feedlot cattle; the P 3 Model= Selling mulberry leaves produced for concentrate ingredient. Parameter measured was net income generated from each model. Result of the study indicated that integration models of mulberry plant with livestock have their own uniqueness to be applied. The highest income for farmer was obtained when the whole mulberry plant was used as feedstuff for feedlot cattle (the P 2 model). Income of Silkworm farmers also increased when applying the P 1 model, which introduced two goats for each box of silkworm rose. But in a certain occasion, it was more beneficial for the farmers to harvest and dry mulberry plant then sells it for concentrate ingredient (the P 3 model). In conclusion, the main factor to be considered in choosing one particular model to be implemented is mainly determined by ability of the farmers to procure cattle or goat to be raised in the mulberry plant???livestock integration model without ignoring the forecast of dry and rainy seasons...|$|E
40|$|Namen pričujočega članka je predstavitev ekonomije in ekonomskih značilnosti skupnosti, ki so živele na stičišču Krasa z Jadranskim morjem, pri čemer je osnovno izhodišče in vir Franciscejski kataster (začetek 19. stoletja). Na temelju analize podatkov iz katastrskega cenitvenega elaborata za skupnosti v devetih katastrih občinah od Trsta do Devina lahko vidimo, kako so prebivalci prilagajali svoje agrarne in neagrarne dejavnosti težavnemu kraškemu terenu in klimi ter razpoložljivim virom in sredstvom. Pri agrarnih dejavnostih sta od posebnega pomena bila gojenje in prodaja bolj kvalitetnih pridelkov (pšenica in vino „prosek“) ter ribolov (skupaj z lovom na tune), medtem ko je osrednjo neagrarno dejavnost predstavljala trgovina s temi pridelki (primarno s Trstom) ter „šavoranstvo“ in kamnolomstvo. The aim of {{the paper}} is to present {{the economy and the}} {{economic}} characteristics of the communities living in the area where the Karst meets the Adriatic Sea, using the Franciscan cadastre (early 19 th century) as the point of departure and the primary source. The main purpose of the cadastre was to record the status of agriculture, but because the assessors wanted to gather as much information as possible, it also contains data about other economic aspects and activities. And although it was established in the early 19 th century, it reflects the overall situation in the area prior to the beginning of industrialization. The selected communities in the Karst area are divided into nine cadastral municipalities belonging to two cadastral districts (Trieste and Duino) and are located in the coastal belt from Trieste to Duino respectively. For the analysis of their economies, we made use of the cadastral survey’s evaluation report, which presents the main features of each cadastral municipality, such as topography, municipal boundaries, population, livestock, rivers and other water bodies, roads, markets, types of arable land, harvests, field crops and tillage, crop quality and its value, types of landed property, houses and branches of industry. The evaluation report was the most suitable source for this research because it covers all economic characteristics that the assessors deemed important to record and, unlike other similar evaluation reports in the cadastre, it was preserved for all municipalities, thus enabling a methodological comparison of data between the municipalities. The analysis of these economies has shown that the agrarian activities of the inhabitants were rather well adapted to the difficult karst terrain and the harsh climate. Arable land was fenced in with stone walls, and the inhabitants regularly brought new soil to fields and removed the scattered stones. They acquired water for livestock and for their own needs by catching and storing rainwater in ponds and cisterns. The choice of land cultivation was deliberate, as the better land was used for fields, vineyards and olive groves, while the poorer and more stony surfaces were used for pastures, meadows and forests. Due to the lack of quality soil and their desire to make better use of what was there, the inhabitants used a type of “mixed culture”, primarily fields with wine grapes but occasionally also vineyards with olive trees. The lack of other crops and also household and agricultural supplies could only obtained by trading for higher quality or more sought-after crops, such as wheat and high-quality wine (prosek), which was cultivated at the best locations by the sea. Trade was therefore an integral part of their survival strategy and a major non-agricultural activity, especially considering the favourable conditions of proximity to a large city (Trieste) and the main trade route. The principal trade products were wine, hay and wheat, to which they added those from other activities (fish from fisheries, cocoons from <b>silkworm</b> <b>farming</b> and milk and cheese from livestock husbandry). The central complementary activity was fishing, including tuna hunting, in which the inhabitants of all municipalities immediately adjacent to the sea participated. Even in non-agrarian activities, the inhabitants strived to exploit the available resources and means, such as stone and fishing boats in the activity of “šavorantstvo” (gathering and transporting stone by sea) and stone deposits for quarrying...|$|E
