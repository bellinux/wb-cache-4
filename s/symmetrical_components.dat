2500|$|The Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant (spring of 1891) and the {{original}} Niagara Falls Adams Power Plant (August 25, 1895) {{were among the first}} hydroelectric alternating current power plants. The first long distance transmission of single-phase electricity was from a hydroelectric generating plant in Oregon at Willamette Falls which in 1890 sent power fourteen miles downriver to downtown Portland for street lighting. [...] In 1891, a second transmission system was installed in Telluride Colorado. The San Antonio Canyon Generator was the third commercial single-phase hydroelectric AC power plant in the United States to provide long-distance electricity. [...] It was completed on December 31, 1892 by Almarian William Decker to provide power to the city of Pomona, California which was 14 miles away. [...] In 1893 he next designed the first commercial three-phase power plant in the United States using alternating current was the hydroelectric Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant near Redlands, California. [...] Decker's design incorporated 10kV three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation, transmission and motors used today. The Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant in Croatia was set in operation on 28 August 1895. The two generators (42Hz, 550kW each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the Hungarian company Ganz. The transmission line from the power plant to the City of Šibenik was [...] long on wooden towers, and the municipal distribution grid 3000V/110V included six transforming stations. Alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly {{in the latter part of}} the 19th and early 20th century. Notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include Charles Steinmetz, Oliver Heaviside, and many others. Calculations in unbalanced three-phase systems were simplified by the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>components</b> methods discussed by Charles Legeyt Fortescue in 1918.|$|E

40|$|In the {{classical}} approach, line-to-line faults are usually analysed using a parallel connection of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> sequence networks. The sequence networks are solved separately, {{and then the}} positive and negative sequence networks are connected in parallel for a line-to-line fault, and solved to obtain the phase quantities. The solution proceeds by identifying the connection of the sequence networks at the fault point and then solving for the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> currents and voltages. These are then used to determine the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> voltages at the other busbars and hence the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> currents in the lines. The approach requires that the connection of the sequence networks be known for the common fault types. However, a solution by the general method of fault admittance matrix does not require prior knowledge of how the sequence networks are connected. This makes the general method more versatile than {{the classical}} methods. The paper presents a procedure for simulating a short circuit, which is a requirement for using the general fault admittance method.

As a first step, a reference phase is chosen {{which results in}} the simplest connection of the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> sequence networks for the fault. The simplest connection of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> sequence networks is a parallel one of the positive, negative and zero sequence networks when phase a of an abc phase sequence is the reference phase and the fault is taken to be between the b and c phases and ground. Putting the fault on an odd phase, say between the a and c phases and ground results in a parallel connection of the positive, negative and zero sequence networks that involve phase shifts, and the solution is more demanding. In practice, {{the results for the}} line-to-line-to-ground fault for the reference phase a may be translated to a fault on odd phases by appropriate substitution of phases. In this approach, the solution proceeds by assuming that the fault is in phases b and c and ground and that the symmetrical sequence networks are connected in parallel. The solution of the fault on b and c phases and ground is then translated to apply to the fault on odd phases, say either between phases c and a and ground or between phases a and b and ground. Alternatively, the parallel connection of the sequence networks at the fault point for the odd phases fault is solved for the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> currents and voltages...|$|R

Indices can be defined for individual events, for individual sites, and for a whole system. A standard method for single-event methods is part of IEC standard 61000 - 4 - 30. This thesis emphasizes the importance of voltage sag indices and different methods for calculating three-phase voltage sag characteristics. Three-phase events measured in a medium network voltage over period of one month were analyzed, results examined and statistically evaluated. An algorithm for calculating voltage sag characteristics and indices was created in Matlab. Algorithm detects if the event is voltage sag, interruption or swell. Two different methods, <b>symmetrical</b> <b>component</b> method and six-phase rms method, for calculating sag type are used in the algorithm. Single-event characteristics as duration, retained voltage, voltage sag energy index, voltage sag severity and sag type are calculated for each event and summarized in synoptic table.
