[...] Critic and sf historian Thomas Clareson has commented that [...] "Planet seemed to look backward towards the 1930s and earlier", an impression that was strengthened by the extensive use of interior artwork by Frank Paul, who had been the cover artist for the early Gernsback magazines in the 1920s. [...] Paul's distinctive style was strongly associated with the early years of the field. [...] The cover art was also melodramatic, with beautiful womensometimes human, sometimes princesses from other planetsand threatening aliens.

The use of flowers as a subsitute to lawn brings forward new possibilities for otherwise neglected surface. Applying these alternatives are based on natural principles that initially cost higher but benefit far better in the long run. The chapter Introduction deals with issues of lawn versus flowers. This chapter focuses on typical habitats, groups of plants and works of experts. The chapter Literature Review focuses on different possibilities of ground covers with herbaceous vegetation in five <b>subheads.</b> <b>Subhead</b> Explanation of Basic Terms contains explanations of terms for lawn, flower - blooming plant and lawn substitutes from the perspective of different authors. <b>Subhead</b> Lawns briefly describes the history of the current lawns, mentions their function, types, methods of growing and its maintenance. The important idea is the negative effect of monocultures on the environment and how to reduce it. <b>Subhead</b> Groups of Flowers Used as Temporary Substitutes describes the topic of annuals and biennials in further details. It brings definition and characteristics of these flowers. Their use in different conditions either separately, as perennial plantings or as semi-wild structures are mentioned there. <b>Subhead</b> Groups of Flowers Used as Permanent Substitutes deals with perennials in detail. Flowering plants are divided according to the place of habitat. Describes the growing of flowers as a lawn substitute and its features such as visual similarity with lawn; resistance to pedestrian traffic, height, foliage, flowering time, etc. It focuses on the use of bulbs, alpine plants, xerophilous plants, flowers from the woods, hygrophilous plants, aromatic plants and other groups. The last <b>subhead,</b> Specific Groups of Flowers as a Lawn Substitute, discusses the flower meadows, extensive perennial flower bed and roof gardens. It brings insight into the history, the use in different habitats, growing, or flower mixtures on the market. It mentions the financial and environmental burden.

40|$|The {{title of}} this diploma thesis is {{knowledge}} and preparedness of the population to provide first aid {{in case of an}} extraordinary events. It is divided into two main parts, that is the theoretical part and the empirical part of the thesis. The theoretical part of this diploma thesis is contained in one main chapter named Current status that contains several <b>subheads.</b> In the consecutive successive <b>subheads</b> we define the definition of first aid and its history. Moreover they contain characteris-tics and division of the Slovakian Integrated rescue system and the activity of the IRS coordination center. Within first aid and its procedure, this diploma thesis contains cha-racterizations of the first approach to the befallen, the characteristics of the rescue chain and the appointment and detailed description of life-saving activities. The next <b>subhead</b> contains selection of dangerous accidents with the tendency of direct threat to life and their treatment in the means of first aid. Further away we created an individual <b>subhead</b> about the procedure at the casualty site with a large number of the befallen persons. A very important element of first aid is the psychological effect on the befallen. This is described in the <b>subhead</b> Providing of psychological first aid at the casualty site. The next <b>subhead</b> describes the most common myths, miscues and mistakes in providing of amateur first aid. Many amateur rescuers stand by inactively in situations when help is needed, they feel that their knowledge of providing first aid is not sufficient and they are afraid. All of these negative factors cost the befallen valuable seconds that are nee-ded for saving a life and that is why it´s important to increase the public awareness abo-ut providing first aid. The individual <b>subhead</b> about extraordinary events contains basic characteristics of this problem and the description of chosen, most commonly occurring extraordinary events that endanger the residents of Slovakia. Seeing that the chosen method of this diploma thesis is a questionnaire and subsequently statistical evaluation of acquired data, it was necessary to include the statistical methods in the theoretical part of the thesis. The last part of the theoretical part of this diploma thesis is the des-cription of basic descriptive statistics methods and the description of the mathematical statistics methods, that are applied in the empirical part of the thesis. The empirical part of this diploma thesis begins with an assessment of aims and two hypothesis, that focus on ascertaining of the degree of theoretical knowledge of civilians about the providing of first aid in different kinds of extraordinary events. The methodical part of the thesis describes the way of collecting the data using a questionna-ire, it closely describes the characteristics of object file, inquiry progression and results processing. The results describe individual questions and their evaluation and subsequ-ently course of statistical inquiry and comparing its results using the methods of des-criptive and mathematical statistics. The last chapter of this diploma thesis is focused on the discussion about acquired results from the individual questions inquiries and subse-quently the description of the results of statistical inquiry. This part of the thesis further away contains practical recommendations that emerge from acquired results and their application...|$|R

First chapter is an introduction into topic of right of defence and role of defence counsel in criminal procedure. It also deals with legal sources of right of defence and its brief history form 1873 Criminal procedure until recent Criminal procedure.

[...] Upon the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Wilford's article was lauded by journalist Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics, who emphasized Wilford's skillful use of data.
