40|$|A gravity-operated {{submerged}} anaerobic {{membrane bioreactor}} (SAnMBR) {{was set up}} in order to test its principle of operation as an alternative to conventional pumped permeation of the membrane. This operating mode allowed the membrane flux rate to be measured accurately whilst maintaining a constant transmembrane pressure (TMP), and allowed small transient variations in flux rate to be observed. The reactor was operated at 36 0 C for a period of 115 days using a nutrient-balanced synthetic substrate with a high suspended solids concentration. Membrane cleaning was in-situ by a gas <b>scouring</b> <b>system</b> using recirculation of headspace biogas. With an initial TMP of 7. 0 kPa the membrane flux slowly decreased due to membrane fouling and had not reached a constant value by day 71. The results indicated that the system was still acclimatising up to 50 days after start-up; but from that point onwards performance parameters became much more stable. A constant flux of 2. 2 L m- 2 hour- 1 was achieved over the last 45 days after the TMP was reduced to 2. 3 kPa. The stable flux was maintained over this period and the loading raised to 1 g COD L- 1 d- 1 by increasing the influent strength. Under these conditions the average COD removal efficiency was 96 % and the specific methane potential (SMP) was 0. 31 L CH 4 g- 1 COD removed...|$|E

With disposal costs rising and available storage facilities decreasing, DOE is exploring and implementing new waste minimizing D and D techniques. Technology demonstrations are being conducted by LMES at a DOE gaseous diffusion processing plant, the K- 25 Site, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The gaseous diffusion process employed at Oak Ridge separated uranium- 235 from uranium ore for use in atomic weapons and commercial reactors. These activities contaminated concrete and other surfaces within the plant with uranium, technetium, and other constituents. The objective of current K- 25 D and D research is to make available cost-effective and energy-efficient techniques to advance remediation and waste management methods at the K- 25 Site and other DOE sites. To support this objective, O`Brien and Gere tested a decontamination system on K- 25 Site concrete and steel surfaces contaminated with radioactive and hazardous waste. A <b>scouring</b> <b>system</b> has been developed that removes fixed hazardous and radioactive surface contamination and minimizes residual waste. This system utilizes an abrasive sodium bicarbonate medium that is projected at contaminated surfaces. It mechanically removes surface contamination while leaving the surface intact.

The majority (67 - 70 %) of entrained eggs and gum pellets were partially damaged or completely destroyed by entrainment. Water quality monitoring showed that scouring increased turbidity levels only along the river bottom up to 160 ft from the Turbo-scour unit. Scouring {{did not appear to}} alter salinity or dissolved oxygen throughout the water column. Physical destruction of entrained eggs may be the most detrimental impact of turbo-scour operations on the striped bass fishery.

40|$|Raw {{water of}} {{reservoirs}} has high colour and low turbidity while river water normally has low colour and high turbidity. Organic matters carried with run off water accumulate {{at the bottom}} of reservoirs. Reservoir waters being stationary provides a friendly environment for algal growth and colour development from decomposition of those and some inorganic ion such as Iron & Manganese from soil. So treatment of reservoir water is to be focused on colour removal rather than turbidity removal. It has been found that colour removal requires high coagulant dosage than turbidity removal and purification of reservoir water gives rise to operational problems in the conventional treatment systems such as short filter run with filter clogging and filter bed cracking. Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plant has been constructed in 1954 with design capacity of 20 mgd. It is a conventional type treatment plant having the following processes, Aeration, Pre-chlorination, Coagulation, Flocculation, Sedimentation, Filtration Post chlorination and pH correction. Raw water is drawn off to the treatment plant from the Kalatuwawa impounding reservoir and the treated water is conveyed to Greater Colombo area under gravity feed and contributes 16 mgd to the total supply of Greater Colombo. In the course of filtration, clean filter media gradually gets clogged. After about one month, small cracks on the surface of filters starts to appear and these cracks develop into large openings with mud ball formation in continuation of the filtration process. So it has been difficult to reduce the colour to acceptable level during high colour period as settled water passes through openings without filtration. This has been a long-standing problem, which has not received a proper solution so far. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the reasons for filter clogging & filter cracking and find solutions to overcome this problem with improvement of colour removal efficiency. The analysis of the problem was divided into two parts. In the first part, the possible contributory factors from the reservoir up to filters were investigated. Physical & operational factors which may contribute to the problem in the filters themselves were investigated in the second part. A pilot filter was set up in parallel to the existing filters and run more than one year with increased back wash rate and air scouring and found to be operating without clogging and cracking problem in media. Similarly the applicability of clay and settled sludge as coagulant aid, and PAC as colour adsorbent was investigated for the purpose of improving settling and colour removal efficiency in order to reduce the filter load during high colour period. The chemical analysis done for raw water reveals that colour of Kalatuwawa water has developed primarily from organic substances with iron. Organic colour substances come from decomposition of vegetation and Iron from bottom soil. This study investigated the possibility of filter clogging and cracking due to algal growth in the reservoir water and found no significant algal count in raw water to clog filters Through Jar test analysis, it appears that clay and settled sludge can be applied as a coagulant aid in conjunction with Alum and these reduce colour in the settled water to satisfactory level with use of optimum dosage. Addition of Powered Activate Carbon as adsorbent to flocculation basin was found to reduce colour to minimal amount. Applying pre- chlorination is necessary to remove iron from water, as aeration alone is not able to do so. Increased back wash rate up to 36 m 3 /m 2 fhr with air <b>scouring</b> <b>system</b> gives adequate bed expansion and cleaning to filter media. Therefore this study leads to the conclusion that increased backwash rate with improvement of settling would solve the cracking and clogging problem of the filters. Similarly it requires the rehabilitation and modification of filter under drain system...|$|E

The development of a <b>scour</b> protection <b>system</b> at Poole Harbour in Dorset has been documented and reviewed and a series of laboratory investigations were then undertaken. This has enabled a greater understanding of the scour mechanisms from the water jet propulsion systems of High Speed Ships. This work has shown that current design guidance on scour protection is not appropriate for use on berths used by High Speed Ships, that failure of these systems can occur rapidly and catastrophically, and secondary effects from water jets may promote the failure of quay walls. The <b>scour</b> protection <b>system</b> should comprise two individual elements, a filter layer and an armour layer. It has been found that systems involving individual isolated armour units are inappropriate and prone to failure and that shaped linked armour blocks need to be used. The loads on the armour layer were also found to be oscillatory and the materials used for both the armour and filter layers need to be designed for cyclic fatigue loading and fretting.

40|$|Slow {{sand filters}} (SSF) {{have been used}} to treat surface water to {{drinking}} water standards for over a century. Today many cities, including London still treat surface waters to drinking water standards, however because there are viruses that are not efficiently removed by a slow sand filter and are not killed by chlorine, communities have turned to the use of micro filtration and/or reverse osmosis to provide safe drinking water. These technologies are much more efficient if organics are removed and turbidity reduced to less than 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The greenhouse industry is another potential user of slow sand filters. They are not able to recycle irrigation drainage water without it being treated to reduce bacteria, virus, and fungi. The objective of this research was to develop management strategies for SSF that specifically meet the needs of entities using SSF for pretreatment of potable water or use in a greenhouse. This data was used to test a <b>scour</b> <b>system</b> that resulted in scouring 80 percent of the organic layer in the filter and suspending the solids for 40 minutes. A conceptual design was done for a full scale SSF that took advantage of the scour and suspension data to clean the SSF {{at the end of a}} run cycle. SSF were able to consistently produce water with a turbidity less than 1 (NTU) and with the infiltration capacity of 0. 27 m³m⁻². For greenhouse effluent a 1, 000 square meter greenhouse that is discharging 3, 600 L d⁻¹ of drainage water would require a 12. 6 m² SSF, and the SSF for the community requiring treatment of 4. 7 million liters per day of raw water was 730 m². The innovative cleaning system based on an air/water jet was developed to clean the SSF. Experiments were run to determine the amount of time that the solids were suspended and a <b>scour</b> <b>system</b> developed to exceed these times. The entire time for cleaning and recovery of the SSF was an average of 118 minutes for the greenhouse system and 170 minutes for the SSF serving a small community...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{granular}} media {{filters are}} widely used in drinking water treatment to remove particulate and microbial contaminants prior to disinfection. In order to function properly, these filters must be backwashed regularly to remove accumulated deposits. Experience has shown that whenever filter influent is pretreated with coagulants (sometimes {{also referred to as}} flocculants), especially polymers, upflow water wash alone is insufficient to prevent mudballing. In South Africa, air scour is the auxiliary backwash systems of choice, however, many small treatment plants in rural areas (generally treating < 2 ML/day) have water wash alone.

A {{benchtop}} scouring {{procedure was}} used to evaluate the ability of conventional detergent <b>scouring</b> <b>systems</b> to adequately clean fleece samples from a selection of Western Australian Merino wools. Sixteen fleeces were selected from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture resource flocks, covering a wide range in yield (49. 2 to 77. 5 %), wax (7. 3 to 26. 9 %), suint (4. 9 to 11. 6 %), and dust (1. 4 to 16. 3 %) contents. Using a simple detergent-based system, 50 % of the fleeces were classified as effectively scoured, based on residual wax content. When scouring liquor was not refreshed between subsamples drawn from the same fleece, wool wax, staple length and dust content in the greasy fleece accounted for 93 % of the variation in the rate of residual wax increase observed in sequential 10 g samples of wool. Residual ash content also increased but the greasy fleece parameters measured were not statistically significant predictors of residual ash changes. The rate of scoured wool colour change, when sequential samples of greasy wool from the same fleece were scoured without liquor change, could be predicted from greasy fleece yields. The scouring efficiency of the more difficult to scour wools was improved by the addition of sodium carbonate to the main scouring bowls...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of the BiobeadTM version of the Biological Aerated Flooded Filter Process over the last few years. More than twenty of these units have been installed in the U. K. and the operating experience has enabled further development steps to be made, the range of application to be widened and the design methods associated with the technology to be refined. Operating problems have arisen when the design load is less than that found upon commissioning. For the BAFF system because of the short retention times within the media bed it is essential that excess dissolved oxygen is present at all times. Diurnal peaks in load must be allowed for in design. A related problem is that of septic influent. Septicity has a profound influence on the development flora and fauna in any biological system and so it is preferable that septicity is corrected outside of the BAFF system. Similarly intermittent saline intrusion will reduce performance, although to a lesser extent than that found on Activated Sludge processes. The final problem with BAFF's is that of media quality which is exclusively a quality control problem. The major engineering change introduced to the Biobead system is the aeration system which is now a simple sparge tube immersed in the media. This increases the allowable air rates and is particularly helpful in designing for larger than normal diurnal variation. Similarly, the air <b>scour</b> <b>system</b> now used an array of simple drop tubes. The performance of the media has been further improved by the use of charge neutralising additives to the plastic formulation together with broadening the range of source materials able to produce the textured surface finish.

It focuses on the vibration levels and resonant frequencies of the fundamental modes of the support structure. These parameters are crucial to minimize the O&M costs and to extend the lifetime of offshore wind turbine structures. For monopile foundations, scouring and reduction in foundation integrity over time are especially problematic because they reduce the fundamental structural resonance of the support structure, aligning that resonance frequency more closely to the lower frequencies. Since both the broadband wave energy and the rotating frequency of the turbine are contained in this low frequency band, the lower natural frequency can create resonant behavior increasing fatigue damage.

Each method has its own unique advantage depending on the river environment. The Parallel Seismic Survey (PSS) is most useful {{for determining the}} depth of scour during non-flood stages of a river when the scour annulus may be filled in by silt or loose sand as the flood stage subsides.

Particular aspects influencing the design of the scour protection in this case are the use of skirts and the composition of the upper layers of the seabed. The paper will further highlight the way in which existing data and physical modeling were used to arrive at the final design. In particular it will be demonstrated that this is an effective way to carry out the design and that the adaptations of the final design developed and tested during the physical model tests are important. Finally, the paper will present the final design obtained. Copyright 9 2011 by ASME. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|A Bridge <b>Scour</b> Data Management <b>System</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} by the U. S. Geological Survey to support preparation, compilation, and analysis of bridge scour measurement data. Users may interactively store, retrieve, select, update, and display bridge scour and associated data. Interactive processing makes use of full-screen menus and form fill-ins, and an instruction window. Optional help and limits windows provide additional information for each of about 150 items in the data set for each bridge-scour site. The data set items include all of the essential information from a detailed scour measurement. Each data set has four categories of information: site data; measured scour data; flood event data; and channel geometry data. Program options permit selection of prediction equations and computation of scour depth estimates for comparison with observed scour depths. The program is written in Fortran 77 and is portable to personal computers, workstations, and minicomputers. The data base will facilitate: (1) developing improved estimators of scour for specific regions or conditions; (2) describing scour processes; and (3) reducing risk from scour at bridges...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} design tools exist for {{predicting}} scour around off shore structures. In this paper {{some of these}} tools are described and validated by comparing their calculation of scour formation (depth and extent) around a monopile foundation {{with a large number}} of full scale measurements from the Scroby Sands Offshore Wind Farm. It is shown that especially the OptiPile design tool, developed by HR Wallingford for assessing scour risk and scour protection stability, predicts the scour depth very well. Local scour is generally taken into account in the design of support structures for offshore wind turbine projects by assuming a design scour depth corresponding to the most likely extreme local scour depth both for fatigue and ultimate limit state design. Hence, the foundations for offshore wind farms in sandy areas are most often designed with a <b>scour</b> protection <b>system.</b> Nevertheless, cost comparison on recent projects seems to indicate that a design without scour protection can be feasible in some areas. In addition {{it can be argued that}} always designing for the extreme local scour depth, which will for most locations be experienced for a current only situation, is too conservative as imposed wave actions will tend to reduce the scour depth. In the paper this is demonstrated using the OptiPile design tool together with reported time scales for scour development and a suggestion for an alternative to the traditional design approach is presented for debate, as it is recognized that much more evi-dence supporting such a design approach will be needed. Key words: Scour predictive models, full scale measurements, scour adaptive design. 1 Scour Assessment A number of tools exist for predicting the scour risk around offshore structures. See e. g. [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5]. In this chap-ter some of the most recent of these are, after a brief introduction to scour, described for calculating live bed scour around a wind-turbine monopile-type foundation in non-cohesive sediments...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} microprobe (EMP) {{analysis of}} silica (SiO 2) deposition in the epidermis of developing internodes of the perennial scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale var. affine) indicates that SiO 2 is first {{detected in the}} stomatal apparatus beginning with internode 3, then the epidermal papillae (internode 8), and finally in radial cell walls of the long epidermal cells (internode 10). This process is initiated in the intercalary growth regions at the bases of the elongating internodes. The deposition of SiO 2 in long epidermal cell walls occurs after internodal extension has ceased and should therefore be considered {{as one of the}} final stages in internodal differentiation that involves strengthening the cellulosic framework of the cell wall. EMP measurements indicate that SiO 2 in stomata is equivalent to 30 % of a pure SiO 2 standard and that SiO 2 in the radial walls of long epidermal cells averages twice that measured on the tangential walls of these same cells. This study supports the view that silicification {{plays a major role in}} strengthening the developing perennial <b>scouring</b> rush internodal <b>system</b> and that regulation of this process in this and other species of Equisetum, whose SiO 2 deposition patterns are markedly different, deserves further study...|$|R
40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} transportation projects to monitor the performance of roadways and bridges and to identify buried structures. The objective of this thesis was {{to evaluate the use}} of GPR for the identification of bridge scour and to estimate the depth of shallow rock for geotechnical site investigations. The ability to understand and predict scour at bridges is a requirement for safe, economical foundation design and is important for the development of feasible <b>scour</b> monitoring <b>systems.</b> Accurate assessment of the depth to rock is essential for designing and constructing foundations for buildings and transportation infrastructure. Misinterpretation of the depth to bedrock can dramatically increase construction costs. GPR surveys were performed at two bridge locations across shallow streams, on land at four shallow rock locations, and at three other test sites in Rhode Island. During the bridge site tests, the GPR was maneuvered in a small pontoon boat across the water surface from one river side to the other while towed from the bridge deck. The acquired two-dimensional data sets from the shallow streams accurately image the channel bottom, demonstrating that the GPR is an effective and safe tool for measuring or monitoring scour. However, infilled scour features could not be identified due to the presence of cobble armoring layers. During the bridge site tests, the GPR was maneuvered in a research vessel across the water surface from one river side to the other while operated from the bridge deck. The acquired two-dimensional data sets from the shallow streams accurately image the channel bottom, demonstrating that the GPR is an effective and safe tool for measuring or monitoring scour. However, infilled scour features could not be identified due to challenging armoring layers, which showed limitations of the GPR. During the tests on land, the GPR was placed on a survey cart and pushed along to create a linear profile. The acquired two-dimensional data sets from the shallow rock locations were compared to boring logs and shear wave velocity profiles taken previously at the sites and showed good agreement between the different estimated depths to rock. These results showed that GPR is a useful, cost effective tool for the identification of shallow rock layers...|$|R

[...] School of Computing and Engineering and Department of Geosciences. University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2014 Bridges are a vital infrastructure {{component of the}} transportation networks in both rural and urban areas. Damaged or destroyed bridges can affect the reliability and resilience of transportation networks that are critical to human life, economical activities, and the social sustainability at large. Understanding how natural hazards affect the life-cycle performance of bridge systems will lead to improved preparedness prior to extreme disasters and benefit the society ultimately. Among many natural events, flood-induced foundation scour has been recognized as {{a leading cause of}} bridge failure in the United States. The distinct feature of flood-induced scour is that it may last during the rest of bridge’s service life once it is formed around a bridge foundation. Intuitively, the threat may be potentially more severe if the permanent scour is combined with other hazards, such as earthquakes. However, the combined effects of such multiple hazards are not clearly understood to date. It is thus meaningful to investigate the effects of multi-hazard earthquake and scour on the seismic performance of river-crossing bridges. The general objective of this dissertation is to assess the seismic vulnerability of bridge structures considering flooding-induced scour in a general multi-hazard context. To meet this objective, five related research problems are defined in this dissertation. Correspondingly, scientific answers and technical solution frameworks are developed in this dissertation. The dissertation directly contributes to the multi-hazard assessment methodology with an emphasis in flood-induced scour and earthquake hazards. Specifically, the dissertation directly resolves the practical challenge of evaluating the effects of bridge scour on the seismic performance of river-crossing bridges in terms of theoretical frameworks, numerical procedures, and case study-based findings. Future research directions along the line of multi-hazard bridge performance research with an emphasis of hydro- and seismic-impacts are pointed {{at the end of the}} dissertation.

40|$|Ancient basin-floor strata are {{exceptionally}} well exposed in the Neoproterozoic Windermere Supergroup {{in the southern}} Canadian Cordillera. Data from the Castle Creek outcrop, where strata of the upper Kaza Group crop out, and the Mt. Quanstrom outcrop, where the middle Kaza is exposed, form the main dataset for this study. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe and interpret the strata starting at the bed scale, followed by stratal element scale, lobe scale and ultimately fan scale. Strata of the Kaza Group comprise six sedimentary facies representing deposition from a variety of fluid and cohesive sediment gravity flows. These, in turn, populate seven stratal elements that are defined by their basal contact, cross-sectional geometry and internal facies distribution. The lithological characteristics of stratal elements vary little from proximal to more distal settings, but their relative abundance and stacking pattern do, which, then, forms the basis for modeling the internal architecture of lobes. Lobes typically comprise an assemblage of stratal elements, which then are systematically and predictably arranged in both space (along a single depositional transect) and time (stratigraphically upward). Lobes typically became initiated by channel avulsion. In the proximal part of the <b>system</b> <b>scours</b> up to several meters deep, several tens of meters wide are interpreted to have formed by erosion downflow of the avulsion node. Erosion also charged the flow with fine-grained sediment and on the lateral margins and downflow avulsion splays were deposited. Later flows then exploited the basin-floor topography and on the proximal basin-floor carved a feeder channel, which then fed a downflow depositional lobe. At the mouths of feeder channels flows became dispersed through a network of distributary channels that further downflow shallow and widen until eventually merging laterally in sandstone-rich terminal splays. During the lifespan of a single lobe the feeder channel remains fixed, but the distributary channel network and its associated terminal splays wander, causing them to stack and be intercalated laterally and vertically. Eventually an upstream avulsion terminates local sediment supply, causing a new lobe to be initiated elsewhere on the fan, and the process repeats...|$|R
