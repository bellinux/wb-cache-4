The present paper is an attempt to assess Indian {{inland aquaculture}} with respect to its resource base, output trends, systems and activities, yield gaps, adoption and impact on aquaculturists, economics, returns to inputs, investment needs, and future prospects. The paper is largely based on existing literature and observations made as part of an ICAR-WorldFish demand supply project. Indian aquaculture is primarily limited to inland sector and carp-oriented; for that reason, this activity received special attention. Freshwater aquaculture observed tremendous growth in the past 15 years, but immense scope still exists for horizontal expansion and increases in productivity (vertical expansion) ...|$|R

It also discusses in details how changes in the statistical definition {{of some of the}} underlying indicators affect the methodology and results. We recall that the IOI was developed by the European Commission {{at the request of the}} European Council in order to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU’s performance against its main trading partners. The IOI is a composite of four indicators and measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. It covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of <b>fast-growing</b> <b>enterprises.</b> It complements the R&D intensity indicator by focusing on innovation output. It aims to support policy-makers in establishing new or reinforced actions to remove bottlenecks preventing innovators from translating ideas into successful goods and services. This 2016 edition of the IOI offers a number of novelties. It expands international coverage to Israel, New Zealand and Brazil (altogether 38 countries are now compared over a 4 -year time frame). It implements changes in statistical definitions in national accounts (ESA 2010) and international service trade statistics (BPM 6), affecting PCT and SERV components, and uses updated innovation coefficients (CIS 2010 as opposed to CIS 2008) for the DYN scores, and updates scaling coefficients fitting the larger, updated dataset. The report addresses the issue of improving timeliness by using most recent data available for KIABI, GOOD and SERV. Sensitivity analysis highlights that the revision of SERV has the largest impact on outcomes. JRC. DDG 1. 01 -Econometrics and applied statistic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. The {{culture of}} grass shrimp, Penaeus monodon {{has become a}} <b>fast-growing</b> <b>enterprise</b> in Taiwan since {{formulated}} shrimp feed was successfully developed in 1978. In 1983, the total postlarval production for stocking reached 600 million {{at the price of}} 12. 5 U. S. cents each. This high price of the postlarvae resulted from (1) limited availability of wild gravid females, (2) undesirable spawnings obtained by using the method of eyestalk ablation, manifested by a low average hatching rate of 20 %, and (3) high demand from grow-out farms. The eyestalk ablated females induced to spawn were often found unmated which partly explained the poor spawnings and low hatching rates. Consequently, re-use of ablated females was not practised by farmers in the past. The present paper describes the results of artificial insemination and fertilization of wild or pond-reared females whose gonadal development was induced by eyestalk ablation. The hatching rates from unmated soft-thelycum females implanted with two spermatophores are 84. 7 % and 43. 7 % while those implanted with only one spermatophore, 74. 1 % and 16. 8 %, for the first and subsequent spawning, respectively. These results positively confirm that the unmated condition of ablated females is the main reason for low hatching. Through artificial insemination, the spawning and hatching can be improved and ablated females can be re-utilized. For unmated hard-thelycum females, artificial fertilization was done by releasing spermatozoa into the spawning tank right before spawning. Out of 15 attempts, three were successful with hatching rates of 63. 1, 52. 3, and 49. 9 %. Induced maturation of pond-reared shrimps was attempted by manipulation of temperature and salinity. Under constant temperature of 22 Â± 2 Â°C, salinities ranging between 25 and 37 ppt were experimented. The best results with 67 % success were obtained at salinities of 30 and 35 ppt. Continued efforts will be made to improve spawning performance through the technique of artificial insemination under controlled conditions...|$|R

He began observing the leopards and becoming more familiar with their habits and movements. At the same time the family started a small bed and breakfast business and tourists visited Okonjima. Wayne’s research had revealed where leopard could be found and he started to share his viewing experiences with the guests. Hunting ceased as more and more guests came to view the big cats at close quarters and Okonjima became a <b>fast-growing</b> tourism <b>enterprise.</b> At the same time farmers were approaching the Hanssens for advice on livestock protection and to remove cheetahs and leopards that they had caught in traps on their farms. More and more large carnivores were coming to Okonjima to be treated, if necessary, and then released back into the wild. Some of these animals could not be released, having been orphaned at an early age and being too young to fend for themselves. These cats had to be cared for in the long term and the strain on Okonjima’s finances was considerable.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{studies on}} networking, managing a large-scale network remains highly expensive and challenging. Managing a network today costs {{up to four}} times as much as building it, and yet the majority of outages still result from management faults rather than equipment failures. My research precisely addresses this problem by designing, building, and deploying architectural solutions that fundamentally ease operation and management of large-scale networks and networked services. I enjoy addressing this grand challenge particularly with regard to emerging networking environments where ease of management is paramount. One exciting example is <b>fast-growing</b> network edges: <b>enterprises,</b> campuses, data centers, virtual private networks, or networks in less-developed regions. These types of networks have been receiving only marginal attention from the networking research community, whereas successfully managing them (i. e., provisioning, configuring, monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining devices and protocols) is frustratingly difficult due to their limited capabilities and resources for network administration. Facilitating network management can also stimulate a paradigm-shift in computing, such as cloud computing or software-as-a-service, by allowing computing-service providers (data centers, or any sets of networked computers) to frequently re-configure and re-optimize their networks for highly dynamic workloads, without introducing additional management complexity...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} {{the dynamics of}} state feminist counter-publics and independent feminist groups in China, based on a conception of a public sphere as a space for political debate that is both nation based and postnational. Examining the concept and empirical reality of a counter-public sphere {{in the context of}} an authoritarian state may seem peculiar to those who are familiar with the centrality of democracy to Habermas’s concept of the public sphere. Although the Western model of modernization combines a market economy with constitutional democracy, China contradicted this established paradigm throughout the 1980 s, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, in that a <b>fast-growing,</b> <b>successful</b> market economy developed without a transition to democracy. Since then, changes such as the disintegration of the highly centralized social system and the diversification and class stratification of Chinese society have become more apparent (Hu 2007). These characteristics are indicative of a unique Chinese model that cannot be explained by established political paradigms based on Western concepts of liberalism, conservatism, political right, middle and left, public interest, democracy, rights, freedom, and individualism (Hu 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Successful</b> {{establishment}} of <b>fast-growing</b> trees {{could depend on}} early root development and the access to belowground resources. Boreal podzolic soils present a distinctive vertical zonation wherein nutrient availability {{and the presence of}} plant roots decline sharply with depth. Mechanical soil preparation that modifies the vertical arrangement of soil layers creates microsites with improved physical conditions but potentially lower nutrient availability. We compared the vertical distribution of proximal roots of young hybrid poplars in soil layers of mechanically prepared (by mounding) and unprepared microsites. We also evaluated the relationship between root distribution and the availability and mineralization of soil nitrogen. Hybrid poplar roots were less abundant in the surface organic layer of unprepared soils, whereas they proliferated in the buried organic layer of mounds. Total mineralized N was highest in the upper mineral layer of mounds, whereas it was similar between the buried organic layer of mounds and the unprepared organic layer. Altogether, mounding created conditions conducive to greater soil N mineralization and greater production and vertical distribution of proximal roots. This possibly provided access to a larger soil volume and greater soil nutrient pools, which may explain the success of mounding in terms of aboveground growth of hybrid poplars...|$|R
40|$|China’s {{investments}} in R&D are forecast to surpass {{those of the}} US in 2022, thereby attracting capital, innovation {{and a large number}} of returnee managers. In the past eight years alone, the number of returnees has increased five-fold, with the country’s high-tech parks, particularly Beijing’s Z-Park, also known as China’s Silicon Valley or the Silicon Valley of the East, proving considerable attractions. In this context, in which start-ups are vital for economic growth and for the further development of Chinese {{investments in}} leading-edge innovation, understanding how the significant cultural differences between returnee and local managers affect management control systems (MCS) is of key importance. Drawing on a survey of more than 200 companies and data from 435 one-to-one interviews, this study investigates the relationship between CEO characteristics, government financial support and MCS sophistication in the context of <b>fast-growing</b> high-tech <b>enterprises</b> in China’s Silicon Valley. The study develops an MCS sophistication index as an aggregate measure of six main factors (the importance of MCS to the firm, system structure, system operations, system completeness, frequency of use and the level of data aggregation), and measures MCS sophistication by 46 individual management control subsystems. The study predicts and verifies a positive relationship between CEO and firm international exposure and between CEO education and the level of MCS sophistication. It also predicts and verifies a positive relationship between government financial support and MCS sophistication in a context in which privately held and managed venture capital and banks provide such support. The study further analyses the interaction effect of government financial support and CEO characteristics on MCS sophistication. Its empirical findings suggest that, despite their cultural differences, neither local nor returnee managers feel the need for better MCS. Only when there is potential access to government funding do returnee managers have better tools to implement more sophisticated MCS than their local counterparts, thus underlining how international work experience provides Chinese managers with the tools, but not the mindset, for superior MCS. Most previous studies focus on listed companies in China, whereas this study constitutes {{one of the first to}} focus on start-ups using an extensive array of data. It also contributes to the definition of a more systematic MCS sophistication measure, thus allowing more complete analysis of MCS at the firm level. Improving upon previous studies, the research reported herein also encompasses a large set of CEO characteristics to analyse their interaction with government financial support, thereby contributing to a better understanding of MCS in a key area of China’s future development. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue Diligence in {{entrepreneurship}} {{could be}} an approach of an investor to increase the level of control on entrepreneurs being groomed in education institutes by identifying entrepreneurial skills in students and mentoring them. It could {{be a part of}} the Investors Strategy which is defined as “the match an organization makes between its internal resources and skills and the opportunities and risks created by its external environment (Prashant Hebbar, 2011). Due Diligence model helps to build a few innovative companies from student entrepreneurs with reasonable degree of early success and promising future potential and also it exposes students into real entrepreneurship in a competitive do-it-to-learn-it environment. It is emotionally much harder to restart after a failure because the risks seem clearer. This may be why the energy and enthusiasm of youth are so important in research and in new businesses. While thinking about fear, think of “paranoia” of entrepreneurs with respect to sharing thoughts, ideas and concepts with others. In all investors’ years, they don’t think they have ever seen a single idea some variation of which they have not seen before but entrepreneurs must share enough to validate their ideas with people who are not friends or family (Sridar Iyengar, 2010) so whoever is meeting the entrepreneur needs to give them comfort that there is a code of conduct that would be followed (Ramaraj, 2011). The best of the ideas in the world came from campuses and investment community's feels there is a lack of good investible companies outside so best time to take risk for people is student time on campus (Manish Kumar, 2012). 40 % of investors’ business in the US comes from repeat entrepreneurs but investors are very open to backing first time entrepreneurs in the Indian context because they see more first time entrepreneurs than in the West simply because the whole model of building a <b>fast-growing</b> <b>enterprise</b> and then exiting is fairly new (Alok Mittal, 2012). The world's most successful entrepreneurs are all first time entrepreneurs and also the track records of entrepreneurs who have succeeded in their first venture, they typically don’t succeed after that so it comes back to whether they have a track record of achievement in their lives, not necessarily in business (Avnish Bajaj, 2012). All the Angels are very keen to look at the entrepreneur more than the idea, wanting to see the amount of passion, commitment so what's their skin in the game which is an important indicator of commitment (R Ramaraj, 2012). To be a successful entrepreneur, money is one of the ingredients, but it will not automatically guarantee success. At that time there were businesses that had tonnes and tonnes of money, but they don’t exist today (Pradeep Gupta, 2011) so funding is not the issue but the idea itself may not develop into anything. The most important part in the entrepreneurial process is the team - the team that can make it happen because all business plans undergo change, all businesses face crisis. We need to be confident this team has their ears to the ground; they have the passion; they have the staying power to see the finish line (Alok Mittal, 2011). This is the stage things are more flexible and companies can be formed with better teams pertinent to the requirements of the concept so entrepreneurship education on campus helps in entrepreneur team configuration (Manish Kumar, 2012). Students have to develop their own set of tools to finally building the end product and this is possible on campus with less risk and more guidance from the experts and investors. It helps them to think through their product and more than anything else, it reduces dependencies. As corollary, if you have to run for specialist help for your product's core, you may want to think about bringing that specialist onboard (Prashant Hebbar, 2011). The initiative is to explore how investors can organize the youth to create next generation young companies, in their capacity, can play a role in enabling this and hopefully creating some great companies for itself and the ecosystem to cherish. The culmination of this quiet but relentless effort is to reduce the risk of failure of new venture, instilling confidence in investors as well as in students who want to pursue entrepreneurship. The present study is focused on the students’ reasons for pursuing investor supported entrepreneurship development program on campus for the success of their campus ventures knowing investors expectations in terms of running entrepreneurship program parallel to mainstream academics and involving domain experts giving all the necessary inputs to create entrepreneurial mindset. The researcher used questionnaires for B-school students which included close/open ended, multiple choices, nominal and ordinal questions. Investors’ regular interaction with B-school students and helping students develop business relations were found out to be most important attributes in overcoming the fear of starting a new venture. The objectives of the study were: 1. To understand the students’ reasons for pursuing entrepreneurship development program that exposes them into real entrepreneurship in a competitive do-it-to-learn-it environment. 2. To understand investors’ views on what makes build a few start-up companies from student entrepreneurs with reasonable degree of early success and promising future potential...|$|R
