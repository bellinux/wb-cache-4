500|$|The {{price of}} VVVVVV {{when it was}} {{originally}} released was $15. [...] This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's [...] "one unfortunate barrier" [...] to entry: [...] "While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off." [...] Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost [...] "does <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> a lot for an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that [...] "it is worth the money". [...] Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV {{has been reduced to}} $5. [...] On his blog, Cavanagh said that the decision was difficult to make, but added, [...] "I know that the original price of $15 was off putting for a lot of people".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, {{writing in}} the New York Daily News, stated {{that the idea of}} putting Monk in New York [...] "sound great" [...] on paper but it did not take {{advantage}} of what could be [...] "a delightful study in contrasts." [...] Bianculli called it a [...] "misstep", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it [...] "too outrageous." [...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers {{go out of their way}} to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> altogether shopworn." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to David Frith in The Fast Men, at an {{unspecified}} date (probably before 1871) Jem Mace, the boxer, was watching cricket at Lords when a ball hit {{a crack in}} the pitch and took out three of wicket-keeper Ted Pooley's teeth. [...] He dressed Pooley's wounds and declared: [...] "I would rather stand up against any man in England for an hour than take your place behind the wicket for five minutes. [...] I heard that ball <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> if it had hit a brick wall." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is it your {{conception}} of valour to insult {{a man whom}} <b>you</b> hold <b>as</b> if bound hand and foot against <b>striking</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> deserve?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were {{teaching}} my son before breakfast, I believe?" [...] my Lady loftily remarked. [...] "I hope he <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> having talent?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Dutch manners {{are open}} and direct with a no-nonsense attitude; informality {{combined}} with adherence to basic behaviour. According to a humorous source on Dutch culture, [...] "Their directness gives many {{the impression that they}} are rude and crude â€” attributes they prefer to call 'openness.'" [...] A well known more serious source on Dutch etiquette is [...] "Dealing with the Dutch" [...] from Jacob Vossestein: [...] "Dutch egalitarianism is the idea that people are equal, especially from a moral point of view, and accordingly, causes the somewhat ambiguous stance the Dutch have towards hierarchy and status." [...] As always, manners differ between groups. Asking about basic rules will not be considered impolite. [...] "What may <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> being blatantly blunt topics and comments are no more embarrassing or unusual to the Dutch than discussing the weather." [...] That attitude of honesty explains how the Dutch accept each person as he or she is, because it is what the Dutch society asks so everyone is gelukkig ("happy").|$|E
6000|$|... "Did it <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> {{significant}} that Lily should come {{down at a}} few moments' notice dressed just as she left us?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} me {{simply out of}} my mind?" [...] he pursued instead of answering. [...] "Do I merely <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> a {{harmless}} lunatic?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't {{you tell}} me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if {{anything}} <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> we go along, just run it in. I shall understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You {{will find}} it is {{perfectly}} just. Ah! mushrooms and poached eggs! It's the Social System. Pray be seated. Possibly it <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> unfair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't see it," [...] he said finally, proffering the {{manuscript}} to her. [...] "Read it yourself and show me whatever <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> obscene--that was the word, wasn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{suggestion}} {{that his mother}} might have been poisoned accidentally {{by means of the}} tonic she was taking, that did not <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> strange--hein?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{cried the}} Colonel, hurrying to speak first, [...] "does not this room <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> cold? Let me fetch you a shawl." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Warburton gave {{a slight}} start; {{he got up}} and stood before the fire, looking at it hard. [...] "Does that <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> very ridiculous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> being brave for him?" [...] She wouldn't in {{the least}} have this. [...] "It wasn't courage--it was the opposite. I did it to save myself--to escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'His God is his belly, Mr. Graham,' {{said the}} client, 'and if the text <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> disagreeably unrefined, think how it must pain {{me to speak}} thus of an uncle, if only by marriage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose our color <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> peculiar, Mrs. Hargreaves," [...] Ned said, [...] "but it {{will wear}} {{off in a}} few days; it is iodine, and we are already a good many shades lighter than when we started." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHARTERIS. It's a fact, I assure you. Didn't it <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> rather odd, {{our being}} up there {{last night and}} Mrs. Tranfield not with us? ...|$|E
6000|$|Rupert laughed stoutly. [...] "Giving {{orders to}} a {{subordinate}} to strangle a harmless stranger in a coal-cellar may <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> a very blameless experiment, but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Maggie, {{trying to}} follow, almost {{achieved}} a little fold of her forehead. [...] "I <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> modest to-day--modest when I stand here and scream at you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Haldane laughed. [...] "It is {{generally}} wise {{to make the}} most of a pleasant interlude, because the average man does not get too many of them. If this <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> trifling, Ormesby, <b>you</b> will find grim enough amusement before we are through." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bennett {{turned on}} him. [...] "Oh, it <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> funny, does it? Well, {{let me tell}} you that if you think you can laugh at me with--with--er--with one hand and--and--marry my {{daughter}} with the other, you're wrong! You can consider your engagement at an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'll {{wait till}} afterwards," [...] {{returned}} Pitman; [...] "on the whole, I think I'll {{wait till the}} thing's over. I don't know if it <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> it does me; but the place seems deserted and silent, Mr. Finsbury, and filled with very singular echoes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In what way," [...] asked Newman, who {{was much}} amused at his companion's {{immediate}} philosophization of Mademoiselle Nioche, [...] "does her intelligence <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> so remarkable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a pretty}} near thing. Does it <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> curious that while you made {{yourself}} responsible for me I {{had to take care}} of you?" ...|$|E
60|$|You must be {{prepared}} for things that will <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> crude, for a certain difference of accent and dialect {{that you may not}} like, and you must {{be prepared}} too to hear what may <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> the clumsy statement of my ignorant rediscovery of things already beautifully thought out and said. But in the end you may incline to forgive me some of this first offence.... It is quite unavoidable that, in setting out these intellectual foundations of mine, I should lapse for a moment or so towards autobiography.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh, <b>you</b> may <b>as</b> well {{overhaul}} the cabin at once," [...] Rupert said; [...] "we {{have paid for}} its sole use during the voyage. Cast your eye carefully round, {{and see if there}} is anything that <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> being suspicious. I see no arms on deck; see that none are hidden below." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, if Tishy <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> 'initiated' all one can ask is 'Initiated into what?' I should as soon {{think of}} {{applying}} such a term {{to a little}} shivering shorn lamb. Is it your theory," [...] Mrs. Brookenham pursued, [...] "that our unfortunate unmarried daughters are to have no intelligent friends?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> sudden: <b>you</b> had no {{intention}} of going for hours. But the hint is too plain to be ignored. You are preparing to agree that you really must when, looking round, you gather that the last remark was not addressed to you, but to another gentleman who is shaking hands with her: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does it not <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> {{unlikely}} {{that a man}} who had committed a crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone to find?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{made over}} his small income then {{to my mother}} in trust for me. Did it <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> strange that he should do this instead of making a will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--and I wish papa did. But he doesn't." [...] Then {{there was}} a pause. [...] "Of course it must <b>strike</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> very odd, {{the way in which}} we live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{perceive}} my {{having this}} document <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> odd, Sir Gervaise, {{but it can}} be easily explained. There was a wide difference in rank between my parents, and some ill-disposed persons have presumed so far to reflect on the character of my mother, as to assert she was not married at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Quest, [...] "I daresay {{that the}} step <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> <b>as</b> a harsh one. To be {{perfectly}} frank with you, Mr. de la Molle, {{it struck me}} as a very harsh one; but, of course, I am only a servant, and bound to carry out my instructions. I sympathise with you very much--very much indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|Strether understood, {{so far as}} that went; but he {{was feeling}} for his clue. [...] "She <b>strikes</b> <b>you</b> to-night <b>as</b> {{particularly}} magnificent?" ...|$|R
