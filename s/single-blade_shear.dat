40|$|Abstract. This paper mainly {{researches}} on {{the effect}} from high-speed shearing tool {{to the quality of}} stainless steel tube cutting. At first, the relationship between contour line of vertical blade and the direction of shear force and chip flow are studied, and the influence on the quality of shearing caused by the size of blanking clearance is analyzed. Then a new blade contour line that made most of the iron chippings is located outside of the tube and reasonable blanking clearance is obtained. Further, based on the tearing caused by <b>single-blade</b> <b>shear</b> on the top of steel tube, the shape and angle of the vertical blade are studied, and the structure of the vertical blade nose is optimized, which improves the shearing quality of the blade. Finally, the numerical simulation of the process of shearing is done to verify the feasibility of the designed structure by the finite element software DEFORM...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{strains of}} cockerels {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of complete or partial caponization (i. e., removal of either left or right testicle) on growth rates, feed conversions, dressing yields, and texture and sensory properties of the meat. In Experiment 1, where Hubbard White Mountain cockerels were used, partially and completely caponized birds had better feed conversions and were heavier at time of slaughter than roosters. In Experiment 2, where Penobscot birds were used, birds with the right testicle removed gained the most weight and had the best feed conversion ratio; capons were second best. In both experiments, when only one testicle was removed, the other testicle doubled in size so that the testicular weight was equivalent to that of roosters. Results from sensory panels and shear tests indicated that meat from capons was consistently the most tender; this difference was most pronounced in thigh meat. Meat from "slips", or partially caponized birds, was less tender than capon meat but as tender as or more tender than meat from roosters. Correlation coefficients were prepared to compare results of subjective (sensory) and objective (shear) analyses. Sensory evaluations were more highly correlated with multiple-bladed shear tests than with <b>single-bladed</b> <b>shear</b> tests...|$|R
