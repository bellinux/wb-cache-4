5|$|During {{the casting}} process, Parker and {{producer}} Alan Marshall began scouting locations in New York City. On January 20, 1986, he travelled to New Orleans, where he continued writing the script. Parker looked at unused buildings located on Royal <b>Street</b> <b>that</b> could {{act as a}} hotel, and an abandoned house on Magazine <b>Street</b> <b>that</b> would serve {{as the home of}} Margaret Krusemark (Rampling). He returned to New York City where he looked at Staten Island and Coney Island. Parker's script required a total of 78 locations in New York and New Orleans.|$|E

Ernest Smith at Baltimore's Saint Michael and All Angels' Protestant Episcopal Church on 19 November 1895, though Wallis claimed her parents were married in June 1895.

5|$|All of Midler Avenue, {{including}} {{the portion of}} the street not currently part of NY598 in DeWitt, was originally designated as NY433 in the early 1950s. At the time, NY433 ended at the junction of Midler Avenue and Court Street Road (then NY298). By 1954, New Court Avenue, an east–west connector between NY298 and NY433 in DeWitt, was designated as NY436. In the late 1950s, construction began on a bypass of Court <b>Street</b> <b>that</b> extended from the western terminus of NY436 in Salina to the junction of NY298 and Thompson Road (modern NY635) in DeWitt. The bypass was opened to traffic as a realignment of NY298 by 1961. NY433 was then extended northeastward along NY298's former routing on Court Street to Carrier Circle, where it met the realigned NY298.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The <b>street</b> <b>that</b> they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, {{contractors}} halted construction {{because of}} fears {{that they will}} not be paid. This caused Morningstar to reconsider their lease commitment. As a result, the value of the project declined, which made the resale of the project rights difficult. Mills was close to a deal with German investment firm, Deutsche Immobilien Fonds A.G. prior to the difficulties. DIFA had outbid Chicago developer Golub & Co., which then became the frontrunner. Golub, an international real estate investment company headquartered in Chicago, has closed on the office space portion of the project. Mills eventually sold the retail space rights to Chicago developer Joseph Freed & Associates, who had previously purchased the nearby Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building (located at 1 South State <b>Street)</b> <b>that</b> closed in early 2007.|$|E

5|$|NY18 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY104 south {{of a complex}} grade-separated interchange that includes NY18F, NY104, and the Niagara Scenic Parkway on {{the eastern edge of}} the village of Lewiston. From NY104 east, a right-turn ramp allows access to Creek Road Extension, the first <b>street</b> <b>that</b> modern-day NY18 occupies. NY104 continues north from the ramp, passing over NY18 westbound (which terminates at the merge ramp with NY104 west) on its way to the village while NY18 proceeds to the northeast on Creek Road Extension, bypassing Lewiston to the southeast. After , the highway curves to the north and meets NY104 at an unconventional grade-separated interchange that has a pair of two-way ramps connecting the two state routes. NY18 continues on, passing under NY104 and paralleling the Robert Moses State Parkway as it proceeds north.|$|E

Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E
