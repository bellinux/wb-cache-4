5|$|In August 2002, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council {{received}} $57,897.76 {{to carry}} out a restoration plan on the upper reaches of Little Wapwallopen Creek. Since 2005, a project to remedy <b>streambank</b> erosion on the creek has been successful. The creek has a watershed association known as the Little Wapwallopen Creek Watershed Association.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed. These include the Darby Creek Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the Darby Creek Watershed in 2011. A $1047 Pennsylvania Growing Greener grant was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for {{riparian}} restoration on Darby Creek. Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a <b>streambank</b> stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the Darby Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is to preserve and improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E

25|$|Hicks Creek {{experiences}} {{low flow}} in dry weather. However, {{it also is}} prone to flash flooding. The creek also experiences nonpoint source pollution, as well as siltation, sedimentation, and <b>streambank</b> erosion. In the 1980s, hazardous waste was observed in the creek.|$|E
25|$|In a reach where Ackerly Creek flows {{alongside}} US Route 6 and US Route 11, it {{has been}} managed and straightened. This contributes significantly to <b>streambank</b> erosion on the creek. There are roughly a dozen sites with unstable stream bank, {{and there are several}} bridge crossings of the creek. There is relatively little garbage along the creek.|$|E

25|$|Japanese Knotweed, an {{invasive}} species, {{has been}} observed {{on the banks of}} Huntsville Creek. This plant was at one point contributing to <b>streambank</b> erosion on the creek. However, in 2010 the Pennsylvania Environmental Council received a grant to remove the Japanese Knotweed {{and replace it with a}} riparian buffer consisting of native trees and shrubs.|$|E
25|$|Downstream of US Route 6, Wildcat Creek is {{impacted}} by piles of culm {{on one of}} its banks and commercial land on the other bank. A stable <b>streambank</b> does not occur in this reach. The final mile (two kilometers) of the creek is in an open concrete box culvert surrounded by lawns and houses. The channel is fenced in this reach {{and there is no}} natural channel left.|$|E
25|$|Silver Creek {{is partly}} or fully in the Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The {{dominant}} hydrologic soil group in {{the upper part of}} the watershed is C. There are significant deposits of sediment along the stream, and <b>streambank</b> erosion occurs in the watershed. The surface geology consists of interbedded sedimentary rock in 89 percent of {{the upper part of the}} watershed and sandstone in the remaining 11 percent.|$|E

25|$|Periodically, ballast must {{be removed}} and {{replaced}} with clean ballast to ensure adequate drainage. Culverts and other passages for water must be kept clear lest water is impounded by the trackbed, causing landslips. Where trackbeds are placed along rivers, additional protection is usually placed to prevent <b>streambank</b> erosion during times of high water. Bridges require inspection and maintenance, since {{they are subject to}} large surges of stress {{in a short period of}} time when a heavy train crosses.|$|E
500|$|There are waterfalls and cascades on a {{reach of}} Leggetts Creek from the Griffin Reservoir to an intake dam three {{quarters}} of a mile downstream. These waterfalls are formed by rock ledges, boulders, and the remains of an old mill. A <b>streambank</b> stabilization project has been carried out on the creek at South Abington Park. The creek flows through 51 pipes, whose sizes range from [...] The Keyser Avenue Borehole is {{in the vicinity of the}} creek.|$|E

This project has {{substantially}} reduced flooding. <b>Streambank</b> stabilization projects {{have been carried out}} along it in Blakely. The creek is also impacted by historic mining operations downstream of a branch of US Route 6. Upstream of that highway, however, it is relatively undisturbed. The creek flows through an open concrete box culvert in its lower reaches. The culvert becomes closed for its last several hundred feet, downstream to the mouth.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} occurrence and characteristics of undercut <b>streambanks</b> in forested headwater streams of the Oregon Coast Range. Undercut <b>streambanks</b> and associated reach characteristics were surveyed along 46 sample reaches (each 152 m in length) in 8 streams; all sample reaches occurred in unmanaged forested riparian areas. Drainage areas ranged from 0. 3 to 16. 6 km^ 2. At each undercut location length, surface area, volume, low-flow (summertime) volume, and maximum horizontal depth were measured. Individual undercuts had surface areas ranging from 0. 3 to 27. 7 m^ 2 with a mean value of 2. 6 m^ 2, and lengths ranging from 1. 2 to 15. 2 m with a mean value of 5. 0 m. The area undercut <b>streambanks</b> ranged from 0. 0 to 27. 4 m^ 2 / 100 m of stream, with an average value of 6. 5 m^ 2 / 100 m. The proportion of bankfull channel area undercut ranged from 0. 0 to 4. 5 %, with an average value of 1. 1 %. Reach length undercut ranged from 0. 0 to 23. 6 %, with an average value of 6. 2 %. The values reported {{in this study are}} approximately mid-range in comparison to characteristics of undercut banks reported in studies from Alaska, Montana, and Wisconsin. The % of reach area covered by undercut <b>streambanks</b> in this study is approximately half of that provided by large woody debris. Outside channel bends had approximately 6 times more undercut <b>streambanks</b> than inside bends or straight sections. Streams having a sinuosity index greater than 1. 15 averaged approximately twice as much % surface area undercut than streams having a sinuosity index less than 1. 15. Number of undercuts and undercut characteristics were inversely correlated with channel gradient; significant differences occurring among 1 %, 2 - 4 %, and 5 +% channel gradient classes. <b>Streambanks</b> ranging in height from 1 - 2 m had a higher occurrence of undercut <b>streambanks</b> than either lower or higher <b>streambanks.</b> Undercut <b>streambanks</b> were 4 times more common in "composite" than "non-composite" <b>streambanks.</b> Undercut characteristics appear to be correlated with valley segment type. Channel widths were, on average, significantly narrower at undercut sites when compared to reach average channel widths. However, it does not appear than width characteristics are a cause of undercutting. Based on field observations it appears that flow obstructions (gravel bars, boulders, large woody debris) have little impact on undercut characteristics. Both at-a-site and reach-level comparisons of undercut bank characteristics showed relatively strong correlations with streamside tree densities. Red alder (Alnus rubra) is the most prevalent species found in Coast Range riparian areas, and the most significant species in explaining reach-level differences in undercut characteristics. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) is less common in riparian zones, but appears to be positively correlated with the proportion of reach area undercut...|$|R
