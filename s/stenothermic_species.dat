The ecosystem of altitude such as the Pilate Lake one is characterized by specific climatic conditions which make it particularly vulnerable to high temperatures.The Pilate Lake is considered as a relic zone which, by its climatic and orographic conditions, constitutes a real refuge housing which keeps giving the necessary conditions {{to the survival of}} every species which populate it, among them the Chirocephalus marchesonii, <b>stenothermic</b> <b>species</b> of low temperature.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between different water sources {{plays a key}} role in the structure and functioning of Arctic stream systems. Ice melt, snowmelt, groundwater and rainfall mix to produce a diverse range of physicochemical conditions. The heterogeneous habitat matrix created is home to a variety of cold <b>stenothermic</b> <b>species.</b> Recent trends in earth surface temperatures associated with global warming have co-in sided with a reduction in global glacier mass balance and a hastening in the onset of spring thaw. This field based study investigated the physicochemical habitat diversity within a glacierized Arctic catchment, Kårsavagge in Northern Sweden. Hydrological, meteorological and physicochemical data spanning 2007 to 2010 were collected with intensive collection during the summer melt seasons of 2008 and 2009. In conjunction with these data, macroinvertebrate and fish sampling was carried out during both of the intensive summer monitoring periods. The key focus of the sampling regime was to compare lateral and longitudinal habitat variability, investigate the extent to which this was linked to dynamic water source interactions by modeling contributions from identified sources and assess the impact of this physicochemical habitat template on the macroinvertebrate and fish communities in the light of predicted climate change. The key findings discussed within are (1) Lateral habitat and biological diversity was equivalent to that observed longitudinally. (2) The ARISE framework used for modeling different water source contributions is applicable to an Arctic scenario, however its utility decreases with increasing catchment size. (3) The key habitat variables structuring macroinvertebrate and fish distribution were concerned with mediating/ mitigating the extent of the glacial signal. A conceptual model is presented that illustrates the potential impact of loss of this glacial signal on local biodiversity. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|All of {{the members}} of the Chironomid genus Diamesa are more or less cold <b>stenothermic</b> <b>species</b> (BRUNDIN, 1956 : 62) and are {{particularly}} associated with cool waters in northern latitudes. The discovery of a species on Ruwenzori (FREEMAN, 1955 : 62) at heights of 10 — 13, 000 ft., bore out EDWARDS ' statement (1939 : 2) that there is a "Palaearctic " element in the Dipterous fauna of Ruwenzori in the zones above 10, 000 ft. I have now found a second species of Diamesa amongst material collected by Dr. HEINZ LÖFFLER (Vienna University) on Mt. Kenya at a height of more than 14, 000 ft. in water in contact with glaciers. The new species resembles D. ruwenzoriensis FREEMAN, but is clearly separate from it. D. ruwenzoriensis is known only from Ruwenzori, and has been redis-covered there in 1961 by an expedition from the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It is a species with reduced antennal segmentation in the male, and without antennal plumes in that sex. The new species similarly lacks antennal plumes, but the antennae of the male possess 9 segments as compared with 7 in ruwenzoriensis and those of the female 8 segments, that is one more than in ruwenzoriensis. A further difference lies in the long anal point and curved styles of the male genitalia of kenyae. In general external appearance the two species are remarkably similar but the specific differences are quite definite. It will be interesting to see whether further collecting on the other high mountains in Africa will show the existence of other species, possibly related to these two. I should like to express my thanks to Dr. LÖFFLER for sending this material to me, and for allowing the British Museum to retain the holotype. Diamesa kenyae sp. n. Extremely similar in appearance to D. ruwenzoriensis FREEMAN, but readily distinguishable in the male by the 9 -segmented antennae, the long anal point and curved styles; in the female by the 8 -segmented antennae...|$|E
40|$|Annual {{temperature}} data for two Malagasy sites of high anuran diversity We present microclimatic {{temperature data}} for two Malagasy rainforest sites with high amphibian diversity. Our {{data show that}} daily, monthly and annual temperature ranges in these microhabitats are relatively narrow and, as expected, temperatures are much more buffered in streams than in the leaf litter. A successful ex-situ conservation of many species may require adaptation to the reported thermal conditions. Because many Madagascan amphibians seem to be restricted to certain elevations and hence climatic conditions, global warming could endanger <b>stenothermic</b> amphibian <b>species</b> adapted to these narrow climatic envelopes, which highlights {{the need for more}} detailed monitoring, and for an assessment of temperature tolerances and preferences.

40|$|This study {{experimentally}} compares {{growth of}} four aquatic macrophytes species (Sparganium emersum Rehm., Hippuris vulgaris L., Groenlandia densa (L.) Fourr., Luronium natans (L.) Raf.) with different modes of winter persistence in a thermally buffered habitat. The {{question is whether}} the above-ground persistence of photosynthetic structures during winter can compensate for low growth rates of evergreens when they compete with fast growing, non-evergreen species. The experiment was carried out in experimental boxes installed in a former river channel fed by <b>stenothermic</b> ground-water. <b>Species</b> were planted pairwise in experimental boxes in autumn, monitoring was carried out in the following year: degree of evergreenness was evaluated through number of ramets present prior to the main growing season, competitive ability of species was assessed during the growing season through cover measurements at three dates. Degree of evergreenness varied considerably between species, ranging from increase of ramet numbers during winter in Luronium over preservation of ramet numbers in Groenlandia and Hippuris to nearly complete winter die-back in Sparganium. Luronium presented the highest cover during the entire growing season. Only by the end of summer did Sparganium attain a similar cover through a high growth rate. Despite large differences in cover, growth appeared largely unaffected by the kind of treatment partner a species was confronted with. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that being evergreen can compensate for a low growth rate during the main growing season when it is associated to extensive growth outside this main growing season.

40|$|Current global average {{temperatures}} are 2. °C cooler {{than during the}} last interglacial period. The expected increase in temperature during the 21 st century will be most stressful for cold-adapted and <b>stenothermic</b> mountain <b>species,</b> forcing them to migrate upwards, and eventually to concentrate into either large areas with favourable climates (refugia) or small stands under locally favourable microclimates (microrefugia). We investigate potential refugia in the neotropical Guayana Highlands mountain biome (Pantepui), consisting of ~ 50 isolated table mountains (tepuis), to develop strategies for conserving biodiversity during future global warming. We predict the amount of loss of altitudinal habitats of endemic vascular flora of 26 tepuis and evaluate potential threats to these taxa with respect to species extinction, habitat loss, habitat connectivity {{and the degree of}} isolation. We compare past, present and future Pantepui landscape configurations through fragmentation analysis and identify potential in situ refugia. Spatial analysis forecasts more species isolation and declining biodiversity {{at the end of this}} century relative to current and past levels. Habitats are predicted to experience > 80 % loss, with the disappearance of 38 habitat patches. One large patch (Chimantá massif) accounts for 46 % of the predicted remaining habitat. This patch can be considered a potential refugium for future vascular flora, as it is predicted to contain some present-day resistant species from lower altitudinal levels and other species eventually persisting in microrefugia. The easternmost Pantepui district, containing the Chimantá massif and other tepuis, seems to be the most suitable for the application of in situ conservation strategies.

40|$|River {{temperature}} regulates {{nearly all}} bio-chemical processes {{and is a}} key parameter of water quality. Aquatic organisms respond to the entire temperature regime, including the absolute value, seasonal and diel ranges, rate of change and the timing and duration of significant thermal events. In recent summers, stream water temperature in unshaded locations across the New Forest has repeatedly exceed 24 oC making them unsuitable habitat for vulnerable species such as Brown Trout. Although fish are known to use cool water refuges during the summer, low flows can restrict migration and reduce the accessible habitat. The stress caused by overcrowding and the potential increased exposure to disease may also be harmful. The shade cast by riparian vegetation can exert {{a major influence on}} the freshwater thermal regime particularly in small rain-fed streams and therefore affect the ability of sensitive species to withstand extreme high temperatures. Observations across the New Forest in recent summers, have shown that water temperatures in the shaded reaches were as much as ten degrees cooler than the open sections. The problem of high temperatures is expected to get worse as a consequence of climate change; with drier summer resulting in reduced flows and average summer/autumn temperatures predicted to rise by 4 to 5 oC in southern England. Thus the cooling influence of riparian shade is likely to become increasingly important across England and Wales to protect vulnerable <b>stenothermic</b> <b>species</b> such as trout and salmon from thermal stress. This project was devised to determine the influence of riparian shade on stream temperature and behaviour and ecology of woodland streams in the New Forest. We will present details of riparian shade, water temperature, fish populations and community structure in three streams. We will illustrate how riparian shade affects the thermal regime and the volume of suitable habitat within the stream. Quantify the influence of land use, land cover and riparian shade on the response of water temperature to air temperature and model the impact of climate change predictions on the probably suitability of these rivers as habitat for vulnerable/threatened fish species. Habitat restoration and the removal of riparian shaded from a previously shaded stream will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} Porphyra occurs in LIS (U. S. A.), however, little {{was known about}} their spatial and {{temporal}} occurrence, {{as well as many}} aspects of their ecophysiology. Hence, one site at Horse Shoe Beach, Cove Island Park, Stamford, CT was chosen to be monitored from January 1999 to May 2002. Samples of P. suborbiculata (Kjellm.), P. purpurea (Roth) C. Agardh, and P. leucosticta (Thuret in Le Jol.) as well as two strains of P. leucosticta i. e Type A and Type C (sensu Neefus et al. 2000) from LIS, were used in short-term nutrient-uptake experiments. Samples were taken at specific times during the experiments to analyze content for total C, total N, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, phycoallocyanin, FAA and dry weight. Experiments were also performed to determine each types photosynthetic characteristics. ^ At the monitoring site, only three species of Porphyra species were found. The eurythermic Porphyra suborbiculata inhabited the upper midlittoral. The winter-species Porphyra leucosticta Type A was found in lower midlittoral and the infralittoral fringe as opposed to the other winter-species P. leucosticta Type C that was found in the midlittoral, with its peak in the middle to lower part. As for several other species at the site, the abundance of the Porphyra species was correlated to change in seawater and air temperature among years. ^ At 25 °C, P. suborbiculata reached a Pmax of almost 90 μmol O 2 ·g− 1 DW·min − 1. The efficiency coefficient (a) was twice as high in P. leucosticta Type A than in P. purpurea and P. suborbiculata and showed an increased with temperature only for P. suborbiculata. Porphyra leucosticta Type A showed signs of chronic photodamaged in temperatures above 15 °C at 1650 pmol photon-m− 2 ·s− 1. ^ During the uptake experiments, no differences in nitrate uptake-rates were found between <b>stenothermic</b> and eurythermic <b>species</b> of Porphyra. However, average initial uptake rates by Porphyra spp. were rather high (max V 0 - 1 h 30 mM = 73. 8 μmo 1 NO 3 ·g− 1 DW h − 1), demonstrating the ability to quickly absorb nitrate from the medium. FAA content in the summer-species Porphyra purpurea was much lower than for the winter-species and was the only species that showed an initiation of FAA synthesis during the short-term experiments. ...|$|R
