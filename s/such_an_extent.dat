5|$|At age twenty-seven, {{he entered}} the Monastery of Stoudios, giving his life over {{completely}} to discipleship to his teacher Symeon the Studite. The elder Symeon was not an ordained priest, but a simple monk who was considered holy by many people. The younger Symeon was extremely zealous in his practices and in following his teacher—to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that the abbot of the monastery insisted that Symeon leave {{after only a few}} months.|$|E
5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, {{as a matter of}} law, a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E

50|$|Religious {{institutions}} were not spared by the Khmer Rouge as well, religion was so viciously persecuted to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> terrifying <b>extent</b> {{that the vast}} majority of Cambodia's historic architecture, 95% of Cambodia's Buddhist temples, was completely destroyed.|$|R
5|$|Maxwell also {{investigated}} the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> as {{to put its}} general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) {{as well as a}} mathematician.|$|E
5|$|The longer 7.5cm {{guns were}} a mixed blessing. In {{spite of the}} designers' efforts to {{conserve}} weight, the new weapon made the vehicle nose-heavy to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded {{by the introduction of}} the Ausführung H in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
60|$|The {{first part}} of this reply induced a slight {{recurrence}} of the frown and pout, but at its conclusion the black brow cleared and the mouth expanded to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> gum-and-teeth-exposing <b>extent</b> that Nigel fairly burst into a laugh.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} of the press was divided:That McDowell's career in government as Tánaiste is over is partly of his own making as he courted controversy to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fevered <b>extent</b> that he became the most unpopular political leader in the country.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was accused by Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like Leo Sgouros in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos, Pegonites, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include {{the handling of the}} Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
30|$|The further {{improvement}} of the air quality until the year 1995 was not as fast and was not to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great <b>extent,</b> as observed in Wetzlar. On the other hand, the average hypertrophication index remained at a lower value than in Wetzlar (Table 2).|$|R

5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> it never truly recovered. A native ruler, Psammetichus I {{was placed on the}} throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again to pose a threat to either Assyria or Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer.|$|E

60|$|Dora {{had helped}} him up on the sofa; where he really was defying my aunt to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> furious <b>extent,</b> that he couldn't keep straight, but barked himself sideways. The more my aunt looked at him, the more he reproached her; for she had lately taken to spectacles, and for some inscrutable reason he {{considered}} the glasses personal.|$|R
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic sliding doors {{along the length of the}} carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more optimistic and decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel {{in order to meet}} the demand for The Kindly Ones, which ended up selling more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007. Littell was finally given French citizenship.|$|E
50|$|To {{accomplish}} <b>such</b> enhanced protection, <b>a</b> newer mechanism {{was introduced}} in the mid 1990s. In an unfortunate and misguided attempt at compatibility, it was named after the then-proposed C++ language construct of the same name. Because the syntax and behavior of the two differ to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large <b>extent,</b> choosing the same name has only led to confusion and misunderstanding.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} substantial songwriting {{contributions from}} Vini Poncia, {{who had previously}} been Ringo Starr's post-Beatles songwriting partner.

5|$|Like {{all species}} {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is saprobic, and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians. The Roman Senate {{tried in vain to}} prohibit the wearing of silk, for economic reasons as well as moral ones. The import of Chinese silk resulted in vast amounts of gold leaving Rome, to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that silk clothing was perceived as a sign of decadence and immorality.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons {{manufacture}} and other nuclear physics applications {{are a major}} source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>extent</b> that it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers. This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium, since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally-occurring stable lithium isotopes, as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources.|$|E
40|$|The new {{historical}} context, {{with all}} its implications at the political, economic, social, technological, cultural levels has definitely marked language, which began to reflect by its increased dynamism, particularly in its lexical compartment, the current Romanian reality and transformations.
