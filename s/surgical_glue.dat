Today’s laparoscopic knots are basically a modification of knots used by Seamen, Fishermen, Weavers or Hangmen. In much of the literature on laparoscopic surgery, the learning curve for performing the technique is described as steep. In fact, laparoscopy is more than a new technique; it is a completely different way of operating as far as tissue approximation is concerned. The visualization is different, the instruments are different, and the tactile aspects are very different. Laparoscopic suturing and knotting is a skill that requires a great deal of practice: “As a young surgeon in training, you sit up all night, night after night, tying knots {{over and over and over}} again until you become perfect”.

40|$|<b>Surgical</b> <b>glues</b> {{have been}} used in {{pediatric}} surgery because of the fragility of tissue, and to prevent major surgeries. The present report describes our experience with using a new cyanoacrylate Glubran 2 (Viareggio, Italy) in the treatment of five cases of tracheoesophageal atresia with fistula (one fistula protection, three recurrent fistula, and one unstable patients), two cases of hypospadias, one case of vesicutanouse fistula after bladder extrophy, and one case of cloacal extrophy from January–December 2008. Three cases of recurrent tracheoesophageal atresia with fistula were treated by bronchoscpic glue injection. The other two cases benefited from glue through its ability to plug the fistula and to act as a protecting layer on anastomosis. In two cases with hypospadias excessive use of the glue caused skin necrosis, which was repaired. The wounds of cloacal extrophy were protected from nearby colostomy contamination and infection, and the vesicocutanouse fistula was closed by deepithelialization and sealing with glue.

5000|$|To begin a basic remodeling, {{the surgeon}} makes an {{incision}} {{at the center}} of the depressed area on the LV wall and removes blood clots and endocardial scar tissue. To restore the heart to its elliptical shape, an endoventricular suture is put in place and a longitudinal tuck is made to return the cardiac apex from the posterior to the front. The suture also serves as guidance for the patch location. The surgeon then inserts a balloon into the ventricular cavity to ensure correct size and sutures a Dacron patch, deflating the balloon and removing it before complete closure. The non-viable fibrous tissue is pulled over the patch, and <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> is occasionally used to complete the closure. When the lesion is placed on the anteroseptoapical wall of the heart, it will include the septum and apex more extensively than the lateral wall. As a result, the suture is placed deeply within the septum, and the new neck of the suture, which holds the Dacron patch, extends from the septum. Dor explicates this procedure in detail. [...] When the lesion is placed on the posterolateral wall of the heart, a triangular patch is used and stabilized by the posterior mitral annulus. This placement of the lesion allows for mitral valve replacement to be easily conducted by the transventricular approach. (The surgeon does not have to incise the atrium, rather can replace the valve through the already incised ventricle.) ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{widespread}} use of the endoscope in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery has recently contributed to {{the extension of the}} approach beyond the tuberculum sellae and planum sphenoidale for the management of lesions located in the suprasellar area, either with an endoscope-assisted or purely endoscopic technique. Based on our previous experience with more than 450 standard endoscopic transsphenoidal operations, we have retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of the extended endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach in the management of lesions mainly located in the suprasellar area. METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2005, 20 consecutive patients underwent extended endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for a total of 21 procedures. The series consisted of seven pituitary adenomas, seven craniopharyngiomas, three suprasellar Rathke’s cleft cysts, two tuberculum sellae meningiomas, and one pilocytic astrocytoma of the chiasm. RESULTS: Tumor removal, as assessed by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, revealed complete removal of the lesion in four out of seven pituitary adenomas, five out of seven craniopharyngiomas, three out of three Rathke’s cleft cysts, and two out of two tuberculum sellae meningiomas. One patient (5 %) with craniopharyngioma had a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak that required reoperation. The same patient experienced a sphenoid mycosis, which was treated with medical therapy. Some specific conditions associated with the anatomy of the surgical route, {{as well as to the}} morphology of the lesion, have resulted to condition the feasibility of the approach. CONCLUSION: Small and medium sized suprasellar lesions located in the midline, with or without a limited parasellar extension and without involvement of vascular structures, seem amenable to be resected through such extended endoscopic transsphenoidal approach. Improvements in closure techniques and the use of new materials and <b>surgical</b> <b>glues</b> seem to significantly reduce the postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak rate and meningitis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In aortic {{replacement}} procedures the aortic {{wall and}} Teflon strips form a double layer, {{with the use}} of continuous sutures. <b>Surgical</b> <b>glues</b> {{may or may not be}} used to enhance the durability of the anastomoses. In this technical report a modification of the aortic stumps preparation is devised. The technique reduces substantially the preparation time of the aortic stumps by the use of ligation clips and a surgical sealant. Technique Suturing is the standard method for the aortic-teflon double-layer formation prior to Dacron anastomosis. In this study, instead of suturing, 5 - 6 ligation clips are primarily applied on the exterior of the double layer to facilitate proper cooptation. Secondarily, in order to fuse the two layers together, a sealant is injected in between the Teflon and aortic wall. Thus each stump is delivered quickly sutureless for the Dacron anastomosis. Between January 2003 and March 2009 this modified operative technique was performed in 14 cases (group A) with a mean age of 50 ± 16 years. This was contrasted against 24 controls (group B), with a mean age of 40 ± 28 years, treated with the conventional method, where only continuous sutures were used during the anastomosis. All patients were cases of ascending aorta replacement and/or aortic hemi-arch replacement, for acute aortic dissection or aortic dilatation. Results The pure anastomosis time (stump preparation and Dacron connection) was shortened by approximately 25 minutes depending on surgeon's experience. The anastomosis blood-loss was also significantly reduced in the sutureless group A, as evident by the dry operative field and the limited use of blood products, post-prosthetic graft anastomosis. This reflected to a faster post-operative recovery, faster extubation and fewer complications. At a mean follow-up of 21 ± 7 days, there were no post-operative deaths being related to acute aortic dissection or rupture of the anastomotic site. Conclusion Aortic replacement with the combination of ligation clips and a surgical sealant vs. sutures alone allows easy manipulations of the aorta and adaptation of the diameters, thus optimizing aortic operational timings and hemostasis. Moreover, it prevents blood loss and aortic wall trauma from multiple sutures. </p...|$|R

In case of bleeding complications local hemostatic measures, such as local <b>surgical</b> sutures, fibrin <b>glue,</b> local antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid, or e-aminocaproic acid suffice to stop bleeding. In patients with high risk of bleeding an individual assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of interrupting anticoagulation should be carried out.

40|$|Purpose In {{prostate}} brachytherapy, seeds can {{detach from}} their deposited sites and move locally in the pelvis or migrate to distant sites including the pulmonary and cardiac regions. Undesirable consequences of seed migration include inadequate dose {{coverage of the}} prostate and tissue irradiation effects {{at the site of}} migration. Thus, it is clinically important to develop seed immobilization techniques. Methods We first analyze the possible causes for seed movement, and propose three potential techniques for seed immobilization: (1) <b>surgical</b> <b>glue,</b> (2) laser coagulation and (3) diathermy coagulation. The feasibility of each method is explored. Experiments were carried out using fresh bovine livers to investigate the efficacy of seed immobilization using <b>surgical</b> <b>glue.</b> Results Results have shown that the <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> can effectively immobilize the seeds. Evaluation of the radiation dose distribution revealed that the non-immobilized seed movement would change the planned isodose distribution considerably; while by using <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> method to immobilize the seeds, the changes were negligible. Conclusions Prostate brachytherapy seed immobilization is necessary and three alternative mechanisms are promising for addressing this issue. Experiments for exploring the efficacy of the other two proposed methods are ongoing. Devices compatible with the brachytherapy procedure will be designed in futur...|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of Glubran 2 on bleeding, wound healing, and patient comfort in the postoperative period together with its effectiveness in approximating the skin edges in circumcision. Material and Methods: A total of 247 patients (age range: 1 – 12 years) underwent circumcision using a suture for wound approximation (group 1, n = 57) or circumcision using Glubran 2 <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> after subcuticular skin closure (group 2, n = 190). The circumcision was performed using a sleeve technique. All patients received standard general anesthesia and caudal blockade with levobupivacaine was applied after anesthesia induction. In group 2, after meticu− lous hemostasis, the incision was cleansed and the skin edges were approximated in a subcuticular manner.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveLong-term {{success of}} revascularization {{procedures}} {{is limited by}} recurrent stenosis, a reduction in vascular lumen area that results from neointimal hyperplasia. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as losartan, have potential to prevent recurrent stenosis; however, to date, efficacy has not been demonstrated in either animal models or human beings. While we have previously reported that treatment with a satisfactory dose {{may be an important}} element in obtaining efficacy, oral delivery cannot achieve the required concentration. We therefore tested the ability of losartan to restrict neointimal hyperplasia after local delivery of an elevated dose in a fibrin glue. MethodsThe porcine saphenous artery was subjected to balloon angioplasty. Losartan (25 μmol/mL) was applied directly to the adventitial surface of the injured vessel after mixing with 1. 0 mL of Tisseel. Neointimal formation was quantified after 14 days with morphometry, and immunologic staining was used to monitor expression of proteins associated with cell proliferation, migration, and phenotypic modulation. ResultsA statistically significant decrease of 82 % (n = 5) in neointimal area was obtained with losartan, and cell proliferation, as defined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, was inhibited by 97 %. Reduced cyclin A expression in losartan-treated vessels confirmed that cell cycle progression was blocked; however, the presence of cytokeratin 8 and tenascin in the media and neointima of injured vessels, regardless of treatment, suggested that losartan does not restrict phenotypic modulation. Inhibition of MT 1 -MMP (MMP- 14) expression by losartan indicated that this inhibitor likely suppresses cell migration as well. ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that losartan can effectively prevent recurrent stenosis when delivered locally with a fibrin glue such as Tisseel. Our results also indicate that losartan may operate by interfering with the expression of proteins required for cell cycle progression and migration. AbstractClinical relevanceRelease of angiotensin II in response to vascular injury may promote neointimal hyperplasia, because this hormone can stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. This study demonstrates that local application of an angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan, to the site of injury can effectively prevent neointimal hyperplasia after balloon angioplasty. Application of losartan to the perivascular surface of the injured vessel in a <b>surgical</b> fibrin <b>glue</b> enabled delivery of a dose that exceeds the maximum attainable, via a systemic delivery route. The glue also served as a depot from which the drug was slowly released over time. Treatment with losartan may be a viable approach for controlling neointimal hyperplasia at locations (eg, grafts) that are accessible during a surgical procedure...|$|R

Fibrin <b>glue</b> (FG) derived from snake venom was used to minimize these sequelae, as well as to evaluate its healing property in tunica vaginalis and scrotal skin of rams. Applicability of fibrin glue derived from snake venom was tested in different tissues of other animals such as in sciatic nerve and colon of rats and skin of rabbits. In the present study, 30 healthy adult rams were used. They were divided into 3 groups of 10 animals each as follows: G 1 : fibrin glue group (application of fibrin glue on puncture sites and skin incisions after bilateral testicular biopsy with a Tru-Cut needle); G 2 : swab/nylon group (hemostasis by compression with a swab on puncture sites and skin suturing with nylon after biopsy) and G 3 : control group (the animals were not subjected either to biopsy or to surgery). On the 20 day after biopsy, the presence of adhesion strands between the sites of skin incision and testicle was evaluated by palpation. Adhesion strands were found in three testicles (15 %) in G 1 and in two testicles (10 %) in G 2. One hundred days after biopsy, orchiectomy was carried out and the material collected was assessed for subcutaneous (SC) and/or tunica vaginalis adhesions. G 3 did not present any abnormality.

DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled trial of children receiving (a) adenoidectomy, bilateral myringotomy, and insertion of a unilateral grommet; (b) adenoidectomy, unilateral myringotomy, and insertion of a unilateral grommet; (c) bilateral myringotomy and insertion of a unilateral grommet; and (d) unilateral myringotomy and insertion of a grommet. Children were followed up at seven weeks, six months, 12 months, and 24 months by symptom history and clinical investigations. SETTING [...] Otolaryngology department in an urban hospital. PATIENTS [...] 149 Children aged 4 - 9 years who were admitted for surgery for glue ear and who had no history of previous operations on tonsils, adenoids, or ears and no evidence of sensorineural deafness. Inadequate follow up information on levels of hearing and on middle ear function was obtained from 22. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Mean hearing loss (dB) of the three worst heard frequencies between 250 and 4000 Hz, results of impedance tympanometry, and parental views on their child's progress. RESULTS [...] In the 127 children for whom adequate information was available ears in which a grommet had been inserted performed better {{in the short term}} (for at least six months) than those in which no grommet had been inserted, irrespective of any accompanying procedure. Most of the benefit had disappeared by 12 months. Adenoidectomy produced a slight improvement that was not significant, though was sustained for at least two years. The ears of children who had had an adenoidectomy with myringotomy and grommet insertion, however, continued to improve so that two years after surgery about 50 % had abnormal tympanometry compared with 83 % of those who had had only myringotomy and grommet insertion, and 93 % of the group that had had no treatment. Logistic regression analyses identified preoperative hearing level as the single best predictor of good outcome from surgery. Other variables contributed little additional predictive power. CONCLUSIONS [...] If the principal objective of surgery for glue ear is to restore hearing then our study shows that insertion of grommets is the treatment of choice. The addition of an adenoidectomy will increase the likelihood of restoration of normal function of the middle ear but will not improve hearing. When deciding appropriate indications for surgery, a balance has to be made between performing unnecessary operations and failing to treat patients who might benefit from surgical intervention. Preoperative audiometry scores might be the best predictor in helping to make this decision...|$|R

Human albumin 200 g/L mixed with different concentrations of GTA (25, 50, 75, or 100 g/L) {{was used as}} a single protein set-tip for testing tensile strength, elasticity and rate of crosslinking. Subsequently, ultrafiltered canine or human plasma to obtain autologous glue replaced human albumin. BioGlue, a <b>surgical</b> <b>glue,</b> and Tissucol Duo, a fibrin sealant, were used as controls. Tensile strength of human albumin 200 g/L mixed with 75 g/L GTA is 825 +/- 109 N versus 672 +/- 167 N for BIOGlue. Ultrafiltered canine plasma showed a maximum tensile strength of 634 137 N when mixed with GTA 75 g/L. For human plasma, the maximum tensile strength of 436 +/- 69 N was reached after mixing with GTA 25 g/L. Autologous glue had a higher elasticity of 144 +/- 66 N versus 322 +/- 104 N for BioGlue at maximum load. Autologous glues for vascular repair can be easily prepared out of the patient's plasma. The optimal characteristics, compared to BioGlue, are obtained for ultrafiltered canine and human plasma by mixing with a GTA concentration of 5075 g/L and 25 - 50 g/L, respectively. The autologous glue will exert less tensile strength than BioGlue but has a better compliance.

The combination of Synthetic PP Mesh- 1 with Histoacryl offered a high degree of graft integration without vaginal ulceration and a minimal foreign body reaction, being the sheep a proper animal model to test these types of medical devices...|$|E
40|$|The spider {{aggregate}} gland from orb weaving spiders produces a glue that helps bind insects to the web. Very {{little is known}} about the glue, but possible applications for a synthetically produced aggregate protein range from underwater adhesives to <b>surgical</b> <b>glue.</b> We are cloning the aggregate cDNA to confirm and extend existing knowledge about the aggregate gene(s). mRNA was extracted from {{aggregate gland}}s using TRIzol reagent, and then reverse transcribed using MMLV-RT to create single stranded DNA. The second strand was next synthesized employing DNA Polymerase I in conjunction with RNaseH to form cDNA. The cDNA was ligated into pBluescript II and transformed into electrocompetent DH 10 B bacterial cells. Bacteria were plated on ampicillin and plates used had a colony density of approximately 1000 colonies per plate. Libraries screening has commenced with a probe designed using data from two previously reported sequences for the aggregate gene. Preliminary screening of the library was unsuccessful, but the second highly efficient library is now available for further screening. We expect to obtain 2. 5 - 3 Kb of clear aggregate sequence from this library in order to confirm previous sequences and allow us to express this gene synthetically...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Purpose: To {{compare the}} use of a new cyanoacrylate-based <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> and suture with sepa-rate points in skin wounds closure. Methods: Thirty-six rats were {{subjected}} to a 4 cm dorsal longitudinal incision. Twelve were sub-jected to simple suture with polyamide 6 - 0, 12 rats underwent wall synthesis using Dermabond(r) and 12 was performed cutaneous synthesis with N- 2 -Butyl-Cyanoacrylate. Twelve of each group was euthanized on the seventh postoperative day, their blood was taken to biochemical tests and a layer of skin and subcutaneous tissue surrounding the surgical scar was randomly divided in two segments, to the submission of tension tests and to histological study. Results: There were no significant difference between groups (p> 0. 05). In the soft dermis there was more type I collagen production in group I (p 0. 05). In the compact dermis, all 3 groups showed similar results (p> 0. 05). The biomechanical study was similarity between the glue groups (p> 0. 05) but the group III proved to be different from the others having a higher resistance (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: This glue does not cause any inflammation or kidney and hepatic toxicity. Polyamide sutures are more resistant and the glue should be used alone only in less tension are-as...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila is {{a premier}} genetic {{model for the}} study of both {{embryonic}} development and functional neuroscience. Traditionally, these fields are quite isolated from each other, with largely independent histories and scientific communities. However, the interface between these usually disparate fields is the developmental programs underlying acquisition of functional electrical signaling properties and differentiation of functional chemical synapses during the final phases of neural circuit formation. This interface is a critically important area for investigation. In Drosophila, these phases of functional development occur during a period of < 8 hours (at 25 °C) during the last third of embryogenesis. This late developmental period was long considered intractable to investigation owing to the deposition of a tough, impermeable epidermal cuticle. A breakthrough advance was the application of water-polymerizing <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> that can be locally applied to the cuticle to enable controlled dissection of late-stage embryos. With a dorsal longitudinal incision, the embryo can be laid flat, exposing the ventral nerve cord and body wall musculature to experimental investigation. This system has been heavily used to isolate and characterize genetic mutants that impair embryonic synapse formation, and thus reveal the molecular mechanisms governing the specification and differentiation of synapse connections and functional synaptic signaling properties. Protocol Part 1 : Equipment and Supplies 1. A good dissection microscope is required for embryo dissections; 40 X magnification is suggested, with 25 X eye-pieces to maximally increase magnification...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Renal {{allograft}} {{compartment syndrome}} (RACS) {{has recently been}} coined to describe early allograft dysfunction secondary to raised pressure in the retroperitoneal space. This {{may be caused by}} direct compression of the renal vessels or by a diffuse renal parenchymal compression. Herein, we report a renal allograft compartment syndrome secondary to a needle core transplant biopsy and discuss the management strategies in line with an updated literature review. Presentation of Case: A retrospective case-note review was carried out where a 45 -year-old male had a transplant renal biopsy at 4 -weeks after transplant for raising creatinine. Following biopsy patient developed abdominal discomfort and had haematuria. Discussion: Doppler ultrasound scanning of graft demonstrated good perfusion but a small haematoma (2 × 2 × 2 cm) in the upper pole of the kidney {{at the site of the}} biopsy. Patient was thereafter assessed conservatively with serial ultrasound monitoring. After 24 h, significant deterioration of graft function was observed. The third scan, demonstrated reversed flow in diastole in the upper pole of the kidney with a resistive index of 1. 0 in the main renal vessel. With the above findings the kidney transplant was explored immediately and the transplant released from a 300 ml of liquefied haematoma, which was under considerable pressure. In the next 24 -h, the patient showed an immediate return of graft function. Conclusion: We recommend sequential ultrasound Doppler scanning as an invaluable tool to help identify early RACS. The surgical exploration and adequate heamostasis with <b>surgical</b> <b>glue</b> should be sought out in all RACS. Peer-reviewedPublisher Version 8622...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of very soft tissues, such as brain, liver, kidney and prostate have recently joined the mainstream research topics in biomechanics. This {{has happened in}} spite of the fact that these tissues do not bear mechanical loads. The interest in the biomechanics of very soft tissues has been motivated by the developments in computer-integrated and robot-aided surgery—in particular, the emergence of automatic surgical tools and robots—as well as advances in virtual reality techniques. Mechanical testing of very soft tissues provides a formidable challenge for an experimenter. Very soft tissues are usually tested in compression using an unconfined compression set-up, which requires ascertaining that friction between sample faces and stress–strain machine platens is close to zero. In this paper a more reliable method of testing is proposed. In the proposed method top and bottom faces of a cylindrical specimen with low aspect ratio are rigidly attached to the platens of the stress–strain machine (e. g. using <b>surgical</b> <b>glue).</b> This arrangement allows using a no-slipboundary condition in the analysis of the results. Even though the state of deformation in the sample cannot be treated as orthogonal the relationships between total change of height (measured) and strain are obtained. Two important results are derived: (i) deformed shape of a cylindrical sample subjected to uniaxial compression is independent on the form of constitutive law, (ii) vertical extension in the plane of symmetry lz is proportional to the total change of height for strains as large as 30 %. The importance and relevance of these results to testing procedures in biomechanics are highlighted...|$|E
