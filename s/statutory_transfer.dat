40|$|Consideration of {{legislative}} enactment of statutory forms requires a comparative analysis of current policies of consumerism with current policies underlying prohibitions on the unauthorized practice of law. In reality, that comparison is disproportionately {{in the hands}} of lawyers rather than neutrals or public consumers. Consumerism of individual lawyers and bar associations may be offset by the business side of lawyering, specious personal opinions about the unauthorized practice of law without reference to the actual rules regulating it, fears of uncontrollable practice of law by nonlawyers—especially nonlawyers armed with electronic legal information, influence of private clients of lawyers and lobbyists with competing interests, and lawyers serving as part-time legislators who instinctively prioritize the historical-traditional roles of lawyers. Statutory forms are important in implementing the provisions and policies of the basic statute. No other form, however professionally prepared, can bestow the same validation as a legislative statement that “a [document] in substantially the following form shall be sufficient [to invoke the provisions of this Act]. ” That form will produce the most extensive standardization of practice relating to the subject. A statutory form can serve as a guide to understanding the substantive provisions of the statutes as well as a means of insuring that the provisions are properly given effect. Statutory forms provide an opportunity for legislatures to enact reliable, “understandable and consumer friendly” forms. Otherwise, a variety of forms, some more complex, confusing, and costly, dealing with the same statutes, are likely to be used. The added costs will be borne by both consumers and by the legal system called upon to resolve unclear situations. Subsequent legislation affecting a statutory form can contemporaneously be amended into the statutory form and maintain the greatest currency for the form. The same professional focused attention of proponents and legislatures should be given to statutory form provisions in proposed enactments as to all major provisions at issue. A study of the travails of statutory form provisions of the Uniform Real Property Transfer on Death Act in the Nebraska (non-partisan Unicameral) Legislature illustrates how these competing policies can favor lawyers at the expense of public consumers. The Uniform Act is intended to be an “asset specific will substitute” for non-probate transfers of real property effective at death. It contains an “understandable and consumer friendly” optional statutory form quit claim deed which, unfortunately, is supported by relatively weak commentary in the official explanatory text. After consideration by groups within the Nebraska State Bar Association, the legislation, including the statutory form, was approved by the Bar Association, with a number of modifications of the official text of the Uniform Act. It was introduced in that form in the Nebraska Legislature by a lawyer-legislator {{at the request of the}} Bar Association. The statutory form provision was quietly stricken by the principal introducer on the morning of the public hearing before the Judiciary Committee at the request of a private client of the Bar Association’s lobbyists. It was stated that the Bar Association would provide a transfer of real property on death deed form, apparently without disclosure that Bar Association real estate conveyance forms are available to its members for a fee and are not directly available to the general public. It amounted to a stealth attack by lawyers during the legislative process. The Bar Association had previously studied and supported the statutory form provisions. There was no public discussion of the reasons for striking the statutory form. Subsequently, the official position of the Bar Association was changed from support to opposition of the statutory form. The interests of nonlawyer public consumers were not separately represented. The term “unauthorized practice of law” was not expressly relied upon or discussed openly but was always present in the background. Although the statutory form had been stripped from the bill by the time it reached the legislative floor, the legislation suffered further pro-lawyer, potentially anti-consumer amendments prior to enactment. Nebraska now has real property transfer on death legislation which was designed initially to be more simple and consumer-friendly than prior law. The statutes enacted turned out to be more complicated and unfriendly than the rules for other deeds of real property, self-proved wills, and even for executing an “ordinary” will. Nevertheless, despite substantial deviations from the official text of the Uniform Act, the policies and interests of consumerism would have been best served by a statutory form incorporating the legislation as enacted. This analysis examines why the objectives of the <b>statutory</b> <b>transfer</b> of real property on death deed form fared so poorly in the legislative arena. Each of the relevant groups involved bears some of the responsibility, from the initial preparation and presentation of the statutory form and commentary in the Uniform Act, to proponents of the legislation in Nebraska, to loosely drawn, ambiguous rules on the unauthorized practice of law, to the Judiciary Committee’s legislative study committee examining and reporting on each provision of the Act, to the lobbyists for the Bar Association and other private clients, and to individual members of the Legislature...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a surge in {{international}} empirical evidence that national policymakers allocate resources across regions based on political considerations, in addition to any normative considerations of equity and efficiency. In order to mitigate these political compulsions, several federations around the world have attempted to create independent constitutional bodies that are responsible for determining federal transfers to subnational jurisdictions. The author tests whether constitutional rules indeed make a difference in curbing political influence by contrasting the impact of political variables on two types of intergovernmental transfers to states in the Indian federation over a period of time, 1972 - 95. The pattern of evidence shows that transfers, whose regional distribution is determined by political agents, usually provide greater resources to state governments that are politically affiliated with the national ruling party and are important in maximizing the party's representation in the national legislature. But the political effect on <b>statutory</b> <b>transfers,</b> determined by an independent agency with constitutional authority, is strikingly contrary, with greater resources going to unaffiliated state governments. The author argues that this contrasting evidence indicates that constitutional rules indeed restrict the extent to which partisan politics can affect resources available to subnational governments.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} critically {{the awards}} {{of the recent}} Finance Commissions (FCs) {{in the specific context}} of the ongoing work of the Thirteenth Finance Commission (13 FC). The Commission is currently engaged in determining the quantum and modes of financial transfers from the Centre to different states for the five-year period beginning from 2010 - 11. It is the transfers which are being decided now by the present Commission that are going to determine in the medium term the size and the shape of the budgets and the plans of not only the State government but also of its local bodies. Our review of State’s finances shows that FC transfers account for about three-fifths of the total revenue transfers from the Centre to the State and about one-fifth of the State’s total revenue. The paper highlights the pitfalls in the approach of the earlier Commissions which resulted in progressive decrease in the flow of Central funds to Kerala, thus aggravating its fiscal crisis. The paper is divided into two sections. Section I presents an empirical study on how Kerala had fared in the matter of <b>Statutory</b> <b>transfers</b> in the past. It examines how different criteria adopted by different FCs affected Kerala.

To fulfill this mission, INL encourages its scientific, engineering, and technical staff to disclose new inventions and creations to ensure the resulting intellectual property is captured, protected, and made available to others who might benefit from it. As part of the mission, intellectual property is licensed to industrial partners for commercialization, creating jobs and delivering the benefits of federally funded technology to consumers. In other cases, unique capabilities are made available to other federal agencies or to regional small businesses to solve specific technical challenges. In other interactions, INL employees work cooperatively with researchers and other technical staff of our partners to further develop emerging technologies.

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{environmental issues}} facing a prospective seller of industrial real property. Because a seller generally {{will not be}} able to <b>transfer</b> <b>statutory</b> responsibility for environmental problems, it is advisable for the seller to investigate and remedy environmental problems prior to transferring the property. An environmental investigation may be required for the seller to make representations and warranties to buyers and lenders.

Information gained from environmental investigations can be useful during negotiations for sale and for contractual allocation of environmental responsibility. Where a site cleanup is required, information gained from an environmental investigation can serve as the basis for a remediation plan. As a result of an environmental investigation and site remediation, the seller will be in a stronger position to negotiate limitations on indemnity provisions requested by the buyer. The author concludes that given the current level of environmental awareness and regulation, cleaning up contaminated industrial property is not only good policy, it is good business...|$|R
40|$|Germany {{is known}} for its {{comprehensive}} health care coverage by sickness funds and private health insurers and its successful cost containment policy. The stabilization of health care expenditures as a percentage of GNP was enforced by five cost containment laws since 1977. The last one became effective in 1993 and the next ones are planned for 1996 and 2000. The 1993 law has initiated drastic changes of the system. Office based physicians will be paid by a mixture of capitation, fee-for-service and fees for combined service packages. The hospital financing will be transformed from the current per diem remuneration to a payment system where per diems are combined with payments based on diagnostic related groups and patient management categories. Up till now many restrictions exist for insurees to switch sickness funds. These limitations were removed by the 1993 law. To allow unbiased competition between sickness funds, a risk compensation pool, some kind of <b>statutory</b> reinsurance, will <b>transfer</b> financial resources from sickness funds with good risk structure to those with many bad risks.

40|$|UnrestrictedResearch {{develops}} an empirically derived cardinal {{model that}} prescribes handling and transfer of risks between organizations with hierarchical relationships. Descriptions of mission risk events, risk attitudes, and conditions for risk transfer are determined for client and underwriting entities associated with acquisition, production, and deployment of space systems. The hypothesis anticipates that large client organizations {{should be able}} to assume larger dollar-value risks of a program in comparison to smaller organizations even though many current risk transfer arrangements via space insurance violate this hypothesis. A literature survey covers conventional and current risk assessment methods, current techniques used in the satellite industry for complex system development, cardinal risk modeling, and relevant aspects of utility theory. Data gathered from open literature on demonstrated launch vehicle and satellite in-orbit reliability, annual space insurance premiums and losses, and ground fatalities and range damage associated with satellite launch activities are presented. Empirically derived models are developed for risk attitudes of space system clients and third-party underwriters associated with satellite system development and deployment. Two application topics for risk transfer are examined: the client-underwriter relationship on assumption or transfer of risks associated with first-year mission success, and <b>statutory</b> risk <b>transfer</b> agreements between space insurance underwriters and the US government to promote growth in both commercial client and underwriting industries. Results indicate that client entities with wealth of at least an order of magnitude above satellite project costs should retain risks to first-year mission success despite present trends.; Furthermore, large client entities such as the US government should never pursue risk transfer via insurance under previously demonstrated probabilities of mission success; potential savings may reasonably exceed multiple tens of $millions per space project. Additional results indicate that current US government statutory arrangements on risk sharing with underwriting entities appears reasonable with respect to stated objectives. This research combines aspects of multiple disciplines to include risk management, decision theory, utility theory, and systems architecting. It also demonstrates development of a more general theory on prescribing risk transfer criteria between distinct, but hierarchically associated entities involved in complex system development with applicability to a variety of technical domains...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{presents}} an energy analysis of selected building products, particularly thermal insulation materials. Efficient use of energy has gained importance over years, accordingly also rehabilitation of energy-intensive buildings in Slovenia. Most of current {{research in the}} field is focused on financial savings from measures of rehabilitation. Only few are focusing on embodied energy in comparison to the energy consumed in the amortization period of the thermal envelope. Aim of the thesis is to determine the reasonableness behind using building materials with high embodied energy with an intention to save the energy in the amortization period of the thermal envelope over thirty years. Our reference is a non-isolated object, where we defined the most important construction products for analysis and located the object into three different climatic zones with different duration of the heating season. On the basis of the statutory thermal transmittance of each building element, we calculated the energy consumed for heating per one square meter of the construction set. Using obtained data of embodied energy, densities and thermal characteristics of the material we calculated the amount of embodied energy. Later, we tensed limited heat transfers {{to such an extent that}} the ratio between embodied energy represented about a third of all consumed energy in the amortization period of the thermal envelope. The results showed that the majority of organic thermal insulation materials with the exception of cork, and most of the inorganic thermal insulation materials with the exception of foamed glass are reasonable to use in the thermal envelope of the building. The analysis has also shown that the terrace as a structural assembly of a mile <b>statutory</b> limits heat <b>transfer,</b> as it experiences excessive heat loss in the amortization period. The main finding is that the cork as insulating material from the perspective of energy is not suitable for the manufacture of thermal envelope as it never meets the desired requirements...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{contributes to the}} debate about what constitutes access to justice {{within the context of}} the Australian federal civil justice system. It is the story of how the case transfer processes of one federal court, when transferring so-called 2 ̆ 7 less complex 2 ̆ 7 cases to another federal court, can have a negative impact on access to justice for litigants within the system. This is so despite it, on the surface, appearing to function in accordance with principles of due process in the majority of cases and as the legislature intended. The nature of those sometimes hidden transfer processes and their implications, as well as the realities and tensions underlying the objectives of law reform, are revealed. The lesson learned is that recognising the vital role procedure plays in the justice system is essential in the delivery of quality justice in the implementation of law reform. The research explores the fact that significant reform of the federal civil justice system occurred in 1999 - 2000 with the establishment of both the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia as an additional federal court and a statutory system governing case transfers between it and the Federal Court of Australia, known in this thesis as the Federal Concurrent Jurisdiction System (FCJS). The legislature intended the FCJS to enhance access to justice by granting litigants greater choice of forum by providing a new cheaper, simpler and quicker forum for the resolution of general federal law disputes. At the same time, the Federal Court is granted power to change the forum by transferring matters it regards as more appropriate for determination by the other court, and thus reduce its workload to concentrate upon its 2 ̆ 7 more complex 2 ̆ 7 cases. The operation of the FCJS has been an overlooked area of public attention, both at the scholarly and court level. This is remarkable given the Federal Court utilises the FCJS to reduce its workload more than it does any other <b>statutory</b> case <b>transfer</b> scheme. The few previous empirical studies undertaken of the workings of the Federal Magistrates Court in relation to accessibility to justice have tended to focus upon matters commenced within the Court, and particularly with regard to the family law jurisdiction. This research redresses the absence of public examination of how the FCJS operates in both theory and practice in relation to general federal law cases commenced in the Federal Court, but then transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. The study answers the main research question - whether the operation of the FCJS creates any impediments to access to justice for cases transferred by the Federal Court to the Federal Magistrates Court - by taking a group of 204 finalised transferred matters. It evaluates, using quantitative and qualitative research methods, the extent to which the transfer processes employed in those matters accord with four principles of procedural justice (equality, openness, fairness and the provision of adequate reasons for decision). Access to procedural justice, rather than any other approach to evaluating access to justice, is chosen because of the discretionary power invoked to override the original choice of forum, and the importance of litigants participating fully in an accountable court system that instils public confidence by affording due process, fairness and transparency. The research methods employed are novel in that they evaluate the impact of law reform and the delivery of procedural justice through in-depth investigation of court computer records that reveal what transpires during case transfer processes. The overall findings of the research are generally positive for the operation of the FCJS. The true value of the findings, however, is in what they expose about the operation of the FCJS at the micro level and how this affects the administration of federal justice. To the extent the study reveals weaknesses in the delivery of procedural justice, it is argued the problem lies with both the nature of the statutory scheme and its implementation as part of managerial judging practices of the transferring court. The law reform objective of maintaining court efficiencies (reducing workload) should not prevail over the objective of providing access to justice. The implications for litigants (access to justice), the courts (workloads, accountability and public confidence) and the development of procedural jurisprudence are identified. The main solution to the problem is relatively straightforward - enhance transparency in transfer decision-making processes and public discussion in relation to this procedural, yet integral, part of the federal civil justice system...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. (Economics) Abstract: When {{faced with}} {{idiosyncratic}} risks and socio-economic shocks that drastically affect incomes {{and contribute to}} steep descent into poverty among vulnerable households, a range of responses is possible. On the one hand, <b>statutory</b> large-scale anti-poverty <b>transfers</b> are designed to facilitate exit from poverty. On the other hand, non-state agents design their own strategies in direct response to idiosyncratic shocks and stressors. In much of the social protection literature, transfers from the state to vulnerable households dominate the discussion. In contrast, an assessment of non-state strategies of poor households in mitigating risks and coping with shocks has received limited attention in the social protection literature in developing countries. This provides {{the focus of the}} study. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness and determinants of risk mitigation strategies employed by poor households in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Four strategies that are widely deployed by poor households are selected and discussed. The first strategy discussed is that of migration, which is a strategy used by households to cope with income shortages. The second strategy is that of risk sharing, where households form groups to mitigate the adverse effects of funeral expenses on food consumption and household property. The last two strategies are that of reciprocal giving within household networks of mutual assistance and emergency relief from donors, NGOs and/or faith-based organisations targeted to poor households. This thesis is grounded in the fieldwork conducted in three selected suburbs in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, {{in the second quarter of}} 2014. A household survey was designed for the purpose of the study. A two-stage cross-sectional survey was used. In the first stage, three suburbs were randomly selected. In the second stage, a systematic random sample of 300 households was selected from the population of households in the selected suburbs. This allows for a degree of generalisability of the findings to the rest of the poor suburbs in Bulawayo. Economic models were developed to provide a framework for the assessment of some risk management and coping strategies employed. The findings are outlined below. On average, each household has one migrant. Of all migrants, females, especially with children at the household of origin, contribute more to improving the welfare of members left behind. Migration may, however, not be an effective strategy if migrants are young, not educated and do not have a child at the household of origin. About two thirds of the households belong to a risk sharing group. The informal funeral insurance from these groups is partially effective in insuring food consumption and household property against funeral expenses hence households supplement this insurance by drawing from other sources of household finance. Again, about two thirds of households are networked with relatives and neighbours/ friends. The nature of the assistance received within these networks depends on the age and gender of the household head. Very few households (about 10 per cent) received emergency relief in the past five years. Receipt of this relief appears to be based on the targeting criteria set by the distributing agents such as international donors, NGOs and emergency relief agencies. However, the networks of households within burial societies seem to also influence the receipt of emergency relief [...] ...|$|R
