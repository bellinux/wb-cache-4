40|$|L-Ergothioneine (ET) is a sulfur-containing {{derivative}} of the amino acid histidine that offers unique antioxidant properties. The enzyme independent redox-chemistry of ET {{relies on the}} availability of the thiol tautomer to allow oxidative formation of disulfide bridges, i. e., the tautomeric equilibrium. To study the intrinsic properties of ET the tautomeric equilibrium is studied in the gas-phase by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. The IR ion spectra of isolated molecular ions of ET and of the biosynthetic precursors of ET, i. e., hercynine and Nε-methyl-hercynine are acquired. The analyte structures are independently investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and computed linear IR-spectra of tautomer ion structures are compared with the gas-phase spectra for identification. For the molecular ion of ET the simulated IR spectra of thione and thiol structures match the recorded IRMPD spectrum and that prevents an individual structure assignment. On the other hand, theory suggests that ET adopts a thione tautomer in MeOH solution which could be carried over from the condensed phase to gas phase and could be kinetically trapped after effective electrospray phase transfer and desolvation. Such a non-thermal behavior is also found for the molecular ions of protonated hercynine and Nε-methyl-hercynine. Contrary to that, the <b>sodium</b> <b>complex</b> ions of ET, hercynine and Nε-methyl-hercynine adopt the respective ground structures predicted by theory, which are reliably identified spectroscopically.

A comparison between the proton and carbon longitudinal relaxation times of lasalocid in nonpolar and polar solvents demonstrates that the free acid (HX) is a monomer in methanol solution. Parallel proton and carbon relaxation measurements demonstrate that the anion (X-), <b>sodium</b> <b>complex</b> (NaX), and barium complex (BaX+) are also monomeric in methanol solution. These results are {{in contrast to the}} Na 2 X 2 dimer and the BaX 2 -H 20 dimer observed in crystals and in nonpolar (cyclohexane and methylene chloride) solutions. Large downfield shifts on complex formation (X- to NaX and BaX+) are detected for protons located on the polar face of the ionophore with their C-H bonds directed towards and proximal to the metal ion. The exchange of lasalocid anion between free (X-) and complexed (BaX+) states in methanol can be monitored from the temperature-dependent line shapes of the proton resonances at superconducting fields. The exchange rates are independent of the reactant concentrations and are characteristic of a rate-determining dissociation of BaX+ in methanol solution with activation parameters delta H++ = 6. 5 kcal mol- 1 (25 degrees) and delta S++ = - 20. 0 cal mol- 1 degree - 1 (1 cal = 4. 184 J).

In this study we evaluated various commercial lots of <b>sodium</b> copper chlorophyllin <b>complex</b> to identify the primary small molecule constituents, and to test various <b>sodium</b> copper chlorophyllin <b>complexes</b> and their small molecule analog compounds for hyaluronidase inhibitory activity in vitro. Ascorbate analogs were tested in combination with copper chlorophyllin complexes for potential additive or synergistic activity. Materials and methods: For hyaluronidase activity assays, dilutions of test materials were evaluated for hydrolytic activity of hyaluronidase by precipitation of non-digested hyaluronate by measuring related turbidity at 595 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy was used to analyze and identify the primary small molecule constituents in various old and new commercial lots of <b>sodium</b> copper chlorophyllin <b>complex.</b> Results: The most active small molecule component of <b>sodium</b> copper chlorophyllin <b>complex</b> was disodium copper isochlorin e 4, followed by oxidized disodium copper isochlorin e 4. <b>Sodium</b> copper chlorophyllin <b>complex</b> and copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had hyaluronidase inhibitory activity down to 10 µg/mL. The oxidized form of copper isochlorin e 4 disodium salt had substantial hyaluronidase inhibitory activity at 100 µg/mL but not at 10 µg/mL.

The calcium complex [{Ph 2 P(O) NH(2, 6 -Me 2 C 6 H 3) CaI(THF) 3 }I] (3) was obtained by the reaction between the neutral ligand 1 and anhydrous calcium diiodide in THF at ambient temperature. The solid-state structures of the complexes were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In the solid-state structure of 2, the sodium ion is coordinated through the chelation of oxygen atom attached to the phosphorus atom. Two different P-N and P-O bond lengths are observed, which indicates that one ligand moiety is anionic, whereas the second one is neutral. In the solid-state structure of 3, the calcium atom adopts distorted octahedral arrangement through the ligation of two phosphinic amide ligands, three THF molecules, and one iodide ion.

With 1 {{each of the two}} independent centrosymmetric tetramers in the repeating unit of the complex comprises four independent antimony ions and eight citrate residues interlinked by two potassium centres [K-O range 2. 62 - 3. 06 (1) Å]. The difference between the two tetramers is that potassium is seven-coordinate in one and eight-coordinate in the other. The water molecules are coordinated to the potassium ions. Each antimony forms the usual distorted pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal four-coordinate complex through the α-hydroxy carboxylate oxygens of two citrate residues. A feature of the structure is the presence of three differently charged citrate species (1 -, 2 -, 3 -), giving the formula {K[Sb(CHO) ][Sb(CJO) (CHO) ](HO) }. The coordination about antimony in 2 is similar, but the lithium links the two citrate residues together via carboxyl and a hydroxyl oxygen from one ligand and a carboxyl oxygen from the second. A water completes the tetrahedral coordination sphere [mean LiO, 1. 942 (5) Å].

The Disintegration time (Y 1) and Wetting time (Y 2) wereselected as dependent variables.

A cost effectiveness model was developed, consistent with the DRIVE studies, using decision analysis with a 12 -week time horizon. The primary effectiveness measure was the mean hemoglobin increase in the intent to treat patient groups comparing epoetin with or without <b>sodium</b> ferric gluconate <b>complex.</b> Costs were computed using projected 2007 US Medicare reimbursements for the treatments and for serious adverse events, with the effectiveness factored by the increase in hemoglobin. The net savings for <b>sodium</b> ferric gluconate <b>complex</b> plus epoetin treatment was $ 1390 compared to epoetin alone for each g/dl hemoglobin increase over 12 weeks of study. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the impact of change in the variables (using medians or means and actual 2005 or projected 2007 Medicare reimbursements) and these affirmed the robustness of the model.

Precise information about 23 Na quadrupole coupling constants and chemical shifts was determined from analysis of 23 Na magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra. We found that the experimental 23 Na chemical shifts {{can be related to}} an empirical parameter that {{is a function of the}} atomic valence of the donor ligand, the Na+-ligand distance, and the coordination number (CN) around the Na+ ion of interest. A reasonably good correlation was also observed between the 23 Na quadrupole parameters measured in CDCl 3 solution and those measured in the solid state, indicating that the cation exchange is slow in CDCl 3. In MeOH solution, however, neither 23 Na quadrupole parameters nor chemical shifts of the Na-ionophore complexes show correlation with the corresponding solid-state data.
