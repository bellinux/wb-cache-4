40|$|<b>Salvage</b> <b>felling</b> {{is one of}} the {{indicators}} of the forest health quality and stability. Most of the European Union countries monitor forest harmful agents, which account for <b>salvage</b> <b>felling,</b> in order to see trends or functionality between factors {{and to be able to}} predict their development. The systematic evidence of forest harmful agents and volume of <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> in Slovakia started at the Forest Research Institute in Zvolen in 1960. The paper focuses on the occurrence of the most relevant harmful agents and volume of <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> in the Slovak forests over the last decade. Within the 10 years period (2004 – 2013) <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> in Slovakia reached 42. 31 mil. m 3 of wood, which was 53. 2 % of the total felling. Wind and European spruce bark beetle Ips typographus damaged 78. 4 % of salvage wood, i. e. they were the most important pest agents. Norway spruce (Picea abies) was the most frequently damaged tree species that represented the amount of 35. 6 mil. m 3 of wood (81. 2 % of total volume of <b>salvage</b> <b>felling).</b> As Norway spruce grows mostly in mountains, these regions of Central and Northern Slovakia were most affected. At the damaged localities new forests were prevailingly established with regard to suitable ecological conditions for trees, climate change scenarios and if possible, natural regeneration has been preferred. These approaches in forest stand regeneration together with silvicultural and control measures are assumed to gradually decrease the amount of <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> over long term perspective...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{the scope of the}} forest health debate in the northwestern USA should be {{expanded}} beyond just the health and marketability of trees. Ecological generalizations and misconceptions that have been used to support the current forest health assumptions and to guide policy development are discussed. Management techniques are recommended for the appropriate use of forest health treatments, e. g. thinning, controlled burning, <b>salvage</b> <b>felling,</b> and a comprehensive land management strategy is proposed which addresses a broad range of issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{proportion}} of <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> caused by Armillaria, selected according to age classes and is also focused on the bark beetles, which colonize infected trees. Armillaria infestation is very acute in the selected area of LS Ruda nad Moravou, the district of Brníčko. A part of the thesis is an evaluation of the influence of abiotic factors on the activation of Armillaria and bark beetle, their species spectrum in the selected territory. The results show that the high temperature and lack of precipitation cause physiological weakening of trees, which are susceptible to Armillaria attacking and bark beetles...|$|E
40|$|Post-fire {{salvage logging}} {{is a common}} {{silvicultural}} practice around the world, {{with the potential to}} alter the regenerative capacity of an ecosystem and thus its role as a source or a sink of carbon. However, there is no information on the effect of burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance. Here, we examine {{for the first time the}} effect of post-fire burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance by comparing the carbon exchange of two treatments in a burnt Mediterranean coniferous forest treated by <b>salvage</b> logging (SL, <b>felling</b> and removing the logs and masticating the woody debris) and Non-Intervention (NI, all trees left standing) using eddy covariance measurements. Using different partitioning approaches, we analyze the evolution of photosynthesis and respiration processes together with measurements of vegetation cover and soil respiration and humidity to interpret the differences in the measured fluxes and underlying processes. Results show that SL enhanced CO 2 emissions of this burnt pine forest by more than 120 g C m??? 2 compared to the NI treatment for the period June???December 2009. Although soil respiration was around 30 % higher in NI during growing season, this was more than offset by photosynthesis, as corroborated by increases in vegetation cover and evapotranspiration. Since SL is counterproductive to climate-change and Kyoto protocol objectives of optimal C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, less aggressive burnt wood management policies should be considered...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the localisation and quantification of deforestation and forest damage in Norway spruce forests in northern Czech Republic using Landsat data. Severe defoliation increases the spectral reflectance in all wavelength bands, {{especially in the}} mid infrared region. These spectral differences allow the separation of three damage categories with an accuracy of 75 % using TM data and regression-based relationships. Estimating the same categories using an artificial neural network, multitemporal TM data and topographic data yields slightly higher accuracy (78 %). The methods are comparable when using identical input data, but the neural network more efficiently manage large input data sets without pre-processing. The estimated coniferous deforestation in northern Bohemia from 1972 to 1989 reveals especially affected areas between 600 and 1000 m. a. s. l. and on slopes facing south and southeast. The sector downwind a large source of sulphur dioxide was strongly deforested. Comparing regional forest damage statistics to three methods estimating harmful effects of sulphur dioxide on Norway spruce yielded significant relationships versus level of forest damage and accumulated <b>salvage</b> <b>felling.</b> Quantifying the effect of data uncertainties permit mapping the probabilities of areas to be significantly over or below thresholds for harmful effects on spruce forests. Satellite based estimation of coniferous forest health is a good complement to field surveys and aerial photography...|$|E
40|$|The work {{deals with}} the issue of {{regenerating}} clearings due to <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> at mountain altitudes. Development was monitored on research plots Sokol in the Hrubý Jeseník Mts. (15 plots) and Jizerka in the Jizerské Mts. (15 plots). The aim was to assess the developing young plantations of Norway spruce, European beech, European larch and Carpathian pubescent birch in particular, as well as of sycamore maple, European mountain ash and Silesian willow aged 9 [...] 14 years after planting. The assessment was focused primarily on the mensurational variables of the tree species (height, root collar diameter, crown diameter, and their increments). Part of the work was to evaluate the condition of soil environment, nutrition, root system architecture and health of Norway spruce. The best growth was shown by European larch. By contrast, the use of sycamore maple, European mountain ash and Silesian willow did not prove well. The mixing of Norway spruce and European beech was demonstrated to have a significantly favourable influence on the growth of the two species. The root system was confined to humus horizons only and all individuals exhibited deformation into a tangle. Analyses of soil conditions revealed that the effect of liming had persisted even after 20 years and the nutritional condition of the trees pointed to the luxurious supply namely of calcium and magnesium...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the status of}} spruce stands in the Kysuce and Orava region was performed and their health condition was compared to the spruce forest constitution in the rest of Slovakia. For this purpose, the inventory plots established within the first circle of National Forest Inventory (NFI) in 2005 and 2006 were used. The Kysuce and Orava regions significantly differ from the rest of Slovak forests by its high proportion of spruce. The health status of the spruce stands in these regions, according to the <b>salvage</b> <b>felling</b> {{as a result of the}} damage caused prevailingly by stem rotting and bark beetles appears worse than in the rest of Slovakia. The analysis showed that not only the acute damage of spruce stands (insects) but also the chronic damage of trees (rotting, mechanical damage during logging) is more serious in these regions than in the rest of Slovakia. The browsing caused by deer game (data does not include young stands) in both regions as well as in the rest of Slovakia seems to be low and not so serious compared to the previously mentioned types of damage. Other sorts of damage (stem breakage, standing dead trees, or damage by insect) have also small proportion. More detailed analyses of NFI data with acceptable precision were possible only for most frequent kinds of damages such as stem rotting and damage by logging. The results showed the frequency of rotting tended to be higher with increasing stand age. Influence of altitude on the frequency of the damage was not evident. Since variability of selected types of damage on spruce forest in the target regions was high, all results are presented with the precision at 68 % confidence interval. - 1...|$|E
