25|$|Saturn Apollo flight {{profiles}} varied considerably by mission. All missions began, however, with liftoff under {{power of the}} first stage. To more smoothly control engine ignition, thrust buildup and liftoff of the vehicle, restraining arms provided support and hold down at four points {{around the base of}} the S-IC stage.

25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E

25|$|The most {{northwest}} {{portion of}} the American Southwest is covered by the Mojave Desert. Bordered on the south by the Sonoran Desert and the east by the Colorado Plateau, its range within the region makes up the southeast tip of Nevada, and the northwestern corner of Arizona. In terms of topography, the Mojave {{is very similar to}} the Great Basin Desert, which lies just to its north. Within the region, Las Vegas is the most populous city; other significant areas of human habitation include Laughlin and Pahrump in Nevada, and Lake Havasu City, Kingman, and Bullhead City in Arizona. The Mojave is the smallest, driest and hottest desert within the United States. The Mojave gets less than <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> rain annually, and its elevation ranges from 3000 to 6000 feet above sea level. The most prolific vegetation is the tall Joshua tree, which grow as tall as 40 feet, and are thought to live almost 1000 years. Other major vegetation includes the Parry saltbush and the Mojave sage, both only found in the Mojave, as well as the creosote bush.|$|E
25|$|Two flaws {{emerged in}} Maines protection, both due to {{technological}} developments between her laying-down and her completion. The {{first was a}} lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with Texas. The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, nickel steel was the first modern steel alloy armor and, with a figure of merit of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of mild steel used until then. Harvey steel and Krupp armors, both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of nickel steel. Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the s, designed after Maine, but commissioned at roughly the same time.|$|E

500|$|In 1904, Admiral John [...] "Jacky" [...] Fisher became First Sea Lord, {{the senior}} {{officer of the}} Royal Navy. He had for some time thought about the {{development}} of a new fast armoured ship. He was very fond of the [...] "second-class battleship" [...] , a faster, more lightly armoured battleship. As early as 1901, there is confusion in Fisher's writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments. This did not stop him from commissioning designs from naval architect W. H. Gard for an armoured cruiser with the heaviest possible armament for use with the fleet. The design Gard submitted was for a ship between , capable of , armed with four 9.2-inch and twelve [...] guns in twin gun turrets and protected with <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> armour along her belt and 9.2-inch turrets, [...] on her 7.5-inch turrets, 10 inches on her conning tower and up to [...] on her decks.
