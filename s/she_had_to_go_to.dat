500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Denmark {{to work on the}} film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E
2500|$|In August–September 2008, she {{competed in}} her second Women's World Chess Championship at Nalchik, Russia. She had {{qualified}} by {{being one of}} the six highest rated players from the average of the July 2006–January 2007 period. In this knockout tournament, she was seeded 3rd out of 64 players. She defeated WGM Mona Khaled (Egypt) 2–0 in the first round and WGM Bathuyang Mongontuul (Mongolia), 2–0 in the second. In third round, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> rapid playoffs to eventually beat IM Elena Sedina (Italy) 3–1 (1–1, 2–0). In the quarterfinals she defeated Armenian IM Lilit Mkrtchian 1½–½, followed by Indian GM Humpy Koneru, the second seed, in the semifinals (4–2 overall, 1–1, 1–1, 2–0). She lost the final to Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia, 2½–1½. Nonetheless she became the youngest ever finalist for the Women's World Championship title, earning an automatic International Master (IM) title and a [...] "runner-up 9-game grandmaster norm", her fourth GM norm overall. Her performance rating for the entire championship was 2536.|$|E

6000|$|He {{gave her}} no {{opportunity}} of self-satisfaction, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on unaided, {{which she did}} in a vanquished tone, verging on tears: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{four blocks}} <b>to</b> the nearest drug-store {{that would be}} open {{at this time of}} night, and there {{telephone}} the doctor.|$|R
60|$|And by {{that time}} she was so tired, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> luncheon.|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not find}} the notes. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the {{managing}} editor, trembling, all her good little heart wild with pain. The editor's brows made a V at her report, and he grunted, [...] "Well--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{she will}} tell you so many things and I shall not hear them," [...] grumbled Mab, who felt herself in {{the first volume of}} a {{delightful}} romance and obliged to miss some chapters because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> pupils.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned toward}} the door ready <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> {{but in order to}} reach it from where <b>she</b> stood, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> past the foot of the bed.|$|R
60|$|And so her {{afternoon}} was one long fret. Broken at intervals. Three times <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down stairs on errands--that is, <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> six glimpses of him, in the aggregate, {{without seeming to}} look in his direction; {{and she tried to}} endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign, but they fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt that the naturalness she was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and hysterically calm to deceive.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{home and}} confess to her master, who first scolded her and {{afterwards}} beat her. 'Now go,' he ended, 'and {{look after the}} pigs!' ...|$|R
60|$|Ethel lighted up, {{and enjoyed}} herself when talking was going on--her periods of ennui were {{when she had}} to set about any home employment--when Aubrey's lessons did not go well--when she wanted to speak to her father, and could not catch him; and even when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Cocksmoor.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have another opinion. Emily sent her love; she would have come in, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Niagara. Everybody goes there; it's the place now. Rachel goes every morning: she overdoes it--she'll be laid up one of these days. There's a fancy ball there to-night; the Duke gives the prizes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. This is {{the fourth}} day. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Scotland. A matter of duty, you understand, and the doctors would not let me go. Not that I would have allowed them to stop me, but she was on their side. Now, thank God! it is over, and she may be here at any moment." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him for everything. Two hundred a {{year and}} not a penny she could call her own!

If she could only screw her courage to the sticking-point the question would be settled for once and all.|$|E
6000|$|He left her, {{and went}} to receive the {{commands}} of a lady who was leaning over the desk, and saying severely, [...] "My mail, if you please," [...] and Clementina could not {{wait for him to}} come back; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Lander, and get her ready for breakfast; Ellida had taught Mrs. Lander a luxury of helplessness in which she persisted after the maid's help was withdrawn.|$|E
6000|$|Susan got up {{and went}} to bed by [...] "God's time," [...] and {{regulated}} her own goings and comings by it. She served the meals, under protest, by Borden's time, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church by it, which was the crowning injury. But she said her prayers by her own clock, and fed the hens by it; so that there was always a furtive triumph in her eye when she looked at the doctor. She had got the better of him by so much at least.|$|E
6000|$|... "This girl hasn't {{been very}} good, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from the village, or else her family have. He {{wants me to}} find a place for her in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "No; Agnes engaged {{her at the}} intelligence-office, {{and told}} her we should meet her here, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back for her purse, and left me to explain." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> but {{not till}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> given her mother a kiss {{that is a}} {{challenge}} to the world. Then to the bewilderment of Steve two human frames are rocked with laughter.|$|R
60|$|That afternoon's {{dissipation}} {{had made}} it needful to do double work the next day, and Gillian was again disappointed. Then came Saturday, when Miss Mohun was never available, nor was she on Monday; and when it appeared that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{a meeting at the}} Cathedral town on Tuesday, Gillian grew desperate, and at her tete-a-tete meal with Aunt Ada, related the whole history of the Whites, and her great desire to show kindness to her father's old brother-officer's family, and how much she was disappointed.|$|E
60|$|She ceased crying at last, {{and slowly}} crept upstairs, glad to meet no one, and {{that not even}} Josephine was there to see her red eyes. Her muslin frock was on the bed, and she managed to dress herself, and run down again unseen; she stood over the fire, so that the housemaid, who brought in her tea, should not see her face; {{and by the time}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the drawing-room, the {{mottling}} of her face had abated under the influence of a story-book, which always drove troubles away for the time.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> {{tea with}} him. She avoided his love-making, by telling him {{any sort of}} spooniness revolted her. And he was too much an old {{bachelor}} to take easily to a fondling habit--before marriage, at least. So he mercifully left her alone: {{he was on the}} whole devoutly thankful she wanted to be left alone. But he wanted her to be there. That was his greatest craving. He wanted her to be always there. And so he craved for marriage: to possess her entirely, and to have her always there with him, so that he was never alone. Alone and apart from all the world: but by her side, always by her side.|$|E
60|$|She {{crouched}} quite {{still on}} the hearth. He turned aside his face. After {{a moment or two}} he went out. She stirred her pot slowly and sadly. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> downstairs for something.|$|R
60|$|So {{all went}} well and happily for a time, {{but then she}} began to be very sad and sorrowful, for all day long <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about alone; and she did so wish <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home <b>to</b> her father and mother and {{brothers}} and sisters. Then the White Bear asked {{what it was that}} she wanted, and she told him that it was so dull there in the mountain, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about all alone, and that in her parents' house at home there were all her brothers and sisters, and it was because she could not <b>go</b> <b>to</b> them that she was so sorrowful.|$|R
5000|$|Helios pretends nothing happened, {{and asks}} Mineko to attend [...] "the festival" [...] {{that was held}} to greet her. Mineko says <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> Earth, where her only beloved person lives, {{saddening}} Helios.|$|R
60|$|Then Mrs. Carey {{remembered that}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the grocer, and they {{continued}} their way. When the shopping was done they often went down {{a side street}} of little houses, mostly of wood, in which fishermen dwelt (and {{here and there a}} fisherman sat on his doorstep mending his nets, and nets hung to dry upon the doors), till they came to a small beach, shut in on each side by warehouses, but {{with a view of the}} sea. Mrs. Carey stood for a few minutes and looked at it, it was turbid and yellow, [and who knows what thoughts passed through her mind?] while Philip searched for flat stones to play ducks and drakes. Then they walked slowly back. They looked into the post office to get the right time, nodded to Mrs. Wigram the doctor's wife, who sat at her window sewing, and so got home.|$|E
60|$|Tessa {{sat on the}} low stool, nursing her knees, for {{a minute}} or two, with her little soul poised in {{fluttering}} excitement on the edge of this pleasant transgression. It was quite irresistible. She had been commanded to make no acquaintances, and warned that if she did, all her new happy lot would vanish away, and be like a hidden treasure that turned to lead {{as soon as it was}} brought to the daylight; and she had been so obedient that when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church she had kept her face shaded by her hood and had pursed up her lips quite tightly. It was true her obedience had been a little helped by her own dread lest the alarming stepfather Nofri should turn up even in this quarter, so far from the Por' del Prato, and beat her at least, if he did not drag her back to work for him. But this old man was not an acquaintance; he was a poor stranger going to sleep in the outhouse, and he probably knew nothing of stepfather Nofri; and, besides, if she took him some supper, he would like her, and not want to tell anything about her. Monna Lisa would say she must not go and talk to him, therefore Monna Lisa must not be consulted. It did not signify what she found out after it had been done.|$|E
