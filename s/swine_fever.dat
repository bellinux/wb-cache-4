5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{have put}} and still, are putting much effort in {{applying}} the DIVA principle {{to a wide}} range of infectious diseases, such as, for example, classical <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> avian influenza, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia and Salmonella infections in pigs.|$|E
25|$|Common {{themes and}} {{techniques}} in Cartmel's novels include: animal rights; {{the use of}} animal perspectives; and extended metaphors of animal behaviour. These elements appear in the three Virgin New Adventures novels, the original novel The Wise, the Judge Dredd novel <b>Swine</b> <b>Fever</b> and the audio play Animal.|$|E

25|$|Thymidine kinase {{is present}} in animals, plants, some bacteria, archeans and virus. The {{thymidine}} kinases from pox viruses, African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus, Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein- Barr virus have been identified and to a varying degree characterized. The enzyme form in virus {{is different from that}} in other organisms. Thymidine kinase is not present in fungi.|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} classes of thymidine kinases {{have been identified}} and are included in this super family: one family groups together thymidine kinase from herpesvirus as well as cellular thymidylate kinases, the second family groups TK from various sources that include, vertebrates, bacteria, the bacteriophage T4, poxviruses, African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (ASFV) and Fish lymphocystis disease virus (FLDV). The major capsid protein of insect iridescent viruses also belongs to this family. The Prosite pattern recognizes only the cellular type of thymidine kinases.|$|E
25|$|A {{biological}} {{research facility}} in Tbilisi, Georgia, {{is named for}} Lugar {{in honor of his}} efforts to reduce nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons around the world. The Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research is a Georgian biological research facility established with technical assistance from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to contain and house dangerous pathogens and support international research efforts. This and other upgraded bio-threat reduction facilities in the region are designed to stop diseases like plague and African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> from spreading globally.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001 Valentine, {{along with}} a {{colleague}} were fined for trespassing on to a pig farm in north Norfolk to gather evidence of cruelty and the poor living conditions. They were fined nearly £5,000 after they pleaded guilty to entering an infected place, namely Woodlands Farm, without written permit during a <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> outbreak. District Judge Patrick Heley described {{the way in which}} Valentine and her accomplice gathered their evidence as [...] "improper, illegal, intrusive and irresponsible", he also dismissed their video evidence.|$|E
2500|$|African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (ASFV) {{is a large}} {{double-stranded}} DNA virus which replicates in the cytoplasm {{of infected}} cells {{and is the only}} member of the Asfarviridae family. The virus causes a lethal haemorraghic disease in domestic pigs. [...] Some strains can cause death of animals within as little as a week after infection. In other species, the virus causes no obvious disease. ASFV is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and exists in the wild through a cycle of infection between ticks and wild pigs, bushpigs and warthogs.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cattle tick}} conference in May 1907, convened by the {{agricultural}} department, approved the motion [...] "that a bacteriologist {{be attached to}} the Department of Agriculture and Stock to investigate diseases in stock" [...] with mention of regaining the services of Pound. It was reported the government decided that while Pound was to continue supervising the institute's work on plague outbreaks and other human pathology, his attention should again be directed to livestock: tick fever, pleuropneumonia, lumpy jaw, <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> swamp cancer, sheep parasites, and poultry diseases. As a result, in August 1907 supervision and control of the institute were returned to the agricultural department.|$|E
2500|$|On Duvalier's {{death in}} April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as [...] "Baby Doc"). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's {{economic}} and political condition continued to decline, {{although some of the}} more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} over the years, came from the Régie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estimé, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept. His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorcée, Michèle Bennett, in a $3million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Michèle, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's kleptocracy left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus—which, at the insistence of USAID officials, led to the slaughter of the creole pigs, the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when Pope John Paul II condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.|$|E
