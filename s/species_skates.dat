40|$|Weight–Body Length {{relationships}} (WLR) of 45 {{fish species}} (37 Actinopterygii and eight Elasmobranchii) were investigated. A total of 31, 167 individuals were caught and their biological parameters measured {{during the four}} quarters from 2013 to 2015, on five scientific surveys sampling the North-eastern Atlantic Ocean from the North Sea to the Bay of Biscay (ICES Divisions IVb, IVc, VIId, VIIe, VIIg, VIIh, VIIj, VIIIa and VIIIb). Among 45 tested species, all showed a significant correlation between total length (L) and total weight (W). The influence of sex on WLR was estimated for 39 species and presented a significant sexual dimorphism for 18 species. Condition factor (K) of females was always higher than for males. Moreover, a spatial effect on the WLR according to five ecoregions (the Bay of Biscay, the Celtic Sea, the Western English Channel, the Eastern English Channel and the North Sea), was significant for 18 species among 38 tested species. The temporal effect was tested according to components (year and quarter/season). The seasonality effect on WLR is more frequently significant than the year especially for the Elasmobranchii species, and {{can be related to}} the spawning season. Finally, depressiform <b>species</b> (<b>skates,</b> sharks and flatfish) are characterized by positive allometric growth, whereas there is no such clear pattern regarding roundfishes growth, whatever their body shape is...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs have life-history {{characteristics}} {{that make them}} more vulnerable to fishing than many teleost fish. As commercial landings data are usually not sufficient for the monitoring and assessment of elasmobranchs, fisheries-independent data, geostatistics and Geographic Information Systems were used to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of sharks (6 <b>species),</b> <b>skates</b> (9 species) and stingray in the eastern English Channel. Temporal trends in relative abundance and distributions of total-length frequencies were investigated using data collected over 21 yr from an annual survey using a Grande Ouverture Verticale (GOV) trawl. Temporal trends in relative abundance were examined qualitatively {{in relation to the}} reported conservation status for the various species. Most individuals captured for 7 of the species were immature. The GOV trawl was more efficient at sampling demersal sharks than batoids (skates and rays), especially small-sized batoids. Geostatistics were effectively used to explore, identify and quantify the spatial structure of the distributions of 13 species. The more abundant species displayed significantly larger patch diameters. Three shark species (Scyliorhinus canicula, S. stellaris and Galeorhinus galeus) were found to be spatially segregated by sex. The shark species tended to occur in the deeper waters of the area, while skates were found to be more coastal in their distribution. Results have contributed to a greater understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns in elasmobranch species in the eastern English Channel and are of relevance to future marine spatial planning and the development of long-term management plans for elasmobranchs in the area and elsewhere...|$|E

50|$|Spotback skates are {{particularly}} vulnerable to extinction due to their large body size relative to other <b>skate</b> <b>species.</b> According to Dulvy & Reynolds (2002), <b>skate</b> <b>species</b> considered to be locally extinct have larger body sizes compared to all other skates. Large body size is in turn correlated with higher mortality rates and with life-history parameters such as late age at maturity. Another study by García et al. (2007) also corroborated {{the notion that a}} large body size increased the extinction risk in elasmobranchs. Spotback skates are also especially vulnerable to trawl fisheries because they inhabit the soft bottom substrates of the ocean (Ebert; Sulikowski, 2007). Consequently, the biomass of spotback skates has decreased by 75% from 1994 to 1999.|$|R
