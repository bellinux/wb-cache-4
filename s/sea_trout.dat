5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> returning to the river to spawn.|$|E
5|$|Plankton support {{marine life}} {{including}} oysters, shrimp and other invertebrates, and bait-fish species including menhaden and mullet, {{which in turn}} support larger fish and mammal species that populate the local waterways. Popular sport fish in the Hilton Head Island area include the red drum (or spot tail bass), spotted <b>sea</b> <b>trout,</b> sheepshead, cobia, tarpon, and various shark species.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{nature reserve}} at Brofjorden, Ryxö island and Broälven. Ryxö, {{sometimes}} spelt Rixö, established in 1968 with {{an area of}} 61 ha, is {{an island in the}} middle of the fjord. The central part is the island has a deciduous forest, mainly oaks and meadows intersected by steep cliffs. Broälven, established in 1995 with an area of 194 ha comprises the land at the shallow north end of Brofjorden and the banks of Broälven which has its outlet in the fjord. The shallow area at the mouth of the river is a valuable habitat for <b>sea</b> <b>trouts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and <b>sea</b> <b>trout,</b> were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{incidents}} in recent years where the river has been polluted and fish have been killed. In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river. This resulted in sediment running into the river and the flooding of the plant. Fish were not directly harmed by this incident, and the Water Service carried out an investigation to assure drinking water had not been affected. However, concerns were raised by the Shimna Anglers Club that this was not the first time building work had affected the river, and that there was the possibility of long term harm to the salmon and <b>sea</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the fish}} farmed more intensively around the world today are carnivorous, for example Atlantic salmon, <b>trout,</b> <b>sea</b> bass, and turbot. In the {{development}} of modern aquaculture, starting in the 1970s, fishmeal and fish oil were key components of the feeds for these species. They are combined with other ingredients such as vegetable proteins, cereal grains, vitamins and minerals and formed into feed pellets. Wheat, for example, is widely used as it helps to bind the ingredients in the pellets.|$|R
40|$|Project n° 513692 Combined {{genetic and}} {{functional}} genomic approaches for stress and disease resistance marker assisted selection in fish and shellfish: AQUAFIRST The overall {{aims of the}} project is to identify, in sea bream, sea bass, oyster, and rainbow trout, genes of which expression is associated with disease and stress resistance and, from this information, to develop genetic approaches that allow characterisation of genetic markers for marker-assisted selective breeding of disease and/or stress resistant individuals. For such project, the following main objectives {{will have to be}} reached: 	Characterisation in sea bream, <b>sea</b> bass, <b>trout</b> and oyster, stress- and disease-responsive genes as potential candidate gene markers for desirable traits; 	Seeking associations between (i) variations in response to stress and resistance to pathogen and (ii) selected candidates genes and microsatellites markers by segregation analysis in appropriate families (QTL analysis); 	Mapping of these genes in linkage and gene maps. In order to characterize disease and stress-responsive genes in seabream, <b>sea</b> bass, <b>trout</b> and oyster, a functional genomic using microarray technology have been developed. During the second year of the project, all planned cDNA collections have been obtained and sequenced which allow the project, y combining his genomic resources with that of Marine Genomic Europe NoE to establish a database containing a large collections of EST for seabass, seabream, oyster and rainbow trout. These cDNA will be spotted on microarrays for seabream, seabass and oyster. For trout, this collection allowed the design of synthetic oligonucleotides which have been spotted in microarrays. All partners have been trained to analysis of microarray data and in vivo stress/pathogen exposure experiments have been carried out and validated. Gene profile analysis will be performed during {{the first part of the}} 3 rd year. During the second year of the project, we have also carried on several tasks devoted to characterization of genetic markers associated with stress or disease resistance. This includes search for SNP in stress or disease-resistant genes, production of relevant biological material (oyster and trout) on which a QTL analysis would be developed, development of new genetic markers (microsatellites) which would be later used for genotyping individuals in QTL protocols, construction of a radiation hybrid panel for sea bass. ...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on welfare aspect of the main systems of stunning and killing of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the EU.

A semi-quantitative risk assessment approach was used to rank the risks of poor welfare associated with the different commercially applied stunning and killing methods for Atlantic salmon. The risk assessment was also used to identify other areas of concern, as well as to provide guidance for future research. The risk assessment was mainly based on expert opinion, due to the limited amount of quantitative data and published peer-reviewed data on many effects of hazards associated with killing of Atlantic salmon.

25|$|Two weirs {{impede the}} flow of the river at Durham, both {{originally}} created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> and salmon, and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994, it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).|$|E
25|$|By the 1750s, Larbert {{constituted}} a small settlement {{on the main}} road between Falkirk and Stirling, which was turnpiked by an Act of Parliament in 1752.

These mills shut down in the 1980s and since then salmon and <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> have returned in good numbers. The surrounding population, largely scattered, engaged in agriculture and took part in the important Falkirk Tryst (cattle market) held annually in nearby Stenhousemuir. In the 1950s, archaeological excavations to the north of present-day Larbert uncovered remains of a substantial pottery works with eight kilns dating from the 15th or 16thcenturies (Hall and Hunter 2001).|$|E
25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), <b>sea</b> <b>trout</b> (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), European bullhead (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and wels catfish (Siluris glanis). The endangered species include grayling (Thymallus thymallus), burbot (Lota lota) and bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus) and the non-native species are represented by the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris).|$|E

Lepeophtheirus salmonis can parasitize other salmonids to varying degrees, including brown <b>trout</b> (<b>sea</b> trout: Salmo trutta), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and all species of Pacific salmon. In the case of Pacific salmon, coho, chum, and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. keta, and O. gorbuscha, respectively) mount strong tissue responses to attaching L. salmonis, which lead to rejection within {{the first week of}} infection. Pacific L. salmonis can also develop, but not complete, its full life cycle on the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). This has not been observed with Atlantic L. salmonis.|$|R
50|$|Six {{species of}} fish are found in {{freshwater}} areas including the zebra trout (Aplochiton zebra), the Falklands minnow and common galaxias (Galaxias maculatus), which {{is among the most}} widespread fishes in the world. Many of these native species are amphidromous, spending part of their lives at <b>sea.</b> Introduced brown <b>trout,</b> have been established in many freshwater streams and have also formed sea-runs resulting in an increase in body size. Due to the introduction of brown trout and other fish species the endemic zebra trout (a galaxiid fish unrelated to typical salmonid trout) is now restricted to small streams in remote parts of West Falkland and Lafonia. Different species of krill are found in Falkland waters, with lobster krill inhabiting the warmer waters in the north.|$|R
25|$|In 2011 the Nar was {{recognised}} by the Environment Agency {{as one of}} the top ten most improved {{rivers in}} England and Wales, and was ranked seventh in the list. Historically, the engineering of the channel, to make it straighter, deeper and wider, first for navigation and later for land drainage, took no account of the destruction of habitat which such action causes. Some improvement has been made by setting the flood banks further back from the channel, and creating artificial meanders within the resultant flood plain. Structures which inhibit the passage of animal life, such as weirs, have also been removed where possible. Other improvements have been achieved through the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) scheme, which helps farmers to reduce the runoff of perticides and fertiliser into watercourses. The river provides habitat for <b>sea</b> <b>trout,</b> which are quite rare in East Anglia, while its banks are frequented by water voles and otters. 78 different types of river plants have been identified growing in or along it, which includes the southern marsh orchid, while insects found include 12 different species of dragonfly. Grey wagtails, kingfishers, reed warblers and willow and marsh tits are some of the constituents of the bird population.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{effects of}} two {{structurally}} contrasting PCB congeners (coplanar 77 and non coplanar 153) were investigated {{by measuring the}} induction of CYP 1 A immunopositive protein (CYP 1 A IPP) in the pyloric caeca {{and the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) by amoebocytes in the common sea star Asterias rubens. CYP 1 A IPP was quantified using a specially designed ELISA which uses competitive binding between <b>sea</b> stars and <b>trout</b> CYP 1 A IPPs. Only the coplanar congener had a significant effect on the two considered biological responses. Intensity of the effects was dose-dependent.
