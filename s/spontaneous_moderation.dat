50|$|Distributed {{moderation}} {{comes in}} two types: user moderation and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>moderation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>moderation</b> is {{what occurs}} when no {{official}} moderation scheme exists. Without any ability to moderate comments, users will spontaneously moderate their peers through posting their own comments about others' comments. Because <b>spontaneous</b> <b>moderation</b> exists, no {{system that allows}} users to submit their own content can ever go completely without any kind of moderation.|$|E
