5000|$|In the {{presence}} of unilateral damage to a single cerebral hemisphere, there is generally a gradual reduction {{in the frequency of}} alien behaviors observed over time and a gradual restoration of voluntary control over the affected hand.

5000|$|This {{powerful}} essay, {{for which}} La Mettrie expressed warm appreciation in 1751, revolves around a remarkable deathbed {{scene in which}} a dying blind philosopher, Saunderson, rejects the arguments of a deist clergyman who endeavours to win him round to a belief in a providential God during his last hours.

The work appeared anonymously in Paris in June 1749, and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the outage loss differential between firms that engage in backup generation {{and those that}} do not. Unmitigated outage losses were estimated to be US$ 2. 01 –US$ 23. 92 per kWh for firms engaging in <b>self-generation,</b> and range from US$ 1. 54 –US$ 32. 46 per kWh for firms without <b>self-generation.</b> We also find that firms engaging in <b>self-generation</b> would have suffered additional 1 – 183 % outage losses had they not invested in <b>self-generation.</b> On the other hand, firms without <b>self-generation</b> would have reduced their outage losses by around 6 – 46 % if they had engaged in selfgeneration. Further analyses however reveal that, although engagement in selfgeneration reduced outage losses, a firm engaging in <b>self-generation</b> may still suffer a greater unmitigated outage loss relative to a firm without a backup generator. The relative outage losses depend on the relative vulnerability of the operations of the two sets of firms to power interruption, and the relative generating capacity of a selfgenerating firm to its own required electricity loads. Policy reforms that allow firms, whose operations are highly vulnerable to outages, to make a binding contract with utilities in order to get preferential supply are recommended.

One aspect of cognition affected in both HIV and MA and may be a target for intervention is prospective memory (PM), or remembering to perform an intended action at a specific time. <b>Self-generation</b> is a potentially powerful approach to improve PM, hypothetically by supporting strategic aspects of encoding and cue monitoring that underlie PM impairment in HIV/MA individuals. This dissertation project sought to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of self- generation on PM in HIV/MA adults on basic, clinical, and naturalistic PM paradigms; 2) determine neurocognitive mechanisms of <b>self-generation</b> on PM in HIV/MA; and 3) explore potential correlates of <b>self-generation</b> on PM in HIV/MA. Design : Using a 3 -group design (N= 83), this study examined the effectiveness of <b>self-generation</b> in HIV+MA- and HIV+MA+ individuals compared to healthy comparison individuals (HIV-MA-) across three PM tasks of varying ecological validity. Participants were also administered a structured psychiatric interview, neuropsychological battery, and neuromedical examination. Results : Across tasks utilizing within-subjects designs (basic, clinical PM tasks), participants were more likely to respond to the PM cue at recall and recognition for self-generated cues relative to didactically-learned cues (ps 0. 05).

40|$|A severe aphasia {{following}} a cerebral vascular accident is characterised by generalised deficits in most speech-language domains. The clinical dilemma remains {{focused on the}} extensive verbal speech impairment {{and in most cases}} little possibility of regaining verbal speech production. Many individuals living with severe aphasia use augmentative and alternative communication strategies to assist them in getting their communication needs met in their everyday lives. The Blissymbol system is one of the graphic symbol systems {{that can be used to}} supplement existing communication and speech strategies of the individual with little or no speech. Although the use of AAC strategies is gaining momentum in its application to severe aphasia, however, there still remain questions on how best to help these individuals learn and retain such strategies. Not only are individuals with severe aphasia faced with a memory task when learning AAC strategies such as Blissymbols, additional complexity to AAC interventions is derived from clinical presentation of severe aphasia. The presence of extensive damage to the neural centers responsible for linguistic processing and semantic retrieval makes learning of new AAC strategies all the more complicated. Research studies have looked at whether individuals with severe aphasia can learn to recognise and retain Blissymbols. Although these studies have successfully shown that individuals with severe aphasia can learn Blissymbols, there is little information available regarding how these symbols can best be taught and retained over time individuals with severe aphasia. Recently the research that has looked at the application of symbol learning with persons presenting with severe aphasia using computer technology and sophisticated application software has highlighted the importance of therapeutic methods that may enhance the learning of such software. This study looks at the application of the <b>self-generation</b> effect as a viable method for enhancing the recognition of Blissymbols in persons presenting with severe aphasia. The <b>self-generation</b> effect is the finding of superior retention and recall for stimuli constructed or generated by an individual. Memory for stimuli such as words, numbers and pictures were found to be enhanced by the extent to which the individual was involved in its construction. Using a 2 X 2 X 3 factorial design, this study compared the recognition levels for Blissymbols taught using two treatment approaches which was the <b>self-generation</b> condition and the non <b>self-generation</b> condition. During three experimental sessions which included two withdrawal periods participants were taught using both treatments to recognise a set of Blissymbols. Recognition levels were tested during recognition probes and retention probes. The results from these probes were compared in order to identify which treatment produced superior recognition levels. The data analysis conducted showed that although there was no recognition advantage for the <b>self-generation</b> effect seen during the three recognition probes some advantage for the <b>self-generation</b> effect was seen during the retention probes conducted. The <b>self-generation</b> effect began to emerge by the final retention probe {{following a}} withdrawal period of seven days. The <b>self-generation</b> treatment showed better retention of symbol recognition over time. Previous studies have shown that the <b>self-generation</b> effect failed to emerge with stimuli that were new or unfamiliar. This trend was also seen in this study. The results provide support for a semantic-association theory for the <b>self-generation</b> effect. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

The application of <b>self-generation</b> procedures {{has been found to}} improve memory in healthy elderly and in individuals with impaired cognition. Overall, the available studies support the notion that active participation in verbal encoding engages memory mechanisms that supplement those used during passive observation. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the age-related changes in the neural mechanisms involved in the encoding of paired-associates using a <b>self-generation</b> method that has been shown to improve memory performance across the lifespan. Subjects were 113 healthy right-handed adults (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory > 50; 67 females) ages 18 – 76, native speakers of English with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Subjects underwent fMRI at 3  T while performing didactic learning (“read”) or <b>self-generation</b> learning (“generate”) of 30 word pairs per condition. After fMRI, recognition memory for the second word in each pair was evaluated outside of the scanner. On the post-fMRI testing more “generate” words were correctly recognized than “read” words (p <  0. 001) with older adults recognizing the “generated” words less accurately (p <  0. 05). Independent component analysis of fMRI data identified task-related brain networks. Several components were positively correlated with the task reflecting multiple cognitive processes involved in self-generated encoding; other components correlated negatively with the task, including components of the default-mode network. Overall, memory performance on generated words decreased with age, but the benefit from <b>self-generation</b> remained consistently significant across ages.
