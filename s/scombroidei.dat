500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder <b>Scombroidei</b> and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family Lamnidae – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (thresher sharks). The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E

50|$|Mackerel {{range in}} size from small forage fish to larger game fish. Coastal {{mackerel}} tend to be small. The king mackerel {{is an example of a}} larger mackerel.

40|$|A partial rostrum with an attachcd lower jaw, a {{posterior}} neurocranium, and a proximal hyomandibular {{from the}} Lincoln Creek Formation (late Oligocene, Washington) arc described and identified as Aglyptorhynchlls coillmhianlls sp, nov. In addition. ten articulated anterior caudal vertebrae presumably from the Lincoln Creek Formation arc described and identified as Aglyptorhyllchlls sp. This {{is a second}} record of an Aglyptorhynchus from a deposit bordering the Pacific Ocean, The specimens are compared with other billfishes (Perciformes: <b>Scombroidei),</b> both extant and extinct. Unusual features include a tripartite celous occipital condyle composed equally of the basioccipital and cxoccipitals, a lower jaw that is nearly twice as deep as the corresponding section of the rostrum, a subtemporal fossa, an oval-shaped fossa in the parasphenoid, two sphenotic ridges separated by a fossa, a bifurcated pterotic ridge. and a hyomandibular with a laterally curved posterior margin. With {{the exception of the}} deep lower jaw. these features have never been recorded before in extinct or extant scombroid fish, Heretofore. a tripartite occipital condyle was unknown in a non-beryciform percomorph fish, AglyplOrhynchlls is placed in the <b>Scombroidei.</b> family incertae sedis, because of the paucity of shared characters with other scombroid taxa...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} minor groove binder (MGB) probe assays {{have been}} developed for rapid and accurate identification of the species commonly used for production of canned tuna, i. e. yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), bluefin (Thunnus thynnus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga) tunas. The assays targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene were able to discriminate efficiently between the three species contained in fresh or canned tunas and did not react with other <b>Scombroidei</b> that were tested. A correct species prediction was obtained even from artificial mixtures prepared with different amounts of the reference tuna species and subjected to the sterilisation treatment. Testing of 27 commercial canned tunas by PCR-RFLP, MGB probe assays and sequence analysis showed a concordance of 100 % between the last two techniques, whereas by using PCR-RFLP several samples were uncharacterised or mischaracterised. These results make the established MGB probe assays an attractive tool for direct and rapid species identification in canned tuna...|$|E
40|$|The muscles {{serving the}} ventral {{portion of the}} gill arches ( = infrabranchial musculature) are poorly known in bony fishes. A {{comparative}} analysis of the infrabranchial muscles in the major percomorph lineages reveals {{a large amount of}} phylogenetically-relevant information. Characters derived from this anatomical system are identified and discussed in light of current hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships among percomorphs. New evidence supports a sister-group relationship between the Batrachoidiformes and Lophiiformes and between the Callionymoidei and Gobiesocoidei. Investigated data also corroborate the existence of two monophyletic groups, one including the Pristolepididae, Badidae, and Nandidae, and a second clade consisting of all non-amarsipid stromateiforms. New synapomorphies are proposed for the Atherinomorphae, Blenniiformes, Lophiiformes, <b>Scombroidei</b> (including Sphyraenidae), and Gobiiformes. Within the latter order, the Rhyacichthyidae and Odontobutidae are supported as the successive sister families of all remaining gobiiforms. The present analysis further confirms the validity of infrabranchial musculature characters previously proposed to support the grouping of the Mugiliformes with the Atherinomorphae and the monophyly of the Labriformes with the possible inclusion of the Pholidichthyiformes. Interestingly, most hypotheses of relationships supported by the infrabranchial musculature have been advanced by preceding anatomists on the basis of distinct data sources, but were never recovered in recent molecular phylogenies. These conflicts clearly indicate the current unsatisfactory resolution of the higher-level phylogeny of percomorphs...|$|E
40|$|Otoliths are dense {{structures}} in the ears of fishes that function in hearing and gravity perception. Otolith (sagitta) diameters, as percentages of standard length (% SL), are calculated for 247 marine fish species in 147 families and compared by taxonomic group (usually order), habitat and {{presence or absence of}} luminescence. Otolith sizes range from 0. 4 - 31. 4 mm and 0. 08 - 11. 2 % SL. The eel and spiny eel orders Anguilliformes and Notacanthiformes have small to very small otoliths, as do the triggerfish order Tetraodontiformes, pipefish order Gasterosteiformes, billfish suborder <b>Scombroidei</b> and many of the dragonfish order Stomiiformes. The soldierfish order Beryciformes has moderate to very large otoliths. The perch order Perciformes has a wide range of otolith sizes but most have small to moderate otoliths 2 - 5 % SL. Only 16 out of the 247 species have the relatively largest otoliths, over 7 % SL. Seven out of these 16 species are also luminous from a variety of habitats. Luminous species have slightly to much larger otoliths than non-luminous species in the same family Both beryciforms and luminous fishes live in low-light environments, where acute colour vision is probably impossible. Most fishes of the epipelagic surface waters have very small otoliths, perhaps due to background noise and/or excessive movement of heavy otoliths in rough seas. Bathypelagic species usually have small otoliths and regressed or absent swimbladders. Other habitats have species with a range of otolith sizes. While the relationship between hearing ability and otolith length is unknown, at least some groups with modified swim-bladders have larger otoliths, which may be associated with more acute hearing...|$|E
