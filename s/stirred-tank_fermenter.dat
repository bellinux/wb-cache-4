40|$|Abstract The {{dissolved}} oxygen tension of 20 % of air saturation, pH-shift from 4. 0 to 5. 5 on day 3, and a mod-erate shear stress (calculated as an impeller tip speed, Vtip 0 : 926 2 : 161 m=s) were identified {{to be the}} key factors in scaling-up the mated fermentation of Blakeslea trispora NRRL 2895 (?) and 2896 (-) for lycopene production from a shake flask to a <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter.</b> The maximal lycopene production of 183. 3 mg/L was obtained in 7. 5 -L <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter,</b> and then the mated fermentation process was successfully step-wise scaled-up from 7. 5 - to 200 -L <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter.</b> The comparability of the fermentation process was well con-trolled and the lycopene production was maintained during the process scale-up. Furthermore, with the integrated addition of 150 lmol/L abscisic acid on day 3, 0. 5 g/L leucine and 0. 1 g/L penicillin on day 4, the highest lyco-pene production of 270. 3 mg/L was achieved in the mated fermentation of B. trispora in <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter...</b>|$|E
30|$|Among seven carbon sources tested, {{glycerol}} and glucose {{favored the}} Cerrena unicolor laccase production (18.8 - 20.3 U/mL); in addition, glycerol ensured the highest manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity (2 U/mL). Substitution of glycerol with the ethanol production residue (EPR) gave the highest laccase (90.1 U/mL) activity, while the walnut pericarp provided the highest MnP activity (7.4 U/mL). Supplementation of medium with 1  mM copper and 1  mM xylidine at appropriate time caused significant additive effect on laccase expression (333.2 U/mL) in shake-flask experiments. Overproduction of laccase activity (507 U/mL) and secretion of MnP activity was obtained when C. unicolor was cultivated in <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter.</b> C. unicolor showed several distinctive and attractive technological features: it is capable to synthesize {{high levels of}} oxidases under high carbon and high nitrogen conditions and it secretes high laccase activity during trophophase.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{using data}} {{obtained}} and different approaches, overproduction of laccase activity (507 U/mL) and secretion of MnP activity {{have been achieved}} {{in a relatively short}} time when C. unicolor CBS 117347 was cultivated in <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter.</b> Previously, comparatively low laccase activity was revealed in synthetic medium in shaken flask cultures (6 U/mL) and in fermenter (3.9 U/mL) (Janusz et al. 2007), as well as in a complex tomato juice medium (19 U/mL) (Michniewicz et al. 2006); however, the highest laccase activity (450 U/mL) among Cerrena species tested so far was achieved in submerged fermentation of wheat bran by C. unicolor strain C- 139 (Songulashvili et al. 2012). Based on the optimized induction conditions developed here laccase production by C. unicolor CBS 117347 could be further scaled up for different biotechnological applications. Moreover, this fungus is a suitable system to understand the LME expression in other basidiomycetous fungi.|$|E
40|$|Mycelial {{fermentation}} of an Ophiocordyceps sinensis strain Cs-HK 1 {{was carried}} out in various volumes of <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenters</b> from 1. 6 -L and 15 -L laboratory scale to 2000 -L industrial scale. The mycelial growth in most fermenters had a higher rate, due probably to more efficient oxygen supply, than in shake-flasks. The mycelial fermentation was successfully scaled up to 2000 -L industrial fermenters, achieving 30 g/L maximum biomass in 5 days. The Cs-HK 1 mycelia formed hairy and fluffy pellets in the fermentation medium and the mycelial broth exhibited pseudoplastic rheology following the power law, with the flow behavior index n decreasing from 0. 5 to 0. 3, and the flow consistency K and the apparent viscosity µα increasing with time and biomass concentration. The mycelial broth containing biomass and extracellular products harvested from 2000 -L fermenters was tested for anti-fatigue activities in forced animal swimming experiments. The mycelium hot water extract showed the most significant effects, increasing the swimming endurance of mice up to 100 %, and also increasing the glycogen levels and reducing the lactic acid and blood urea nitrogen levels significantly. The results demonstrated the feasibility of Cs-HK 1 mycelial fermentation for large-scale production of bioactive and medicinal materials. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
40|$|Cordyceps (Ophiocordyceps) sinensis, the Chinese {{caterpillar}} fungus or Cordyceps in brief, is {{an important}} medicinal fungus in Chinese herbal medicine {{with a wide range}} of health benefits and bioactivities. Because wild C. sinensis fungus (in the form of insect caterpillar-fungal fruiting body complex) is very expensive and rare in nature, mycelial fermentation has become the main source of C. sinensis fungal materials. Liquid or submerged fermentation of fungal mycelia has been widely exploited for large-scale production of C. sinensis mycelium biomass and exopolysaccharides (EPS). This chapter will give a brief introduction of the biological characteristics of the C. sinensis fungus and its medicinal functions and applications, and then mainly review the conditions and characteristics of C. sinensis mycelial culture for the production of mycelial biomass and EPS in shake-flasks and <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenters.</b> In addition to the relevant studies reported by other research groups, this chapter will summarize the major findings from the studies by our own group with the Cs-HK 1 fungus, including the fluid transport properties and the process parameters from small laboratory to large-scale industrial fermenters, the problems in separation and recovery of mycelial biomass and EPS from the viscous fermentation liquid, and the isolation, purification and molecular properties of polysaccharides.

40|$|Microbial lipid {{production}} by the oleaginous yeast Rhorosporidium toruloides Y 4 was studied using glucose as carbon source, {{in order to}} realize high-density cell culture. Batch cultures demonstrated {{that there was little}} inhibitory effect with a substrate concentration of up to 150 g l(- 1). Flask fed-batch cultures were run for 25 days and reached a dry biomass and cellular lipid content of 151. 5 g l(- 1) and 48. 0 % (w/w), respectively. Using pilot-scale fed-batch cultures in a 15 - 1 <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter</b> for 134 h resulted in dry biomass, lipid content and lipid productivity of 106. 5 g l(- 1), 67. 5 % (w/w) and 0. 54 g l(- 1) h(- 1), respectively. The fed-batch culture model used here featured initial nutrient-rich media and a pure carbon source with discontinuous feeding. Gas chromatography analysis revealed that lipids from R. toruloides Y 4 contained mainly long-chain fatty acids with 16 and 18 carbon atoms. The four major constituent fatty acids were oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and linoleic acid. A slight increase in stearic acid production was found during the culture process. Based on these compositional data, microbial lipids from R. toruloides Y 4 are a potential alternative oil resource for biodiesel production. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The optimal {{temperature}} and initial pH for both mycelial growth and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in shake flask cultures of Phellinus linteus KCTC 6190 {{were found to}} be 30 ◦C and pH 4. 0, respectively. Optimal medium composition was determined to be sucrose 50 g/l, corn steep powder 3 g/l, KH 2 PO 4 0. 68 g/l, and CaCl 2 0. 55 g/l. Under optimal culture conditions, the maximum mycelial biomass and EPS achieved in a 5 -l <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter</b> indicated 11 and 3. 3 g/l, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest polysaccharide yield amongst liquid cultures of P. linteus reported in the literature. The three groups of EPSs (designated as Fr-I,-II, and-III) were obtained from the culture filtrates by a gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL- 4 B and the different fractions were analyzed directly using the size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser-light scattering (SEC/MALLS) analysis. It was revealed that all fractions of EPS were polysaccharides consisted of mainly mannose, galactose, and glucose. The molecular weights of Fr-I,-II, and-III of EPS were determined to be 433, 400 (± 7801), 31, 470 (± 283), and 12, 950 (± 90) g/mol, respectively. The SEC/MALLS analysis revealed that molecular dimension of the Fr-I was a spherical form, whereas the Fr-II was a random coil in an aqueous solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{variability}} of the yield of the intracellular enzyme cytochrome P- 450 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 754, in closed batch fermentation using a 5 -litre computer-controlled <b>stirred-tank</b> <b>fermenter,</b> was investigated using two control strategies: a) Conventional constant set-point control, using previously determined optimal control parameters; b) time-profiled control of three fermenter control parameters, pH, temperature and stirrer speed varied with time according to pre-calculated profiles, computed {{from a single}} empirical model using Pontryagin's continuous maximum principle. Cytochrome P- 450 was assayed using the reduced carbon monoxide spectrophotometric procedure. The sample treatment and carbon monoxide gassing rate having been optimised before. The accuracy of the fermenter control variables was assessed. The sum of the squared differences (SSD) between the set and actual control values was used. The values of the SSD {{were related to the}} enzyme yield. It was found that the enzyme yield was strongly affected by the accuracy of the control, as expected in a near optimal system. It was noted that inaccurate control always gave low enzyme yields, while accurate control gave a range of enzyme yields. It was concluded that yield variability was caused by more than one factor, including the accuracy of control, but that the accuracy of control was overriding. It was found that the accuracy of control of the individual variables depended on the control strategy used. It was concluded that this provides a useful practical method of assessing operational control efficiency, as opposed to analysis of individual control loops, in analysing process efficiency. Analysis of batch to batch variation in components of the complex growth-medium showed that the enzyme yield was affected. Changes in the batch of yeast extract were found to have most effect on the enzyme yield, mycological peptone less so and the glucose and salt virtually none at all. It was concluded that the saving in cost of growth medium, by partially replacing mycological peptone with yeast extract, may be offset by the costs arising from the resulting greater variability in yield. The effect on enzyme yield of the method of sterilising the growth medium indicated that the complex medium contained material which inhibited enzyme production. This material was believed to affect the rheology and the mass-transfer properties of the growth-medium. Analysis of the time interval between the occurrence of the biomass and the enzyme concentration peaks during the fermentation showed that, in this system, the biomass peak always preceded the enzyme peak. In "slower" fermentations the time interval was smaller. This also explained an apparent discrepancy in behaviour between shake-flask and stirred-tank fermentations. In general, the time interval was slightly shorter under time-profile control than with set-point control fermentations. Exhaust gas analysis data showed that the maximum carbon dioxide concentration occurred {{at the same time as}} the minimum oxygen concentration. The turning point consistently preceded the enzyme concentration peak by a virtually constant time interval, this time interval was found to be 69 minutes under set-point control and 56 minutes under time-profiled control. This is potentially valuable in enabling the occurrence of the peak enzyme concentration to be predicted accurately, with consequent saving in process time and enzyme yield...|$|E
