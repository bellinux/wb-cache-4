40|$|Pitch {{modelling}} {{is considered}} to be an important factor in speech synthesis where the pitch contour plays a demonstrable role in the intelligibility and naturalness of synthesised speech. While quantitative models for pitch contours have been proposed previously, each of these have a fixed level of details and as such not all of them provide the basis either for automatic extraction <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> model parameters or for measuring the distance between two instances of a model. In this paper, a novel and compact quantitative model for pitch contour is presented which covers the possible variations in pitch and can be automatically extracted. The minimum F 0 value, the level global <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pitch</b> segment and the semi-periodic jitter properties are used as pitch components and are modelled with a linear function, a sine function and a set of sine functions respectively. A distance measure is defined for the model which takes the shape of the contours into consideration. Experiments show a low mean square error (MSE) for the estimated contours for different languages across different corpora, and investigate the accuracy of the distance function on the model.

40|$|The present work is an {{investigation}} of the function of sentence intonation in Swedish for conveying information of various kinds: semantic-syntactic (distinguishing. declarative and interrogatory yes/no sentences), stylistic (on the character of the speech situation), and dialectal information (on the regional background of the speakers). Finally the properties of the sentence intonation of individual speakers have been studied. The investigation is based on an acoustic analysis of recorded speech supplemented by other experiments involving perceptual tests in which specimens of natural speech, low pass filtered speech, and synthetic speech were presented to listeners. In the acoustic experiments five fundamental pitch parameters were investigated. The significance of these parameters for the listeners was tested in the perceptual experiments. The most evident difference between declarative and interrogatory intonation is in the marking of the frequency dominance manifested by certain properties of the features corresponding to the pitch parameters. The weak (negative) marking in declarative sentences implies a relatively low average and low peak value <b>of</b> <b>pitch,</b> an early position <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> peak in the sentence, and a relatively fast <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pitch.</b> The contrasting strong (positive) marking in interrogatory sentences is characterized by the opposite properties. The marking of these features is in some cases optional. In speech delivered in situations when the pitch contour was one of very few or the only channel of information, e. g. in lists of read sentences, the intonation types are distinguished more clearly than when several channels were working, e. g. in spontaneous conversations. As far as dialectal information is concerned there is a tendency among speakers from the southern parts of Sweden to use a higher average level and greater variations <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> than in Northern Sweden. In order to estimate the influence of particular vowels on the sentence intonation their inherent pitch was investigated. It was shown that, although there is a considerable variation in the inherent <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> vowels, the influence <b>of</b> the inherent <b>pitch</b> on sentence intonation is neutralized in speech with a normal variation of vowels. The result of the investigation has been summarized in a model for the production of sentence intonation of Swedish. It contains process steps with obligatory or optional marking <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> contour features. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and systematic investigation about how geometric parameters on a biplane configuration {{have an influence}} on aerodynamic parameters. This experimental investigation has been developed in a two-dimensional approach. Theoretical studies about biplanes configurations have been developed in the past, {{but there is not}} enough information about experimental wind tunnel data at low Reynolds number. This two-dimensional study is a first step to further tridimensional investigations about the box wing configuration. The main objective of the study is to find the relationships between the geometrical parameters which present the best aerodynamic behavior: the highest lift, the lowest drag and the lowest <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pitching</b> moment. A tridimensional wing-box model will be designed following the pattern of the two dimensional study conclusions. It will respond to the geometrical relationships that have been considered to show the better aerodynamic behavior. This box-wing model will be studied in the aim of comparing the advantages and disadvantages between this biplane configuration and the plane configuration, looking for implementing the box-wing in the UAV?s field. Although the box wing configuration has been used in a small number of existing UAV, prestigious researchers have found it as a field of high aerodynamic and structural potential...|$|R

To assess in advance {{the performance of the}} alternative plant solutions, a computational model for the determination of solar energy absorbed by surfaces with different exposures as a function of latitude, day, orientation and inclination has been created. Its application to roofs of buildings typically used for animal housing is presented; these were mono-pitch, gabled, and shed type roofs. For each building, the annual energy absorption per unit of floor area is calculated by varying orientation and <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pitches.</b> For roof surfaces exposed only in one direction (mono-pitch or shed), the orientation is shown to be a dominant factor with respect to the slope in determining the annual energy uptake. The maximum uptake is obtained with exposure to the south and is greater the higher the slope (up to 67. 5 %). For gabled roofs, the total uptake is negatively affected by the worse exposed pitch and does not vary significantly, for a given slope, with orientation (up to 2. 8 %). The maximum gain is obtained with the optimal building azimuth (0 °) and the highest slope. The shed type, since it is affected by the shade induced by the upper pitch over the lower, cannot reach the level of a mono-pitch roof: - 1. 5 % with a <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 10 % and - 21 % with a <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> 67. 5 % with the optimal building azimuth of 90 °. However, its performance is slightly higher than the corresponding gabled roof (+ 2. 5 %), therefore, it could be a convenient alternative if optimally oriented and, above all, if the collectors are installed on the predominantly sunny part of the roof...|$|R

40|$|Below is {{an account}} of a {{teaching}} experience, in which the use of 3 D modeling, digital and physical, has heightened the desire of students to increase {{their knowledge of the}} old-town center of the Municipality of Castelmarte. The ultimate goal of the survey was to make a physical model of part of the territory which included the old mountain settlement, with the most significant social-life buildings: the town hall, the parish complex, the sports field, the small town park. To achieve this, it was necessary to use different survey methods, supplementing direct survey {{with the use of the}} digital survey instruments used in topography. The graphic rendering of the survey was developed by integrating various types of 3 D modeling software which, through subsequent steps, led to the creation of a physical model, developed at the Prototyping Laboratory of the Milan Polytechnic, of the whole of the old-town center. The following images document the various work stages and the different survey and representation methods used. These clearly show the process of gradual advancement of knowledge developed during the physical modeling stage, regarding the morphology of the hilly terrain, the shape and mutual position of the buildings, the different <b>slopes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pitched</b> roofs. The digital modeling method used to create the physical model requires extreme precision in the realization of the design and was therefore the stimulus to perform a detailed survey of the existing situation; at the same time, it provided the opportunity to learn to use and compare different types of software. Learning was verified directly through the tangible result of the physical model, built on the basis of the 3 D model, using a rapid prototyping machine...|$|R

40|$|Prosody can {{be defined}} as the aspects of a sentence's {{pronunciation}} not described by the phone sequence of the words. Examples of prosodic information include pitch contour, loudness and duration. Prosody or prosodic information {{plays an important role in}} human communications. In tonal languages such as Chinese, words are often differentiated by the lexical tones which are related to the pitch contour. In addition, intonation patterns are used in both Chinese and English to express emotion or emphasis. The goal of this thesis is to investigate different approaches of applying prosodic information for speech processing such as using tone information for Chinese speech recognition and classification of English intonation patterns with an application to computer-aided language learning. The classification <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> contour patterns involves four components, i) pitch detection, ii) pitch contour representation, iii) pitch pattern classification and, iv) integration of prosody for Chinese speech recognition. While pitch can be estimated frame by frame, because pitch pattern is a supra-segment, it is more effective to represent the pitch pattern by a continuous curve, such as a polynomial. By representing the pitch contour as a polynomial, we experimented with different classifiers, such as Decision tree, Neutral Network and Hidden Markov Model, and evaluated their effectiveness on tone classification of isolated and continuous Chinese syllables, and English intonation pattern classification. Finally, prosody information is integrated into a Chinese speech recognition system. In our study, we found that the Cepstrum (CEP) pitch detection algorithm could detect pitch values with good accuracy (97. 2 %). Since cepstral coefficients are typically used in recognition, the CEP method has the additional advantage that it can be implemented in the speech recognition front-end. In pitch pattern classification, the combination of polynomial representation and decision tree gave the best performance in both English intonation pattern classification and isolated Chinese syllable tone recognition. An analysis of the decision tree structure indicated that the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pitch</b> contour was the most important feature which was consistent with our knowledge of Chinese tones. In continuous Chinese speech, because of the co-articulation effects and tone sandhi, tone classification degraded significantly with confusions at tone 3 or neutral tone. By integrating the prosodic information into Chinese speech recognition, syllable accuracy improved from 65. 4 % to 70. 5 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} experimental campaign are compared to computational fluid dynamics simulations results to assess the modelling capabilities for a NACA 23012 pitching airfoil in deep dynamic stall regime. The experimental campaign involved fast unsteady pressure measurements and particle image velocimetry. Two-dimensional simulations were carried out with EDGE, developed by FOI. The investigated test case consists in a sinusoidal pitching motion with a 10 amplitude and a reduced frequency of 0. 1 around a mean angle of attack of 10. The behaviour of the experimental lift and pitching moment coefficients is {{in close agreement with}} the two-dimensional simulations results, also during the downstroke motion where the flow field is characterised by severe unsteadiness conditions. A three-dimensional numerical model was built to evaluate the relevance of three-dimensional effects on the experiments. Three-dimensional simulations were carried out using the commercial code FLUENT. During upstroke motion, three-dimensional simulations results are in better agreement with the experiments, in particular in terms of the lift coefficient curve <b>slope</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>pitching</b> moment coefficient peak. The flow fields evaluated by particle image velocimetry surveys show strong vortical structures moving on the airfoil upper surface during the downstroke motion that are captured only by the three-dimensional model; then, the flow fields comparison demonstrates the importance of three-dimensional effects for a deep dynamic stall condition...|$|R
