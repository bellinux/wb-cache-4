5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet <b>Searcher</b> (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Five star {{systems have}} been found to have planets, four of which have been {{discovered}} by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet <b>Searcher</b> (HARPS) in Chile. HD 4308 is a star with around 83% of the Sun's mass located 72 light-years away with a super-Earth planet with an orbital period of around 15 days. HD 215497 is an orange star of spectral type K3V around 142 light-years distant. It is orbited by a hot super-Earth every 3 days and a second planet around the size of Saturn with a period of around 567 days. HD 221287 has a spectral type of F7V and lies 173 light-years away, and has a super-Jovian planet. HD 7199 has spectral type KOIV/V and is located 117 light-years away. It has a planet with around 30% the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of 615 days. HD 219077 has a planet around 10 times as massive as Jupiter in a highly eccentric orbit.|$|E
5|$|Pyxis is home {{to three}} stars with {{confirmed}} planetary systems—all discovered by doppler spectroscopy. A hot Jupiter, HD 73256 b, that orbits HD 73256 every 2.55 days, was discovered using the CORALIE spectrograph in 2003. The host star is a yellow star of spectral type G9V that has 69% of our Sun's luminosity, 89% of its diameter and 105% of its mass. Around 119 light-years away, it shines with an apparent magnitude of 8.08 and is around a billion years old. HD 73267 b was discovered with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet <b>Searcher</b> (HARPS) in 2008. It orbits HD 73267 every 1260 days, a 7 billion year-old star of spectral type G5V that is around 89% as massive as the Sun. A red dwarf of spectral type M2.5V that has around 42% the Sun's mass, Gliese 317 is orbited by two gas giant planets. Around 50 light-years distant from Earth, {{it is a good}} candidate for future searches for more terrestrial rocky planets.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGiven {{a set of}} <b>searchers</b> in the grid, whose search paths {{are known}} in advance, can a target that moves {{at the same speed}} as the <b>searchers</b> escape {{detection}} indefinitely? We study the number of <b>searchers</b> against which the target can still escape. This number is less than n in an n×n grid, since a row of <b>searchers</b> can sweep the allowed region. In an alternating-move-model where at each time <b>searchers</b> first move and then the target moves, we show that a target can always escape ⌊n 2 ⌋ <b>searchers</b> and there is a strategy for ⌊n 2 ⌋+ 1 <b>searchers</b> to catch the target. This improves a recent bound Ω(n) [A. Dumitrescu, I. Suzuki, P. Zylinski, Offline variants of the “lion and man” problem, in: SoCG 2007, Proc. 23 rd Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, ACM Press, 2007, pp. 102 – 111] in the simultaneous-move-model where at each time <b>searchers</b> and target moves simultaneously. We also prove similar bounds for the continuous analogue, as well as for <b>searchers</b> and targets moving with different speeds. In the proof, we use new isoperimetric theorems for subsets of the n×n grid and the n×n square, which is of independent interest...|$|R
5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked through the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet <b>Searcher</b> (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E
5|$|Although no star {{systems in}} Telescopium have {{confirmed}} planets, several {{have been found}} to have brown dwarf companions. A member of the 12-million-year-old Beta Pictoris moving group of stars that share a common proper motion through space, Eta Telescopii is a young white main sequence star of magnitude 5.0 and spectral type A0V. It has a debris disk and brown dwarf companion of spectral type M7V or M8V that is between 20 and 50 times as massive as Jupiter. The system is complex, as it has a common proper motion with (and is gravitationally bound to) the star HD 181327, which has its own debris disk. This latter star is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F6V of magnitude 7.0. PZ Telescopii is another young star with a debris disk and substellar brown dwarf companion, though at 24 million years of age appears too old {{to be part of the}} Beta Pictoris moving group. HD 191760 is a yellow subgiant—a star that is cooling and expanding off the main sequence—of spectral type G3IV/V. Estimated to be just over four billion years old, it is slightly (1.1 to 1.3 times) more massive as the Sun, 2.69 times as luminous, and has around 1.62 times its radius. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet <b>Searcher</b> (HARPS) instrument on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope, it was found to have a brown dwarf around 38 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting at an average distance of 1.35 AU with a period of 505 days. This is an unusually close distance from the star, within a range that has been termed the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E

2500|$|The node searching game on a graph {{is a form}} of pursuit-evasion {{in which}} a set of <b>searchers</b> {{collaborate}} to track down a fugitive hiding in a graph. The <b>searchers</b> are placed on vertices of the graph while the fugitive may be in any edge of the graph, and the fugitive's location and moves are hidden from the <b>searchers.</b> In each turn, {{some or all of the}} <b>searchers</b> may move (arbitrarily, not necessarily along edges) from one vertex to another, and then the fugitive may move along any path in the graph that does not pass through a searcher-occupied vertex. The fugitive is caught when both endpoints of his edge are occupied by <b>searchers.</b> The node searching number of a graph is the minimum number of <b>searchers</b> needed to ensure that the fugitive can be guaranteed to be caught, no matter how he moves. As [...] show, the node searching number of a graph equals its interval thickness.
