500|$|Since {{the vessel}} {{was no longer}} {{seaworthy}} and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, {{the focus of the}} operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Navy {{equipped}} the Tribal {{class with}} a comparatively heavy anti-aircraft armament; all eight 4.7in guns could engage aircraft with predicted fire using the FKC computer, and thus provide a powerful augmentation to the battle-fleet's AA defence. The close range AA armament of a quad 2pdr and two quad Vickers machine guns was a marked advance over previous destroyer classes and heavier than most other nations' close range destroyer armament in 1939. However, prewar, the Royal Navy assumed that destroyers would be acting mainly as escorts for the battle-fleet, {{and would not be}} the primary focus of aerial attack. Events soon showed that destroyers often functioned independently and so became the main target of Luftwaffe attack, especially by dive bombers. After the loss of Afridi and Gurkha, the remaining ships were taken in hand to improve the situation. Each ship's 'X' turret, which held a [...] mounting, was removed and replaced by a twin [...] gun QF Mark XVI on the mounting HA/LA Mark XIX. The mainmast was cut down and the rear funnel was lowered to improve the arcs of fire for the anti-aircraft weapons. As they became available, the more effective 20 mm Oerlikon guns were added, at first adding to and eventually replacing the [...]50 in./12.7 mm machine guns. Depth charge storage was also increased, from 30 to 46 charges. Furthermore, the class initially had problems with leaks in feedwater tanks; this was traced to issues with the turbine blades caused by <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> when steaming at high speed in rough weather.|$|E
50|$|A {{geodesic}} dome is a hemispherical thin-shell structure (lattice-shell) {{based on}} a geodesic polyhedron.

When the combustion of fuel takes place in heavy diesel engine cylinder, high temperature and pressure develops.

50|$|Most {{aerobatic}} maneuvers involve {{rotation of}} the aircraft about its longitudinal (roll) axis or lateral (pitch) axis. Other maneuvers, such as a spin, displace the aircraft about its vertical (yaw) axis. Maneuvers are often combined to form a complete aerobatic sequence for entertainment or competition. Aerobatic flying requires a broader set of piloting skills and exposes the aircraft to greater <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> than for normal flight. In some countries, the pilot must wear a parachute when performing aerobatics.|$|E

40|$|A new cell-vortex {{unstructured}} {{finite volume}} method for structural dynamics is assessed for simulations of structural dynamics {{in response to}} fluid motions. A robust implicit dual-time stepping method is employed to obtain time accurate solutions.

The method is coupled with a fluid dynamics solver for fluid-structure interaction, providing {{a viable alternative to}} the finite element method for structural dynamics calculations. A mesh sensitivity test indicates that the finite volume method is at least of second-order accuracy. The method is validated by the problem of vortex-induced vibration of an elastic plate with different initial conditions and material properties. The results are in good agreement with existing numerical data and analytical solutions. The method is then applied to simulate a channel flow with an elastic wall.

50|$|It is {{possible}} for Galactica to jump without retracting her pods; however, heavy damage occurs the one time the ship is seen to jump this way, implying that doing so places severe strain on its hull structure. This may explain why Galactica always retracts them before a jump is initiated, though the heavy damage to Galactica following her final jump may also {{be due to the}} advanced deterioration and decay of her structure and armor after more than forty years of service, four years of continual heavy combat, a desperate atmospheric reentry, and no access to an orbital shipyard, asides from the possible <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> of such a jump.|$|E

50|$|Silicon is an earth {{abundant}} element, and is fairly inexpensive to refine to high purity. When alloyed with lithium {{it has a}} theoretical capacity of ~3,600 milliampere hours per gram (mAh/g), which is nearly 10 times the energy density of graphite electrodes (372 mAh/g). One of silicon's inherent traits, unlike carbon, is {{the expansion of the}} lattice structure by as much as 400% upon full lithiation (charging).

5000|$|The B-52C used on {{the mission}} of Thursday January 7, 1971, with the call sign [...] "Hiram 16", had {{been built in the}} summer of 1956 as one of thirty-five B-52C bombers. From 1952 to 1962 a total of 744 B-52s of all models were built. By January 1971, all {{remaining}} thirty-one B-52Cs were stationed at Westover Air Force Base near Springfield, Massachusetts. The aircraft were more than 15 years old and four of the original thirty-five had been lost to accidents. None of the remaining aircraft had been modified to cope with the <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> demands of low level flight. All were used for training in their designed high altitude role and, after May 1960, in the new low level role. Low level B-52 missions were typically flwn at 300 to 500 ft above ground level. Some of the aircraft stationed at Westover were loaned to other bases during the late 1960s and early 1970s, due to Strategic Air Command being use of later model B-52's in combat in Southeast Asia, beginning with Operation Rolling Thunder in March 1965.|$|E
50|$|The {{start and}} {{lift-off}} went well. At T+90 seconds, a programmed shutdown {{of the core}} propulsion system (the six center engines) was performed to reduce <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> on the booster. Because of excessive dynamic loads caused by a hydraulic shock wave when the six engines were shut down abruptly, lines for feeding fuel and oxidizer to the core propulsion system burst and a fire started in the boattail of the booster, in addition the #4 engine exploded. The first stage broke up starting at T+107 seconds and all telemetry data ceased at T+110 seconds. The launch escape system activated and pulled the Soyuz 7K-LOK to safety. The upper stages were ejected from the stack and crashed into the steppe. An investigation revealed that the abrupt shutdown of the engines led to fluctuations in the fluid columns of the feeder pipes which ruptured and spilled fuel and oxidizer onto the shut down, but still hot, engines. A failure of the #4 engine turbopump was also suspected. It was believed that the launch could have been salvaged had ground controllers sent a manual command to jettison the first stage and begin second stage burn early.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{aerodynamic}} surfaces {{known as}} [...] "high-lift devices" [...] including leading edge wing root extensions allow fighter aircraft much greater flyable 'true' alpha, up to over 45°, compared to about 20° for aircraft without these devices. This {{can be helpful}} at high altitudes where even slight maneuvering may require high angles of attack due to the low density of air in the upper atmosphere {{as well as at}} low speed at low altitude where the margin between level flight AoA and stall AoA is reduced. The high AoA capability of the aircraft provides a buffer for the pilot that makes stalling the airplane (which occurs when critical AoA is exceeded) more difficult. However, military aircraft usually do not obtain such high alpha in combat, as it robs the aircraft of speed very quickly due to induced drag, and in extreme cases, increased frontal area and parasitic drag. Not only do such maneuvers slow the aircraft down, but they cause significant <b>structural</b> <b>stress</b> at high speed. Modern flight control systems tend to limit a fighter's angle of attack to well below its maximum aerodynamic limit.|$|E
