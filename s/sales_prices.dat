5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual <b>sales</b> <b>prices.</b> Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles article and photograph of 1951.|$|E

The rest of the 1920s {{remained}} difficult period for the company, with low margins and highly fluctuating but steadily falling export. Ankers Træsliperi & Paperifabrik was bought in 1924 and expanded the following year to an annual production of 16,000 tonnes of pulp and 10,000 tonnes of newsprint.|$|E

Slightly over 75% of them are kept in the country's northeastern region. The {{statistics}} also indicate that {{by the beginning of}} 2012, less than one million were in the country, {{partly as a result of}} illegal shipments to neighboring countries where <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> are higher than in Thailand.|$|E

Elon Musk said production will remain in the U.S., but if there is sufficient local demand for the Model 3 in China, a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model. Production in Europe will also depend on the region's demand for the Model 3.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to rural}} parts of California, living in Milpitas is more expensive, {{as it is}} {{throughout}} Silicon Valley. Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m²) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable {{than the rest of}} the San Francisco Bay Area, as a similar sized house may cost well over a million dollars in more affluent cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino or Saratoga. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the West Coast's housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{trading was}} {{conducted}} under {{a framework of}} bilateral intergovernmental agreements which provided for sales, transit volumes, gas prices, gas storage, and other {{issues such as the}} establishment of production joint ventures. Commercial agreements were negotiated between the relevant companies within the guidelines and dictates of that framework and supplemented by annual agreements specifying exact prices and volumes for the following year. Gas <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> and transit tariffs were determined in relationship to each other. Commercial agreements and trade relations have been non-transparent and trade has been conducted via intermediaries such as Itera, EuralTransGaz, and RosUkrEnergo. RosUkrEnergo's involvement in the Russian-Ukrainian gas trade has been controversial. There are allegations that the company is controlled by Semion Mogilevich and its beneficiaries include strategically placed officials in the Russian and Ukrainian gas industries and governmental structures related to the energy sector. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has made accusations that RosUkrEnergo is owned by a business ally of Ukraine's ex-president, Viktor Yushchenko. The Ukrainian investigation into RosUkrEnergo, during Yulia Tymoshenko's first term as Prime Minister, was closed after she was fired by Yushchenko in September 2005.|$|E

500|$|On November 7, 1989, Torpedo...Los! sold at Christie's for $5.5 million (US$ {{million in}} [...] dollars) to Zurich dealer Thomas Ammann, {{which was a}} record for {{a work of art}} by Lichtenstein. The sale was {{described}} as the [...] "highpoint" [...] of a night in which Christie's achieved more than double the total <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> of any other contemporary art auction up to that date. The seller of the work was Beatrice C. Mayer, the widow of Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago founder and board member Robert B.

Mayer Memorial Loan Program and was exhibited at colleges and museums. Torpedo...Los! was expected to sell for $3 to 4 million at the time. In 1991, Mayer became one of the key benefactors of the new Museum of Contemporary Art Building.|$|E
500|$|When the Milken {{study was}} published, HUD had already {{commissioned}} its own study of seller-funded down-payment assistance programs. [...] It {{was performed by}} the Concentrance Consulting Group and published in March 2005 (herein, the [...] "Concentrance study"). [...] Unlike the earlier OIG reports, the Concentrance study was based largely on a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in interviews with individual homebuyers, sellers and various types of real-estate professionals in ten metropolitan areas. [...] Their findings corroborated some of the claims made by the nonprofit organizations, particularly that the typical recipient {{was a person who}} would not otherwise have been able to become a home owner. [...] But the interviewees also generally corroborated some of the claims made by detractors of the programs—that sellers were routinely raising their <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> to recoup the payment made to the nonprofit organization, and that the price increases led to higher loan costs for the buyers along with a higher risk of default on their loans. [...] The study was not restricted to the Nehemiah Program; no particular program was singled out {{in the body of the}} report. [...] However, the appendices gave summary results of questionnaire answers from real-estate professionals. [...] These results indicated that the Nehemiah Program was the most active program in the ten metropolitan areas covered by the study.|$|E
500|$|... Malawi exports an {{estimated}} US$945million in goods per year. The country's strong reliance on tobacco places {{a heavy burden}} on the economy as world prices decline {{and the international community}} increases pressure to limit tobacco production. Malawi's dependence on tobacco is growing, with the product jumping from 53% to 70% of export revenues between 2007 and 2008. The country also relies heavily on tea, sugar and coffee, with these three plus tobacco making up more than 90% of Malawi's export revenue. Because of a rise in costs and a decline in <b>sales</b> <b>prices,</b> Malawi is encouraging farmers away from tobacco towards more profitable crops, including spices such as paprika. The move away from tobacco is further fueled by likely World Health Organization moves against the particular type of tobacco that Malawi produces, burley leaf. It is seen to be more harmful to human health than other tobacco products. India hemp is another possible alternative, but arguments have been made that it will bring more crime to the country through its resemblance to varieties of cannabis used as a recreational drug and the difficulty in distinguishing between the two types. This concern is especially important because the cultivation of Malawian cannabis, known as Malawi Gold, as a drug has increased significantly. Malawi is known for growing [...] "the best and finest" [...] cannabis in the world for recreational drug use, according to a recent World Bank report, and cultivation and sales of the crop may contribute to corruption within the police force.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> and its proximity to different open spaces types is explored using a data set comprised of single-family home sales {{in the city of}} Portland, within Multnomah County, between 1990 and 1992. Homes located within 1, 500 feet of a natural area park, where more than 50 % of the park is preserved in native and/or natural vegetation, are found to experience, on average, the largest increase in <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> The open space size that maximizes a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> is calculated for each open space type. Natural area parks require the largest acreage to maximize <b>sale</b> <b>price,</b> and specialty parks are found to have the largest potential effect on a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> A zonal approach is used to examine the {{relationship between}} a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> and its distance to an open space. Natural area parks and specialty parks are found to have a positive and statistically significant effect on a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> for each zone studied.
