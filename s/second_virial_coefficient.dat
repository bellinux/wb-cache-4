This equation is also called the Kamerlingh Onnes equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. A is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> B corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, C to triplets, and so on.

2500|$|In dilute solution, the {{properties}} of the polymer are characterized by the interaction between the solvent and the polymer. In a good solvent, the polymer appears swollen and occupies a large volume. In this scenario, intermolecular forces between the solvent and monomer subunits dominate over intramolecular interactions. In a bad solvent or poor solvent, intramolecular forces dominate and the chain contracts. In the theta solvent, or the state of the polymer solution where the value of the <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> becomes 0, the intermolecular polymer-solvent repulsion balances exactly the intramolecular monomer-monomer attraction. Under the theta condition (also called the Flory condition), the polymer behaves like an ideal random coil. [...] The transition between the states is known as a coil-globule transition.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} (Couldwell et al., 1978) has been {{developed}} for the measurement of the <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> of condensable gases. This method evaluates the <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> in terms of three pressure measurements (temperature maintained constant) and avoids the difficult volume calibration associated with former p-V-T-n and other volumetric methods. Measurements are reported for n-hexane at temperatures of 323. 15, 328. 15, 338. 15, 348. 15, 358. 15 amd 373. 15 K, and for benzene and cyclohexane at temperatures of 323. 15, 348. 15 and 373. 15 K. The influence of surface adsorption of the vapours on the measurement of <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> is observed. It is suggested that future measuremets be made for loading pressure less than 0. 34 to 0. 4 times the saturation vapour pressure of the gases, corresponding to a region of monolayer adsorption. The influence of the third <b>virial</b> <b>coefficient</b> is determined, thus enabling the estimations of the "true" <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> which are at variance with the literature values (Dymond and Smith, 1980). Reasons are advanced to explain this anomaly. The results interpreted in the same manner, as the literature values, are {{in agreement with the}} latter. In a parallel study. an existing apparatus (McElroy et al., 1980) has been modified to measure unlike interaction <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Battino et al., 1983). The excess <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> (B 12 ōB 11 +B 22) / 2) for benzene, cyclohexane and n-hexane vapour binary mixtures have been measured at the temperatures 298. 15, 323. 15. 348. 15, 373. 15 and 398. 15 K.

To study these interactions in the gas phase a Burnett type equipment was designed, built and operated at low pressure, obtaining experimental pressure-temperature (P-T) data for various systems including alcohol-amylamine mixtures. The P-T data were reduced by a method developed in this work to give values of <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Measurements on known systems were in excellent agreement with values reported in the literature.

40|$|Protein {{partitioning}} in aqueous two-phase {{systems is}} strongly {{affected by the}} net charge of the protein, but a thermodynamic description of the charge effects has been hindered by conflicting results. Many of the difficulties may arise from failures to isolate electrochemical effects from other interactions of phase components;This work was targeted at characterizing the charge effects on protein partitioning in polymer-polymer aqueous two-phase systems by using two series of genetically-engineered charge modifications of bacteriophage T 4 lysozyme produced in E. coli. The two series, one {{in the form of}} charged-fusion tails and the other in the form of charge-change point mutations, provided matching net charges but very different polarity. Partition coefficients of both series were obtained and interfacial potential differences of the phase systems were measured. Phase systems with different polymer concentrations, different salts and salt concentrations were investigated. T 4 lysozymes with different surface charge display different partitioning behaviors in all the aqueous two-phase systems that were studied, which indicates the importance of electrostatic effect on protein partitioning. All the proteins have different partition coefficients in systems with different overall polymer concentrations because of different potential differences and different polymer-protein interactions between the two phases. T 4 lysozyme fusion-tail mutants display different partitioning behavior in all the phase systems from those of point mutations with matching net charge. In the systems with the same overall polymer concentration, but different salts and salt concentrations, both salts and proteins have different distributions between the two phases;A model based on the virial expansion was established to describe the dependence of the protein partition coefficient on phase composition and potential difference. Multi-angle laser light scattering measurements were performed initially to determine the <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> between proteins and polymers in a phase solution to calculate the interaction parameter in the model. However, the prediction of the parameter from the <b>second</b> <b>virial</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from laser light scattering has been very difficult.

40|$|Historically, the {{development}} of equations of state for fluids has almost invariably followed {{the lead of the}} van der Waals equation by simply adding together contributions from intermolecular repulsion and attraction. Recently an alternative approach, first suggested by Dieterici (Ann. Phys. Chem. Wiedemanns Ann., 1899, 69, 685), has been revised (R. J. Sadus, J. Chem.
