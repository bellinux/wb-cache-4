25|$|The Lord's Taverners, a {{charitable}} group comprising cricketers and cricket-lovers, take their {{name from the}} old Tavern pub at Lord's, where the organisation's founders used to congregate. The pub no longer exists, and the Tavern <b>Stand</b> <b>now</b> stands on its former site. However, a new pub {{of the same name}} is open in the grounds, as well as the Members Bar, in the Pavilion.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the first Sydney cricket test in February 1882, the ground could boast two grandstands; the Brewongle Stand at the {{southern}} end and the original Members' Stand, which had been built in 1878 in the north west corner where the current Members' <b>Stand</b> <b>now</b> sits. On opposite sides of the ground to the stands two spectator mounds were built. They became known as The Hill and the Paddington Hill.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, {{if only for a}} short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who knew where they had stood, but not where they would <b>stand</b> <b>now.</b> As there had been no definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.|$|E

25|$|As studies <b>stand</b> <b>now,</b> {{the authors}} do admit that even this last {{hypotheses}} is {{not supported by}} sound proofs– {{as far as the}} aspect and original composition of the statues-tombs complex is concerned. It has nevertheless been suggested that, if the hypotheses is correct, the sculptures would have been arranged at the East and West side of the serpentine-shaped necropolis, to form a sort of gigantic human exedra reminiscent of the half-circle exedra of a Giants’ grave. The boxers could have formed the most external part of this arrangement, whereas archers and warriors would have been located in the center, immediately next to the tombs. According to this hypotheses, the nuraghe models would have formed the crowning of the mound, being arranged on the cover slabs of the tombs.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} back (1980–81) saw the club finish 7th. Work started that {{year on a}} new £1million stand, {{originally}} called the Findus <b>Stand</b> (<b>now</b> known as the Young's Stand) after the former Barrett's Stand had been declared unsafe, the stand opened {{for the first time}} on 29 August 1982, as the Mariners played hosts to Leeds United. In the 1983–84 season the club finished 5th in the Second Division after spending most of the latter part of the campaign in the top three promotion places. This was their highest league finish since the 1947–48 season. Grimsby Town's stay in the Second Division ended in 1987, having spent much of the 1986–87 season in the top half of the table, but a run of 8 losses and 2 draws in the final 10 games saw them fall from 8th to 21st.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stand</b> <b>now</b> {{comprises}} {{only one}} level of timber tiered seating (originally two), with slatted timber benches and back rests, supported on steel frames {{bolted to the}} floor. The seating is accessed via three sets of brick and concrete stairs {{at the front of}} the stand. These are located at either end of the structure and in the middle, the central stair having a double staircase. Set into the front brick wall of each staircase is an inscribed stone plaque. That at the southeast end reads: This stone was laid by CE McDougall, President 18th Nov 1922 J Hutchinson, Builder. That in the centre stair reads: This stone was laid by His Excellency, Sir Matthew Nathan PC, GCMG, Governor of Queensland 18th Nov 1922 Richard Gailey Jnr FOIA, Architect. That on the northwest stair reads: This stone was laid by Ernest Baynes, Chairman, for and on behalf of the Council 18th Nov 1922. This stone also records the names of the 13 other RNA Councillors of the day and the Secretary. The front and staircase balustrades are of decorative cast iron with timber handrails, but the side balustrades are a later metal grille. At the top of the seating, later fire-exit doors have been cut in the brick rear wall at either end – these lead to fire-escape stairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, when Hawthorn {{entered the}} VFA, the council was {{required}} {{to build a new}} dressing shed to meet the standards of the VFA competition. These dressing sheds were erected in the north-west corner of the ground, where the Tuck <b>Stand</b> <b>now</b> resides, and were later moved to the Rathmines Road Reserve in Hawthorn where it still exists today. In 1922 the ground was widened by 30 yards and lengthened westward by 50 yards - taking in the previous outer reserve ground - to the dimensions that remain today. The 1922 ground improvements also resulted in Glenferrie Oval's first main stand, which was a wooden structure {{to be known as the}} Kennon-Owen Stand, and had been purchased from the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in late 1921 when that ground was closed due to expansion of the Jolimont railyards. The Kennon-Owen Stand was located where the Victorian Weightlifting Building is now situated. Glenferrie Oval is universally known for its famous art-deco Grandstand, built in 1937 and later named the Michael Tuck stand after the club great, and housed the new changerooms and administration of the club. It is now heritage protected as one of the most significant buildings of the era. The Kennon-Owen Stand was replaced by the Dr A S Ferguson Stand, a new brick stand opened in 1966 which was 185 feet long and could seat 1450, with 400 undercover. It was later to be home of the Past Players Association and the original Museum. The northern part of the Ferguson stand was demolished to make way for the Victorian Weightlifting Building. In 1963 the large scoreboard was erected at the eastern end of the ground. After the club won the 1961 premiership it was decided to buy some houses on the other side of Linda Crescent to build the Social Club which opened in 1962. The ground was relatively small by VFL standards, but the intimate nature of the ground (with the grandstands and train line surrounding the ground) made for a terrific atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, {{as part of}} a £35,000 refurbishment, an 80-yard-long {{roof was}} added to the United Road <b>stand</b> (<b>now</b> the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand) for the first time, while roofs were added to the south corners in 1938. Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Old Trafford was requisitioned by the military {{to be used as a}} depot. Football continued to be played at the stadium, but a German bombing raid on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 damaged the stadium to the extent that a Christmas day fixture against Stockport County had to be switched to Stockport's ground. Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main <b>stand</b> (<b>now</b> the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman James W. Gibson. After pressure from Gibson, the War Damage Commission granted Manchester United £4,800 to remove the debris and £17,478 to rebuild the stands. During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their [...] "home" [...] games at Maine Road, the home of their cross-town rivals, Manchester City, at a cost of £5,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts. The club was now £15,000 in debt, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labour MP for Stoke, Ellis Smith, petitioned the Government to increase the club's compensation package, but it was in vain. Though Old Trafford was reopened, albeit without cover, in 1949, it meant that a league game had not been played at the stadium for nearly 10 years. United's first game back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748spectators witnessed a 3–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers.|$|E
