40|$|SummaryThe {{antiviral}} {{protein kinase}} PKR inhibits protein synthesis by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF 2 α on Ser 51. Binding of double-stranded RNA to the regulatory domains of PKR promotes dimerization, autophosphorylation, and the functional {{activation of the}} kinase. Herein, we identify mutations that activate PKR {{in the absence of}} its regulatory domains and map the mutations to a recently identified dimerization surface on the kinase catalytic domain. Mutations of other residues on this <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> PKR autophosphorylation and eIF 2 α phosphorylation, while mutating Thr 446, an autophosphorylation site within the catalytic-domain activation segment, impairs eIF 2 α phosphorylation and viral pseudosubstrate binding. Mutational analysis of catalytic-domain residues preferentially conserved in the eIF 2 α kinase family identifies helix αG as critical for the specific recognition of eIF 2 α. We propose an ordered mechanism of PKR activation in which catalytic-domain dimerization triggers Thr 446 autophosphorylation and specific eIF 2 α substrate recognition...|$|E

The effects of crystal size and blocking on the activity-selectivity characteristics of the crystal are illustrated through an example that is qualitatively similar to industrially important reactions such as alkylation of toluene in blocked ZSM- 5 zeolite. 1...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSelf-assembly of alkylphosphonic acids on {{stainless}} steel was investigated under different conditions. Four different alkylphosphonic acids exhibiting alkyl chain of various size were synthesized and studied: butylphosphonic acid (C 4 P), octylphosphonic acid (C 8 P), decylphosphonic acid (C 10 P), and hexadecylphosphonic acid (C 16 P). Electrochemistry experiments were extensively {{carried out in}} order to determine electrochemical <b>surface</b> <b>blocking</b> of adsorbed layers in function of grafting time. In term of <b>surface</b> <b>blocking,</b> an 8 h modification time was optimal for all alkylphosphonic acids. Longer immersion times lead to degradation of adsorbed layers. For the first time, grafting of C 16 P was studied under high frequency ultrasound irradiation. Interestingly, grafting process is highly accelerated under sonication and well-covering C 16 P modified substrates are obtained after 1 h of immersion under ultrasound irradiation. This would allow to elaborate high-quality alkylphosphonic acids modified samples within much shorter times. Water contact angles measurements and X-ray Photoelectrons Spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed presence of adsorbed alkylphosphonic acids on {{stainless steel}} surface.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{is to use the}} diurnal variation of the differences in the brightness temperatures between each of the four surface-sensing IRTM (infrared thermal mapper) wavelength bands to separate the average grain size determined by the thermal inertia into the <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> population and the inertia of the fine component. It is noted that the thermal emissivity of the surface can also be determined and that this in turn can be used to estimate compositional variations. What is more, the atmospheric dust content can be estimated and used to infer sources and sinks of airborne dust. Owing to the number of unknowns, observations at more than one time of day are necessary to determine each of these parameters independently.

40|$|Meshkenet Tessera {{structures}} were mapped from Magellan data and several resemblances to chocolate tablet boudinage were found. The complex fault sets display polyphase tectonic sequences {{of a few}} main deformation phases. Shear and tension {{have contributed to the}} areal deformation. Main faults cut the 1600 -km long Meshkenet Tessera highland into bar-like blocks which have ridge and groove pattern oriented along or at high angles to the faults. The first approach to the <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> deformation is an assumption of initial parallel shear faulting followed by a chocolate tablet boudinage. Major faults which cut Meshkenet Tessera into rectangular blocks have been active repetitively while two progressive or superposed boudinage set formations have taken place at high angles during the relaxational or flattening type deformation of the area. Chocolate tablet boudinage is caused by a layer-parallel two-dimensional extension resulting in fracturing of the competent layer. Such structures, defined by two sets of boudin neck lines at right angles to each other, have been described by a number of authors. They develop in a flattening type of bulk deformation or during superposed deformation where the rock is elongated in two dimensions parallel to the surface. This is an attempt to describe and understand the formation and development of structures of Meshkenet Tessera which has complicated fault structures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a modified contact algorithm based on the flexibility matrix approach for the analysis of three bodies in elastic frictional contact. This analysis reduces four nodal-displacement equations of potential contact nodes in three bodies to two equa-tions by satisfying the compatibility condition of displacement and force of equilibrium. The third contact surface is considered necessary for computing contact pressure between tire and road, or wheel and rail, which must be loaded through an additional contact between shaft and tire/wheel. In {{view of the fact that}} the common normal/tangential direction of contacting surfaces may vary during the loading process, a method of determining the common normal direction between contacting surfaces is proposed and incor-porated into the modified algorithm. In order to ease computational procedures, two levels of operation are adopted, namely, primitive level and higher level. The primitive level is designed to compute the nodal reactional forces and rigid body motions whereas the latter is designed for the determination of common normal/ tangential directional and contact pressure. The algorithm is applied to solve the contact pressure for the two body assembly of a cylinder/flat <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> and for the three body assembly of a shaft/disk/flat plate. The computed and measured results are compared and found to achieve excellent agreement, veri-fying the validity of the proposed algorithm for solving contact problems of practical engineering interest...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The human placenta-derived {{cell line}} BeWo has been {{demonstrated}} to be restrictive to cell-free HIV- 1 infection. BeWo cells are however permissive to infection by VSV-G pseudotyped HIV- 1, which enters cells by a receptor-independent mechanism, and to infection by HIV- 1 via a cell-to-cell route. Results Here we analysed viral entry in wild type BeWo (CCR 5 +, CXCR 4 +) and BeWo-CD 4 + (CD 4 +, CCR 5 +, CXCR 4 +) cells. We report that HIV- 1 internalisation is not restricted in either cell line. Levels of internalised p 24 antigen between VSV-G HIV- 1 pseudotypes and R 5 or X 4 virions were comparable. We next analysed the fate of internalised virions; X 4 and R 5 HIV- 1 virions were less stable over time in BeWo cells than VSV-G HIV- 1 pseudotypes. We then investigated {{the role of the}} proteasome in restricting cell-free HIV- 1 infection in BeWo cells using proteasome inhibitors. We observed an increase in the levels of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV- 1 infection in proteasome-inhibitor treated cells, but the infection by R 5 -Env or X 4 -Env pseudotyped virions remains restricted. Conclusion Collectively these results suggest that cell-free HIV- 1 infection encounters a <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> leading to a non-productive entry route, which either actively targets incoming virions for non-proteasomal degradation, and impedes their release into the cytoplasm, or causes the inactivation of mechanisms essential for viral replication. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{intracellular}} Ca blocks current flow through open K channels in squid giant fiber lobe neurons. The block has similarities to internal Sr block of K channels in squid axons, {{which we have}} reexamined. Both ions must cross a high energy barrier to enter the blocking site from the inside, and block occurs only with millimolar concentrations and with strong depolarization. With Sr (axon) or Ca (neuron) inside, IK is normal in time course for voltages less than about + 50 mV; but for large steps, above + 90 mV, there is a rapid time- dependent block or "inactivation. " From roughly + 70 to + 90 mV (depending on concentration) the current has a complex time course that {{may be related to}} K accumulation near the membrane's outer <b>surface.</b> <b>Block</b> can be deepened by either increasing the concentration or the voltage. Electrical distance measurements suggest that the blocking ion moves to a site deep in the channel, possibly near the outer end. Block by internal Ca can be prevented by putting 10 mM Rb in the external solution. Recovery from block after a strong depolarization occurs quickly at + 30 mV, with a time course that is about {{the same as that of}} normal K channel activation at this voltage. 20 mM Mg in neurons had no discernible blocking effect. The experiments raise questions regarding the relation of block to normal channel gating. It is speculated that when the channel is normally closed, the "blocking" site is occupied by a Ca ion that comes from the external medium...|$|E
40|$|Lava flows {{continue}} to move {{after they have been}} emplaced by flow mechanisms. This movement is largely vertical and can be detected using differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. There are three main components to this motion: (1) movement of surface scatterers, resulting in radar phase decorrelation, (2) measurable subsidence of the flow surface due to thermal contraction and clast repacking, and (3) time-dependent depression of the flow substrate. These effects act in proportion to the thickness of the lava flow and decay with time, although there is a time lag before the third component becomes significant. We explore these effects using SAR data from the ERS satellites over the Etna volcano, Sicily. Phase decorrelation on young, thick a’a lava flows persists for a few years and probably results from <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> rotations during flow contraction. Maximum measured subsidence rates of the 1991 – 1993 lava flow over a period of 70 days are about 0. 7 mm day− 1, but are potentially greater in areas of data decorrelation. These rates fall to < 2. 7 × 10 − 2 [*]mm day− 1 after about 20 years in flows about 50 m thick, sooner for thinner flows. Comparison with measured subsidence rates on Kilauean lava lakes suggests that thermal contraction only accounts for about one third of the observed subsidence. The remaining motion is thought to come from surface clast repacking during cooling and from creep mechanisms in the flow substrate. Measurements of postemplacement surface movement provide new constraints on the thermomechanical properties of lava flows and have cautionary implications for the interpretation of interferometric SAR data of volcanoes. © 2001 American Geophysical Union...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine if Alberta's sulfur blocks were inhabited by microorganisms which contribute to oxidation of elemental sulfur. The first objective was to elucidate a functional method of differentiating between viable and non-viable organisms in environmental samples. The second objective was to use this and other more established microbiological analyses to characterize the microbial population inhabiting the block and determine if they influence elemental sulfur oxidation. In order to differentiate between viable and non-viable microorganisms, I relied on a DNA binding agent called ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA). Based on previous literature, I was able to test its activity in different environmental samples. Treatment with EMA inhibits the amplification of free DNA, whereas DNA protected by the membranes of viable cells is not affected. After finding that killed pure culture cells had a substantial reduction in their DNA amplification I proceeded to inoculate the same species of killed and viable cells into either soil, biofilm, or elemental sulfur samples obtained from Syncrude's Phase I sulfur block. I have found the EMA treatment to be sufficient at inhibiting amplification of DNA from non-viable cells inoculated into both the soil and sulfur samples, but not in the biofilms. In achieving the second objective I designed experiments which tested in vitro and in situ samples of the sulfur block. Bioreactors containing microbiological inoculants from water running off the sulfur block were compared to sterile bioreactors for levels of acidity, sulfate accumulation and microbial population. Comparison between the <b>surface</b> <b>block</b> samples and the matrix samples showed a higher number of bacteria in the surface samples; however, {{the differences between the two}} bioreactor treatments were not significant. Bioreactors which received sterile water did not increase in acidity or sulfate accumulation. The two treatments which were inoculated with 10 % sulfur block run off increased by 3 and 4. 3 mM sulfate, and 8. 6 x 10 - 3 and 1. 8 x 10 - 2 hydronium ion concentration, in the surface and matrix treatments respectively. In situ samples obtained by coring the sulfur blocks showed that microbial inhabitants are present throughout the block depth profile with a discontinuous pattern, which could be attributed to the fractures associated with the solidification of the block and subsequent colonization. The level of microbiological inhabitants ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 5 log heterotroph colony forming units g- 1 sulfur, and 3. 19 x 101 to 1. 62 x 102 A. thiooxidans amplified copy numbers, and 1. 23 x 103 to 1. 11 x 104 Eubacteria amplified DNA copy numbers ìg- 1 of extracted DNA from EMA treated sulfur block samples. Most probable number counts for autotrophs only detected organisms along the 0 - 10 cm depth of the block. The results of this study suggest that the use of ethidium monoazide bromide is a suitable method of detecting the large and varied microbial population inhabiting Alberta's sulfur blocks which can influence the level of block oxidation. The level of microorganisms present in the block is varied, which may parallel the varied pockets of air and water collected in the geomorphic fractures. Microbial communities residing in the sulfur block are partially responsible for sulfur oxidation. Methods aimed at reducing the level of sulfur oxidation must aim to reduce both the chemical and biological pathways leading to sulfur oxidation...|$|E
