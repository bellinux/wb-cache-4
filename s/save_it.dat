The reader would type the BASIC program listing {{into the computer}} by hand, run it, and could <b>save</b> <b>it</b> to tape for later use. Software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts. Magazines printed long lists of checksummed hexadecimal digits with machine code games or tools.|$|E

5|$|Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game, {{developed}} by Rare {{and published by}} Nintendo. Although the game's original concept was intended for the Nintendo 64, Shigeru Miyamoto convinced Rare to re-design the game to be both {{a part of the}} Star Fox series and as a launch title for the GameCube. The game was released on 23 September 2002, and was the final Nintendo game that Rare developed, before it was acquired by Microsoft {{to be a part of}} its Xbox division the day after the game's release in North America. The game's story takes place after the events of Star Fox 64, in which players take control of Fox McCloud who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and <b>save</b> <b>it</b> from destruction.|$|E

5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. The house had become a Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though {{the house had been}} heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to <b>save</b> <b>it</b> from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} {{was bought by}} the Ramada hotel chain in 1973, and was redecorated to cover the 1950s design, seen {{at the time as}} outdated. No longer in vogue, but centrally located, the hotel remained prominent for years, and hosted conferences, business meetings, and vacationers. Under Ramada management, however, the property began to show a lack of maintenance, and its popularity declined. It closed in 2001 and its demolition was considered when no purchase offers were received. Admirers of the hotel's exemplary architecture and its local history rallied to <b>save</b> <b>it,</b> and it was placed on the Scottsdale Historic Register.|$|E
5|$|A boy {{known as}} Musashi, reincarnated from the legendary Brave Fencer Musashi who saved the Allucaneet Kingdom from a monster called the Wizard of Darkness 150 years before, is summoned to Allucaneet by its ruler Princess Fillet to <b>save</b> <b>it</b> from the invading Thirstquencher Empire. Musashi {{is given the}} blade Fusion, and is charged {{with the task of}} obtaining Brave Fencer Musashi's sword — Lumina, the Sword of Luminescence — before the Thirstquencher Army does. Although Musashi has no {{intention}} of saving the kingdom, he agrees to do so in order to return to his homeland. After Musashi recovers Lumina, he finds {{that most of the people}} from the Allucaneet kingdom, including Fillet, have been kidnapped by the Thirstquencher Empire.

In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} <b>save</b> <b>it,</b> but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to <b>save</b> <b>it</b> from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00 on 12 May, U.S. commanders on {{the ground}} in Khâm Đức were {{notified}} of Westmoreland's decision to evacuate all military personnel, both American and Vietnamese, as well as their civilian dependents. However, most army units {{on the ground}} were left uninformed about the decision, and it led to chaos later when evacuation was underway. During the predawn hours of 12 May, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division continued to increase their pressure on the main compound of the Special Forces Camp. The North Vietnamese made final preparations for the main assault by capturing one mountain outpost at a time, which were manned by U.S. soldiers of the Americal Division, who had placed machine-guns around the main camp as advanced defensive positions. At 04:23, U.S. soldiers reported that outpost number 1 had been overrun, and fighter-bombers were scrambled in an attempt to <b>save</b> <b>it.</b> About 30 minutes later, the defenders of outpost number 7 reported that their position had been surrounded. They attempted to hold their position by calling on an AC-47 gunship to fire directly into their position, in order to stop the attack, but soon afterwards outpost 7 succumbed to the North Vietnamese and the defenders retreated back to Khâm Đức.|$|E

5|$|Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing {{heritage}} to {{the march}} of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to <b>save</b> <b>it</b> from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Robert Foehl {{died and}} Evelyn Foehl sold {{the hotel to}} Ramada, a hotel chain. The Ramada {{managers}} remodeled the hotel, stripping out and covering {{much of what they}} considered an outdated interior. The hotel was named Ramada Valley Ho. Though it remained a fashionable location for a while, its original character was largely absent and it began to suffer from neglect and disrepair. It continued to host conferences and business meetings, such as the Natural Health, Aromatherapy and Herb Conference & Trade Show in early 2000, and the Arizona LANBasher's League party in early 2001. Later that year, the hotel closed and was put on the market. Plans for its demolition were considered when no offers were made. To protect it, Alan Hess wrote a letter detailing its importance, and a successful campaign was mounted in Scottsdale to place it on the Scottsdale Historic Register in recognition of its significance to city history and its architectural connection to the past. To <b>save</b> <b>it</b> from demolition, business partners Scott Lyon and Bill Nassikas of Westroc Hotels & Resorts bought the property and undertook an extensive renovation and building addition that eventually cost $80M. Evelyn Foehl died in August 2003, two years after the hotel was closed for renovation.|$|E
5|$|Maneater is a 2007 American {{television}} natural horror film {{directed by}} Gary Yates and produced by RHI Entertainment, starring Gary Busey, Ty Wood, and Ian D. Clark. The film aired on various {{video on demand}} channels, before officially premiering in the United States on the Syfy Channel on September 8, 2007. This film lends {{its name to the}} film series to which it belongs and is the third film in the series. Filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the film is produced under an agreement with Syfy. Based on Jack Warner's novel Shikar, the film details the killing spree of an escaped Bengal tiger after it gets loose in a small town along the Appalachian Trail. Trying to stop it are Sheriff Barnes (Busey) and big game hunter Colonel Graham (Clark), while a young boy named Roy (Wood) who has a strange connection to the tiger, tries to <b>save</b> <b>it.</b> It is the 4th film in the Maneater Series.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo {{initially}} {{developed the}} sequel {{of the first}} F-Zero game for the SNES, although it was broadcast in several versions on the St.GIGA subscription service for the Satellaview attachment of the Super Famicom instead. Using this add-on, gamers could download titles via satellite and <b>save</b> <b>it</b> onto a flash ROM cartridge for temporary play. The sequel was released under the Japanese names of BS F-Zero Grand Prix and BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 during the mid-1990s. BS F-Zero Grand Prix contained a new track along with the original 15 tracks from the SNES game and four different playable vehicles. According to Nintendo Power, the game was under consideration for a North American release via Game Pak. IGN states BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2 features one new league containing five tracks, a Grand Prix and a Practice mode.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to <b>save</b> <b>it.</b> The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North Vietnamese tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To <b>save</b> <b>it,</b> Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North Vietnamese overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North Vietnamese tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North Vietnamese had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E
