25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as <b>suture</b> <b>materials.</b> Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Incisional {{complications}} {{are a major}} post operative challenge following ventral midline exploratory celiotomy for {{abdominal pain}} in horses.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effect of antibacterial (triclosan) coated 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 <b>suture</b> <b>material</b> on the likelihood of incisional infections when used for closure of subcutaneous tissue following ventral midline celiotomies in horses. METHODS: One hundred horses undergoing exploratory celiotomy assigned at random to one of 2 groups. In the control group coated 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) was used for apposition of the subcutaneous tissue in a simple continuous pattern and, in the study group, antibacterial (triclosan) coated 2 - 0 polyglactin 910 <b>suture</b> <b>material</b> (Vicryl Plus) was used. Post operatively an elastic adhesive abdominal bandage was applied, changed and the incision was inspected by a clinician blinded to the study protocol at 24 - 36 h and 6 - 9 days post operatively. Outcomes of interest were evidence of incisional pain, incisional oedema, sheath/udder oedema, incisional drainage, hernia formation and dehiscence. RESULTS: Antibacterial-coated <b>suture</b> <b>material</b> did not decrease the likelihood of incisional complications in 100 horses. CONCLUSIONS: A beneficial effect on ventral midline incisions in 100 horses was not evident by using antibacterial-coated <b>suture</b> <b>material.</b> POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: Lack of effectiveness of antibacterial-coated <b>suture</b> <b>material</b> in equine ventral midline closure after exploratory celiotomy and the observed potential adverse effects suggest that further clinical investigations are needed before using such material routinely on horses...|$|R

5000|$|Chitosan {{hemostatic}} {{agents are}} often chitosan salts made from mixing chitosan with an organic acid (such as succinic or lactic acid). The hemostatic agent works by {{an interaction between}} the cell membrane of erythrocytes (negative charge) and the protonated chitosan (positive charge) leading to involvement of platelets and rapid thrombus formation. The chitosan salts can be mixed with other materials {{to make them more}} absorbent (such as mixing with alginate), or to vary the rate of solubility and bioabsorbability of the chitosan salt. The chitosan salts are biocompatible and biodegradable making them useful as absorbable haemostats. The protonated chitosan is broken down by lysozyme in the body to glucosamine [...] and the conjugate base of the acid (such as lactate or succinate), substances naturally found in the body. The chitosan salt may be placed on an absorbable backing. The absorbable backing may be synthetic (for instance made from existing absorbable <b>suture</b> <b>materials</b> e.g. Tephaflex polymer) or natural (e.g. cellulose or gelled/solidified honey). In addition to salts, hydrogel-based chitosan bandages have been developed to treat burn wounds. Burns are similar to other wounds, but are problematic because they are associated with membrane destabilization, energy depletion, and hypoxia, all of which can cause severe tissue necrosis if not treated properly or quickly enough. Chitosan-gelation bandages using nanofibrin {{have been shown to be}} more durable than ointments, while still allowing gas exchange at the cell surface.|$|E

40|$|Background: Using non-absorbable suture in {{children}} hernia repair to decrease of recurrence is recommended {{in the most}} pediatric surgery centers. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine relationship between kind of <b>suture</b> <b>material</b> and rate of hernia recurrence. Methods: In this clinical trial 200 children (age 1 - 5 years) with inguinal hernia who operated in Imam-Reza Hospital (kermanshah –Iran Between April 2007 until April 2008) enrolled into the study. Cases were selected by convenience sampling method and then randomly divided into two groups (100 cases per group) and operated with absorbable (silk 3 - 0) and non-absorbable (vicryli 3 - 0) <b>suture</b> <b>material.</b> Following period was 12 months after operation and collected data analyzed by statistical software. Emergency operations were excluded from the study. Results: 83 % of patients were boy and 17 % were girl. % 53 showed right side inguinal, 29 % left side and % 18 were bilateral hernia. After one year follow up only one case of recurrence was observed in each group. Conclusion: Our study confirmed that recurrence of inguinal hernia {{in children}} after surgery, is not related to kind of <b>suture</b> <b>material</b> (absorbability) and we didn’t find any significant difference.
