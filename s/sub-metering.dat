30|$|The <b>sub-metering</b> methods need {{to build}} {{expensive}} <b>sub-metering</b> systems to gather the data {{with regard to the}} charging request information of PEVs [6, 14]. These methods usually aim at designing demand management paradigms that are based on the real time pricing mechanisms. For many power utilities, the main impediment for such paradigms is that their residential customers may not be receptive to the true dynamic pricing schemes [3, 19]. For the power utilities whose residential customers prefer time-of-use price schemes, <b>sub-metering</b> systems are not necessities for the customers and the utilities are also unwilling to improve their measurement systems due to the high cost of investment, operation as well as maintenance [20]. Thus, the <b>sub-metering</b> methods are not suitable for these kinds of power utilities since the charging request information of PEVs are not available.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the use of}} high-resolution multispectral data (acquired by small format digital air-borne imaging sensors) for large-scale vegetation mapping. Recent studies have focused on the potential of air-borne multispectral data as a means of identifying plant communities. This study is concerned with establishing a formal relationship between spatial resolution and large-scale vegetation mapping. The study was necessitated by the fact that economic considerations take precedence over technical recommendations when selecting imagery data for large-scale vegetation mapping in Uganda. The question is whether there is any scientific justification in acquiring <b>sub-meter</b> imagery data for large-scale mapping of `low-value' natural resources such as vegetation. Rigorous assessment of both thematic and geometric integrity of vegetation patches mapped from digital air-borne imagery data shows that a formal relationship between large-scale vegetation mapping and high-resolution imagery data can be established. The findings show that there is no scientific justification to acquire <b>sub-meter</b> imagery data for large-scale vegetation mapping. It is concluded that digital air-borne data acquired at spatial resolutions greater than <b>sub-meter</b> is optimal for cost-effective large-scale vegetation mapping...|$|R

A few error sources {{have to be dealt with}} in order to reach <b>sub-meter</b> accuracy, among which one has to cite multipath and near-far effects.

40|$|The future vehicle {{navigation}} {{for safety}} applications requires seamless positioning at {{the accuracy of}} <b>sub-meter</b> or better. However, standalone Global Positioning System (GPS) or Differential GPS (DGPS) suffer from solution outages while being used in restricted areas such as high-rise urban areas and tunnels due to the blockages of satellite signals. Smoothed DGPS can provide <b>sub-meter</b> positioning accuracy, but not the seamless requirement. A disadvantage of the traditional navigation aids such as Dead Reckoning and Inertial Measurement Unit onboard vehicles are either not accurate enough due to error accumulation or too expensive to be acceptable by the mass market vehicle users. One of the alternative technologies {{is to use the}} wireless infrastructure installed in roadside to locate vehicles in regions where the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals are not available (for example: inside tunnels, urban canyons and large indoor car parks). The examples of roadside infrastructure which can be potentially used for positioning purposes could include Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) /Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) based positioning systems, Ultra-wide band (UWB) based positioning systems, Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) devices, Locata’s positioning technology, and accurate road surface height information over selected road segments such as tunnels. This research reviews and compares the possible wireless technologies that could possibly be installed along roadside for positioning purposes. Models and algorithms of integrating different positioning technologies are also presented. Various simulation schemes are designed to examine the performance benefits of united GNSS and roadside infrastructure for vehicle positioning. The results from these experimental studies have shown a number of useful findings. It is clear that in the open road environment where sufficient satellite signals can be obtained, the roadside wireless measurements contribute very little to the improvement of positioning accuracy at the <b>sub-meter</b> level, especially in the dual constellation cases. In the restricted outdoor environments where only a few GPS satellites, such as those with 45 elevations, can be received, the roadside distance measurements can help improve both positioning accuracy and availability to the <b>sub-meter</b> level. When the vehicle is travelling in tunnels with known heights of tunnel surfaces and roadside distance measurements, the <b>sub-meter</b> horizontal positioning accuracy is also achievable. Overall, simulation results have demonstrated that roadside infrastructure indeed has the potential to provide <b>sub-meter</b> vehicle position solutions for certain road safety applications if the properly deployed roadside measurements are obtainable...|$|R

This study analyses data from a Toronto condominium building to assess the impacts of suite (or sub-) metering. We estimate the aggregate reduction in electricity usage arising from <b>sub-metering</b> to be about 20 %. Financial savings to residents are much smaller. We analyze large variations across units in electricity consumption after <b>sub-metering</b> finding that unit characteristics explain much {{but not all of}} this variation.

For the stochastic simulating methods, travel patterns of internal combustion engine vehicles are used to simulate PEV charging behaviors and then to calculate NCBC-parameters [13].

30|$|The {{proposed}} methodology is well {{suitable for}} the power utilities to understand the integrated features of ACL from the system level’s perspective.

However, it does not need to install the expensive <b>sub-metering</b> systems to gather and process the PEV’s individual information.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that, there are some related works on getting the {{accurate}} data of ACLs (see [15, 16, 39]). In these works, the data of charging load for each vehicle are submitted to a central authority by using the expensive <b>sub-metering</b> system.
