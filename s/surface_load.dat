In this study the bending properties of nickel electrodes are investigated in an attempt to correlate the bending properties of the electrode with its propensity to blister. Nickel electrodes from three different batches of material were tested in both the as-received and impregnated forms. The effects of specimen curvature and position within the electrode on the bending strength were studied, and within-electrode and batch-to-batch variations were addressed. Two color-imaging techniques were employed to differentiate between the phases within the electrodes. These techniques aided in distinguishing the relative amounts of nickel hyroxide <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> on each electrode, thereby relating <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> to bend strength.

They are for singly-rotated quartz plates, doubly-rotated quartz plates, and plates of crystals of class 6 mm with the c-axis along the plate thickness, respectively. The purpose of the generalizations is to include the effects of <b>surface</b> mechanical <b>loads</b> such as mass layers or fluids for resonator -based acoustic wave sensor applications. Surface acoustic impedance is introduced {{to take into account}} various <b>surface</b> <b>loads</b> in a general manner for time-harmonic motions.

Simple two-dimensional scalar differential equations are constructed from the asymptotic dispersion relations quadratic in the small wave numbers of transversely varying thickness waves at long wavelengths. The equations obtained can be reduced to the equations in the literature in the special case when the surface acoustic impedance is set to zero. As illustrations of the usefulness and effectiveness of the equations obtained, simple examples of pure thickness vibrations of unbounded plates with <b>surface</b> <b>loads,</b> propagation of long thickness waves in unbounded plates with <b>surface</b> <b>loads,</b> and vibrations of finite plates with <b>surface</b> <b>loads</b> are presented.

40|$|The {{dissolved}} air flotation process is used in water and wastewater treatment. Among many parameters the fluid dynamics determine {{the capacity of the}} process. The contact zone is assumed to be important for the removal function, as it {{is believed to be the}} location for the aggregation of bubbles and flocs. This paper presents an experimental study on the flow structure in a contact zone of a DAF pilot tank and the influence of contact zone configuration. The flow structure in the contact zone was examined for different horizontal lengths of the zone and for different heights and inclinations of the shaft wall. The hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> was 11 m/h over the total tank surface area and the recycle rate was constant at 10 % of the main flow. The examined hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> over the contact zone ranged from 40 to 98 m/h. Water velocities in the longitudinal, central section of the tank were measured with an acoustical Doppler velocimeter in a grid net for the different contact zone configurations, giving an insight into the flow structure. The result showed that the flow structure in the contact zone was characterised by a turbulent lower region and a plug-flow higher region. The hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading,</b> a function of the length of the contact zone, seemingly determined the extension of the turbulent region. A higher hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> decreased the turbulent region while the lower loading increased it. A hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> of 65 m/h was suggested for design. It was not possible to determine the turbulent intensity quantitatively due to the measurement method. The height and inclination of the shaft wall did not seem to have a significant influence on the turbulent region. However, an increased height of the contact zone enhanced the higher, plug flow region and a recommended height of 0. 81 m or higher for the recommended hydraulic <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> was suggested when both mixing and plug-flow are desired. The separation zone was characterised by a stratified flow structure, mainly influenced by the cross-flow velocity that is a function of the distance between the shaft wall top and the water surface. A cross-flow velocity of 37 m/h or higher resulted in a clearly defined stratification, believed to be crucial for an efficient separation of flocs. Finally, the extension of the lower, denser plug-flow region in the separation zone increased when the shaft wall height increased...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a procedure for calculating the energy dissipation at the interface using finite element 	analysis to estimate the damping for the fundamental and the higher modes. We use the static contact analysis instead of the 	dynamic contact analysis to reduce computational effort and use the mode shapes of linear FE model of the joined plate 	structure as the forced displacement in the static contact analysis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} {{underground}} spaces {{in urban areas}} must account {{not only for the}} current overburden load but also for future surface loads, such as from construction of high-rise buildings above underground structures. In saturated ground, the <b>surface</b> <b>load</b> will generate an additional mechanical response through stress changes and ground displacement, as well as a hydraulic response through pore pressure changes. These hydro-mechanical (H-M) changes can severely influence tunnel stability. This paper examines the effect of surface loading on the H-M response of a typical horseshoe-shaped tunnel in saturated ground. Two tunnel models were created in the computer code Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC). One model represented weak and low permeability ground (stiff clay), and the other represented strong and high permeability ground (weathered granite). Each of the models was run under two liner permeabilities: permeable and impermeable. Two main cases were compared. In Case 1, the <b>surface</b> <b>load</b> was applied 10 years after tunnel construction. In Case 2, the <b>surface</b> <b>load</b> was applied after the steady state pore pressure condition was achieved. The simulation results show that tunnels with impermeable liners experienced the most severe influence from the surface loading, with high pore pressures, large inward displacement around the tunnels, and high bending moments in the liner. In addition, the severity of the response increased toward steady state. This induced H-M response was worse for tunnels in clay than for those in granite. Furthermore, the long-term liner stabilities in Case 1 and Case 2 were similar, indicating that the influence of the length of time between when the tunnel was completed and when the <b>surface</b> <b>load</b> was applied was negligible. These findings suggest that under surface loading, in addition to the ground strength, tunnel stability in saturated ground is largely influenced by liner permeability and the long-term H-M response of the ground...|$|E

CH is supplied to the MBfR through gas-permeable membranes while NO and As(III) are provided in the bulk liquid. A mathematical model was developed by integrating the well-established biokinetics of DAMO microorganisms with the kinetics of As(III) -oxidizing bacteria (AsOB). The key parameter values of AsOB were specifically estimated using the batch experimental data of an enriched pure AsOB culture in conjunction with thermodynamic state calculations. The maximum specific growth rate of AsOB (μ) and the yield coefficient for AsOB (Y) were determined to be 0. 00161 h and 0. 016 g COD g As, respectively. The modeling results demonstrated that both influent <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> (or hydraulic retention time (HRT)) and CH <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> played important roles in controlling the steady-state microbial community structure and thus significantly affected the system performance.

Here, we report, for the first time, an easy approach for bimetallic Au/Ag <b>surface</b> <b>loading</b> by modifying poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogel surfaces with ss-DNA. The advantages of this approach consist of the accuracy and the simplicity by which both gold and silver nanoparticles can be adsorbed by electrostatic interactions on hydrogel templates, without requiring sophisticated chemical treatment for their conjugation or the growth of nanoparticles on a hydrogel surface. The resulting patterns possess the capability of tuning the interparticle distance upon temperature changes, and thus their plasmonic properties. The aforementioned templates have been successfully used as SERS substrates for 5 × 10 - 7 M adenine detection...|$|R
