5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids. It adheres to plants where it promotes growth of sooty molds. These are unsightly, reduce the surface area of the plant available for photosynthesis and may reduce {{the value of the}} crop. These aphids are also the vectors of about thirty plant viruses, mostly of the nonpersistent variety. The aphids may not be the original source of infection but are instrumental in spreading the virus through the crop. Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of <b>soft</b> <b>soap.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{advantage}} of the fully boiled hot process in soapmaking is the exact amount of hydroxide required need not be known with great accuracy. They originated when {{the purity of the}} alkali hydroxides were unreliable, as these processes can use even naturally found alkalis, such as wood ashes and potash deposits. In the fully boiled process, the mix is actually boiled (100+ °C), and, after saponification has occurred, the [...] "neat soap" [...] is precipitated from the solution by adding common salt, and the excess liquid is drained off. This excess liquid carries away with it much of the impurities and color compounds in the fat, to leave a purer, whiter soap, and with practically all the glycerine removed. The hot, <b>soft</b> <b>soap</b> is then pumped into a mold. The spent hydroxide solution is processed for recovery of glycerine.|$|E
2500|$|Evolutionary Squadron {{was engaged}} in what became {{the first of the}} Victorian Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres. When the Leander joined on 17 June, she was {{attached}} to the ships blockading Berehaven. On 18 June [...] "the weather was so stormy that all exercises were suspended... After sunset, the Conquest, Mercury, Leander, Racer, Cormorant and Mariner with the torpedo boats attached to them got under way top take up their position of observation outside the haven. The weather proved so boisterous that the blockading division returned before it had reached the open water outside. In returning... the Leander, while manoeuvring to keep clear of the Conquest, struck on the Hornet rock, and was seriously injured. As soon as the accident occurred the engines were stopped, the watertight doors closed, the pumps were set going, and collision mats and sails were passed under the ship's bottom. After some time it was found that e pumps failed to gain on the leak. On the following day the ship was moved nearer the shore, so as to be ready to beach in case of necessity. Early, however on the 21st the divers succeeded in finding the leak and stopping it with the patent leak-stopper. The ship's hold was thereupon cleared of water." [...] It was not until 24 June that Leander was ready to go to sea again. [...] On 26 June, the Leander, escorted by the Mercury, arrived at Devonport, where she was placed in dock. [...] The damage to the Leader was described as follows: [...] "The sea entered through numerous rivet holes where rivets had been sheared, but the compartment kept the ship afloat in a working condition."

5000|$|The word [...] "alkali" [...] {{is derived}} from Arabic al qalīy (or alkali), meaning the {{calcined}} ashes (see calcination), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called potash and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), a far more strongly basic substance known as caustic potash (potassium hydroxide) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally {{used in conjunction with}} animal fats to produce <b>soft</b> <b>soaps,</b> one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of saponification, one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element potassium, which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol K (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from alkali.|$|R
50|$|Shea {{butter is}} mainly {{used in the}} {{cosmetics}} industry for skin- and hair-related products (lip gloss, skin moisturizer creams and emulsions, and hair conditioners for dry and brittle hair). It is also used by soap makers, typically in small amounts (5-7% of the oils in the recipe), because it has plenty of unsaponifiables, and higher amounts result in <b>softer</b> <b>soaps</b> that have less cleaning abilities. Some artisan soap makers use shea butter in amounts to 25% - with the European Union regulating the maximum use around 28%, but it is rarely the case in commercially produced soap due to its high cost against oils like palm oil or pomace (olive oil). It is an excellent emollient for people who suffer dry skin conditions. No evidence shows it is a cure, but it alleviates the pain associated with tightness and itching.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the family {{business}} goes back to Michael Mäurer and his stepson Andreas August Wirtz, who established a soapworks in 1845 in Stolberg. Initially, only <b>soft</b> <b>soaps,</b> curd soaps and fine soaps were sold {{in a grocery store}} for the local market. Over time, the products were established in the Rhineland and later also in neighboring countries (mainly France and Benelux). In 1884 the production of washing powder began and then {{around the turn of the}} century the company's first trademarks were registered. Mäurer & Wirtz now produces detergents, soap products, perfumes and cosmetics. Since 1992, products under the Betty Barclay brand have also been produced under license. In 2007, the company took over the brands 4711, Tosca, Sir Irisch Moos and Extase from Procter & Gamble, and in 2011 the Baldessarini fragrance line, and Windsor were acquired.|$|R
5000|$|Shaving soap is {{produced}} like a traditional soap with an ingredient selection oriented to producing a stable, slick lather. Its manufacture often differs slightly from normal bath soap in that both potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide {{may be used}} as saponification agents. Sodium hydroxide creates a harder soap such as is used in pucks, where potassium hydroxide facilitates creation of a <b>softer</b> <b>soap</b> which loads on the brush more easily. [...] Historically, tallow has been a popular ingredient in shaving soaps and is still in use in some traditional products. Palm oil is frequently used as a substitute for tallow where animal fats are not desired. Other oils such as coconut oil are commonly used. Component fatty acids such as stearic acid are also used in shaving soaps for the properties which they contribute; stearic acid contributes to a more stable dense lather.|$|R

5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as <b>soft</b> <b>soaps.</b> The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium is a necessary element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|R
40|$|Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Quaintance) (orange spiny whitefly, OSW) (Hemiptera Aleyrodidae) {{has been}} {{spreading}} in Puglia Re- gion since its first report in Italy in 2008.

The aleyrodid also threatens {{the national and}} international trade in plants and plant products because of the Quarantine status (EPPO A 2) of the species. OSW is a major pest of Citrus; we also report more than thirty other host plant species belonging to twenty-two families infested by this pest; thus, cultivated and urban areas, parks and protected natural reserves are infested to varying degrees. Moreover, it disturbs natural and protected habitats, also forcing unwanted pesti- cide use in economic and recreation areas as in private gardens.
