5000|$|The true {{emergency}} brake on a cable car {{is known as}} a [...] "slot blade," [...] a steel wedge that can be forced into the slot-rail between the running rails by a strong spring. If a runaway car is moving fast enough that the slot blade is necessary, the friction has been known to weld the blade to the <b>slot</b> <b>rail,</b> disabling the transit line until the obstruction can be extracted with a cutting torch. The slot blade is controlled by the large red lever near the grip, and is not used except for emergency stops.|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{material}} properties of rails and projectiles {{are critical to}} the success of the Navy railgun. This thesis addresses the design, fabrication, and testing of a scalable square bore electromagnetic railgun. This railgun is designed to permit series augmented operation, and incorporates disposable rail liners to facilitate investigating the suitability of variousrail materials. A series of shots has demonstrated performance consistent with theoretical modeling, including significant performance enhancement as a result of both <b>slotted</b> <b>rail</b> geometry and augmentation over solid rail and un-augmented configurations. A capacitor based stored energy supply input of 35 kJ resulted in a measured velocity of 294 m/s for an 11. 4 gram projectile. Suggestions are provided for future power supply configurations, rail materialsand surface treatments, and a variety of armature geometries...|$|R
50|$|Also in the 1880s, third-rail systems {{began to}} be used in public urban transport. Trams were first to benefit from it: they used {{conductors}} in conduit below the road surface (see Conduit current collection), usually on selected parts of the networks. This was first tried in Cleveland (1884) and in Denver (1885) and later spread to many big tram networks (e.g. New York, Chicago, Washington DC, London, Paris, all of which are closed) and Berlin (the third rail system in the city was abandoned {{in the first years of}} the 20th century after heavy snowfall.) The system was tried in the beachside resort of Blackpool, UK but was soon abandoned as sand and saltwater was found to enter the conduit and cause breakdowns, and there was a problem with voltage drop. Some sections of tramway track still have the <b>slot</b> <b>rails</b> visible.|$|R
50|$|Dallas-Arbiter {{designed}} {{their own}} cumbersome tom holder too, which {{might well have}} looked good on the drawing board, but in reality {{was something of a}} nightmare. A flat, curved and <b>slotted</b> <b>rail</b> was jacked up a little above the bass drum shell and to this was attached the body of the cast tom holder itself. This was fitted with not one, but two ratchets and by judicious use of both you could actually have exceedingly limited horizontal height adjustment. A radial-toothed block was fixed to the tom which mated with a ratchet on the holder to maintain its playing angle, and very large capstan nuts locked tom to holder and holder to bass drum rail. These capstans had an annoying tendency to crush your fingers against the drum and were neither particularly stable nor hard wearing. But at the time, it was the best around. Hayman spurs were modelled on Ludwig type outrigger designs, but with large, cast circular holder blocks which matched the nut boxes and also located the tom legs. Hayman's 'lightning-bolt' bass drum tensioners were the first that were ergonomically designed to ease operation - they were shaped to accommodate the thumbs better.|$|R
50|$|The slots on a Weaver {{system are}} {{primarily}} {{used as a}} clearance of the locking screw that tightens the clamp to the rail. Some Weaver-type accessories have a bar that fits inside the machined <b>slots</b> on the <b>rails</b> while many others do not.|$|R
50|$|Acknowledging the MOE slot systems shortcomings, Magpul drafted M-LOK {{as a new}} and {{improved}} mounting standard which was released in 2014 replacing the existing MOE <b>slot.</b> The M-LOK <b>rail</b> specification included metric dimensions instead of imperial, and utilizes a T-slot nut with a thread-locking fluid making it suited for applications such as free floated handguards. It was designed to work with both metal and polymer parts.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{significant}} difference between the Picatinny rail and the similar Weaver rail are the size and shapes of the slots, where the Picatinny <b>rail</b> has square-bottomed <b>slots</b> while Weaver <b>rails</b> have rounded <b>slots.</b> This means that an accessory designed for a Weaver rail will fit onto a Picatinny rail whereas the opposite might not be possible (unless the slots in the Weaver rail are modified to have square bottoms.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Washington, DC, PCCs were unique {{because of}} conduit plows which {{collected}} current from a <b>slot</b> between the <b>rails</b> {{into which the}} plow dipped, contacting positive and negative rails under the street on either side. At the city limits were [...] "plow pits", where the plow was dropped and removed, the trolley pole raised, and the car then continued on its way, utilizing overhead wire; the process was reversed {{in the opposite direction}} into Washington.|$|R

50|$|M-LOK, {{standing}} for Modular Locking system, {{is a free}} licensed firearms accessory mounting system developed by Tim Roberts of Magpul Industries that allows for direct attachment to negative space mounting points. It is a competing standard to KeyMod in regards of replacing the MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail in some applications. Compared to the Picatinny rail system, M-LOK and KeyMod enables the user to have a slimmer and smoother handguard with accessories mounted only where needed, whereas a Picatinny handguards typically will have Picatinny <b>rail</b> <b>slots</b> for its whole length resulting in a larger handguard diameter with sharp corners.|$|R
50|$|The first {{commercial}} slot cars {{were made by}} Lionel (USA) and appeared in their catalogues from 1912, drawing power from a toy train rail sunk in a trough or wide <b>slot</b> between the <b>rails.</b> They were surprisingly similar to modern slot cars, but independent speed control was available only as an optional extra. Production was discontinued after 1915. Sporadically over the next forty years, several other electrically powered commercial products came and went. Although a patent was registered {{as far back as}} March 1936 for a slot car, until the late 1950s, nearly all powered toy vehicles were guided by raised rails, either at the wheels (railroad-style), or at the lane center, or edge.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} open access for railways, comparing the new situation created by the current European reform and the present situation in the US, deriving from the deregulation. Open access in this paper {{is defined as the}} possibility to use some <b>slots</b> on <b>rail</b> infrastructure on a non discriminatory basis. Concerning railway, it is interesting to analyze why two market oriented areas (the US and the EU) exhibit so important differences. First, we address the question of open access, which is both desirable and problematic, given the specificity of railways economics. Then, we will consider the question of the link between open access and vertical separation, which lies behind the rationale of European reform. This had to be compared to the vertically integrated railways of the US. The third part will show how various infrastructure charging systems might favour or preclude open access. After a brief review of the theoretical principles, two systems will be analyzed the French one and the German one. We will conclude that different situations and different objectives might lead to different railways systems but this diversity might be problematic for EU...|$|R
5000|$|A typical air hockey table {{consists}} of large smooth playing surface, a surrounding rail {{to prevent the}} puck and paddles from leaving the table, and <b>slots</b> in the <b>rail</b> {{at either end of}} the table that serve as goals. On the ends of the table behind and below the goals, there is usually a puck return. Additionally, tables will typically have some sort of machinery that produces a cushion of air on the play surface through tiny holes, with the purpose of reducing friction and increasing play speed. In some tables, the machinery is eschewed in favor of a slick table surface, usually plastic, in the interest of saving money in both manufacturing and maintenance costs. Note that these tables are technically not air hockey tables since no air is involved, however, they are still generally understood to be as such due to the basic similarity of gameplay. There also exist pucks that use a battery and fan to generate their own air cushion, but as they are prone to breakage, they are commonly marketed only as toys. An air hockey table has very little friction.|$|R

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution Li-cense, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. The effect of preheating temperature on the mechanical and fracture behavior, hardness, and the microstructure of <b>slot</b> welded pearlitic <b>rail</b> steel were studied. Railhead sections with slots were preheated to 200 ËC, 300 ËC, 350 ËC and 400 ËC before gas metal arc filling to simulate defects repair. Another sample, welded at room temperature (RT) with no pre-heat, was studied in comparison. The parent rail steel has ultimate strength, yield strength and strain to failure of 1146 MPa, 717 MPa and 9. 3 %, respectively. Optimum values of these properties for the welded rail steels {{were found to be}} 1023 MPa, 655 MPa and 4. 7 %, respectively, for the 200 ËC preheat temperature. On this basis, the optimum weld effi-ciency was found to be 89. 2 %. The average apparent fracture toughness KI for the parent rail was 127 MPa. m 0. 5, while that for the optimum welded joint (200 ËC preheat) was 116. 5 MPa. m 0. 5. In addition, the average hardness values of the weld, fusion zone, and heat affected zone (HAZ) were 313. 5, 332 and 313. 6 HB, respectively, while that for parent rail steel was about 360 HB. Dominance of bainite and acicular ferrite phase in the weld microstructure was observed at 200 ËC preheat...|$|R
40|$|Vehicles {{will suffer}} various loads in the moving process, {{and under the}} {{functions}} of {{various factors such as}} the ovality of the wheel, and the impacts to the rails when the vehicle passes the curve <b>rail,</b> the <b>rail</b> <b>slot</b> and the turnoff, the wheels will inevitably add normal loads to the rails, and the flexural moment will influence the generating and growth of the fatigue crack. To study the influences of flexural moment on the fatigue performances of rails with various materials, the experiments about the growth performances of the fatigue cracks of two kinds of materials including U 71 Mn and PD 3 under the flexural moment are made on the NENE- 2 fretting test machine, and according to the experiment results, the measures to reduce the fatigue of rails are proposed. The research analysis and experiment results indicate that the fatigue crack generates from the focal point of stress at first, and the main shearing stress is very important, and when the static load functions, the direction of crack growth will change by a large angle, but when the dynamic load functions, the direction of crack growth will be stable, and under same loading speed, the fatigue crack of PD 3 rail more easily generates and grows than U 71 Mn rail. To prevent and reduce the fatigue of rails, the selection of rail should accord with the type of the route and the actual working environment of the rail, and in the heavy freight route, the PD 3 rail with high mechanical strength should be selected, and in the high-speed route, the U 71 Mn rail should be selected. </p...|$|R
