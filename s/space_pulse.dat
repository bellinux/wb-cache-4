[Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2370 (2000) ]. We then investigate the transport of optical pulses through dispersive media with negative dielectric permittivity and negative refractive index choosing the geometry such that no resonant effects come into play. For evanescent waves, the definitions of the group delay and the reshaping delay get interchanged in comparison to propagating waves. The total delay times for the evanescent waves can be negative in an infinite plasma medium even for broad-band pulses. The total time is, however, positive for broad band pulses {{in the presence of}} an interface when the radiation is detected outside the plasma. We find evidence of the Hartman effect for pulses when the distance traversed in the plasma is much smaller than the free <b>space</b> <b>pulse</b> length. We also show that for a negative refractive index medium(NRM) with ϵ(ω) = μ(ω) the reshaping delay for propagating waves is identically zero. The total delay time in NRM is otherwise dominated by the reshaping delay time, and for broad band pulses in NRM the total delay time is subluminal...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. <b>Space</b> <b>pulse</b> tube coolers {{are very}} efficient, {{but like all}} {{regenerative}} high frequency Stirling and pulse tube coolers, the cold head needs to be located near the compressor {{in order to minimize}} the input power to the cooler. For applications that require cooling some distance from the cooler or that require vibration isolation from the cooled object, the cooling can be effectively transferred with a fluid loop rather than with a higher mass conduction bar. This can greatly ease integration into a payload as well as readily transmit the cooling to multiple cooling points. In this paper we report on a proof of concept test in which we added cold reed valves to the pulse tube cold block of our flight proven high efficiency cooler (HEC) so that cold gas could be circulated without the need for an additional circulation pump and additional heat exchangers to cool the gas. In this test, the measured remote cooling and the parasitic heat loads were compared to our previously reported tests using warm reed valves. The two previous tests circulated gas from either a second circulator compressor or from the pulse tube compressor that also acted as a circulator and cooled the gas with a heat exchanger connected to the pulse tube cold head...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging {{of the spine}} {{provide a basis for}} the automated assessment of intervertebral disc (IVD) and vertebral body (VB) anatomy. High resolution three-dimensional (3 D) morphological information contained in these images may be useful for early detection and monitoring of common spine disorders, such as disc degeneration. This work proposes an automated approach to extract the 3 D segmentations of lumbar and thoracic IVDs and VBs from MR images using statistical shape analysis and registration of grey level intensity profiles. The algorithm was validated on a dataset of volumetric scans of the thoracolumbar spine of asymptomatic volunteers obtained on a 3 T scanner using the relatively new 3 D T 2 -weighted <b>SPACE</b> <b>pulse</b> sequence. Manual segmentations and expert radiological findings of early signs of disc degeneration were used in the validation.

The method compares favourably to existing 3 D MR segmentation techniques for VBs.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{traversal}} times of electromagnetic pulses across dispersive media with negative dielectric permittivity (ε) and magnetic permeability (μ) parameters. First we investigate {{the transport of}} optical pulses through an electrical plasma and a negative refractive index medium (NRM) of infinite and semi-infinite extents where no resonant effects come into play. The total delay time of the pulse constitutes of the group delay time and the reshaping delay time as analyzed by Peatross et al peatross. For evanescent waves, even with broadband width, the total delay time is negative for an infinite medium whereas it is positive for the semi-infinite case. Evidence of the Hartman effect is seen for small propagation distance compared to the free <b>space</b> <b>pulse</b> length. The reshaping delay mostly dominates the total delay time in NRM whereas it vanishes when ε(ω) =μ(ω). Next we present results on the propagation times through a dispersive slab. While both large bandwidth and large dissipation have similar effects in smoothening out the resonant features that appear due to Fabry-Pérot resonances, large dissipation can result in very small or even negative traversal times near the resonant frequencies. We investigate the traversal and the Wigner delay times for obliquely incident pulses. The coupling of evanescent waves to slab plasmon polariton modes results in large traversal times at the resonant conditions. We also find that the group velocity mainly contributes to the delay time for pulse propagating across a slab with refractive index (n) = - 1. The traversal times are positive and subluminal for pulses with sufficiently large bandwidths. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

However, the shortcomings of using it are low DC voltage utilization, and poor inverter transmission capability. In recent years, there is an increasing trend and more research concentration of using <b>space</b> vector <b>pulse</b> width modulation in adjustable speed drives and renewable energy systems because it has better DC bus utilization, better performance, lower loss, lower ripples, and wide application range.

The three phase alternating current induction motor is reviewed based upon space vector representation. The development of <b>space</b> vector <b>pulse</b> width modulation and implementation to speed control of induction motor is done using Matlab/Simulink. The simulation is conducted by analyzing the response of stator current, stator voltage, speed, voltage, frequency, and the electromagnetic torque.
