40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{model is}} {{presented}} for predicting {{the transport of}} an environmental pollutant from the source to and through <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> model can predict the deposition of an environmental pollutant on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> due to <b>the</b> pollutant being loaded on dust particles, which are later deposited on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> model is a coupling of three models: a model for predicting the cumulative dust deposition from near and far field sources on a certain area; a canopy microclimate model for solving the energy partition within the canopy elements and so predicting the water convection stream for pollutant transport through the soil; and coupling the deposition of these pollutants on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> to a model for its transport through <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> air pollution model uses the Gaussian model approach, superimposed for multiple emission sources, to elucidate the deposition of pollutant laden airborne particulates on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> A complete canopy layer model {{is used to calculate}} within the canopy energy fluxes.

Because of water flow and other processes (climate, agricultural practices, biological activity, etc.), {{the properties of}} <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> can undergo significant changes that affect erosion. As a consequence, understanding of the transport processes and improvement in soil erosion prediction involve a better assessment of <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> characteristics. Structural stability {{has been used to}} evaluate <b>the</b> sensitivity of <b>soils</b> to erosion. This methodology reproduces the processes responsible for particle and fragment production, the initial step leading to erosion. Structural stability measurements are usually carried out on soil materials sampled inside the plough layer. Since the material at <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> interacting with <b>the</b> overland flow, is usually discarded at sampling, structural stability measurements do not assess the properties of the most relevant material.
