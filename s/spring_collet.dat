2500|$|An {{external}} collet is {{a sleeve}} with a (normally) cylindrical inner surface and a conical outer surface. The collet can be squeezed against a matching taper such that its inner surface contracts to a slightly smaller diameter, squeezing the tool or workpiece {{to hold it}} securely. Most often this is achieved with a <b>spring</b> <b>collet,</b> made of spring steel, {{with one or more}} [...] cuts along its length to allow it to expand and contract. An alternative collet design is one that has several tapered steel blocks (essentially tapered gauge blocks) held in circular position (like the points of a star, or indeed the jaws of a jawed chuck) by a flexible binding medium (typically synthetic or natural rubber). Regardless of the collet design, the operating principle is the same: squeeze the collet against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction.|$|E
40|$|A {{device is}} {{described}} for forming vee-notches in tensile test specimens comprising a vertically reciprocating, triangular, triple-edged cutting tool guided in a corresponding triangular slot. The specimen to be vee-notched {{is mounted on}} a carriage that is movable toward {{and away from the}} cutting tool. The specimen is precisely positioned on the carriage by tapered studs that extend into holes in the specimen and are used to expand <b>spring</b> <b>collets</b> {{against the wall of the}} holes...|$|R
