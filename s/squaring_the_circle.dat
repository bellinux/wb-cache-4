Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and <b>squaring</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E

25|$|Doubling {{the cube}} and trisection of an angle (except for special angles such as any φ such that φ/2π is a {{rational}} number with denominator not divisible by 3) require ratios {{which are the}} solution to cubic equations, while <b>squaring</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> requires a transcendental ratio. None of these are in the fields described, hence no compass and straightedge construction for these exists.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{up to this}} period, geometers {{also tried}} to {{determine}} what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of trisecting an angle with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that {{can be carried out}} with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until Pierre Wantzel published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include doubling the cube and <b>squaring</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates {{from the fact that the}} compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.|$|E
