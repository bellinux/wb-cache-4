40|$|The pressure-density {{relationship}} {{and the pressure}} distribution inside the compression chamber of a newly designed New Holland BB 960 large <b>square</b> <b>baler</b> were studied for the baling of alfalfa, whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw. An analytical model was developed for the pressure distribution inside the compression chamber of the large <b>square</b> <b>baler</b> in the x-, y-, and z-directions by assuming isotropic linear elastic properties for forage materials. In order to validate this model, a tri-axial sensor was designed and {{used to measure the}} forces inside the compression chamber when whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw were baled. The experimental results proved that the developed analytical model for each of the tested forage materials had a good correlation with the experimental data with a reasonable coefficient of determination (0. 95) and standard error (20. 0 kPa). Test data were also used to develop an empirical model for the pressure distribution inside the compression chamber of the baler for each of the tested forage materials using least square method in regression analysis. These empirical models were simple equations which were only functions of the distance from the full extension point of the plunger along the compression chamber length. Analytical and empirical models were also developed for the pressure-density relationship of the baler for baling alfalfa and barley straw. Results showed that bale density initially decreased with distance from the plunger, and then remained almost constant up {{to the end of the}} compression chamber. The developed empirical model for both alfalfa and barley straw was a combination of a quadratic and an exponential equation. In order to validate the developed models, field tests were performed by baling alfalfa and barley straw of different moisture contents, flake sizes, and load settings. The forces on the plunger arms were recorded by a data acquisition system. The actual bale bulk density was calculated by measuring the bale dimensions and weight. Results showed that both load setting and flake size had a significant effect on the plunger force. The plunger force increased with increased load setting and flake size. Comparing analytical and empirical models for bale density as a function of the pressure on the plunger showed that the trend of variation of density with pressure in both models was similar, but the rate of change was different. The variation rate of density with pressure in the analytical model was higher than that of the empirical model. The analytical model underestimated the bale density at low plunger pressures but showed more accurate prediction at higher pressures, while the empirical model accurately predicted the bale density at both low and high pressures. Some crop properties such as coefficient of friction and modulus of elasticity were determined for the development of the pressure distribution model. Results showed that static coefficient of friction of alfalfa on a polished steel surface was a quadratic function of material moisture content, while the relationship between the coefficient of friction of barley straw on a polished steel surface and material moisture content was best expressed by a linear equation. Results of this study also proved that modulus of elasticity of alfalfa and barley straw was constant for the density range encountered in the large <b>square</b> <b>baler...</b>|$|E
40|$|Renewable fuel {{production}} {{is essential to}} improve the energy independence of the United States. Cellulosic ethanol is renewable fuel that is gaining traction in the commercial fuels industry. This fuel {{can be made from}} agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops widely available in the Midwestern United States. The biofuels industry is already moving to meet these federal biofuels mandates and to establish sustainable biomass feedstock supply chains. Two companies have scheduled to build dedicated cellulosic ethanol refineries in Iowa. This initial phase of a biofuels supply chain is currently in its infancy and will require significant efficiency improvements and enhancement to current methods to ensure profitability. The resulting harvest costs, transportation costs and material quality all have significant impact on the cellulosic ethanol industry. The objective of the first chapter of this thesis was to determine the best method for semi-automated and large scale analysis of machinery management parameters. Electronic data logging of GPS position and CAN messages provides the timing and operational status needed for calculation of machinery management terms. Additional information like fuel rate, engine speed, hydraulic flow, or specific implement parameters can also be captured. This data enables detailed performance evaluation. GIS software was used to query the dataset. Appropriate spatial selections and parameter filters were defined for each performance parameter. This ensured measurement of productivity terms in conformance to ASABE Machinery Management Standards. The objective of the second chapter was to quantify and provide detailed information on the performance of corn stover collection equipment during industrial scale harvest operations. Current equipment developed for the hay and forage industry can be used to harvest corn stover. Understanding the performance characteristics of this repurposed forage equipment is critically important for the continued development of the cellulosic ethanol industry.

This work presents an integrated design of multi-functional rice combine harvester that allows grain harvesting and straw baling. This multi-functional combine harvester could reduce the energy consumption required for rice harvesting and simplify the process of harvesting and baling. The transmission schematic, matching parameters and the rotation speed of threshing cylinder and <b>square</b> <b>baler</b> were designed and checked. Then the evaluation of grain threshing and straw baling were tested on a transverse threshing cylinders device tes rig and straw square bales compression test rig. The test results indicated that, with a feeding rate of 3. 0 kg/s, the remaining straw flow rate at the discharge outlet was only 1. 22 kg/s, which indicates a variable mass threshing process by the transverse threshing cylinder. Then the optimal diameter, length and rotating speed of multi-functional combine harvester transverse threshing cylinder were 554 mm, 1590 mm, and 850 r/min, respectively. The straw bale compression rotating speed of crank compression slider and piston was 95 r/min. Field trials by the multi-functional combine harvester formed bales with height×width×length of 40 × 50 × 54 - 63 cm, bale mass of 22. 5 to 26. 0 kg and bale density 206 to 216 kg/m 3.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the crop density in a New Holland BB 960 (branch of CNH Global N. V.) large <b>square</b> <b>baler</b> as examined by crop trajectory from the precompression room to the bale chamber. This study also examined both {{the top and bottom}} plunger pressures and critical factors affecting the final top and bottom bale densities. The crop trajectories (wad of crop) were measured using a high-speed camera {{from the side of the}} baler through viewing windows. The viewing windows were divided into four regions for determining the crop displacement, velocity and acceleration. Crop strain was used to evaluate the potential change in density of the crop before being compressed by the plunger. Generally, the vertical crop strain was found to be higher in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom. Average strain values for side measurements were 12. 8 % for the top and 2. 1 % for the bottom. Plunger pressures were measured to compare peak pressures between the top and bottom halves of each compressed wad of crop, and to develop pressure profiles based on the plunger’s position. Results of comparing the mean peak plunger pressures between the top and bottom locations indicated the mean pressures were significantly higher at the top location with the exception of one particular setting. Resulting pressure profile graphs aided in qualitatively describing the compression process for both top and bottom locations. A stepwise regression model was developed to examine the difference in material quantity in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom, based on bale weights. The model indicated that flake setting, stuffer ratio and number of flakes had the greatest effect on maintaining consistent bale density by comparing top to bottom halves of each bale. The R 2 (coefficient of determination) value for the developed model was of 59. 9 %. The R 2 was low although could be accounted for due to the limited number of data points in the developed model...|$|E
40|$|The {{compression}} of biomass {{is essential for}} facilitating transport and storage. Biomass, like wood, landscape refuse, straw and hay, is mostly compressed with a press moulding machine because of continuous operation which results in high capacities. The working principle of press moulding machines is based on friction of the material with the compression chamber. Higher friction means more compression but also results in high energy consumption for pushing the material out of the chamber. Studies show that the actual compression energy is less than 50 % of the total required energy of the compression process. This low energy efficiency is inherent to the current design of press moulding machines in agriculture and allows for optimizing the process. High forces are needed for the compression and the transportation of the biomaterial and thus the metal work {{has to be very}} solid. A tractor driving mobile press moulding machines then requires a lot of energy for off-road transportation. This research will found the development of new balers with higher energy efficiency and a lighter construction and will consist of two parts. The first and biggest part will model the interaction between the baler and the biomaterial in the compression chamber. This will result in a three dimensional dynamic finite element model that correlates the applied forces with the density of the biomass. The (time dependent) inputs of the compression process consist of machine and crop parameters together with the settings of the machine. Literature, lab research and fieldwork will explore the dependency of the model to the crops. The model validation will be done on the baler that is currently present at the lab. The second part of this research will show the advantages of a model-based optimization and will show the power of in-silico design optimization. This part will combine insights and expertise from experienced drivers with the modelling to eventually determine new machine parameters. The optimization will aim to minimize the work for transportation of the compressed biomaterial in the compression chamber while compressing till 200 kg/m³. Mechanical adaptations and suggestions for alternative control algorithms will be validated in the field with a large <b>square</b> <b>baler</b> to evaluate the optimal, theoretical efficiency in practice. nrpages: 174 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} world population, the {{agricultural}} sector needs more productive and more energy-efficient agricultural machinery in order to adequately address the growing demand for food and biomass. Therefore, the sector significantly invests in the optimization of agricultural machinery. Historically, the optimization of agricultural machinery was done by trial and error. Design improvements of agricultural machinery are still often based on the experience and the insights of engineers and farmers. To test whether an adjustment has a positive effect, a prototype is developed and validated during field tests. This optimization method, however, has some disadvantages. Developing and constructing a prototype is costly. Moreover, prototypes can only be validated in field conditions during the growing season. These two factors oblige agricultural machinery manufacturers to opt for small adaptations with a high success rate. The current generation of agricultural machinery is, therefore, the result of decades of evolution. Now that computing power increases, another opportunity to improve the design of agricultural machinery presents itself. Models and simulations facilitate the optimization of machines. However, an accurate virtual crop model is missing. A simulation model that accurately describes the interactions between individual crop stems and the interactions between crop stems and machine components {{could be used to}} improve the design of stem processing agricultural machinery. In this thesis, such a simulation model was developed for the processing of crop stems in a baler. It has previously been shown that the Discrete Element Method (DEM) can be used to simulate and optimize particulate processes. For this, two requirements need to be met. Realistic particle geometries and realistic deformation models are required to obtain accurate simulation results. The virtual crop stems, therefore, need to be compressible and bendable. Also the frictional and tensional properties need to be realistic. A first step {{in the development of the}} DEM simulation model included an analysis of the bending behaviour of crop stems. It was observed that there are two phases during bending: ovalisation and buckling. The forces that occur during ovalisation result in a flattening of the cross-section of the stem and this reduces the bending resistance. This process continues until the maximum force has been reached and the stem buckles. Buckling is associated with a strong reduction of the resistance to bending. The influence of the stem diameter, the thickness of the stem wall and the presence of a core-rind structure were examined for wheat and barley stems. All were found to affect the bending behaviour significantly. The acquired knowledge was used to develop a data based bending model for flexible particles (i. e. crop stems) in DEM. The influences of the stem length, the support distance and the number of segments which make up the virtual stem, were examined. The same data based method was also used for developing a compression model for virtual stems in DEM. For this purpose, the interactions between individual stems and the interaction between a stem and a plate were studied and modelled. The models were successfully validated by comparing bulk compression simulations and measurements. For this purpose 250 stems were compressed in a box by the movement of a plunger. To study the influence of friction on the processing of stems, measurements were performed on the stem level. The measured coefficients of friction were significantly lower than those found in the literature, which have been measured on a bulk level. The influence of friction on bulk compression was evaluated and it was found that a small change in the coefficient of friction at stem level has a significant effect on the bulk behaviour. The last stem parameter that was studied was the tensional stiffness. Stem measurements were again performed for this purpose. The force was found to increase linearly with increasing deformation up to the point where the stem broke. A linear tensional model was therefore implemented in DEM. Afterwards, the influence of the tensional resistance on the bulk deformation behaviour was examined. The effects of the tensional model parameters were found to be very limited. Therefore, the model parameters of the tensional model were selected in such a way that the computation time was minimized. The effect of strain rate on the force-deformation behaviour at the stem level was studied using a pendulum device. However, no significant effects could be observed for the tests at low and high speed with the used set-up. When the stem properties were measured and after they were modelled in DEM, the influence of the stem variability (e. g. the variability in physical and mechanical properties) on the bulk deformation behaviour was determined. To this end, simulations were performed with different degrees of variability. As a validation, bulk compression tests were performed. It was observed that a limited number of stem measurements can be sufficient to obtain accurate DEM simulations. As more stems are measured and as the stem database becomes larger, the accuracy of the simulations increases. However, the accuracy gained by measuring additional stems decreases with an increasing crop database. A statistical method was therefore presented to determine the minimum number of stem measurements needed to obtain accurate DEM simulations. When the behaviour of crop stems was fully characterized and modelled and after insights were obtained on the influence of stem variability, DEM simulations were performed regarding the processing of crop stems by the rotor of a large <b>square</b> <b>baler.</b> First, a method was developed to create virtual swaths. Scalability was demonstrated with these swaths. This reduced the computation time of thesimulations. Again, friction was found to have a significant impact on the crop processing as a higher coefficient of friction led to a higher energy consumption. When stems are damaged, less energy is required for their processing. Also, the feed rate was found to have an influence. The energy demand increased as more stems were processed simultaneously. Finally, the shape of the swath was also found to have a major impact on the required torque. An evenly filled swath was found to require less processing energy than an unevenly filled swath. In a final step, the filling of the pre-compression chamber was also simulated and successfully validated with stationary measurements. An increasing swath mass, the presence of the trip sensors (determining when the the pre-compression chamber is full) and a reduced rotor speed were found to have a negative impact on the required energy. The crop flow in the simulations was visually compared to the crop flow in the measurements. A high-speed camera was used for this purpose. The crop flows were found to be similar. However, a quantitative analysis should be performed to confirm this. The simulation model is now ready for the optimization of the design of the pick-up and feeding sections of the agricultural baler. The knowledge that was gained in this dissertation is more broadly applicable and could, for example, also be used for optimizing sections of the combine and the forage harvester. However, more research is required to accurately simulate nodes, leafs and ears. The influence of the strain rate and the number of stem measurements required to obtain accurate DEM simulations of crops should also be studied in more detail. Modelling the cutting and breaking of stems would have a positive effect on the accuracy and the applicability of the simulations. Since in many processes air currents have a major impact, a coupling with a CFD software is also necessary. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|E
