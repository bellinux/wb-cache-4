40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of attractiveness of stone fruits production in Czech Republic using the industry attractiveness evaluation matrix {{according to the}} methodology of Higgins and Vincze (1989). It was identifies the key criteria for evaluation of attractiveness, described in detail and eva­lua­ted {{from the viewpoint of}} a producer operating in the stone fruits production industry. According to the data of the Central Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture (OTK ÚKZÚZ) for 2008, 1166 entities (companies and growers) farmed on 21   738 hectares of fruit orchards, of which 6   730  ha were aimed on stone fruit production. Total sales for the production of stone fruits decreased by 34. 5  % in the period of 2004 – 2008. Production of stone fruit can be sold through <b>sales</b> <b>co-operatives,</b> to a fruit processing company or in­de­pen­dent­ly. Czech Ministry of Agriculture and the EU through the State Agricultural Intervention Fund stated a range of support programs under which it is possible to apply for funding. Attractiveness of the production of stone fruit is evaluated as below average; the result of the industry attractiveness evaluation matrix for this sector equals 1. 84, which is lower than the average score of 3. 00...|$|R

40|$|The present study, {{carried out}} in the state of Maharashtra of India during 2003 - 04, has its focus on {{assessing}} the functional dimensions of agribusiness cooperatives and identifying the reasons for their unsuccessful functioning. The study is based on a case of agribusiness cooperative dealing with the marketing of mainly fruit with its spectrum spread over various other marketing activities. The study has evaluated the performance of Khanapur Group Fruit <b>Sale</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Society (KFCS) which is located about 15 km from Raver taluka of the Jalgaon district in Maharashtra. Though it mainly deals with the marketing of banana, its functional dimensions also encompass input marketing and various other welfare activities. The evaluation of KFCS has revealed several deficiencies in its functioning, the major ones being its poor grasp of studying the market forces, its own internal drawbacks in terms of managing the Society, its own personal interests involved in the functioning of Society, and its failure to generate allies for lobbying to safeguard as well as promote interests of the Society or its members. Since the existence of internal interest-cum-entrepreneurial group in providing dedicated and efficient leadership stands very low as the members of the Board are reported to be self-centered with lack of motivation in terms of growth of the Society, there has been adverse impact on the working of this Society. The study has also revealed that because of lack of funds and losses incurred by the Society, coupled with selfish nature of the management, the memberfarmers have started diverting their produce to private traders. All these factors have led to some adverse implications insofar as the functioning of the society is concerned. The study has concluded that any agribusiness cooperative marked with such deficiencies will end-up with a similar fate as has been noticed in the case of KFCS. Agribusiness,...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the early}} {{emphasis}} in Owenism {{was on the}} formation of utopian communities, these communities were predicated upon co-operative labour, and frequently, <b>co-operative</b> <b>sales.</b> For example, the Edinburgh Practical Society created by the founders of Orbiston operated a co-operative store to raise the capital for the community. Abram Combe, the leader of that community, was to author the pamphlet The Sphere for Joint Stock Companies (1825), which made clear that Orbiston {{was not to be}} a self-subsistent commune, but a co-operative trading endeavor.|$|R
40|$|Minerals {{that are}} sold to {{collectors}} are often produced by artisanal and small scale miners {{in many developing}} countries. The market for collector minerals is not well understood by most government agencies or NGOs but has a large impact on the artisanal and small miners that {{have the opportunity to}} produce these minerals because of the high prices that can be realized. This paper describes the collector mineral market that is held annually in Tucson, Arizona, that analyzes the competitive forces that affect the profitability of the mineral dealers at the show and describes potential methods for artisanal and small scale miners to participate successfully in the show. Most collector minerals produced by artisanal and small-scale miners are valued for their aesthetic qualities instead of mineral content. The 43 shows that operate during the first two weeks in February make up the largest gem and mineral show in the world, the Tucson Show. The Tucson Mineral Show is a subgroup of six shows that specialize primarily in collector minerals. There are several competitive forces at the Tucson Mineral Show that can affect the profit potential of dealers that participate in the show. These forces include potential entrants, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors. New entrants face several barriers to entering the market place including the supply side economies of scale, demand side benefits of scale, and capital requirements. Because of these barriers, {{the cost of doing business}} and the way that promoters organize and manage the shows, it is difficult for artisanal and small scale miners to enter the show and compete with established dealers. However, with support from entities such as local governments, non-profit organizations, and international organizations the artisanal and small scale miners have the potential to have their minerals sold at the Tucson Shows for prices that would be greater than what can be achieved in the local market. Methods to help the artisanal and small scale miners compete include direct sales or consignments to retail dealers, tailgating, development of <b>sales</b> <b>co-operatives,</b> and the creation of an artisanal/small scale mineral show.

Even though in the states like Kera'a, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh the meat is consumed, major portion of the live clams are collected for utilising the shell for lime and related industries involving a high wastage of meat. There are co-operative societies functioning {{in certain parts of}} the country making the harvest and <b>sale</b> on a <b>co-operative</b> basis. Similarly large scale collection and destruction of seed clams are also observed in some of the areas and if properly conserved the production can be enhanced considerably.

40|$|Total {{number of}} the Co-operative {{societies}} in U. K. increased rapidly till {{the early years of}} 1890 's and its maximum was 1455 in 1903. But the total number of individual members of the Co-operative societies increased steadily and many Co-operative societies grew up larger and larger, especially in the urban areas {{in the first half of}} 20 th century. Since 1960 or so, the Movement has been in the declining stage. The market share of retail turnover, the number of Co-operative shops, and the Co-operative membership have been decreasing. This decline of the Co-operative Movement has mainly been pushed aside not by the independent shopkeepers but by the expansion of multiples. The Co-operative Movement in Japan became popular after World War 11 and grew up rapidly during the period from 1960 's to 1980 's. Growth of Co-operative Movement after 1960 can be obserbed in the increase of members of local Co-operative societies. Number of local Co-operative societies increased slowly in the 1960 's and rapidly from 1973 to 1977. Membership has been increasing continuously since 1960 except in 1979. Main purpose of these societies is to supply food to members, and the societies increased in number till 1977. And the share of food and joint buying in retail <b>sales</b> of local <b>Co-operative</b> societies expanded after 1960 until 1990. Total turnover increased until 1993, but then it reached a sort of plateau. Monthly purchase per member of the retail Co-operative societies has been decreasing after 1991, and the turnover of their retail sales also stopped increasing after 1993. Total number of individual members of societies is still increasing because of members of the consumers Co-operative societies...|$|R
40|$|To readers {{interested}} in the material progress of the Province, no introduction seems necessary for so fascinating, a subject as the "Enonomic effects of the Punjab Canal Colonies. The origin, growth {{and development of the}} Canal colonies is an interesting and surprising miracle of the 20 th century -a miracle which has given rise to an important trading city like Lyallpur, the capital of the Lower Chonab Colony. The development of the Lower Bari Doab Colony has an importance of its own as it is the youngest of all its sister colonies and as most of us have seen the change that has come over the new Bar. One can see what it was like less than ten years ago as one passes in the Karachi mail through the desert skirting the youngest Canal Colony, not a vestige of cultivation on either side: only sand hills and a barren plain, dreariness unreclaimed save by the vivid mirage of water and trees. How this blight and hideousness of land, was redeemed by the miracle of the 20 th century and what are the consequences of this change form the scope of my thesis. I have chosen what appears to me to be the notable features and grouped round them the circumstances which led to them and the consequences which came from them. It has not been possible, however, to mention all the noteworthy points in the development of different colonies and my apologies are, therefore, due for any partiality or neglect which I may appear to have done. I have deliberately given much attention and large space to Chapter LV (on means of communications) as the prosperity of colonies very much depends upon the progress and improvements effected in their means of communication and I feel therefore no hesitation in quoting A. Smith, that "improvement in the means of transport is the greatest of all the agricultural improvements". Chapter V (on population is meant to indicate the relation between migration of population and canal irrigation. Chapters VL & VII (dealing with depressed classes and the janglis respectively) are important both from social and economic point of view. The importance of Chapter VIII (unrocognised assets of the Canal Irrigation) lies in its exposition or a few important effects which are generally overlooked by a superficial observer. Chapters XI (experiment of <b>co-operative</b> <b>sale)</b> is very important from the present day stand point and the Chapter XIII dealing with the problem or indebtedness has much bearing upon the Chapter XI. The latter is a remedy of the economic ills of indebtedness diagnosed in the former. As for my appendices, I may submit that they form an integral part of my thesis and therefore deserve a careful perusal. Appendix "A" is based on an inductive enquiry into the village No. 369 near Cora, district Lyallpur. The usefulness of Appendix "B" lies in its reference to sufferings and hardships undergone by early colonists and also in its real story of a Sufaid Posh grantee...|$|R
