50|$|The lagoon {{is divided}} into two {{distinct}} layers: sludge and liquid. The sludge layer is a more solid layer formed by the stratification of sediments from the manure. After a while, this solid layer accumulates and eventually needs to be cleaned out. The liquid level is composed of grease, scum and other particulates. The liquid level CAFO wastewater enters {{at the bottom of the}} lagoon so that it can mix with the active microbial mass in the sludge layer. These anaerobic conditions are uniform throughout the lagoon, except in a small surface level. Sometimes aeration is applied to this level to dampen the odors emitted by the lagoons. If <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> is not applied, a crust will form that will trap heat and odors. Anaerobic lagoons should retain and treat wastewater from 20 to 150 days. Lagoons should be followed by aerobic or facultative lagoons to provide further required treatment. The liquid layer is periodically drained and used for fertilizer. In some instances, a cover can be provided to trap methane, which is used for energy. Anaerobic Lagoons work through a process called anaerobic digestion. Decomposition of the organic matter begins shortly after the animals void. Lagoons become anaerobic due to the high biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the feces, which contains a high level of soluble solids, resulting in higher BOD. Anaerobic microorganisms convert organic compounds into carbon dioxide and methane through acid formation and methane production.|$|E

The odors originating from open liquid manure storages {{are one of}} the most persistent problems and present undesirable environmental situations that have caused conflicts between swine producers and their neighboring communities. A considerable amount of research effort has been spent on controlling odor emissions from swine manure storages with methods studied including aeration and anaerobic treatment. <b>Surface</b> <b>aeration</b> is the most cost-effective method. Therefore, more information is needed about the system improvement and optimal depth determination of <b>surface</b> <b>aeration.</b> This thesis presents investigations on gas injection in water, including a field-and-lab-scale study on <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> to reduce odor generation potential and laboratory-scale studies on aerator module development, liquid flow rate, alpha factor, <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> depth and temperature profiles on aeration efficiency. The purpose of the first investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of a <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> system using venturi injectors, in which air was injected into a pipeline and discharged into the lagoon as a gas-liquid diffuser.

Their taxonomy is confused {{since it is}} difficult: to align them with known nocardioform actinomycete genera based upon chemotaxonomic, numerical taxonomic or phenetic information.

We have sequenced the 16 S rRNA gene (16 S rDNA) of the type strains of N. pinensis and N. amarae and compared these with representative nocardioform actinomycete sequences. N. amarae was most closely related to and had the highest sequence similarity with Gordona terrae. The support in our phylogenetic analysis for this was significant (bootstrap values of 99 - 100 percent). This is consistent with recent publications placing N. amarae into the genus Gordona. N. pinensis was most closely related to G. terrae and N. amarae and was an outlier to the Gordona group.

It was evident from the phylogenetic analyses that N. pinensis represents a distinct phyletic line that is most closely associated with the Gordona clade.

To aid in evaluating the microbial representation in foam, we developed and characterized group-, genus-, and species-specific oligonucleotide probes targeting the small subunit rRNA of the Mycobacterium complex, Gordona spp., and Gordona (Nocardia) amarae, respectively. The use of a universal base analog, 5 -nitroindole, in oligonucleotide probe design was evaluated by comparing the characteristics of two different versions of the Mycobacterium complex probe. The temperature of dissociation of each probe was determined. Probe specificity studies with a diverse collection of 67 target and nontarget rRNAs demonstrated the specificity of the probes to the target groups.

40|$|Purpose Discharge of {{untreated}} {{domestic and}} industrial waste in many European rivers resulted in low oxygen concentrations and contamination with trace metals, often concentrated in sediments. Under these anoxic conditions, {{the formation of}} insoluble metal sulfides is known to reduce metal availability. Nowadays, implementation of waste water treatment plants results in increasing surface water oxygen concentrations. Under these conditions, sediments can be turned from a trace metal sink into a trace metal source. Materials and methods In an ex situ experiment with metal contaminated sediment, we investigated the effect of <b>surface</b> water <b>aeration</b> on sediment metal sulfide (acid volatile sulfides (AVS)) concentrations and sediment metal release to the surface water. These results were compared with long-term field data, where surface water oxygen and metal concentrations, {{before and after the}} implementation of a waste water treatment plant, were compared. Results and discussion <b>Aeration</b> of <b>surface</b> water in the experimental setup resulted in a decrease of sediment AVS concentrations due to sulfide oxidation. Metals, known to precipitate with these sulfides, became more mobile and increasing dissolved metal (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu)) concentrations in the surface water were observed. Contrary to As, Cd, or Cu, manganese (Mn) surface water concentrations decreased in the aerated treatment. Mn ions will precipitate and accumulate in the sediment as Mn oxides under the oxic conditions. Field data, however, demonstrated a decrease of all total metal surface water concentrations with increasing oxygen concentrations following the implementation of the waste water treatment plant. Conclusions The gradual decrease in surface water metal concentrations in the river before the treatment started and the removal of metals in the waste water treatment process could not be countered by an increase in metal flux from the sediment as observed in the experiment. ...|$|R

Aim: The aim of this research is to study the intensity of sediments of hardly soluble salts crystals on the surfaces of the heating of evaporative cooling equipment and condensers from supersaturated circulating water in the circulating cooling systems of power plants with water cooling towers. Materials and Methods: The methodology of the research was to study the mass and size of the hardly soluble crystals in circulation water and sediments on heat exchange surfaces of the condenser and the evaporator surface of the water cooling tower. Source water for the experiment was selected from Styr river. Experimental studies were carried out at the installation of a scale model of circulation cooling system.

40|$|Dissolved oxygen {{refers to}} the mass of oxygen that is {{contained}} in water. The concentration of dissolved oxygen is an important indicator of the environments water quality. The presence of oxygen in water is desirable therefore it is a positive sign; whereas the absence of oxygen {{is a sign of}} severe pollution. An adequate supply of dissolved oxygen is important for waste water treatment processes. Many naturally occurring biological and chemical processes use oxygen, thereby diminishing the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water. The physical process of oxygen transfer or oxygen absorption from the atmosphere acts to replenish the used oxygen. This process has been termed aeration. Aeration is the primary requirement of the biological treatment of water and wastewater treatment. As reported in the literature, the aeration process consumes as much as 60 - 80 % of total power requirements in wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, it is necessary that the design and operation of aeration process should be economized in terms of their energy efficiency. The performance of <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems is rated in terms of their oxygen transfer rate; hence the choice of a particular <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> system depends on its performance and efficiency of oxygen transfer rates. Oxygen transfer rate and the corresponding power requirement to rotate the rotor are very vital parameters for the design and scale-up of surface aerators. Basically two types of operation are in use for <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems – batch operation and continuous operation. Batch operation involves a single vessel which is filled, aerated then completely emptied. Continuous operation method of operating a biological treatment plant is characterized by a steady input stream (in terms of chemical and biological composition and flow rate, when flow and concentration equalization is practiced), steady process conditions during the treatment steps and by a fairly consistent flow of treated material with only little variation in its composition. The work presented in this thesis consists of two parts. The first one deals with the experimental investigations on the three types of batch <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> tanks. A comprehensive design analysis has been worked out and presented on these types of <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems. In the second category, experimental investigations have been carried out extensively on continuous flow <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems of different sizes. Analysis has led to the formulation of optimal geometric dimension and the simulation criteria for the design purposes. As far as the first category of investigations is concerned, a substantial work has been reported on batch surface aerators on various issues, during the past several years. Still, a general methodology to scale up or scale down the process phenomena is lacking. In the present work, experiments were done on different shaped batch <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> system for generalizing or devising the scale up and scale down criteria for oxygen transfer coefficient and power consumption. Present work through experimental observations established that unbaffled circular tanks are more energy efficient than baffled when used as surface aerator. Power consumption in <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems is characterized by a fundamental non-dimensional parameter named power number. This number relates drag force to the inertial force in fluid flow system. Power number scaling up of unbaffled surface aerators of square, circular and rectangular shaped tanks {{is one of the most}} important contributions of the present work. Design charts have been developed for all the three shape of tanks for the installation as the batch <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems. Based on the experimental analyses in the present work, it was found that circular shape is the most efficient than any other shape and it is also established that generally a number of smaller sized tanks were more economic and efficient than using a single big tank while aerating the same volume of water. Based on the energy economy analysis, present work suggests the optimal speed range of batch systems of different shaped <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> tanks. Different sized rectangular aeration tanks with different aspect ratios (that is length to width ratio) were tested along with a series of square and circular tanks for comparing their relative performances. Present work by doing experiments answered this fact and found that square tank (aspect ratio = 1) was more efficient than any other aspect ratio rectangular tanks. Vortexes are inherently present in any type of unbaffled tanks. Present work analyzed the vortex behavior of unbaffled <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems to determine the critical impeller speed in unbaffled batch <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems at which oxygen transfer rates are more. The second part of the present work establishes the optimal geometrical parameters of a continuous flow <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems. These types of operations were found to be least reported in the available literature and there appears to be of no report in the literature on optimal geometrical parameters. Extensive experimental work is reported in the present thesis on the establishment of the optimal geometrical parameters of continuous flow <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> systems. From there, simulation criteria are established by maintaining optimal geometrical similarity in different sized continuous flow <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> tanks; so that the scale up or scale down criteria can be applied to predict oxygen transfer rates and power number...|$|E

Moreover, the level of pollution in regards to the water quality of oceans, lagoons, and rivers has been aggravated. In particular, lagoons across the globe are suffering from the use of fertilizers, manual wastes and dead remains. A lack of dissolved oxygen (DO) has been a problem for the lagoon water quality. Many living creatures in the lagoon have become prone to death and their dead remains further aggravate the water quality. Dredging the bottom of lagoon to remove various wastes, vegetation inside the lagoon for self-purification and employing micro bubble machines to increase DO are methods to alleviate the problem. Alternative and additional solutions may be applied depend on the condition of the lagoon. For most lagoons are comprised of oxygen-deficient water mass, a micro bubble machine is particularly efficient for its micro-aeration in amplifying DO.

Water table (WT) treatments were established on 37 day after planting (DAP), at depths of 0. 15 -, 0. 30 -, 0. 45 - and 0. 60 -m below the soil <b>surface.</b> Soil <b>aeration</b> status was determined by measuring soil oxygen concentrations at 0. 15 -, 0. 30 -, 0. 60 -m depths in the lysimeters. Effects of water table depths on groundwater quality were determined by observing the movement of residual soil nitrate and applied metolachlor at three different depths (0. 20 -, 0. 40 -, and 0. 60 -m) in the soil profile. Measurements on different physiological parameters (photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content and intercellular CO[subscript] 2) and leaf temperature were taken on a weekly basis;The results of study showed that oxygen concentration was significantly reduced by raising the water table depth. Differences in soil oxygen concentrations for various soil depths were also significant. Soil oxygen concentration at shallow soil depths was always higher compared to deeper soil depths. The variation in soil oxygen concentrations with time was not significant. Significant reductions in both NO[subscript] 3 -N and metolachlor concentrations were observed by maintaining shallow WT depths. For 0. 15 -m WT treatment, the NO[subscript] 3 -N and metolachlor concentrations were 54 and 63 %, respectively, lower compared to 0. 60 -m WT treatment. The analysis of drainage outflow data also supported the fact that shallow WT treatments can reduce the leaching of NO[subscript] 3 -N and metolachlor to groundwater. A week after the establishment of WT treatments, different physiological parameters of soybean were significantly affected. Photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rates were significantly reduced when WT was raised to 0. 15 -m depth. Soybean yield was significantly reduced with the decrease in WT height. The results of this study indicate that, on the average, 48 % increase in yield is possible by maintaining WT at 0. 60 -m depth...|$|R
40|$|Stepped channel {{applications}} {{include a}} broad range of domains. A detailed review (past and present) was published by the author (Chanson 1995). To date most studies on gepped chutes applies to gradually variedflows in rectangular prismatic channels with horizontal. The three-dimensional features of stepped chute flows are not accounted. Regarding dimensional analysis, several dimensionless numbers {{must be taken into account}} for the hydraulic study of skimming flows past stepped chutes. The Froude number takes into account tk gravity effects with free-surface flows while the Reynolds number is a characteristic of the form (drag) resistance. In presence of free-surface <b>aeration,</b> <b>surface</b> tension effects must also be taken into account. Overall, a true similitude is not possible. Neglecting the air entrainment effects (Chanson 1994 b), the detailed investigation of the author showed explicitly that, for the analysed set of data: 1. The Froude number has no effect on the flow resistance. 2. The skin drag has little effect on the flow resistance for steep slopes. For flat stepped chutes, the skin friction might have some effect (as suggested in Chanson 1994 b). But additional data is required to verify or deny this point. 3. The Reynolds number has no effect on the flow resistance, for these supercritical extremely turbulent flows. The author does not believe that the conclusion of his analysis is the "final word" on the topic. New experiments, in particular on prototypes, might confirm or not the analysis...|$|R

As a modified activated sludge process, oxidation ditches have distinct advantages in simple construction, flexible operating mode, low sludge production, and special capability of nitrification and denitrification within the same tank.

40|$|More {{knowledge}} {{has to be}} acquired on the gas-liquid mass transfer characteristics with microbubble aeration before an efficient bioreactor is designed. Experiments about this subject have been conducted in a stirred reactor. Some valuable conclusions were obtained: the shaft power consumption is little affected by the superficial gas velocity (v(s)) and the power consumption of the microbubble generator is rather high; the dispersion of microbubbles is more uniform compared to sparger aeration; <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> leads to a reduced microbubble number and {{the diameter of the}} microbubble increases with higher superficial gas velocity; when <b>surface</b> <b>aeration</b> happens, the k(L) a-v(s) curves turn quite abnormally different from {{that in the case of}} sparger aeration, and correlation-based calculations fit well with the measurements...|$|E
30|$|During the {{experimental}} operation, excessive foam on the <b>surface</b> of the <b>aeration</b> tank was observed. Nevertheless, the treatment {{process and the}} permeate quality were not affected. It was only encountered at MLSS of over 40  g/l. The foam removal was done manually by means of water flushing. A secondary option was to drain a portion of activated sludge to reduce sludge concentration. On a regular basis, sludge was drained from the aeration chamber to reduce thick foaming inside the chamber caused by the high density of sludge. The foaming was due to shortcomings of the pilot plant as well. It {{is not expected to}} occur with the same magnitude in a commercial-size MBR because the sludge- recycle ratio would be more accurate and well planned during design, with careful consideration of SRT, temperature, and the influent quality. This does not guarantee that the foam issue will be completely eliminated but MLSS value of 40  g/l during operation is not a standard operation parameter. It will vary from application to application. The MLSS should be limited to a certain level, depending on the foaming situation. At MLSS less than 20  g/l, the foam formation stopped completely. The temperature of the reactor was closely monitored from December to July. The reactor’s temperature varied between 21 and 32 °C, which was lower than the high ambient temperature of Sharjah. The temperature interval was ideal for bacteria activity, and obviously the temperature was not controlled. In general, the bacteria are under water surface with no direct sun light; hence, no effect of temperature on the sludge. It only affected the excess foam, which formed due to dead bacteria.|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} {{the results of a}} study conducted to determine the rates of bacterial aerosol emission from the <b>surfaces</b> of the <b>aeration</b> tanks of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago John E. Egan Water Reclamation Plant. This study was accomplished by conducting test runs in which Andersen six-stage viable samplers were used to collect bacterial aerosol samples inside a walled tower positioned above an <b>aeration</b> tank liquid <b>surface</b> at the John E. Egan Water Reclamation Plant. The samples were analyzed for standard plate counts (SPC), total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci. Two methods of calculation were used to estimate the bacterial emission rate. The first method was a conventional stack emission rate calculation method in which the measured air concentration of bacteria was multiplied by the air flow rate emanating from the aeration tanks. The second method was a more empirical method in which an attempt was made to measure all of the bacteria emanating from an isolated area (0. 37 m 2) of the <b>aeration</b> tank <b>surface</b> over time. The data from six test runs were used to determine bacterial emission rates by both calculation methods. As determined by the conventional calculation method, the average SPC emission rate was 1. 61 SPC/m 2 /s (range, 0. 66 to 2. 65 SPC/m 2 /s). As determined by the empirical calculation method, the average SPC emission rate was 2. 18 SPC/m 2 /s (range, 1. 25 to 2. 66 SPC/m 2 /s). For TC, the average emission rate was 0. 20 TC/m 2 /s (range, 0. 02 to 0. 40 TC/m 2 /s) when the conventional calculation method was used and 0. 27 TC/m 2 /s (range, 0. 04 to 0. 53 TC/m 2 /s) when the empirical calculation method was used.

40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis {{that grows}} {{to a higher}} cell density (SE-HCD) than wild type while {{retaining}} O-chain lipopolysaccharide was isolated by transforming wild type serovar Enteritidis with the cell density sensor plasmid pSB 402 and selecting for bioluminescence. A luminescent strain, SE-HCD, that emitted light in proportion with cell density and opacity through stationary phase was isolated. After a peak cell density of 1. 5 × 1011 CFU/ml was observed, luminescence decreased, although opacity continued to increase. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that changes in luminescence and opacity past peak cell density were associated with lysis of a swarming hyperflagellated coccobacillary cell type and emergence of a 10 -to- 30 -fold-elongated rod cell type that lacked cell <b>surface</b> structures. Vigorous <b>aeration</b> was required to induce this dramatic cellular differentiation. The virulence of two isogenic variants with different patterns of light emission at an opacity of 0. 2 after the culture was diluted 10 -fold (1 / 10 OD) was assessed in animal models. Whereas SE-HCD 1 killed 70 % of 6 -day-old chicks challenged subcutaneously, the same dose of SE-HCD 2 did not kill any chicks. Conversely, subcutaneous challenge of hens with SE-HCD 2 contaminated eggs five and seven times more often, respectively, than did SE-HCD 1 or wild type serovar Enteritidis. Intravenous challenge with SE-HCD 2 contaminated 22 % of eggs versus 0. 5 % with wild type, depressed egg production for 4 weeks, and caused clinical signs of Gallinarum Disease (Fowl Typhoid) in hens. SE-HCD 2 produced no contaminated eggs following oral infection, whereas wild type contaminated 1. 3 % of eggs. Thus, SE-HCD 2 is better at contaminating eggs than wild type, but only by parenteral challenge. These results suggest {{that it may be}} possible to separate luminescent serovar Enteritidis into groups that infect different age groups and organs and contaminate eggs...|$|R
