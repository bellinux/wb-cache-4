40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the problem of multiple comparisons in <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> and to provide some guidelines on how to deal with it in practice. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We describe common reasons for multiplicity in <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews,</b> and present some examples. We provide guidance on how to deal with multiplicity when it is unavoidable. RESULTS: We identified six common reasons for multiplicity in systematic reviews: multiple outcomes, multiple groups, multiple time points, multiple effect measures, subgroup analyses, and multiple looks at accumulating data. The existing methods to deal with multiplicity in single trials can not always be applied in <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews.</b> CONCLUSION: There is no simple and completely satisfactory solution to the problem of multiple comparisons in <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews.</b> More research is required to develop multiple comparison procedures for use in <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews.</b> Authors and consumers of <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> should give serious attention to multiplicity in <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> when presenting, interpreting and using the results of these reports...|$|R

5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided.

Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced.

40|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> {{can be a}} {{tremendous}} asset {{in the implementation of}} evidence-based practice, because they minimize some of the most-documented barriers to evidence-based practice.

Further, clinicians can rely on someone else’s reviewing expertise, which reduces the knowledge and skill burden otherwise imposed on them. However, empirical studies have repeatedly demonstrated that there is great variability in the quality of <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews.</b> Thus, in order to harness their potential, it is imperative that clinicians distinguish high-quality <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> from those of low quality.

40|$|We {{systematically}} <b>reviewed</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> {{of surgical}} orthopaedic interventions published between 1996 and 2001 to document {{when and how}} nonrandomized studies were included. From more than 10, 000 citations examined in various electronic databases, 58 orthopaedic <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> were eligible for inclusion based on specific criteria. Thirty of these (52 %) included nonrandomized studies, 15 of which found no randomized controlled trials. <b>Systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> {{were more likely to}} include randomized controlled trials if nondistinguishable operations were compared (if participants could be blinded). Only six of the <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> that included nonrandomized studies (20 %) assessed the quality of primary studies. Heterogeneity of studies was a major concern. In 21 of the <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> that included nonrandomized studies (70 %), data for groups treated similarly were pooled across studies, and outcomes for pooled groups were compared. The conclusions of <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> that included nonrandomized studies are weakened by the limitations of nonrandomized study designs.

40|$|Background. Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine (CAM) is widely {{applied in the}} clinical practice of neck pain owing to cervical radiculopathy (CR). While many <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> exist in CAM to improve CR, research is distributed across population, intervention, comparison, and setting. Objective. This overview aims to summarize the characteristics and evaluate critically the evidence from <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews.</b> Methods. A comprehensive literature search was performed in the six databases without language restrictions on February 24, 2015. We had identified relevant <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> that examined the subjects with neck pain due to cervical radiculopathy undergoing CAM. Two authors independently appraised the methodological quality using the revised assessment of multiple <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> instrument. Results. We had included eight <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews.</b> The effectiveness and safety of acupotomy, acupuncture, Jingfukang granule, manual therapies, and cervical spine manipulation were investigated. Based on available evidence, the <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> supported various forms of CAM for CR. Nevertheless, the methodological quality for most of <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> was low or moderate. In addition, adverse reactions of primary studies were infrequent. Conclusions. Current <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> showed potential advantages to CAM for CR. Due to the frequently poor methodological quality of primary studies, the conclusions should be treated with caution for clinical practice...|$|R

5|$|In 2004 {{the first}} {{adequately}} large scale {{study on the}} natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or impairments, and 8.3% had died.

A subsequent <b>systematic</b> <b>review</b> of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that mortality is about 5.6% during hospitalisation and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery.

5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a <b>systematic</b> <b>review</b> of four {{head-to-head}} comparative {{trials of}} metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Many {{medicines}} are dosed {{to achieve}} a particular therapeutic range, and monitored using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The evidence base for a therapeutic range can be evaluated using <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews,</b> to ensure it continues to reflect current indications, doses, routes and formulations, as well as updated adverse effect data. There is no consensus on the optimal methodology for <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> of therapeutic ranges. Methods An overview of <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> of therapeutic ranges was undertaken. The following databases were used: Cochrane Database of <b>Systematic</b> <b>Reviews</b> (CDSR), Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects (DARE) and MEDLINE. The published methodologies used when systematically reviewing the therapeutic range of a drug were analyzed. Step by step recommendations to optimize such <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> are proposed. Results Ten <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> that investigated the correlation between serum concentrations and clinical outcomes encompassing a variety of medicines and indications were assessed. There were significant variations in the methodologies used (including the search terms used, data extraction methods, assessment of bias, and statistical analyses undertaken). Therapeutic ranges should be population and indication specific and based on clinically relevant outcomes. Recommendations for future <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> {{based on these findings}} have been developed. Conclusion Evidence based therapeutic ranges have the potential to improve TDM practice. Current <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> investigating therapeutic ranges have highly variable methodologies and there is no consensus of best practice when undertaking <b>systematic</b> <b>reviews</b> in this field. These recommendations meet a need not addressed by standard protocols...|$|R
