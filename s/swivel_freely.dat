5000|$|The {{principle}} {{is similar to}} that of the radiating axles invented by James Cleminson of London for railway carriages, which [...] "consists in mounting the axles with their axle boxes, guards, and springs in frames separate from the main under-frame of the carriage. The end frames have central pivots, around which they <b>swivel</b> <b>freely,</b> while the middle frame is so arranged that it can slide transversely. The three frames are connected together by articulated radiating gear, so that they act sympathetically, and, no matter how sharp the curve, each axle instantly assumes a position coincident with the radial lines of that curve, instead of remaining parallel to each other as in the ordinary construction, in which the wheels grind their way along the sides of the rails. The wear and tear of tires and rails is thus greatly reduced, because the flanges of the tires are always parallel with the rails." ...|$|E
50|$|Batman's Batsuit {{is changed}} in The Dark Knight (2008) due to Bruce Wayne's growing {{frustration}} over his overall lack of mobility (leading to an incident where he gets mauled by dogs while breaking up a drug deal). In this new design, the bodysuit {{is made of}} hardened kevlar plates on titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers and is broken into multiple pieces of armor over a more flexible bodysuit for greater mobility. But as a trade-off, the flexible armor leaves Batman more vulnerable to injury from knives and gunfire in favor of increased flexibility and lighter weight. While the cowl of the Batsuit in previous film incarnations has been attached to the shoulder and neck, the Batsuit's cowl is now a separate component inspired by the design of motorcycle helmets, allowing the wearer to <b>freely</b> <b>swivel</b> and move his neck without moving {{the rest of his}} upper torso (by Bruce's personal request to Fox as 'it would make backing out of the driveway easier') as was characteristic in all the previous cinematic versions of the Batsuit. Also, a strong electric current runs through it that prevents anyone except Batman from removing it, to further protect his identity.|$|R
5000|$|... 1) Centrifugal Discharge Elevator - Typically, this is {{the style}} of {{elevator}} used in grain handling facilities we are all familiar with along rivers, ports or on the farm. The elevator buckets discharge product freely {{by the use of}} centrifugal force. Product flings out of the bucket into the discharge spout located {{at the top of the}} elevator. The most common style elevator bucket seen in agricultural application is the [...] "CC" [...] style. This style is most recognized by the four breaks in the inside bottom of the bucket, straight sides and the presence of high sides or [...] "ears". An example of this style is made by a variety of manufacturers TOPS Inc. [...] "CC Swift", MAXI-LIFT [...] "Tiger - CC" [...] or [...] "CC- Max" [...] or Tapco's [...] "CC-HD". 2) Continuous Discharge Elevator - This style bucket elevator is used typically to discharge sluggish and non free flowing product where the elevator buckets discharge on top of each other. Speeds are run in the 125 fpm range to accomplish this type of centrifugal force. Common styles of elevator buckets seen in this application would be the MF, HF, LF, and HFO due tot their [...] "V" [...] style among other attributes. 3) Positive Discharge Elevator - Elevator design where the buckets are used to elevate commodities such as popcorn, candy and potato chips where the utmost concern is on gentle handling and finished food grade applications. This style elevator bucket operates off a double strand chain where they are held in place by two pins so the bucket is allowed to <b>freely</b> <b>swivel.</b> To discharge the bucket it's mechanically tripped to flip and discharge but until this action the bucket is held parallel with the floor and upright. These elevators typically form an [...] "S" [...] or [...] "L" [...] in design and run throughout a plant.|$|R
