40|$|I have {{outlined}} some {{objections to}} <b>soteriologies</b> that presume that only some {{are given a}} chance of eternal life. Such <b>soteriologies</b> can include or exclude those mentally competent but lacking human evangelisation. Fundamental to evaluating <b>soteriologies</b> I have looked at both what sin is (being and doing) and what salvation consists in, as regards divine and human interaction. On the one side I have considered God's goodness - would such a being act unethically regarding man's eternity? On the other hand I have looked at whether, and if so in what way, man is required to respond - in what way or ways is chance (if at all) given. Finally I have considered views about those who die in infancy. Here I have tentatively suggested my own theory which seeks to presume that before death every human being may choose to accept of reject God, a choice integral (I suggest) to salvation.

5000|$|As well {{as these}} modern divisions, {{there were many}} diverse Christian {{communities}} with wildly different Christologies, eschatologies, <b>soteriologies</b> and cosmologies that existed alongside the [...] "Early Church" [...] which is itself a projected concept to indicate which communities were [...] "proto-orthodox", in that their views would become dominate. In many ways, the first three centuries of Christianity was significantly more diverse than the modern Church.|$|R
25|$|Christ's death, resurrection, ascension, {{and sending}} of the Holy Spirit, is called The Paschal Mystery. Christ's human birth {{is called the}} Incarnation. Either or both are {{considered}} in different versions of <b>soteriology.</b>|$|E

25|$|No {{one person}} or group founded Pentecostalism. Instead, {{isolated}} Christian groups were experiencing charismatic phenomena such as divine healing and speaking in tongues. The holiness movement provided a theological explanation {{for what was}} happening to these Christians, and they adapted Wesleyan <b>soteriology</b> to accommodate their new understanding.|$|E
50|$|Most {{distinctive}} is the idealist hermeneutic {{which stood}} (and stands) {{in contrast to}} the common sense realism of Hodge and subsequent American Reformed theology, i.e. Nevin starts with the whole before the parts, and the whole is indeed greater than the sum of the parts. Within this hermeneutical context, Mercersburg also prioritizes the Incarnation as a theological lens which - as one might suppose - has vast theological implications. The result is a thoroughgoing ecclesiology and sacramentology that opposes a number of theological dualisms and heavily forensic <b>soteriologies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The early Church in the post-apostolic {{period was}} much more {{involved}} in [...] "defending its frontiers against alternative <b>soteriologies</b> — either by defining its own position with greater and greater exactness, or by attacking other religions, and particularly the Hellenistic mysteries." [...] In fact, {{a good deal of}} the early Christian literature is devoted to the exposure and refutation of unorthodox theology, mystery religions and Gnostic groups. Irenaeus, Tertullian and Hippolytus of Rome were among the greatest early Christian apologetes who engaged in critical analyses of unorthodox theology, Greco-Roman pagan religions, and Gnostic groups.|$|R
50|$|In Christian theology, {{synergism}} is {{the position}} of those who hold that salvation involves some form of cooperation between divine grace and human freedom. It stands opposed to monergism, a doctrine most commonly associated with the Lutheran and Reformed Protestant traditions, whose <b>soteriologies</b> have been strongly influenced by the North African bishop and Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo (354-430). Lutheranism, however, confesses a monergist salvation and synergist damnation (see below). Synergism is upheld by the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, and by the Methodist and Pentecostal traditions of Protestantism. It {{is an integral part}} of Arminian theology.|$|R
25|$|Free Grace Theology is {{distinguished}} by its <b>soteriology</b> or doctrine of salvation. Its advocates believe that God justifies the sinner on the sole condition {{of faith in}} Christ, not righteous living. Their definition of faith involves belief, trust, and conviction that Jesus {{is the only way}} to salvation.|$|E
25|$|Classical Pentecostal <b>soteriology</b> is {{generally}} Arminian rather than Calvinist. The {{security of the}} believer is a doctrine held within Pentecostalism; nevertheless, this security is conditional upon continual faith and repentance. Pentecostals believe in both a literal heaven and hell, the former {{for those who have}} accepted God's gift of salvation and the latter for those who have rejected it.|$|E
25|$|This {{order is}} a later development, when discriminating insight (prajna) became central to Buddhist <b>soteriology,</b> {{and came to}} be {{regarded}} as the culmination of the Buddhist path. Yet, Majjhima Nikaya 117, Mahācattārīsaka Sutta, describes the first seven practices as requisites for right samadhi. According to Vetter, this may have been the original soteriological practice in early Buddhism.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to illustrate the}} salience of the concept ‘heresy’ for sociologically-informed studies of religious violence and opposition by removing it from its traditional moorings in historical theology and applying it to two religious movements: second-century Christians and nineteenth-century Mormons. Divided into two major sections, the study pursues its objective first by surveying available definitions of heresy (theological and sociological) and offering its own understanding of heresy as a Weberian ideal type of religious opposition. Part One of the study concludes {{with a look at}} the sociology of knowledge in general and the theory of identity adumbrated by Hans Mol in particular, appropriating each in order to outline the social process whereby religious groups facing opposition come to elaborate complex <b>soteriologies</b> capable of resolving the conflict. The second half of the thesis involves a close examination of early Christians and early Mormons, providing a detailed description of the types of social opposition each group faced and juxtaposing the two communities in an effort to illuminate unique historical patterns of social marginalisation. Following this investigation of each group’s religious milieu and corresponding persecution, the study engages the <b>soteriologies</b> articulated by Irenaeus and Joseph Smith, paying particular attention to the connections between specific forms of opposition and the way in which espousing deification helped resolve such ‘heresy’. The thesis concludes with thoughts on the relationship between adaptable belief systems (such as the forms of deification expressed by Irenaeus and Joseph Smith) and the future success of new religious movements. ...|$|R
50|$|II. Relativism. In addition, Krausz’s work on relativism canvasses {{the range}} and {{significance}} of relativistic doctrines and rehearses their virtues and vices. He considers relativism as the claim that truth, goodness, or beauty (among other values) is relative to some reference frame, and no absolute standards to adjudicate between reference frames exist. He defines and differentiates various strands of absolutism: realism, universalism and foundationalism. Krausz argues that when these strands of absolutism are unwoven, and when relativism is understood as the negation of these strands, classical self-refutation arguments against relativism do not apply. In turn, Krausz considers whether the idea of “undifferentiated ” survives the relativist challenge. He suggests that the assertion of undifferentiated unity, instanced for example in some Asian <b>soteriologies,</b> is compatible with relativism as here he defines it.|$|R

However there are also many religious transhumanists who find the project of human enhancement at least consistent with, and sometimes a fulfillment of, their metaphysics, <b>soteriologies</b> and eschatologies. Transhumanism appears to be especially compatible with religious traditions that emphasize human agency and evolution to a transcendent state, such as Buddhism, or that have incorporated Enlightenment values, such as liberal Christianity. But elements of the transhumanist worldview and enhancement technologies are compatible with one element or another of most world faiths, even the most fundamentalist. We can thus expect that human enhancement technologies will be adopted creatively into the theologies of groups within all the world's faiths, producing many flavors of "trans-spirituality. "...|$|R

40|$|Doctor TheologiaeThis {{research}} project {{is situated in}} the history of Christianity in Zambia with specific reference to the relationship between the United Church of Zambia and the New Jerusalem Church, one of the so-called African Instituted Churches (AICs). Since the 1950 s numerous members of the UCZ have become attracted to the New Jerusalem Church. Why is this case? One may identify several factors in this regard, including the administration of sacraments such as Baptism and Holy Communion also the ministry of faith healing, the ministry of pastoral care the confession of sins and the assurance of pardon. In this {{research project}} I have investigated one such factor namely the role of the ministry of music in these two churches. The term ministry of music in this context refers to praise and worship in the liturgy, to the significance of church choirs, the role of music leaders, the appropriation of melodies from various sources, the use of musical instruments and then of course to the actual text of the hymns that are sung. In this research project the focus has been on a description and analysis of the lyrics of selected hymns. This is based on the observation that the hymns that are frequently sung constitute the “theology of laity”. This project has first identified those hymns that are frequently sung in selected congregations of the United Church of Zambia and the New Jerusalem Church. For this study five urban and five rural congregations of both churches were selected. The identification of such hymns was done through interviews with the local pastors and the musical leadership of the selected congregation. On the basis of this process of identification ten of these hymns {{in each of the four}} categories mentioned above were subjected to closer analysis. The question that was addressed is this: What similarities and differences may be identified in the text of hymns sung frequently in urban and rural congregations of the United Church of Zambia and the New Jerusalem Church? The point of comparison that was used in this regard is the <b>soteriologies</b> embedded in the text of the selected hymns, that is, the notions of salvation expressed through these hymns. The study therefore sought to identify, describe and analyse the underlying <b>soteriologies</b> in the ministry of music in these two churches. It also assessed the significance of the similarities and differences identified in this way. The assumption was that there may be different images of salvation embedded in such hymns and that these may partially account for attracting people to a particular church...|$|R

30|$|The {{convergence}} of voices notwithstanding, clear differences between Paul and Vivekananda {{emerge in the}} second half of each man’s statement, namely, that for Vivekananda the path out of the muck and misunderstanding is through self-realization of one’s own inherent divinity; in short the position of Vedanta, that the self or atman is one with the universal self or Brahman, such that the deeper “reality in every man [sic] should be the object of worship” (Vivekananda 1976 d, 358). Whereas for Paul, human subjects are acted upon by God in Christ, and only then are able to become active in the faith that trusts in God and works in love for all. Faith here signals ‘trust’; trust that in Jesus Christ God has confirmed and raised the human person to dignity, to reconciliation with God and with fellow persons, and that as a consequence of such divine action and human response, one is now free to live rightly in covenant relationship. The <b>soteriologies</b> – if we can use the term “vaguely” – of the two men signal clear distinctions in their understandings of the human person as well as consonance in their shared sense of the difference right understanding makes, the difference made in an identity-confirming positive response to vocation (Neville and Wildman 2001, 198; Sheveland 2011, 1 – 3). This difference is spelled out powerfully in a life of authenticity with and in the company of others, in what Paul refers to as ‘new life’ and ‘good works’ and Vivekananda as ‘seeing every man as God’ (Vivekananda 1976 b, 326).|$|R
40|$|As {{a debate}} over the {{legitimacy}} of the liturgical use of images, the Byzantine Iconoclastic controversy (ca. 726 - 843) had important political and theological implications, which modern scholarship generally tends to treat unconnectedly. The primary object {{of this study is to}} explicate the relationship between the political and theological dimensions of the controversy and to reconstruct the debate over images in a comprehensive approach that accounts for both its political and theological dimensions. The main argument of the thesis is that the question of images was a politico-theological problem and the prospects of 'political expediency' and 'theological propriety' were correlated in the minds of both the Iconoclastic reformers and their Iconodule rivals. Indeed, it was through their respective <b>soteriologies</b> that the two parties gave meaning to the theological and political dimensions of the debate in relationship with their respective theological first principles. Therefore, the Iconoclastic debate is explained as a soteriological dispute where the worldview represented by the traditional Byzantine religio-political ideology and the worldview represented by the proponents of images were set over against each other. The main contribution of our thesis to modern scholarship of the Byzantine Iconoclastic controversy is to reconstruct the debate in the light of the contending theological paradigms of the two parties, which shaped not only their attitudes towards images but also their political stands in relation to the Byzantine Empire's involvement in ecclesiastical politics. This new synthetic reading explains the debate in reference to two essential theological cornerstones of the Byzantine tradition [...] -the Eusebian "Imperial Theology" and the Christological definition of the council of Chalcedon [...] -both taken as key reference points, against which the political and doctrinal stands of both parties were constructed and interpreted...|$|R
40|$|Scientology holds {{considerable}} {{interest for}} scholars of new religious movements. As such, {{this study aims}} to contribute new data and insight to ongoing theoretical work within this area of religious studies scholarship. Engaged in this inquiry are the similarities between Scientology, the new religious movement founded in 1951 by L. Ron Hubbard (1911 - 1986), and the Chinese religion, Confucianism, which originates with the teachings of Confucius (551 - 479 BCE). Though Hubbard admits being influenced by eastern thinking such as Buddhism and Daoism in shaping his worldview, he specifically discounts Confucius as relevant in this regard. However, through comparisons between Scientology and Confucianism, this study demonstrates that there are significant and numerous instances of similarities between the two religions ranging from their worldviews to concomitant <b>soteriologies.</b> In the cosmogonies of Scientology and Neo-Confucianism, for example, the world comes about from the interplay of two cosmic phenomena: 1) an ordering, non-physical life force, termed in this study as the quasi-transcendent and 2) the physical. All life, including human beings, occurs as the quasi-transcendent realm combines with the physical, creating three homogeneous, coextensive, and teleologically interdependent parts: 1) the quasi-transcendent domain, 2) the physical universe, and 3) the human sphere. Comparing both traditions further, human beings are innately good, endowed as such by the benevolent influence of their quasi-transcendent component. Error, or evil, is rendered no ontological status and is rationalized as confusion caused by the obfuscating effect of the mind 2 ̆ 7 s physical constituent upon its benevolent counterpart. Self-transformation occurs as the physical component {{of the human mind}} is purified restoring profound ontological awareness and cosmic creativity. A notion absent in Confucianism, which could be assessed as a significant theological difference between these traditions, is Scientology 2 ̆ 7 s reincarnation theme. This aspect, however, is peripheral to the larger conceptual model that both these religions share...|$|R

In summary, Abid believes that “conversion” (rather than “repentance”) is the best English word to express the meaning of the Greek metanoia/μετάνοια.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{this term}} also {{refers to the}} doctrines and {{practices}} of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader. Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated {{in a number of}} ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on <b>soteriology</b> rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things—in salvation but also in all of life. This concept is seen clearly in the doctrines of predestination and total depravity.|$|E
25|$|Since the Arminian controversy, the Reformed tradition—as {{a branch}} of Protestantism {{distinguished}} from Lutheranism—divided into two separate groups, Arminians and Calvinists. However, it is now rare to call Arminians {{a part of the}} Reformed tradition, as many see these two schools of thought as opposed, making the terms Calvinist and Reformed synonymous. While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word Calvinism is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on <b>soteriology</b> and predestination, which are summarized in part by the Five Points of Calvinism. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things including salvation.|$|E
40|$|My paper {{deals with}} mythological/religious imagery and syncretic <b>soteriologies</b> in Thomas Pynchon’s 2006 novel 'Against the Day', {{focusing}} in particular {{on the character}} of Cyprian Latewood, bisexual spy, Orpheus stand-in, and masochist par excellence. Cyprian’s path throughout the novel is specifically an Orphic descent/return myth, but it also deals with issues of mystical transcendence, metempsychosis, Dionysian 'ekstasis', and Buddhist 'nirvana'. These are represented at the macro level in themes such as retreat from the world, neo-monasticism, anarchic activism, or hope for transcendent knowledge, and also within specific images and scenes, such as those involving flight, self-negation, disembodied voices, and the final voyage of the Chums of Chance, a Manichaean allegory of escape. Cyprian’s final home at a Bogomil-Orphic monastery near Thrace serves to tie together disparate religio-political strands within the novel, including a syncretic teleology (Gnostic/Buddhist/Manichaean) and countercultural activism. It is simultaneously a retreat from the world – a political move with relevance to the history of the Bogomils as both persecuted sect and social agitators – and also a move towards transcendence through gnostic ritual. There are a few important results of this reading, touching on religious, mythological, and Pynchon studies, and sexual and political discourse. Firstly, it challenges the ease with which Western, and specifically Christian, ideologies appropriate counter-discourses in acts of cultural hegemony, exemplified in one instance by Kathryn Hume’s early reading of the novel’s ethos as explicitly Roman Catholic, {{even in the face of}} overwhelming evidence to the contrary (“The Religious and Political Vision of 'Against the Day'”, 2007). Secondly, though other critics have gestured at the presence of Orphism and Buddhism in 'Against the Day', they have failed to convincingly tie these concerns to a larger conversation around Pynchon’s oeuvre and the meaning of the evolution of the author’s religious vision. None, so far as I know, have commented on the expressly Manichaean concepts in the work, and the consequences of the presence of this specific cosmological binary. Lastly, by making the heroic Cyprian the focus of the novel’s transcendental religious narrative, the author complicates two assumptions which have lingered unquestioned for far too long in Pynchon studies, namely the anti-metaphysics of his earth-centered onto-epistemology, and the inherent homophobia present in  a worldview which privileges the nuclear, procreative family structure and seems to use homosexuality and sadomasochism strictly in negative significations, as metaphors for unequal political and economic power dynamics (see Julie Christine Sears’ “Black and White Rainbows and Blurry Lines”).  This paper resists the reductive impulse towards conclusiveness, but rather seeks to complicate existing readings while pushing forward into new territory by synthesizing areas of discourse around the author, his works, and mythology and politics, which are usually considered only as discrete entities. Pynchon’s postmodern playfulness in his arrangement of historical, religious, and political signifiers resists organization into a singular narrative, but is rather designed to lead readers to question the ways in which knowledge is produced and belief is rationalized, and to consider alternatives to a future which marches blindly in lockstep with our past and present realities...|$|R

25|$|Leo's {{writings}} (both the sermons and the letters) {{are mostly}} concerned with theological {{questions concerning the}} person of Jesus Christ (Christology) and his role as mediator and savior (<b>Soteriology),</b> which is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon in which Roman legates participated in Leo's name. Subsequently, through numerous letters addressed to bishops {{and members of the}} imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also {{in the eastern part of}} the Roman empire. Leo defends the true divinity and the true humanity of the one Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ's presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.|$|E
