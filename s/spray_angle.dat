5000|$|The <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> diverges or converges {{with respect}} to the {{vertical}} axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with <b>spray</b> <b>angle.</b> The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, spray pressure, and viscosity. Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging. [...] Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent overspraying of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property.|$|E
50|$|Impact of a spray {{onto the}} target surface is {{expressed}} as the force/area, N/m2 or lb/in2.

Three coatings were selected: NiCr + Cr 2 O 3, ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3 (8 wt-%), and Mo. The substrate used was aferritic Cr steel.

50|$|Full cone nozzles yield {{complete}} {{spray coverage}} in a round, oval or square shaped area. Usually the liquid is swirled within the nozzle and mixed with non-spinning liquid that has bypassed an internal vane. Liquid then exits through an orifice, forming a conical pattern. <b>Spray</b> <b>angle</b> and liquid distribution within the cone pattern {{depend on the}} vane design and location relative to the exit orifice. The exit orifice design and the relative geometric proportions also affect the <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> and distribution.Full cone nozzles provide a uniform spray distribution of medium to large size drops resulting from their core design, which features large flow passages.

50|$|The {{surface tension}} of a liquid tends {{to assume the}} {{smallest}} possible size, acting as a membrane under tension. Any portion of the liquid surface exerts a tension upon adjacent portions or upon other objects that it contacts. This force is in {{the plane of the}} surface, and its amount per unit of length is surface tension. The value for water is about 0.073 N/m at 21 °C. The main effects of surface tension are on minimum operating pressure, <b>spray</b> <b>angle,</b> and drop size. Surface tension is more apparent at low operating pressures. A higher surface tension reduces the <b>spray</b> <b>angle,</b> particularly on hollow cone nozzles. Low surface tensions can allow nozzles to be operated at lower pressures.|$|E

50|$|Investigations {{show that}} in all cases gas {{atomisation}} of molten metal yields {{a broad range of}} droplet diameters, typically in the range 10-600 µm diameter, with a mean diameter of ~100 µm. Droplet diameter governs the dynamic behaviour of the droplet in flight which in turn determines the time available for in-flight cooling which is critical in controlling the resulting billet microstructure. At a flight distance of 300-400 mm, predictions show droplet velocities of 40-90 ms−1 for droplet diameters in the range 20-150 µm respectively, compared to measured velocities of ~100 ms−1, and at distances of up to 180 mm from the atomiser, droplets were still being accelerated by the gas. Droplets cool in-flight predominantly by convection and radiation, and can experience undercooling of up to 300 C prior to nucleation. Models and experimental measurements show that small droplets (<50 µm) very rapidly become fully solid prior to deposition, 50-200 µm droplets will be typically semi-solid and droplets of diameters >200 µm will be liquid at deposition. The range of droplet dynamic and thermal histories result in a billet top surface of 0.3 to 0.6 solid fraction. Not all material that impacts the surface is incorporated into the billet: some solid droplets will bounce or splash-off the billet top surface or be directed out of the deposition region by turbulent gas movement in the chamber. The proportion of droplets that impact the surface compared to the proportion that are incorporated into the billet has been termed the sticking efficiency: dependent on the geometric sticking which {{is a function of the}} <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> relative to substrate and the thermal sticking efficiency dependent on spray and billet solid/liquid fraction.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> on the {{properties}} of plasma spray deposits has been investigated. Two different materials, NiAl and Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr, were sprayed at angles from 50 to 90 ° {{with respect to the}} substrate. The <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> influenced the microstructure and {{the properties of}} the deposits.

The surface roughness of the Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr deposit was not sensitive to the <b>spray</b> <b>angle,</b> whereas NiAl exhibited an increase as the <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> decreased. Microhardness, tensile adhesion strength, and interfacial fracture toughness decreased with <b>spray</b> <b>angle.</b> The change of these properties with <b>spray</b> <b>angle</b> is attributed to (1) the morphology of the splats, (2) the change of the local <b>spray</b> <b>angle,</b> and (3) the change of momentum of particles impacting on the substrate or previously deposited particles.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} flow in simplex fuel atomizers using the arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method is presented. It {{is well established}} that the geometry of an atomizer {{plays an important role}} in governing its performance. We have investigated the effect on atomizer performance of four geometric parameters, namely, inlet slot angle, spin chamber convergence angle, trumpet angle, and trumpet length. For a constant mass flow rate through the atomizer, the atomizer performance is monitored in terms of dimensionless film thickness, spray cone half-angle, and discharge coefficient. Results indicate that increase in inlet slot angle results in lower film thickness and discharge coefficient and higher <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle.</b> The spin chamber converge angle has an opposite effect on performance parameters, with film thickness and discharge coefficient increasing and the <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle</b> decreasing with increasing convergence angle. For a fixed trumpet length, the trumpet angle has very little influence on discharge coefficient. However, the film thickness decreases, and <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle</b> increases with increasing trumpet angle. For a fixed trumpet angle, the discharge coefficient is insensitive to trumpet length. Both the <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle</b> and the film thickness are found to decrease with trumpet length. Analytical solutions are developed to determine the atomizer performance considering inviscid flow through the atomizer. The qualitative trends in the variation of film thickness at the atomizer exit, <b>spray</b> cone <b>angle,</b> and discharge coefficient predicted by inviscid flow analysis are seen to agree well with computational results...|$|R

30|$|Thus, to {{investigate}} the specifications of {{the two types of}} foam used, we carried out preliminary tests focusing on solidification time and the degree of volume expansion of the two types of material. From the results of these tests, we determined appropriate coefficients for the characteristic features of each type of foam for use in the real robot experiments. We designed the actual construction robots paying attention to <b>spray</b> <b>angles.</b> Furthermore, we proposed state transition rules to realize a set of actions involving sensing slopes, movement by actuators, and moving over irregular ground. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed system was evaluated through experiments using actual robots.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic large-eddy {{simulation}} methodology {{is applied}} to a simplified water-spray fire suppression system to investigate droplet effects on a buoyant gas flame. A hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is employed for the gas-liquid system. Dynamic subgrid models are included to capture the local and unsteady interactions between the two phases. The effectiveness of changing <b>spray</b> <b>angles</b> on combustion suppression has been investigated. The drag effects of droplets cause significant changes to the flow and flame structures. Dense droplets, in particular, can cut through the reaction zones, causing flame extinction. The high temperature regions associated with reaction zones are suppressed by the spray droplets in all cases...|$|R
