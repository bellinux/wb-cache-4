40|$|An efficient, {{economically}} viable and operationally simple method {{was developed for}} deoximation of oximes (of ketones and aldehydes) to their corresponding carbonyl compounds using polymer beads of N, N-dichloro poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) <b>sulphonamide</b> <b>resin.</b> Polymeric reagent offered speedy conversion and substantial yields of products under mild condition and is recyclable. Deoximation was monitored {{by the use of}} 13 C NMR...|$|E
