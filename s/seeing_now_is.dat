Within fifteen minutes, a doctor noted that Duncan had recently come from Liberia and needed to be tested for Ebola. The doctor described following [...] "strict C.D.C. protocol" [...] including wearing a mask, gown, and gloves. At 12:58 p.m., the doctor called the CDC directly.

5000|$|Institutions such as hedge funds, {{pension funds}} and {{investment}} banks like Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been instrumental in pushing up prices {{in the last five}} years, with investment in food commodities rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations. Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in wheat futures. According to Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following George W Bush's Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000. De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: [...] "What we are <b>seeing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing - they never actually buy the ton of wheat or maize; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell.

40|$|The rapid {{proliferation}} of 2 ̆ 2 problem-solving courts, 2 ̆ 2 particularly of drug courts, occasions this Article. These progeny of the 1989 Dade County, Florida drug court 2 ̆ 7 {{can be found}} throughout the country. According to one report, there are approximately 500 drug courts operating nationwide, with several hundred more coming on line. From these drug courts, {{a number of other}} courts have evolved, all under the problem-solving handle. In New York, for example, in addition to drug courts, there are community courts and domestic violence courts. In the State of Washington there is a mental health court. While disparate in their focus, their 2 ̆ 2 problem solving 2 ̆ 2 characterization appears to result from a shared, urgent common goal of judicially addressing problems deemed, usually by the court, as not adequately addressed through the quotidian mills of, at least, the overloaded urban criminal justice system. Chief Justice Kathleen A. Blatz of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota has forged a palpable description of this problem- solving stimulus: I think the innovation that we 2 ̆ 7 re <b>seeing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the result of judges processing cases like a vegetable factory. Instead of cans of peas, you 2 ̆ 7 ve got cases. You just move 2 ̆ 7 em, move 2 ̆ 7 em, move 2 ̆ 7 em. One of my colleagues on the bench said: 2 ̆ 2 You know, I feel like I work for McJustice: we sure aren 2 ̆ 7 t good for you, but we are fast. 2 ̆ 2 This emergence of problem-solving courts as an alternative to 2 ̆ 2 McJustice 2 ̆ 2 has begun to engender debate over the three foundational premises on which problem-solving courts rest: first, courts are appropriate institutions for solving the undertaken problems; second, the resources commanded for this problem-solving do not shortchange the resolution of more important but more complex problems; and third, the problem-solving protocols employed by these courts are effective...|$|E

5000|$|This {{is not the}} {{philosophical}} atheism of Schopenhauer or Marx or Freud or Feuerbach. This {{is a sort of}} unthinking, simplistic religious criticism. It is primarily being fostered by individuals — like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins — who have absolutely no background in the study of religion at all.
