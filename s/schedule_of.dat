40|$|Abstract The {{multiprocessor}} <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> {{collections of}} real-time jobs is considered. Sufficient tests are derived for feasibility {{analysis of a}} collection of sporadic jobs where job migration between processors is forbidden. The fixed-priority <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> real-time jobs with job migration is analyzed, and sufficient tests of schedulability are obtained for the deadline-monotonic (DM) and the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling algorithms. The feasibility and schedulability tests of this paper may be applied even when the collection of jobs is incompletely specified. The applicability of these tests to the <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> collections of jobs that are generated by systems of recurrent real-time tasks is discussed. In particular, sufficient conditions for the DM <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> sporadic task systems are derived and compared to previously-known tests...|$|R
