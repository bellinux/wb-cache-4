After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for [...] "New York's top MC", Eric B's friend and roommate Marley Marl allowed him to use his home studio. The first track they recorded, [...] "Eric B. Is President", was released as a single on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons heard the single, the duo were signed to Island Records and began recording the album in Manhattan's Power Play Studios in early 1987. Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, [...] "When I hear my first album today I hear myself reading my rhymes but I'm my worst critic." [...] The duo completed the album in one week. They {{have said that they}} worked in 48-hour shifts and recorded in single takes in order complete the album within budget. In a 2008 interview with AllHipHop, Eric B. stated, [...] "o <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> we put together this calculated album to be a great album would be a lie. We were just doing records that felt good." ...|$|E

I look at him like, not the school yard bully, but the motherfucker that's always picking on a motherfucker that don't fuck with nobody. To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy, Meth don't fuck with nobody. I'm not gonna <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> Rae made me do it, that was a spontaneous decision on my own. I'm glad I did it, 'cause he got a big mouth...It wasn't actually planned, he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded, as it went on".|$|E
5000|$|People {{will always}} believe weird things. They always have. They always will ... They don't {{necessarily}} {{want to know}} if they're true or not ... And if we want to understand why people are like that and maybe {{what we can do to}} change those behaviors when they turn out to be something kind of harmful or dangerous to society... how can we sway the population into thinking a little bit more critically... we have to know what they're thinking and what they're experiencing. We can't just <b>sit</b> back <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Oh, ghosts are stupid. People who believe in them are stupid.' You need to go to these events and see how emotional people get when they talk about these things... that they really, really do believe them. And that they're really, really part of their lives. And the only way you're going to do that is if you go to these events and observe.|$|R

We may look into the future, and we may see that, sooner or later, war between our country and Japan is a necessity. We may decide {{that it is better}} for us to fight now than later. These things are in the clouds. They only enter into the present discussion to this extent, but it is not for you to <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> whether war between the United States and Japan is possible or impossible. What Mr. Jones asks you is--what would be your position if it should take place?

"Well, we're tremendously moral for ourselves--that is {{for each}} other; and I won't pretend that I know exactly at whose {{particular}} personal expense you and I, for instance, are happy.

Unless indeed," [...] he had rambled on, [...] "it's only I to whom, fantastically, it says so much. That's all I mean, at any rate--that it's sort of soothing; as if we were sitting about on divans, with pigtails, smoking opium and seeing visions. 'Let us then be up and doing'--what is it Longfellow says? That seems sometimes to ring out; like the police breaking in--into our opium den--to give us a shake. But the beauty of it is, at the same time, that we ARE doing; we're doing, that is, after all, what we went in for. We're working it, our life, our chance, whatever you may call it, as we saw it, as we felt it, from the first. We HAVE worked it, and what more can you do than that?

If we've worked our life, our idea really, as I say-- if at any rate I can <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that I've worked my share of it--it has not been what you may call least by our having put Charlotte so at her ease. THAT has been soothing, all round; that has curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes, or whatever they are, of the opium.

5000|$|Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, saying: [...] "Perhaps the most {{surprising}} thing about [...] "The Scarlett Getter" [...] is that the big guest star, Shannon Sharpe, fit in perfectly. There was an initial awkward [...] "The football guy Shannon Sharpe???" [...] which turned into a horrific pun joke, but overall, the extroverted Sharpe made perfect sense for a ridiculous alien bounty hunter, and made it work. One of the weird things about discussing American Dad {{right now is that}} the production and airing orders are so hopelessly confused that it's difficult to tell if American Dad is on a hot streak or if it's just getting lucky. The presence of Hayley, but not Jeff, in this episode seems to imply that it's from before the wedding at the start of Season 6, so perhaps this episode was produced two years ago, and last week's also-great episode was produced two months ago. Or vice versa. So I'd love to <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> [...] "American Dad is fantastic this season!" [...] but it's possibly that Fox is just burning off episodes it thinks aren't any good...which would be ridiculous, because yeah, whatever the production order of these, American Dad is really good right now.|$|E
