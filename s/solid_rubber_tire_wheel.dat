50|$|The box trail {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical {{to that of the}} M1910. It had either unsprung wooden wheels or metal <b>wheels</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> With wooden <b>wheels,</b> the speed of transportation was limited to about 6 km/h. A team of eight horses was needed to tow the gun; another six towed an ammunition box with 42 rounds.|$|R
50|$|Edwin Kelly {{originally}} {{called the}} company the <b>Rubber</b> <b>Tire</b> <b>Wheel</b> Company {{because it made}} rubber carriage wheels. Arthur Grant was issued , a patent for his <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tire</b> in a rim channel. The tire was held on the wheel by two longitudinal wires embedded in the rubber and forming a circle of smaller circumference than the tire. The tire was an instant success because the rubber stayed on the wheel and the compound was of good quality.|$|R

50|$|Walther's initial {{cast steel}} <b>wheel</b> {{designed}} for <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> lasted for about 10 years. In the 1920s the pneumatic tire with an inner tube provided significant performance advantages over <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> Walther focused on truck <b>wheels</b> for pneumatic <b>tires.</b> Over the next 50 years, Walther was granted multiple additional patents {{for new and}} improved truck wheels.|$|R

50|$|The Hupp-Yeats used Westinghouse motors {{with five}} {{selective}} speeds. The cars were built as four-seaters in both open and closed models, and came with standard <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Deal was an {{automobile}} manufactured at the J.J. Deal and Son Carriage Factory in Jonesville, Michigan from 1905-11. The vehicle {{was a small}} four-seater motor buggy that had <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{produced}} as a Surrey and a runabout, and were early vehicles with false hoods and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> The single- and 2-cylinder air-cooled motors produced 6/7 hp and 18/20 hp, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The first lowboy trailer {{was invented}} in the 1920s; it {{featured}} a riveted gooseneck and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> The first detachable gooseneck trailer, referred to as an RGN (Removable goose neck), {{was invented in}} 1958.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{spoke wheel}} {{was on its}} way out. A patent was granted for the first {{practical}} cast steel <b>wheel</b> for <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> to Walther and the Dayton Steel Foundry on December 13, 1913.|$|R
50|$|Walther {{developed}} the first practical cast steel <b>wheel</b> for <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> This was a basic but critical {{contribution to the}} evolution of the early trucking industry and the U.S. Army trucks in World War I.|$|R
25|$|Cycle racing {{had begun}} in 1869 (Paris–Rouen), so in 1873 Truffaut lent the 18-year-old Clément an iron bicycle with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> to race in Angers. He {{finished}} 6th and was exhilarated to read {{his name in the}} newspapers.|$|R
50|$|Sources {{differ on}} the {{development}} history, but the gun itself was of conventional design. Early production models were horse-drawn, with wooden wheels. Later production models had pressed steel <b>wheels,</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> and air brakes for motor towing.|$|R
50|$|Besides <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> {{before the}} {{pneumatic}} tire was invented, solid tires, made of polyurethane or microcellular foam are also offered for 100% flat prevention. Much of the desirable suspension {{quality of the}} pneumatic tire is lost, and ride quality suffers.|$|R
50|$|The Orion buses {{were built}} between 1899 and 1903 at the Orion factory at Zurich. They offered 12 seats for passengers. The {{entrance}} for the passenger compartment {{is at the}} rear. The vehicle is equipped with four <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} war ended, {{troubles}} developed on <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> on commercial vehicles traveling at higher speeds. Walther was approached by Firestone to design and manufacture a <b>wheel</b> including <b>tire</b> rims for {{what was called the}} Giant Pneumatic Tire.|$|R
50|$|The largest loader in {{the world}} is LeTourneau L-2350. Currently these large loaders are in {{production}} in the Longview, Texas facility. The L-2350 uses a diesel electric propulsion system similar to that used in a locomotive. Each <b>rubber</b> <b>tired</b> <b>wheel</b> is driven by its own independent electric motor.|$|R
50|$|It is {{typified by}} large-diameter slender <b>wheels,</b> {{frequently}} with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> to provide ample ground clearance on the primitive roads predominant {{at the turn}} of the 20th century. For the same reason, it usually had a wider track than normal automobiles.|$|R
5000|$|The first bicycle [...] "tires" [...] were iron bands on {{the wooden}} wheels of velocipedes. These were {{followed}} by <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> on penny-farthings. The first patent for [...] "rubberized wheels" [...] was granted to Clément Ader in 1868. In an attempt to soften the ride, <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> with a hollow core were also tried.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two general}} {{categories}} of tires on which stand-up scooters travel—hard tires and air tires. Hard tires are generally six {{inches in diameter}} and constructed of a hard-plastic insert surrounded by a <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tire.</b> Air tires are most often 10 inches in diameter. They are constructed of a steel or aluminum split rim, an inner tube and <b>rubber</b> <b>tire.</b> Other, less common <b>wheel</b> and <b>tire</b> types include 8 inch and 13 inch air tires.|$|R
2500|$|James Starley in Coventry {{added the}} tangent spokes and the {{mounting}} step to his famous bicycle named [...] "Ariel". He {{is regarded as}} the father of the British cycling industry. Ball bearings, <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> and hollow-section steel frames became standard, reducing weight and making the ride much smoother.|$|R
5000|$|The Maryland Steamer {{automobile}} was {{manufactured in}} Luke, Maryland from 1900 to 1901 by the Maryland Automobile Manufacturing company. [...] The vehicle had a two-cylinder vertical steam engine and a chain drive; its large wheels had wood spokes with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> and its body {{was made of}} wood.|$|R
50|$|M1910/34 {{combined}} {{a barrel}} of the M1910/30 with a carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. The barrel was of built-up construction; it was equipped with interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of hydraulic buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. The split-trail carriage had leaf spring suspension and <b>wheels</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rolling {{resistance}} of steel wheels on steel rail {{of a train}} is far {{less than that of}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> <b>wheels</b> of an automobile or truck. The weight of trains varies greatly; in some cases they may be much heavier per passenger or per net ton of freight than an automobile or truck, but in other cases they may be much lighter.|$|R
50|$|The {{first model}} for the President was Mercedes S-Class, W140 variant, which was {{purchased}} for Boris Yeltsin and has been superseded by a W221 model. The limousine is bulletproof, has <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> and carries an array of communications equipment. On state visits, it is airlifted to the destination using an Il-76.|$|R
50|$|John Sipe's {{invention}} was unsuccessful. It {{was applied}} to <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> rather than pneumatic tires, and so the tires had poor wet grip anyway, owing to their limited contact patch. It was his son, Harry E. Sipe, who popularised the use of sipes in the USA for the new low-pressure balloon tires around 1939.|$|R

50|$|They {{decided to}} test Walther’s design {{and two years}} later, in 1912, the Dayton Steel Foundry {{produced}} a cast steel cruciform spoke type <b>wheel</b> that used <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires</b> for the White Motor Company. The Dayton Steel Wheel featured an odd number of spokes that were hollow steel with sweeping curves where the spoke joined the rim.|$|R
25|$|One {{particular}} model, made by Pope Manufacturing Company in 1886, weighs 36lb (16kg), has a 60-spoke 53-inch (1.35 m) {{front wheel}} and a 20-spoke 18-inch rear wheel. It is fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars {{are made from}} hollow, steel tubing. The steel axles are mounted in adjustable ball bearings. The leather saddle is suspended by springs.|$|R
2500|$|The first commercially {{successful}} use of wired wheels was on bicycles. [...] They {{were introduced}} {{early on in}} the development of the bicycle, following soon after the adoption of <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> [...] This development marked a major improvement over the older wooden wheels, both in terms of weight and comfort (the increased elasticity of the wheel helping to absorb road vibrations).|$|R
50|$|In 1912, Avery added 2 ST and 3 ST {{trucks with}} <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires.</b> Closed cabs were added a year later, and in 1917 they {{introduced}} a cab-over-engine design featuring an enclosed chain drive. The style of Avery trucks became more conventional, {{but the new}} six-cylinder model introduced in 1921 didn't last long because within five years the company was bankrupt.|$|R
50|$|The {{gun barrel}} was {{extremely}} long, making field transport very cumbersome. The gun was normally tractor drawn using its large wooden <b>wheels</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tires,</b> but {{could also be}} pulled by a 5-ton truck. Its greatest drawback was that it had spade plates on each trail leg {{that had to be}} pounded into the ground to anchor the gun in place.|$|R
