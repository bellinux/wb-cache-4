This structure involves units on different ranks within each stratum of the language system. Within the lexicogrammar, for example, the largest is the clause, and the smallest the morpheme; intermediate between these ranks are the ranks of group/phrase and of word.|$|E

In Izi, every syllable is marked with one or more features of pitch and quality. The three features of quality in Izi are palatalization, labialization, and neutral. They are regarded as syllable features for several reasons but most importantly since they cause contrast between syllables rather than between individual phonemes.|$|E

The paradigmatic plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the paradigms or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.|$|E

2500|$|Nicos Mouzelis reconstructed Giddens' {{original}} theories. Mouzelis kept Giddens' original {{formulation of}} structure as [...] "rules and resources." [...] However, {{he was considered}} a dualist, because he argued for dualism to be as important in social analysis as the duality of structure. Mouzelis reexamined human social action at the [...] "syntagmatic" [...] (syntactic) level. He claimed that the duality of structure {{does not account for}} all types of social relationships. Duality of structure works when agents do not question or disrupt rules, and interaction resembles [...] "natural/performative" [...] actions with a practical orientation. However, in other contexts, the relationship between structure and agency can resemble dualism more than duality, such as systems that are the result of powerful agents. In these situations, rules are not viewed as resources, but are in states of transition or redefinition, where actions are seen from a [...] "strategic/monitoring orientation." [...] In this orientation, dualism shows the distance between agents and structures. He called these situations [...] "syntagmatic duality". For example, a professor can change the class he or she teaches, but has little capability to change the larger university structure. [...] "In that case, <b>syntagmatic</b> duality gives way to <b>syntagmatic</b> dualism." [...] This implies that systems are the outcome, but not the medium, of social actions. Mouzelis also criticised Giddens' lack of consideration for social hierarchies.|$|E
2500|$|Respectively {{equivalent}} to <b>syntagmatic</b> and paradigmatic are the terms [...] "diachronic" [...] and [...] "synchronic". Diachronic covers {{the sort of}} analysis that conveys a sense of traversing the highs and lows of a story, like riding the pattern of a sine wave. The second term, synchronic, is where the story is instead absorbed as a whole, like the pattern of a circle. Most literary analyses are synchronic, offering {{a greater sense of}} unity among the components of a story. Although both structural analyses convey partial information about the story, each angle of analysis delivers a different set of information.|$|E
2500|$|Systemic {{functional}} linguistics (SFL) is {{an approach}} to linguistics that considers language as a social semiotic system. It was developed by Michael Halliday, who took {{the notion of a}} system from his teacher, J. R. Firth. Whereas Firth thought systems referred to possibilities subordinated to structure, Halliday, in a sense, [...] "liberated" [...] the dimension of choice from structure and made it the central organising dimension of this theory. In other words, where many approaches to linguistic description place structure and the <b>syntagmatic</b> axis in the foreground, Hallidean systemic functional theory adopts the paradigmatic axis as its point of departure. The term systemic accordingly foregrounds Saussure's [...] "paradigmatic axis" [...] in understanding how language works. For Halliday, a central theoretical principle is then that any act of communication involves choices. Language is a system, and the choices available in any language variety are mapped using the representation tool of the [...] "system network".|$|E
40|$|Belarusian stanzaic prosody as a {{topic of}} the lingua-musical dialectology  Stanzaic prosody of ritual songs detects both {{synchronous}} as well as polymorphic or bistructural correlations of the two song components – poetic text and tune. Tune often has its own actual segmentation (which does not match the text) and its own <b>syntagmatics.</b> Therefore, the verse-quantitative (according to number of verses in the strophe) classification of song forms accepted so far in musical folklore is unproductive and slightly informative. Paradigmatics of melodious forms is more complex and diverse. The same poetic text in tunes of various internal architectonics has different tension, euphony and semantics. This article discusses four of them: 1) repeating, 2) reprise-symmetrical forms, 3) polymorphic forms based on bistructural properties (opposition) of text/tune, 4) implicative forms, variations of question-and-reciprocal ones.

The poetic images {{are different from the}} primary images in that they are never punctual, but they fulfill themselves through combinations of first-degree images, combinations that are at least binary. Still, the ontological is not a sum of objects, but rather an infinity of relations established between these objects. The imaginary transfers relations from the objective world into its mental double through what we call imaginative relational schemes. We draw a distinction between external relational schemes, which are constituents of rhetorical devices, and external relational schemes, which are accountable for textual <b>syntagmatics.</b> In poetry, the dynamics of images and imaginative schemes is visible in style, which materializes them in the act of creation...|$|R
40|$|The new {{linguistic}} science lacunology {{has come}} into prominence recently. The lacunae studies embrace sociolinguistics, nonverbal semiotics and applied linguistics studies. The research of terms of lacunology (lacunicon) is devoted to empty places {{in the structure of}} the contrasting languages and the ways of zero verbalization in the written and oral discourse. The empty category of the category “lacunarity” has been studied by the Canadian translators Jean Paul Vinay (1910 - 1999) and Jean Darbelnet (1904 - 1990), the Russian pioneers of lacunology Yuriy Sorokin (1936 - 2009) and Gulchera Bikova and their followers. The research has resulted in the cognitive mind mapping. It turned out that lacunarity has several vectors, e. g. lacunae of language (i), lacunae of speech (ii), lacunae of cognition (iii) to be further discussed in the article. The basic terms of lacunicon are described. These are a pause in <b>syntagmatics,</b> a linguistic gap in paradigmatics, a lacuna in both diachronic and synchronic regimes...|$|R

Paradigmatic and <b>syntagmatic</b> organizations both belong to the abstract system of language langue (French for [...] "Language;" [...] or an abstract, Platonic ideal). Different linguistic theories place different weight {{on the study of}} these dimensions: all structural and generative accounts, for example, pursue primarily characterisations of the <b>syntagmatic</b> dimension of the language system (syntax), while functional approaches, such as systemic linguistics, focus on the paradigmatic.

40|$|Comparative textual {{analysis}} of the information exchange flows during the communication process allows identifying the relationship {{of a variety of}} texts conveying one meaning. Identification of parallel relations between the original text and the text of the translation in the communication process can only be of conditional nature. The text can serve as an instrument in identifying the dependence of the meaning on the pragmatic purpose of the communication process. In the terms of practice we are concerned only with the lexico-grammatical features of texts for translation and represent eight duads, which make up the functional paradigm of our research. In modern times text corpora tend to have clichéd texts due to common sources of the original information as well as coinciding propositions and presuppositions of the addressers and the addressees. Basically, we see these clichéd texts as semantically and quite often formally parallel. Parallel texts can be used for comparison in an intralingual environment {{at all levels of the}} language system. Our research shows that there are three main types of parallel texts which correlate with the three components: pragmatics, semantics and <b>syntagmatics.</b> Our theoretical frameworks have been applied in teaching foreign languages as well as translation skills to senior students with SDL TRADOS translation software used as a teaching tool on the point “This is how I do it, now you do it better”...|$|R

The novel is originally published by Warner Book on March 1995. As English Department Students, reading a novel is one of important thing. Besides we can learn English structure, grammar or vocabulary enrichment, we also can know the language style. The aims of the research round up description about research destination {{that would like to}} reach from the research that will be done specifically. There are some aims of this thesis arrangement, they are to analyze kinds of figurative language identified in the novel “Priceless” by Mary Lynn Baxter, to find out type figurative language mostly used in the novel “Priceless” by Mary Lynn Baxter, and to discover the educational values in the novel “Priceless” by Mary Lynn Baxter. The analysis mainly uses a descriptive qualitative analysis method or content analysis based on the theory of Michael Quinn Patton (2002), and strengthened by the theory Nur Antoni in “Introduction to Literature”, Robert DiYanni (2002), “The <b>Syntagmatics</b> of Metaphor and Idiom” by Patrick Hanks, “Metaphor in Fiction Language, Thought and Communication” by Aletta Gesina Dorst, “The Meaning of Education or Why Do We Do What We Do?” By Caleb Rosado,“Value-oriented Education” by I. Bhardwaj. Findings show that writer used the types of figurative language variously in the language used in the novel. The types of figurative language which are found are simile, metaphor, personification, synecdoche, metonymy, symbol, allegory, paradox, overstatement and understatement, and irony. It also shows writer tried to make language that could be mentioned easily. And the most frequently of figurative languages in this novel are synecdoche with twenty-two sentences in percentage 35. 50...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{scholarly}} {{debate on the}} nature of prophecy in ancient Israel. Until now, no study has based itself on the semantics of the Hebrew lexeme nābîʾ (‘prophet’). In this investigation, I discuss the nature and function of prophecy in the corpus of the Hebrew book of Jeremiah. I analyse all occurrences of nābîʾ in Jeremiah and perform a close reading of three primary texts, Jeremiah 1. 4 – 19, 23. 9 – 40 and 27. 1 – 28. 17. The result is a detailed explanation of how prophecy works, and what it meant to call someone a nābîʾ in ancient Israel. Chapter one introduces the work and surveys the main trends in the research literature on prophecy. First I describe scholarly constructs and definitions of the phenomenon of prophecy. I then survey contemporary debates over the meaning of nābîʾ and the problem of ‘false’ prophecy. I also describe the methods, structure, corpus and aims of the investigation. In part one, I take all the occurrences of the lexeme nābîʾ in Jeremiah and analyse its relations to other words (<b>syntagmatics</b> and paradigmatics). For nābîʾ, the conceptual fields of communication and worship are significant. There is also a close semantic relation between nābîʾ and kōhēn (‘priest’). Part two analyses prophecy in the literary context of three key texts. Chapter three is a close reading of Jeremiah 1. 4 – 19. Chapter four is a close reading of Jeremiah 23. 9 – 40. Chapter five is a close reading of Jeremiah 27. 1 – 28. 17. In my analysis I situate these passages in the wider context of an ancient cultural worldview on divine communication. This brings to light the importance of legitimacy and authority as themes in prophecy. Chapter six concludes the work. I combine the results of the semantic analysis and close readings with conclusions for six main areas of study: (1) the function and nature of prophecy; (2) dreams and visions; (3) being sent; (4) prophets, priests and cult; (5) salvation and doom; and (6) legitimacy and authority. These conclusions explain the conceptual categories related to nābîʾ in the corpus. I then situate these findings in two current debates, one on the definition of nābîʾ and one on cultic prophecy. This thesis contributes to critical scholarship on prophecy in the ancient world, on the book of Jeremiah, and on prophets in ancient Israel. It is the first major study to analyse nābîʾ based on its semantic associations. It adds to a growing consensus which understands prophecy as a form of divination. Contrary to some trends in Jeremiah scholarship, this work demonstrates the importance of a close reading of the Masoretic (Hebrew) text. This study uses a method of a general nature which can be applied to other texts. Thus there are significant implications for further research on prophecy and prophetic literature...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Syntagmatic</b> and {{paradigmatic}} relations {{provide the}} structural linguist with {{a tool for}} categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs cat and cats are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of cat. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an S {{to the end of}} the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and <b>syntagmatic</b> analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma [...] ("I should") and [...] ("Should I?") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take <b>syntagmatic</b> evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of paradigmatic relations (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for <b>syntagmatic</b> configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of systemic functional grammar, where paradigmatic relations and <b>syntagmatic</b> configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as head-driven phrase structure grammar, similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization.|$|E
