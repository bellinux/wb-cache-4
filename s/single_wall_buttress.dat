40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{adjacent}} structures from damage, some auxiliary methods {{were used to}} control the ground movements induced by deep excavation. Cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> are common construction methods used in Taiwan for protection of adjacent buildings during excavation. It is generally recognized, but not verified, that both methods have good effects in reducing wall movement and ground settlement. However, the design methodologies for cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> in excavations are still highly empirical {{because of lack of}} behavior research. The present analysis and the design method are all pause at the experience stage. Therefore, the related cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> behavior urgently awaits the further research. As this result, a series of behaviors, cases study, and parameter analysis of cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> are then studied using the numerical analysis method in this study. According to the analysis results, the best design proposal will be put forward. And the simplification empirical design graph will be proposed also. In addition, this study will recommend the simplification analysis methods that coordinate the theory of elasto-plastic single beam model and plane strain numerical analysis. Finally, the stability of excavation increased by cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> will be investigated.

In recent years, <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> has been adopted as an auxiliary measurement in protecting the adjacent buildings in excavation; however, in concerning the way how it performances is still lack of consolidated result of verification. Neither domestic nor foreign is still in lack of regarding the study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of the <b>buttress</b> <b>wall.</b> Thus, until so far, concerning the analysis and designing of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> is still staying in the empirical stage that the configuration of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall,</b> including space, length and depth does not have a consistent agreement. Thus, in some cases there came with relatively large space between the buttress walls; some with longer length; some with depth started from near ground surface downward {{to the bottom of the}} diaphragm wall; some only ended to 1 / 2 depth of the diaphragm wall penetrated to underground; some started from the final excavation downward a certain depth, etc. in various configurations where each revealed different performance separately either in reducing the diaphragm wall displacement effectively or in minor. Therefore, the further study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> is required. For this reason, the study shall focus on a series of complete research of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall.</b> As the lateral displacement of diaphragm wall in deep excavation after <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> has been set is a 3 -D moving behavior, we decided to apply 3 -D numerical analysis for case studies in simulating the analysis and verification, then studied the various <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> models in configuration so as to clarify the mechanism and behavior of diaphragm wall, in the mean time, recommend the methodology of 3 -D simulation analysis in simulation. Then, we proceed with parametric study via 3 -D numerical analysis to investigate the performance of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> as the basis in suggesting the principle of optimal design as well as the simplified designing chart for industrial reference. Finally, as currently the beam on elastoplastic foundation method or 2 -D plane strain numerical analysis is broadly adopted in the designing stage of excavation by the industrial field, this study shall follow these two guidelines and propose reasonable analysis method in simulation of setting up <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> in excavation.
