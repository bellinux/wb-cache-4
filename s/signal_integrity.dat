25|$|A DWDM {{terminal}} demultiplexer. At {{the remote}} site, the terminal de-multiplexer consisting of an optical de-multiplexer {{and one or}} more wavelength-converting transponders separates the multi-wavelength optical signal back into individual data signals and outputs them on separate fibers for client-layer systems (such as SONET/SDH). Originally, this de-multiplexing was performed entirely passively, except for some telemetry, as most SONET systems can receive 1,550nm signals. However, {{in order to allow}} for transmission to remote client-layer systems (and to allow for digital domain <b>signal</b> <b>integrity</b> determination) such de-multiplexed signals are usually sent to O/E/O output transponders prior to being relayed to their client-layer systems. Often, the functionality of output transponder has been integrated into that of input transponder, so that most commercial systems have transponders that support bi-directional interfaces on both their 1,550nm (i.e., internal) side, and external (i.e., client-facing) side. Transponders in some systems supporting 40GHz nominal operation may also perform forward error correction (FEC) via digital wrapper technology, as described in the ITU-T G.709 standard.|$|E

In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype that can verify the integrity of GNSS civil <b>signals.</b> By <b>integrity</b> we intuitively mean that civil signals originate from a GNSS satellite without having been artificially interfered with. Our prototype provides interfaces that can incorporate existing spoofing detection methods whose results are then combined into an overall evaluation of the <b>signal’s</b> <b>integrity,</b> which we call integrity level. Considering the various security requirements from different applications, integrity levels can be calculated in many ways determined by their users.

25|$|A power {{amplifier}} is an amplifier designed primarily {{to increase the}} power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, {{as well as the}} inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest <b>signal</b> <b>integrity.</b> An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20dB might have a voltage gain of 20dB and an available power gain of much more than 20dB (power ratio of 100)—yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600Ω microphone and the output connects to a 47kΩ input socket for a {{power amplifier}}. In general the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifier based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.|$|E

2500|$|Compared {{to single}} data rate (SDR) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM {{interface}} makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict {{control of the}} timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as phase-locked loops and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the <b>signal</b> <b>integrity</b> requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name [...] "double data rate" [...] refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.|$|E
5000|$|The power {{reduction}} is accomplished {{in a few}} ways. In 100 Mbit/s, 1 gigabit and 10 Gbit/s speed data links, energy is used to keep the physical layer transmitters on all the time. If they could be put into [...] "sleep" [...] mode when no data is being sent, that energy could be saved. When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer PHY. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain link <b>signaling</b> <b>integrity.</b> When there is data to transmit, a normal IDLE signal is sent for a predetermined period of time. The data link {{is considered to be}} always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the transmit path is in sleep mode.|$|R

40|$|Hcs 77 is a {{putative}} cell surface sensor for cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its loss {{of function}} results in cell lysis during growth at elevated temperatures (e. g., 39 °C) and impaired signaling to the Mpk 1 mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to mild heat shock. We isolated the MID 2 gene as a dosage suppressor of the cell lysis defect of an hcs 77 null mutant. MID 2 encodes a putative membrane protein whose function is required for survival of pheromone treatment. Mid 2 possesses properties {{similar to those of}} Hcs 77, including a single transmembrane domain and a long region that is rich in seryl and threonyl residues. We demonstrate that Mid 2 is required for cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling</b> in response to pheromone. Additionally, we show that Mid 2 and Hcs 77 serve a redundant but essential function as cell surface sensors for cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling</b> during vegetative growth. Both proteins are uniformly distributed through the plasma membrane and are highly O-mannosylated on their extracellular domains. Finally, we identified a yeast homolog of MID 2, designated MTL 1, which provides a partially redundant function with MID 2 for cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling</b> during vegetative growth at elevated temperature but not for survival of pheromone treatment. We conclude that Hcs 77 is dedicated to signaling cell wall stress during vegetative growth and that Mid 2 participates in this signaling, but its primary role is in signaling wall stress during pheromone-induced morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|We {{isolated}} the kexB gene, which encodes a subtilisin-like processing enzyme, from a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae. To examine the physiological role of kexB in A. oryzae, we constructed a kexB disruptant (ΔkexB), which formed shrunken colonies with poor generation of conidia on Czapek-Dox (CD) agar plates and hyperbranched mycelia in CD liquid medium. The phenotypes of the ΔkexB strain were restored under high osmolarity in both {{solid and liquid}} culture conditions. We found that transcription of the mpkA gene, which encodes a putative mitogen-activated protein kinase involved in cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling,</b> was significantly higher in ΔkexB cells than in wild-type cells. The ΔkexB cells also contained higher levels of transcripts for cell wall-related genes encoding β- 1, 3 -glucanosyltransferase and chitin synthases, which is presumably attributable to cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling</b> through the increased gene expression of mpkA. As expected, constitutively increased levels of phosphorylated MpkA were observed in ΔkexB cells on the CD plate culture. High osmotic stress greatly downregulated the increased levels of both transcripts of mpkA and the phosphorylated form of MpkA in ΔkexB cells, concomitantly suppressing the morphological defects. These {{results suggest that the}} upregulation of transcription levels of mpkA and cell wall biogenesis genes in the ΔkexB strain is autoregulated by phosphorylated MpkA as the active form through cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling.</b> We think that KexB is required for precise proteolytic processing of sensor proteins in the cell integrity pathway or of cell wall-related enzymes under transcriptional control by the pathway and that the KexB defect thus induces disordered cell <b>integrity</b> <b>signaling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} method for fast {{analysis}} of <b>signal</b> and power <b>integrity</b> based on a recently developed multilayered finite difference method (M-FDM). In order to accurately model multilayered planar structures, which are three dimensional, M-FDM combines two-dimensional models for power/ground planes using a multilayered unit cell approach. In this way, noise coupling can be considered {{not only in the}} transversal direction between two planes, but also vertically from one plane pair to another through the apertures and via holes. For a co-simulation of <b>signal</b> and power <b>integrity,</b> transmission line models also need to be included. The interaction between the signal transmission and power distribution modes is taken into account using a modal decomposition technique. An equivalent circuit model becomes available based on this finite difference approximation as well. Based on this network representation, second order effects such as fringe and gap fields can be included in M-FDM using equivalent circuit models for these fields. This results in a very accurate method {{that can be used for}} fast analysis of <b>signal</b> and power <b>integrity</b> in arbitrary package and board designs having any stack-up configuration and number of layers.

40|$|Lymphocyte {{signaling}} cascades {{responsible for}} anti-tumor cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine production must be tightly regulated {{in order to}} control an immune response. Disruption of these cascades can cause immune suppression as seen in a tumor microenvironment, and loss of <b>signaling</b> <b>integrity</b> can lead to autoimmunity and other forms of host-tissue damage. Therefore, understanding the distinct signaling events that exclusively control specific effector functions of ‘killer’ lymphocytes (T and NK cells) is critical for understanding disease progression and formulating successful immunotherapy. Elucidation of divergent signaling pathways involved in receptor-mediated activation has provided insights into the independent regulation of cytotoxicity and cytokine production in lymphocytes. Specifically, the Fyn signaling axis represents a branch point for killer cell effector functions and provides a model for how cytotoxicity and cytokine production are differentially regulated. While the Fyn-PI(3) K pathway controls multiple functions including cytotoxicity, cell development and cytokine production, the Fyn-ADAP pathway preferentially regulates cytokine production in NK and T cells. In this review, we discuss how the structure of Fyn controls its function in lymphocytes and the role this plays in mediating two facets of lymphocyte effector function, cytotoxicity and production of inflammatory cytokines. This offers a model for using mechanistic and structural approaches to understand clinically relevant lymphocyte signaling...|$|R
