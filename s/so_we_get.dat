500|$|Chris Turner's book [...] {{describes}} the Movementarians as {{a cross between}} the Church of Scientology and Raëlism, with lesser influences from Sun Myung Moon and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Planet Simpson also notes the Simpsons' chant {{at the conclusion of}} the episode as evidence of a [...] "true high-growth quasi-religious cult of our time", referring to television. The book refers to a [...] "Cult of Pop", which it describes as [...] "a fast growing mutation ersatz religion that has filled the gaping hole in the West's social fabric where organized religion used to be". Martin Hunt of FACTnet notes several similarities between the Movementarians and the Church of Scientology. [...] "The Leader" [...] physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard; the Movementarians' [...] "trillion year labor contract" [...] alludes to the (Scientology) Sea Org's billion year contract; and both groups make extensive use of litigation. The A.V. Club analyzes the episode in a piece called [...] "Springfield joins a cult", comparing the Movementarians' plans to travel to [...] "Blisstonia" [...] to Heaven's Gate's promises of bliss after traveling to the comet Hale–Bopp. However, it also notes that [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] is a commentary on organized religion in general, quoting Bart as saying, [...] "Church, cult, cult, church. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> bored someplace else every Sunday." [...] Planet Simpson discusses The Simpsons approach to deprogramming in the episode, noting groundskeeper Willie's conversion to the philosophy of the Movementarians after learning about it while attempting to deprogram Homer. Author Chris Turner suggests that Marge should have instead gone with the [...] "Conformco Brain Deprogrammers" [...] used in the episode [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] to convince Bart to leave Mr. Burns and come back home.|$|E

500|$|By default, Aurora {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the film's main character. Leigh Butler of Tor.com argues that the role of [...] "protagonist" [...] rightfully belongs to the three good fairies because they [...] "make all the critical decisions in the film, the ones which drive the action", while Aurora acts {{as little more than a}} pawn. Butler expounded that Aurora [...] "never grows as a character during the course of the film; she has no agency at all, in fact. She doesn’t act; she is acted upon. So she is definitely not the hero of the story." [...] Helping Writers Become Authors' K. M. Weiland agreed, writing, [...] "Sleeping Beauty has no arc. Prince Phillip has no arc. And, even more importantly, neither of them are present from start to finish in the story. Without the fairies to hold this thing together, the plot would have lacked any kind of impetus or cohesion." [...] Upon initial viewing of Sleeping Beauty, a writer for Anibundel originally dismissed Aurora as [...] "the ultimate Disney princess in the most negative and passive sense of the stereotype ... playing no part whatsoever in her own outcome." [...] However, in retrospect, the author's opinion eventually evolved upon subsequent viewings: [...] "Although Aurora has little to do with her own conclusion, it’s not a mark of her being a non-person. Instead it reflects how sometimes bad things just happen which we have no control over, a difficult but important lesson." [...] Anibundel does agree that although Aurora is Sleeping Beautys title character, she can hardly be considered the film's protagonist, instead believing instead that the film actually lacks one completely. Meanwhile, the author dubbed Aurora the film's most sympathetic character because she has [...] "thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and emotions," [...] elaborating, [...] "While most characters ... are overly focused on the plot and reacting to events, Briar Rose is unaware of the other events <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to see a more authentic everyday side of her." [...] In his book Multiculturalism and the Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment, author Douglas Brode wrote that the fairies' raising of Aurora mirrors [...] "precisely that sort of women's commune numerous feminists experimented with throughout the seventies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{symbol of}} a {{differential}} operator [...] of order n on a smooth manifold X is defined {{in much the same}} way using local coordinate charts, and is a function on the cotangent bundle of X, homogeneous of degree n on each cotangent space. (In general, differential operators transform in a rather complicated way under coordinate transforms (see jet bundle); however, the highest order terms transform like tensors <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> well defined homogeneous functions on the cotangent spaces that are independent of the choice of local charts.) More generally, the {{symbol of a}} differential operator between two vector bundles E and F is a section of the pullback of the bundle Hom(E, F) to the cotangent space of X. The differential operator is called elliptic if the element of Hom(Ex, Fx) is invertible for all non-zero cotangent vectors at any point x of X.|$|E
2500|$|News {{about the}} Bibles {{had reached the}} Al Jezeera network, which had {{broadcast}} {{a story about the}} possibility that American troops were violating anti-proselytization rules. The report included video footage of U.S. Army Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) Gary Hensley telling soldiers that they had a responsibility to [...] "hunt people for Jesus": [...] "The special forces guys—they hunt men basically. We do the same things as Christians, we hunt people for Jesus. We do, we hunt them down.... Get the hound of heaven after them, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> them into the kingdom. That's what we do, that's our business." [...] The footage shows a discussion between soldiers and their chaplain discussing how the Bibles might be distributed without violating the military's general order against proselytization, [...] "although they don't arrive at any clear plan." [...] When a reporter from Al Jazeera brought up the issue of using the Bibles to proselytize Afghans during a May 4, 2009, Pentagon news conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen stated that [...] "from the United States military's perspective," [...] it is [...] "not our position to ever push any specific kind of religion.

In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "Two-Lane Blacktop is a far from perfect film (those metaphors keep blocking the road), but it has been directed, acted, photographed and scored (underscored, happily) with the restraint and control of an aware, mature filmmaker". Time magazine's Jay Cocks wrote, [...] "The film is immaculately crafted, funny and quite beautiful, resonant with a lingering mood of loss and loneliness ... Not a single frame in the film is wasted. Even the small touches— the languid tension while refueling at a back-country gas station or the piercing sound of an ignition buzzer— have their own intricate worth". In his review for the Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, [...] "Two-Lane Blacktop is a movie of achingly eloquent landscapes and absurdly inert characters". In his review for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, [...] "The movie starts off as a narrative, but gradually grows into something much more abstract— it's unsettling, but also beautiful".|$|E
