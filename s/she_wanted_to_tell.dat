25|$|Hathaway starred {{alongside}} Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's drama Brokeback Mountain (2005). It won {{rave reviews}} and received several Academy Award nominations. Hathaway later {{stated that the}} content of the film was more important than its award count and that making it made her more aware of the kind of stories <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> as an actress.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} {{the film to}} those of director John Waters but felt that it fell short of the mark. Stephanie Zacharek called it a [...] "Waters knockoff" [...] while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished. Babbit says that although Waters {{is one of her}} influences, she did not want her film to have the [...] "bite" [...] of his. She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a conventionally romantic story. The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film, drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and James Berardinelli called it a standout feature. Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a lengthy}} musical break, Norwood {{established}} a flourishing acting career with her sitcom Moesha. She eventually entered recording studios on October 1997, {{to begin work}} on her second studio album, barely satisfied with the material that was presented to her. However, the recording of the album was postponed several times as Norwood felt that many songs wouldn't express what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> at this point of her career. [...] "Many of the songs I heard were not 'me'," [...] the singer stated during a promotional interview with Jet in 1999, [...] "And If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it. I'm not the little girl I was when I made my first record. My voice is a strong instrument now; my vocals come from both my heart and my diaphragm. My heart because I matured {{in the four years}} since the last album; I'm more emotionally there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] whispered Marjorie unheeded. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him {{it mattered}} now, mattered supremely, {{but she knew}} he had no ears for her.|$|E
60|$|Philip moved {{a little}} uneasily in his place. Some {{instinct}} told him, however, how greatly she desired his silence--that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her story her own way.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{knew that}} Ruby meant that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Anne {{all about her}} own recent flirtations, but she promised to go, and Diana offered to go with her.|$|E

60|$|But now Olive {{had written}} that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{her a lot}} of things which could not go into a letter, and so the Broadstone {{carriage}} stopped again at the toll-gate.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{dropped the}} gun and sank beside him, helpless, horror-stricken, {{wringing}} her hands. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him she was sorry, that he drove her to it, that he must let her pray for him. But she could not speak. Her tongue clove {{to the roof of}} her mouth and she seemed strangling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am. It was a {{very nice}} young lady indeed that brought me down this pink tunic, because it got stained last night, and she said her orders was to promise me a ticket if it came in time; but, oh my! ma'am, she looked as if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me not to come." ...|$|E

Since they have some time to kill, Gloria takes Alex to her psychic (Norma Maldonado).

60|$|With {{this idea}} in her head, she resorted to her usual plan when <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> or ask her father {{anything}} particular: {{she found a}} reason for her aunt Tulliver to leaving the dining-room after dinner, and seated herself on a small stool at her father's knee. Mr. Deane, under those circumstances, considered that he tasted {{some of the most}} agreeable moments his merits had purchased him in life, notwithstanding that Lucy, disliking to have her hair powdered with snuff, usually began by mastering his snuff-box on such occasions.|$|E
60|$|Juliana never forgave that drive. She {{continued}} bitter towards Phoebe, {{and kept}} such a watch {{over her and}} Sir Bevil, that the jealous surveillance became palpable to both. Sir Bevil really wanted to tell Phoebe the unsatisfactory result of his pleading for Robert; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him of Robert's gratitude for his offered gift; but the exchange of any words in private was out of their power, and each silently {{felt that it was}} best to make no move towards one another till the unworthy jealousy should have died away.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} {{began to get}} frightened, keeping the secret all to [...] herself; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her mother, but she didn't dare to; and [...] she was ashamed to ask the Fairy to take back her gift, it seemed [...] ungrateful and ill-bred, and {{she thought she would}} try to stand it, [...] but she hardly knew how she could, for a whole year. So it went on and [...] on, and it was Christmas on St. Valentine's Day and Washington's [...] Birthday, just the same as any day, and it didn't skip even the First [...] of April, though {{everything}} was counterfeit that day, and that was [...] some little relief.|$|E
50|$|Talia's best friend. She is {{very kind}} and sweet {{but she is}} very scared to commit any crimes. She confesses a lot because <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth. <b>She</b> also doesn't like getting into trouble due to her parents {{grounding}} her, or for some other reason. Valerie tries {{to be in her}} good side and bad side, but it has to work. She is great friends with Talia & Rudy.|$|R
50|$|Maria is soon {{discovered}} by talent scouts when she sings with the sheriff, and they offer her a deal {{and a chance}} to go to New York City.

5000|$|The song {{is in the}} chanson style, {{popular at}} the early Contest. Brokken sings that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the whole world [...] "my secret", because she is happy. She wonders if perhaps the world is too busy to be happy, {{but this does not}} {{diminish}} her joy. Peculiarly, she never explains why she is happy. Brokken also recorded the song in French, as [...] "Toi mon c≈ìur, tu sais" [...] (translated [...] "You My Heart, You Know").|$|R
60|$|She {{wanted a}} son. She felt, a son would be everything. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her husband. But {{it was such}} a trembling, {{intimate}} thing to tell him, and he was at this time hard and unresponsive. So that she went away and wept. It was such a waste of a beautiful opportunity, such a frost that nipped in the bud one of the beautiful moments of her life. She went about heavy and tremulous with her secret, wanting to touch him, oh, most delicately, and see his face, dark and sensitive, attend to her news. She waited and waited for him to become gentle and still towards her. But he was always harsh and he bullied her.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brinkley {{believed}} {{that this was the}} mere frenzy of sentimentality, the exaltation of a selfish asceticism; but at the break in the girl's voice and the aversion of her face she could not help a thrill of motherly tenderness for her. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her she was an unconscious humbug, bent now as always on her own advantage, and really indifferent to others she also wanted to comfort her, and tell her that she exaggerated, and was not to blame. She did neither, but when Alice turned her face back she seemed encouraged by Mrs. Brinkley's look to go on: [...] "I didn't appreciate her then; she was very generous and high-minded--too high-minded for me to understand, even. But we don't seem to know how good others are till we wrong them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{went up to}} the Mills, {{yesterday}} morning, quite early," [...] said Adeline. She was in {{the rise}} of hope which she and Suzette both felt from the mere fact that Matt Hilary was on the way to hunt the horrible rumor to its source; {{it seemed to her that}} he must extinguish it there. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> this friendly-looking reporter so; but she would not do this without Suzette's authority. Suzette had been scolding her for not telling her what was in the paper as soon as she read it in the morning; and they were both so far respited for the moment from their fear, as to have had some words back and forth about the propriety of seeing this reporter at all. Adeline was on her most prudent behavior.|$|E
5000|$|Kellie Madison is an American writer, producer, {{director}} and actress. Her passion for film {{derives from the}} stories <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> [...] "that inspire, entertain and move people."

Her production company, Madison Films, is run by Madison herself and associate producer Sherrie Adams with a focus on the development and production of various media projects.|$|R
6000|$|The embittered and disheartened ranger {{then called}} up Lee Virginia, {{and the sound}} of her sweet voice turned his {{thoughts}} to other and, in a sense, more important matters; for when she heard his name she cried out with such eager longing and appeal that his heart leaped. [...] "Oh, I wish you were here! Mother has been worse to-day. She is asking for you. Can't you come down and see us? <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{sent for}} me. We live quite close, you know. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> {{somebody}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her something. I must {{go up to}} her again now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She didn't {{mind that}} for a moment. [...] "Well, I'm glad he had the grace to do so, and I hope he did it before you asked him any leading questions." [...] Without waiting to hear whether this was so or not, she went on, with an {{emphasis}} on the next word that almost blotted it out of the language, [...] "SHE came back to me almost the instant you were gone, and told me everything. She said <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me last night, but she hadn't the courage, and this morning, when she saw that I was beginning to hint up to Mr. Kendricks a little, she hadn't the courage at all. I sent her straight off to telegraph for her father. She is behaving splendidly. And now, {{what are we going to}} do?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{with her}} usual force, she at once began {{to engage in}} active matters. Dr. Judkin's {{injunction}} to rest was forgotten. She seemed to be suddenly strong. The doctor's rash promise intoxicated her; Philip, just gone, was dearer than ever. She {{said over and over}} that he would come back well, able to respond to fresh opportunities. He should find them waiting, and friends, too. It was yet early in the day. Isabel dressed carefully, ordered her carriage and went forth to pay visits. New acquaintances must see that she was not a crushed wife. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> every one that her husband was getting better. The splendid pride of her young nature rose up for conquest. Pity was not for Isabel. And after a pleasant outing she returned to find the house, withal, more cheerful than for weeks back. Nurses had gone, and Reginald's unrestrained shouts echoed at will.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hard}} not to. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him that he was}} all wrong--at least, so far as she was concerned. It. was not the conqueror she loved in him; it was the fighter. Not in the hour of triumph but in the hour of despair she would have yearned to put her arms about him. [...] "Unpopularity, abuse, failure," [...] it was against the fear of such that she would have guarded him. Yes, she had dreamed of {{leadership}}, influence, command. But it was the leadership of the valiant few against the hosts of the oppressors that she claimed. Wealth, honours! Would she have given up a life of ease, shut herself off from society, if these had been her standards? [...] "Mesalliance!" [...] Had the male animal no instinct, telling it when it was loved with all a woman's being, so that any other union would be her degradation.|$|E
60|$|It {{surprised}} her, {{when it was}} over. She was shrinking and afraid. To {{what was}} she now exposed? <b>She</b> half <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her husband. Yet she shrank from him.|$|R
5000|$|Later <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Wayne {{and others}} about herself, but Lucretia convinces her to test them first by telling each a different, fictitious but {{shocking}} [...] "secret" [...] about herself, making them promise not <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> anyone else, <b>to</b> {{see if they}} can in fact keep her confidence. So Wayne learns that she was once jailed for stealing, Debbie is told that she is pregnant, and she tells her boss Mr. Jenkins that she is secretly in love with him. With some nudging from Lucretia, hilarious consequences ensue.|$|R
50|$|Jasmine and Julian (Gerald Anderson) {{first meet}} on an airplane. Jasmine {{is at the}} airport waiting for Christine and Jeffrey to arrive with their tour group.

Meanwhile, Julian {{is on his way to}} Cebu in search of his long-lost cousin, Hannah. Jasmine bumps into an old lady and accidentally falls onto the lap of Julian, making it the first time they ever see each other.|$|R
