25|$|Direct {{oxidation}} of ethylene was {{patented by}} Lefort in 1931. This method was repeatedly modified for industrial use, {{and at least}} four major variations are known.

25|$|Silver nitrate {{was one of}} {{the widely}} used drugs in the 19th century. However, It became {{replaced}} by Protargol. Arthur Eichengrün invented this type of colloidal silver, which was marketed by Bayer from 1897 on. The <b>silver-based</b> treatment was used until the first antibiotics came into use in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|A <b>silver-based</b> economy {{developed}} in the 9th century. Lacking minted coins, Vikings developed bullion-based trading, using hacksilver and ingots. The earliest silver ingots that were used as currency were forged (kaltiniai lydiniai). They circulated from the 10th to the early 12th centuries and are very rare in Lithuania. As of 1981, forged ingots were found only seven times within the territory of Lithuania. Archaeologist Duksa identified three sub-types: spiral bracelet, ribbon ingot, and band ingot.|$|E
25|$|After several earlier {{attempts}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{adopted the}} gold standard in 1892 according to a plan drawn up by Minister of Finance Sándor Wekerle. This plan included {{the introduction of the}} new currency, the Krone. It consisted of 100 Heller (Austria) or Fillér (Hungary). The value of the Krone was set at 2 Kronen = 1 Gulden (Florin, or forint in Hungarian) of the previous <b>silver-based</b> currency. From 1900 onward, Krone notes were the only legal banknotes of the Empire.|$|E
25|$|In 1800 the Banque de France, {{a federal}} {{establishment}} {{with a private}} board of executives, was created and commissioned to produce the national currency. In 1803, the Franc germinal (named after the month Germinal in the revolutionary calendar) was established, creating a gold franc containing 290.034mg of fine gold. From this point, gold and <b>silver-based</b> units circulated interchangeably {{on the basis of}} a 1:15.5 ratio between the values of the two metals (bimetallism) until 1864, when all silver coins except the 5-franc piece were debased from 90% to 83.5% silver without the weights changing.|$|E
25|$|Silver nitrate is {{the least}} {{expensive}} salt of silver; it offers several other advantages as well. It is non-hygroscopic, in contrast to silver fluoroborate and silver perchlorate. It is relatively stable to light. Finally, it dissolves in numerous solvents, including water. The nitrate can be easily replaced by other ligands, rendering AgNO3 versatile. Treatment with solutions of halide ions gives a precipitate of AgX (X = Cl, Br, I). When making photographic film, silver nitrate is treated with halide salts of sodium or potassium to form insoluble silver halide in situ in photographic gelatin, which is then applied to strips of tri-acetate or polyester. Similarly, silver nitrate is used to prepare some <b>silver-based</b> explosives, such as the fulminate, azide, or acetylide, through a precipitation reaction.|$|E

2500|$|The Indian rupee was a <b>silver-based</b> {{currency}} {{during much}} of the 19th century, which had severe consequences on the standard value of the currency, as stronger economies were on the gold standard. During British rule, and the first decade of independence, the rupee was subdivided into 16 annas. Each anna was subdivided into either 4 paisas or 12 pies. So one rupee was equal to 16 annas, 64 paises of 192 pies. In 1957, decimalisation occurred and the rupee was divided into 100 naye paise (Hindi/Urdu for new paisas). After a few years, the initial [...] "naye" [...] was dropped.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to fading, <b>silver-based</b> images {{are prone to}} silver mirroring, which presents as a bluish metallic sheen {{on the surface of}} the photograph or negative and is caused by oxidation, which causes the silver to migrate to the surface of the emulsion.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, <b>silver-based</b> {{astrophotography}} {{has been largely}} superseded by CCD imaging techniques. Although CCDs are much more sensitive than photographic plates, they are rarely able to cover the large field of view required to capture most nebulae and nearer galaxies.|$|E

5000|$|The darkest {{possible}} tones in {{the prints}} are lighter than <b>silver-based</b> prints.

50|$|In the 19th century, Thomas Johann Seebeck invents the thermocouple, Joseph Aspin invents Portland cement, Hans Christian Ørsted {{produces}} metallic aluminium, Charles Goodyear invents vulcanized rubber, Louis Daguerre and William Fox Talbot invent <b>silver-based</b> photographic processes, James Clerk Maxwell demonstrates color photography, and Charles Fritts {{makes the}} first solar cells using selenium waffles.|$|E
50|$|The {{process can}} produce images {{of very high}} quality which are {{exceptionally}} resistant to fading and other deterioration. It {{was developed in the}} mid-19th century in response to concerns about the fading of early types of <b>silver-based</b> black-and-white prints, which was already becoming apparent within a relatively few years of their introduction.|$|E
50|$|The Callier Q {{factor is}} always {{equal to or}} greater than unity; its trend versus the diffusely {{measured}} density Ddif is depicted in Figure 5 for a typical <b>silver-based</b> film. These variations (for example with a condenser or a diffuser enlarger) were observed {{over a long period of}} time, and they became known as ‘Callier effect’.|$|E
50|$|In case of high {{scattering}} fraction, the attenuance {{provided by}} the image particles changes considerably with the degree of collimation of the illumination. In Figure 3 the same <b>silver-based</b> film is reproduced in directed and diffused bright-field setups. The global contrast also changes: the contrast {{on the left is}} much stronger than that on the right.|$|E
50|$|Silver iodide is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula AgI. The compound {{is a bright}} yellow solid, but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a gray coloration. The silver contamination arises because AgI is highly photosensitive. This property is exploited in <b>silver-based</b> photography. Silver iodide is also used as an antiseptic and in cloud seeding.|$|E

5000|$|Currently we’re {{seeing a}} surge of {{applications}} for <b>silver-based</b> biocides in all areas: industrial, commercial and consumer. New products are being introduced almost daily.

50|$|Byzantine {{numismatics}} {{entails the}} study of coins. Building on the gold standard of late antiquity, the Byzantine monetary system was, {{until the middle of}} the 14th century, based on a gold standard, and included silver, bronze, and copper coins. With the economic and political decline of the late period, the gold standard was abandoned in the final century of Byzantine history, and replaced by a <b>silver-based</b> system.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 to 1967 all U.S. coins {{were struck}} without mint marks. As {{it was clear}} from Gresham's law that the rising cost of silver (and the ensuing removal of most silver from coinage in 1965) led to {{hoarding}} or even melting of <b>silver-based</b> pre-1965 coins, overzealous collection of specific mint marks of those years by numismatists almost certainly would have exacerbated those shortages.|$|E
50|$|The best {{of these}} papers, with {{suitable}} pigment-based ink systems, can match or exceed the image quality and longevity of photographic gelatin-based silver halide {{continuous tone printing}} methods used for color photographs, such as Fuji CrystalArchive (for color prints from negatives) and Cibachrome/Ilfochrome (for color prints from positive transparencies). For printing monochrome photographs, traditional <b>silver-based</b> papers are widely felt to retain some advantage over inkjet prints.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{printing}} with Inkodye {{resembles that of}} other alternative photographic processes though its chemistry is related to vat dyes such as indigo rather than iron or <b>silver-based</b> chemicals used in cyanotype or Van dyke brown which have higher toxicity. Inkodye is available in several colors (red, orange, copper, blue, navy, magenta, plum, sepia and black) which can be mixed together and diluted with water.|$|E
