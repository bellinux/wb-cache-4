5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, none {{is believed to}} have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended <b>such</b> <b>practices</b> in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the European Commission began {{investigating}} Valve {{and five}} other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media and ZeniMax Media—for anti-competitive practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking through the Steam storefront and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries. <b>Such</b> <b>practices</b> would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E

In this paper, we use the survey data from Baoding, Hebei province, and use the probit model to explore how the agricultural machinery purchase subsidies affect the mechanized crop {{residue recycling}}. The results showed that several factors that affect farmers in adopting the practice of mechanized crop residue crop recycling. Among these factors, the cost of adopting <b>such</b> <b>practice</b> is significant. The agricultural machinery purchase subsidies can effectively reduce me cost of <b>such</b> <b>practice,</b> as well as promote mechanized crop residue recycling. The paper also proposed several actions in the future. They include increasing the subsidies on agricultural machinery purchase and increasing farmers' awareness on crop residue recycling.

Since entering the film industry, she has gained attention for wearing a bikini in Shaadi No. 1 and sharing on-screen kisses with co-stars Ashmit Patel in Silsiilay and Sharman Joshi in Style, respectively.

5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. <b>Such</b> <b>practices</b> can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E
40|$|There is a {{practice}} {{commonly found in}} many Chinese hospitals called ‘accompany the sick’ (pei ban). It means that many patients’ relatives or friends ‘live’ with patients in the hospital. <b>Such</b> <b>practice</b> can benefit patients in that the visitors are providing psychological support and carrying out some bedside nursing care to the patients. However, it also creates many problems to nurses and hospitals such as overcrowding, an over-demand of hospital resources, and maintaining quality care. There is no study of <b>such</b> <b>practice.</b> In order to gain better understanding of ‘accompany the sick’, its impact on nursing practice and nursing professional development, identifying the contributing factors of <b>such</b> <b>practice</b> is needed. This is an ethnographic case study of a public hospital in western China. The study has discovered {{a number of factors}} that contribute to the <b>practice,</b> <b>such</b> as the Chinese concept of duty of care, the geographic and economic situation, and the unique culture of nursing practice. This is a pilot study and the result of this study will contribute to further study in nurses’ work in China. Griffith Health FacultyNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|The Olympic Games {{have been}} criticised as {{upholding}} (and {{in some cases}} increasing) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either {{in the name of}} the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organising committees and official sponsors. Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production, erasure, commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism, theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects, further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands, and neglect and/or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. <b>Such</b> <b>practices</b> have been observed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. <b>Such</b> <b>practices</b> were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

5|$|The doctrinal {{changes in}} the church {{occurred}} gradually, but by 1994, most of the concepts of Armstrongism had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during {{what is now called}} the Christmas Eve Sermon. Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a New Covenant church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Old Covenant. Christian theology defines the Old Covenant as the Mosaic Law embodied in the Torah. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the dietary laws), making observance of <b>such</b> <b>practices</b> an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as taught in the New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.|$|E

This study reveals that the company is committed to quality financial reporting because such reporting can be used to gain legitimacy and to maintain social harmony. The way the actors in the company construct <b>such</b> <b>practice</b> is influenced by its organisational culture, which reflects Javanese culture. In addition, the exercise of power and leadership in the company determines the construction of <b>such</b> <b>practice.</b> The Javanese philosophy of power and leadership has shaped such exercise of power and leadership.
