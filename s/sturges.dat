50|$|William <b>Sturge,</b> JP <b>Sturge’s</b> eldest son, {{entered the}} office in 1836 {{at the age of}} 16. He became a partner at the age of 22 in 1842. Following the death of Young <b>Sturge</b> in 1844, the firm became JP <b>Sturge</b> & Son, {{becoming}} JP <b>Sturge</b> & Sons after William’s younger brothers, Walter and Robert, also became partners.|$|R
50|$|Before William <b>Sturge’s</b> {{death in}} 1905 his nephew, Theodore <b>Sturge,</b> and his grandson, Frederick Allen <b>Sturge</b> Goodbody, {{had joined the}} firm, as none of William’s sons wished to be surveyors. Theodore was the last <b>Sturge</b> to become a partner.|$|R
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on {{attracting}} students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, {{by which it}} significantly increased its endowment. <b>Sturges</b> Hall was constructed as the University's first library in 1855. In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in Merrick Hall. The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877. Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.|$|E
5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert <b>Sturges.</b> Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used {{in the formation of the}} four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E
5|$|Diana's first spar is with Adrian <b>Sturges,</b> {{whom she}} later meets again when Hector takes {{her to a}} {{professional}} fight. Adrian invites Diana to dinner after the fight and kisses her after walking her home. One night after a spar which gave Diana a black eye, Sandro sees Diana and Adrian together and confronts her, assuming that she is in an abusive relationship. She storms {{out of the apartment}} and spends the night with Adrian. When he asks about her parents, she reveals that her mother committed suicide several years ago. When Diana returns to her apartment, Tiny offers to give up boxing so that she can use the coaching money he gets from their father.|$|E
50|$|In 1811, Jacob <b>Sturge</b> {{died and}} in 1814 his younger son, Jacob Player <b>Sturge</b> joined his brother, Young <b>Sturge,</b> in {{partnership}} as “Y and JP <b>Sturge,</b> Land Agents and Surveyors”.

5000|$|In 1841 <b>Sturge</b> {{travelled}} in the United States {{with the}} poet John Greenleaf Whittier {{to examine the}} slavery question there. [...] He published his findings to promote American abolition. In 1845, <b>Sturge</b> visited Nottingham as he was local parliamentary candidate. There he visited a Sunday School run by Samuel Fox. The idea of a school that taught not only scripture, but also basic skills such as reading and writing was taken up by <b>Sturge.</b> <b>Sturge</b> opened a similar school in about 1845.|$|R
5|$|Personnel {{assigned}} to the FMPU included {{some of the most}} well known film professionals of the day, as well as filmmakers who would have great success after the war. Actors such as Clark Gable, William Holden and Alan Ladd, and directors including Richard Bare and John <b>Sturges</b> served with the unit. Future president Ronald Reagan, who transferred from the cavalry reserve, was a captain in the unit. He was the personnel officer and was responsible for maintaining personnel files and orienting new recruits to the operational aspects of Fort Roach. Later he was appointed adjutant. Like the other notable actors Reagan appeared in the films produced by the unit, but to avoid distracting the audience they were eventually relegated to narrating the films.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John <b>Sturges.</b> For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, No. 4 Commando was {{relieved}} by No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando {{and moved to}} Middelburg and stayed at Bergen-Op-Zoom by April. While responsible {{for the security of}} the immediate area, they conducted small raids from the sea against Zuid Holland. Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. On the No.4 Commando front the two French troops crossed the channel to Schouwen and Lieutenant Colonel Dawson accepted the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the region. Within days of the surrender No.4 Commando moved to Recklinghausen in Germany as part of the occupation forces. In Recklinghausen part of their duties were to provide the guard force for a civilian internment camp. The camp housed several thousand German civilians who were not prisoners of war. Inmates included those with no identification and those known to have served in concentration camps. The two French troops returned to French control and were demobilised. Other men were posted to No.s 3 and 6 Commandos in Britain, who were preparing for a move to the Far East to continue the fight in the Burma campaign. By June 1945 the strength of No. 4 Commando had been reduced to 188 all ranks. During a visit in October 1945, Lieutenant General Robert <b>Sturges</b> informed them that the War Office had decided to disband all army commandos. Those not due to be demobilised would be returned to their parent regiment or corps. No.4 Commando was formally disbanded in January 1946.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, Messner sold Dan Patch to Manley E. <b>Sturges</b> (sometimes spelled Sturgis) of New York, for {{a record}} $20,000. <b>Sturges</b> first became {{interested}} in Dan Patch in 1901 when he placed a large bet on the horse in a race at Brighton Beach. <b>Sturges</b> was the part owner and operator of an illegal but highly profitable casino in Manhattan, the Victoria Club. Although the casino was frequently raided, <b>Sturges</b> was never arrested and maintained a low profile. He made his first offer for Dan Patch {{in the summer of}} 1901 and was finally successful some seven months later in February 1902. At that time, Messner cited many reasons for the sale, including the record price and the pressure of running his store. Years later however, Messner said that he had felt threatened by <b>Sturges.</b> A two-year-old daughter of Dan Patch died suddenly in February 1902, apparently from poisoning, and Messner believed that <b>Sturges</b> was responsible.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, <b>Sturges</b> {{performed}} on Broadway in Hotbed, a short-lived play by Paul Osborn, and Sturges' first produced play, The Guinea Pig, opened in Massachusetts. The play {{was a success}} and <b>Sturges</b> moved it to Broadway the following year, {{a turning point in}} his career. That same year also saw the opening of Sturges' second play, the hit Strictly Dishonorable. Written in just six days, the play ran for sixteen months and earned <b>Sturges</b> over $300,000, a staggering amount at the time. It attracted interest from Hollywood, and <b>Sturges</b> was writing for Paramount {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Prior to <b>Sturges,</b> {{other figures}} in Hollywood (such as Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Frank Capra) had {{directed}} films {{from their own}} scripts, however <b>Sturges</b> is often regarded as the first Hollywood figure to establish success as a screenwriter and then move into directing his own scripts, {{at a time when}} those roles were separate. <b>Sturges</b> famously sold the story for The Great McGinty to Paramount Pictures for $1, in return for being allowed to direct the film; the sum was quietly raised to $10 by the studio for legal reasons.|$|E
