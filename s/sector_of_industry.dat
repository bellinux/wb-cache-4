The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b> Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E

However, craft items are under pressure from imitations from Central America and Asia.

2500|$|Ivybridge's {{earliest}} known economy {{relied on}} the River Erme with a corn mill, tin mill and an edge mill in existence in the town. Later development of the town relied on both the River Erme and the railway, which {{was built in the}} latter part of the Industrial Revolution of the United Kingdom. The largest employer to the town from 1787 Stowford Paper Mill, which led to population growth in the town. The paper mill closed in 2013. With the expansion of the town in the late 20th century much of the new jobs are in the service <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b> Due to the A38 Ivybridge's transport to nearby city Plymouth was made possible as a commuter route. As a result, a lot of Ivybridge's work or [...] "economy" [...] is made in Plymouth and nearby towns. Ivybridge does still have some of its own industry with a small industrial estate at the south of the town and very nearby an industrial estate just to the west at Lee Mill. There have been attempts to brand the town as a walking centre for southern Dartmoor. There is good access to Dartmoor from the town. For example, one route follows the route of the old china clay railway to Redlake in the heart of the moor, another glides delightfully by the Erme through Longtimber Woods. There are other accesses to the Moor. The Two Moors Way, which crosses Dartmoor and Exmoor starts in Ivybridge and finishes in Lynmouth on the North Devon coast.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} new model to explain the {{occupational}} structure <b>of</b> Dutch <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b> The non-homothetic production function we use takes account of capital-skill complementarities, skill-biased technological change and the interaction between labour demand and supply. In this study we cover the whole spectrum <b>of</b> occupations and <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>of</b> the labour market in the Netherlands. The paper shows that the ex post prediction of employment shares fit very well to {{the data for the}} period between 1988 and 2002. We found some evidence for skill-biased technological change. The oc-cupational structure <b>of</b> some <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> respond more strongly than other sectors with respect to technological change and investments in capital. Technological change has the largest impact on the occupational structure <b>of</b> the public <b>sectors</b> and the metal industry and electronics. Capital-skill complementarities are least important in most <b>of</b> the services <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> whereas wage changes have the largest impact on the occupational mix in the hotel, catering and commercial services sector {{as well as in the}} health care and other public services sector. Increases in wage shares in particular favour the employment shares of high-skill professional occupations. JEL Classification: J 21, J 23...|$|R

The role of changes in sectoral composition versus within-sector trends in explaining this development of self-employment was investigated through a shift-share analysis of these data. Overall, the evidence rejects a prime role <b>of</b> <b>sector</b> shifts. On the contrary, a deeply rooted process of upscaling followed by historically anomalous downscaling in almost all <b>sectors</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> is the major proximate cause. This conclusion calls for a continued search for ultimate causes within the domains of technology, economics, institutions and culture. ...|$|R

50|$|After the {{industrial}} stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s (see Soviet economic development), planners expected that consumer industries would assume a more {{prominent role in}} Soviet production beginning with the Twelfth Five-Year Plan.

50|$|The labour {{source is}} {{structured}} {{according to the}} average income: 78.6% of all inhabitants are working in the sector of agriculture, 16.2% in fisheries, 2% in fields of trading and services and 3.2% in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry,</b> handicraft and construction. It {{can be seen that}} the sector of fisheries is more profitable than traditional agriculture, it is also a more stable employment: people working on the rice fields are unemployed between the two harvests, creating more pressure on the resources of the National Park by exploiting its resources in this time. The general rate of unemployment declined from 8.26% to 6.51% in the period from 2001 to 2005, but since 96.8% of all residents in the Buffer Zone grow their own rice, a high number of workers depends on the agricultural season.|$|E
50|$|Starting a small {{business}} was the main way the Chinese coped with their limited ability to find employment in a generally alien and hostile English-speaking environment. They forged inter-ethnic partnerships to overcome the twin problem of raising funds and finding employees. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, most Chinese were involved in the laundry business, while migrants who arrived after the Second World War worked primarily in the catering industry. As these businesses grew, so too did the demand for labour, which entrepreneurs met by exploiting kinship ties to bring family members into Britain. Business partnerships broke up and evolved into family firms, starting and gradually reinforcing the move away from community-based enterprise. With this, competition escalated, since most migrants were involved in the same <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
50|$|In October 2005 {{he said of}} Margaret Thatcher:Ever {{since the}} war we had lived in a form of state {{socialism}} with tremendous controls and regulations over economic and social life.

People who think the pre-Thatcher years were a golden age really didn't live through them: just ask anyone who rode on the clapped-out railways or {{tried to make a}} telephone call when the Post Office ran the phones. When she came to power she transformed the country. The moribund industries relying on taxpayer funding - all gone. The trade unions - all gone. She abolished exchange controls, completely liquidated the state <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> and threw the economy wide open. It's certainly true that she was so powerful a person that cabinet government in the collegiate sense began to diminish. More and more they were like a collection of staff officers around the general. Blair has taken that further and deliberately adopted a presidential style in every possible way. The main difference was that she had genuine feeling, conviction and leadership. In my view, during the last eight years, Blair has proved a very plausible conman who promises much but hasn't achieved it.|$|E
