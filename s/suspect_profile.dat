40|$|Scan chain failure {{diagnosis}} {{has become}} an important means for silicon debug and yield improvement. Although plenty of prior work discussed how to perform scan chain diagnosis, most of the previously proposed techniques made an assumption that the system logic is fault-free, which could be an impractical assumption leading to incorrect diagnostic results. In this paper, we propose a scan chain Deterministic Diagnostic Pattern Generation (DDPG) method that can tolerate the faults in the system logic without degradation of chain diagnostic resolution and precision. The entire flow includes three steps. In the first step, patterns are created to propagate the state of a targeted scan cell to as many reliable observation points as possible. In the second step, the load error probability of each targeted scan cell {{is calculated based on}} the Hamming Distances between the observed responses and the expected good or faulty responses. In the last step, a <b>suspect</b> <b>profile</b> is plotted, which can be used to identify the suspect scan cell(s) based on ranking scores. Experimental results show that the diagnostic resolution and precision are not degraded even with dozens of faults injected into the system logic. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of a match between the DNA profile of a stain found on a crime scene and that of a suspect (previously identified) {{involves the use of}} the unknown parameter $p=(p_ 1, p_ 2, [...] .) $, (the ordered vector which represents the proportions of the different DNA profiles in the population of potential donors) and the names of the different DNA types. We propose a Bayesian non parametric method which considers $P$ as a random variable distributed according to the two-parameter Poisson Dirichlet distribution, and discard information about names of DNA types. The ultimate goal of this model is to evaluate DNA matches in the rare type case, that is the situation in which the <b>suspect's</b> <b>profile,</b> matching the crime stain profile, is not one of those in the database of reference...|$|R
40|$|When a Y-chromosomal and a (partial) {{autosomal}} DNA profile {{are obtained}} from one crime sample, and both <b>profiles</b> match the <b>suspect's</b> <b>profiles,</b> {{we would like}} to know the combined evidential value. To calculate the likelihood ratio of observing the autosomal and Y-chromosomal DNA profiles combined, we need to know the conditional random match probability of the observed autosomal DNA profile, given the Y-chromosomal match. We examine this conditional probability in two ways: (1) with a database containing data of 2, 085 men and (2) using a simulation model. We conclude that if the Y-chromosomal DNA profiles match, we can still regard the autosomal DNA profile as independent from the Y-chromosomal DNA profile if the matching person is not a descendant of the father of the donor of the (crime) sample. The evidential value can, in that case, be computed by multiplying the random match probabilities of the individual profiles. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

5000|$|The major U.S. {{city with}} {{the highest rates of}} {{carjacking}} is Detroit. In 2008, Detroit had 1,231 carjackings, more than three a day. By 2013, that number had fallen to 701, but this was still the highest known number of carjackings for any major city in the country. [...] The significant decrease in carjackings was credited to a coordinated effort by the Detroit Police Department, the FBI, and the local federal prosecutor's office. [...] Serial carjackers were targeted for federal prosecutions and longer sentences, and in 2009 the Detroit Police Department centralized all carjacking investigations and developed a <b>suspect</b> <b>profiling</b> system. Through mid-November 2014, Detroit had 486 carjackings, down 31% from the year before, but this was still three times more than the carjackings experienced by New York City (which has ten times Detroit's population) in all of 2013. Even James Craig, chief of police of the Detroit Police Department, was the victim of an attempted carjacking while he was in his police cruiser.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Generally, murder classifications {{have failed}} to be useful for {{investigators}} in identi-fying perpetrators of murders. Based {{on the experience of}} the authors, this article extends the definitions of four previously recognized rape-offender typologies (power-assertive, power-reassurance, anger-retaliatory, and anger-excitation) into classifications for sexually ori-ented killers. These types of murderers and their crime scenes are described through the dynamics of their behaviors, homicidal patterns, and <b>suspect</b> <b>profiles.</b> Each typology is fol-lowed by an actual case example that fits that particular type of killer. By identifying crime scene and behavioral factors of these killers, the homicide investigator will be more equipped to process murder scenes, prioritize leads, and apprehend killers. Unlike earlier efforts at crime scene classification, the present work addresses the behaviors, motivational continuum, and the effects of experiential learning by the perpetrators. The relative frequency of the four types within a population of murderers at the Michigan State Penitentiary is revealed. When the motivation for a murder is unknown and the identity of the killer has not been established, it is hard to explain the critical questions of who, what, when, where, why, and how. Without such information, the public is left with the uneas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method consisting of both automated statistical screening and manual quality control through expert visual inspection, which produces a historical ocean temperature archive of high quality—that is, nearly all profiles are unique (duplicate elimination) and 95 % of bad data is eliminated. The complete process involves comprehensive duplicate elimination, an unreasonable gradient check, and statistical screening to distill out <b>suspect</b> <b>profiles,</b> {{which are then}} only eliminated (or partially so) during an expert manual visual inspection step. Statistical screening was optimized using an archive of known quality. Two iterations of statistical screening were required to identify {{the bulk of the}} bad data. Of an archive of about 121 000 profiles, the authors found they had to manually inspect 35 % of profiles to remove 95 % of the bad data. While costly, they argue such an effort is worthwhile so that the historical ocean temperature archives, which have cost the global community millions of dollars to obtain, are made more immediately useful for climate and ocean sciences. An archive of upper ocean temperature profiles from the Indian Ocean is near completion and extensions into the Pacific Ocean have begun. 1...|$|R
40|$|Today a lot {{of digital}} evidences for crime {{investigation}} includes a geospatial component.

40|$|Since in 2009, when Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) was firstly {{reported}} for the molecular mapping of latent fingermarks, the range of information and operational capabilities have steadily increased. Pioneering work from our Fingermark Research Group exploited different modalities, including Profiling (MALDI MSP), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Ion Mobility MS/MS; a number of methodologies were also developed to conquer a main challenge, namely <b>profiling</b> the <b>suspect</b> and their actions prior to or whilst committing the crime. <b>Suspect</b> <b>profiling</b> here is no longer based on behavioural science but complements this discipline and the investigations by detecting and visualising the molecular make-up of fingermarks onto the identifying ridges.

In 2013, a review was published covering the research work and developments of four years supported by the Home Office, UK and the local regional Police with some insights (and comparison) into similar research being reported employing other mass spectrometric techniques. The present review is an extensive update on the MALDI MS based methods' achievements, limitations and work in progress; it also offers an outlook on further necessary research into this subject. The main highlights are the increased number of possible information retrievable around a suspect and the more extended compatibility of this technology.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of profiling systems with increased sensitivity {{has led to}} a concurrent increase in the risk of detecting contaminating DNA in forensic casework. To evaluate the contamination risk of tools used during exhibit examination we have assessed the occurrence and level of DNA transferred between mock casework exhibits, comprised of cotton or glass substrates, and high-risk vectors (scissors, forceps, and gloves). The subsequent impact of such transfer in the profiling of a target sample was also investigated. Dried blood or touch DNA, deposited on the primary substrate, was transferred via the vector to the secondary substrate, which was either DNA-free or contained a target sample (dried blood or touch DNA). Pairwise combinations of both heavy and light contact were applied by each vector in order to simulate various levels of contamination. The transfer of dried blood to DNA-free cotton was observed for all vectors and transfer scenarios, with transfer substantially lower when glass was the substrate. Overall touch DNA transferred less efficiently, with significantly lower transfer rates than blood when transferred to DNA-free cotton; the greatest transfer of touch DNA occurred between cotton and glass substrates. In the presence of a target sample, the detectability of transferred DNA decreased due to the presence of background DNA. Transfer had no impact on the detectability of the target profile, however, in casework scenarios where the <b>suspect</b> <b>profiles</b> are not known, profile interpretation becomes complicated by the addition of contaminating alleles and the probative value of the evidence may be affected. The results of this study reiterate the need for examiners to adhere to stringent laboratory cleaning protocols, particularly in the interest of contamination minimisation, and to reduce the handling of items to prevent intra-item transfer...|$|R
40|$|Short {{tandem repeat}} (STR) loci are {{distributed}} ubiquitously throughout the genome {{and have become}} useful genetic markers for human identification due to their high power of discrimination and possibility of being amplified in a multiplex fashion (1 – 3). STR loci are now routinely used in forensic casework and paternity evaluations. In forensic DNA analysis, additional genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA (4, 5) and Y-chromosome specific STR loci (6 – 9) are becoming increasingly important in investigating dif-ficult cases. The ability to identify male specific DNA in a mixed gender DNA sample can be valuable evidentiary information in resolving some cases. The haploid nature of Y-specific genetic markers may aid in genetic characterization of male contributors in a multiple source DNA sample. In assaults where a female victim has struggled with the assailant, her nail scrapings may have minimal amounts of for-eign DNA from a male assailant. In some cases, autosomal STR re-sults may contain predominantly female alleles mixed with alleles from the male suspect at minimal levels, making it difficult, if not im-possible, to differentiate the <b>suspect’s</b> <b>profile</b> from the stutter peaks of the victim’s profiles; valuable probative information may be lost. Therefore, polymorphic STR loci residing on the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome (and with unipaternal mode of inheri-tance) can play a very useful role in resolving difficult cases where male and female biological material is mixed together. The importance of Y-chromosome markers in human identifica-tion has been evaluated for forensic applications. In fact, {{there are a number}} of studies relating to multiplex analysis of Y-chromo-some markers (7, 9 – 15). However, a standardized and validated commercial multiplex system with a sequence-verified allelic lad-der has not been available for forensic casework.
