50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{describing the}} formation of the ozone layer was described by British mathematician Sydney Chapman in 1930. Molecular oxygen absorbs high energy sunlight in the UV-C region, at wavelengths shorter than about 240 nm. The oxygen atoms produced combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone. Ozone in turn is photolysed much more rapidly than molecular oxygen as it has a stronger absorption that occurs at longer wavelengths, where the solar emission is more intense. Ozone (O3) photolysis produces O and O2. The oxygen atom product combines with atmospheric molecular oxygen to reform O3, releasing heat. The rapid photolysis and reformation of ozone heats the stratosphere resulting in a temperature inversion. This increase of temperature with altitude is characteristic of the stratosphere; its resistance to vertical mixing means that it is stratified. Within the stratosphere temperatures increase with altitude (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (−3°C or 26.6°F). This vertical stratification, with warmer layers above and cooler layers below, makes the stratosphere dynamically stable: there is no regular convection and associated turbulence {{in this part of the}} atmosphere. However, exceptionally energetic convection processes, such as volcanic eruption columns and overshooting tops in severe supercell thunderstorms, may carry convection into the stratosphere on a very local and temporary basis. Overall the attenuation of solar UV at wavelengths that damage DNA by the ozone layer allows life to exist on the surface of the planet outside of the ocean. All air entering the stratosphere must pass through the tropopause, the temperature minimum that divides the troposphere and stratosphere. The rising air is literally freeze dried; the stratosphere is a very dry place. The top of the stratosphere is called the <b>stratopause,</b> above which the temperature decreases with height.|$|E

40|$|Microwave Limb Sounder and Sounding of the Atmosphere with Broadband Emission Radiometry data {{provide the}} first {{opportunity}} to characterize the four-dimensional <b>stratopause</b> evolution throughout the life-cycle of a major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW). The polar <b>stratopause,</b> usually higher than that at midlatitudes, dropped by ∼ 30 km and warmed during development of a major “wave 1 ” SSW in January 2006, with accompanying mesospheric cooling. When the polar vortex broke down, the <b>stratopause</b> cooled and became ill-defined, with a nearly isothermal stratosphere. After the polar vortex started to recover in the upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere (USLM), a cool <b>stratopause</b> reformed above 75 km, then dropped and warmed; both the mesosphere above and the stratosphere below cooled at this time. The polar <b>stratopause</b> remained separated from that at midlatitudes across {{the core of the}} polar night jet.

The temperature evolution in the USLM resulted in strongly enhanced radiative cooling in the mesosphere during the recovery from the SSW, but significantly reduced radiative cooling in the upper stratosphere.

For the first time, interhemispheric characteristics of the {{transition regions}} over two subtropical regions are studied using temperature observations from the SABER onboard TIMED satellite and the ERA Interim reanalysis during year 2002 to 2015. Results show that tropopause height is higher over Reunion Island (21. 11 S, 55. 53 E) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) as compared to Mt.

Temporal variation of tropopause temperature reveals a decreasing (* 4 K) trend from year 2002 to 2008 and beyond this, an increasing (* 1. 5 K) trend is found in tropopause temperature.

40|$|Zonal asymmetries in <b>stratopause</b> {{temperature}} and height are explored by considering a global climatology based on 7 years of Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite data, from 2004 to 2011. <b>Stratopause</b> {{temperature and}} height is interpreted {{in the context}} of the polar vortices and anticyclones defined by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) meteorological analyses. Multiyear, monthly mean geographic patterns in <b>stratopause</b> temperature and height are shown to depend on the location of the polar vortices and anticyclones. The regional temperature and height anomalies, which are due to vertical ageostrophic motion associated with vertically propagating baroclinic planetary waves, are climatological features. This climatology is reproduced using 40 years of output from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). WACCM is in excellent agreement with observations, except in the Antarctic vortex where the <b>stratopause</b> is ~ 10 K warmer and ~ 5 km higher compared with MLS, and the area of the vortex is 45 % smaller in the SH and 30 % smaller in the NH compared to GEOS. WACCM diabatic heating rates support the hypothesis that ageostrophic vertical motions are responsible for producing Arctic winter temperature anomalies. A composite of 15 elevated <b>stratopause</b> (ES) events based on WACCM is produced and shown to be in good agreement with the 2012 ES event observed by MLS. This analysis is the first to suggest that ES events are not pole centered. Finally, temperature observations during January and February 2006 from the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), MLS, and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) satellite instruments are compared to illustrate the vertical range over which version 6 HIRDLS temperatures are scientifically useful. Though HIRDLS temperatures are consistently 5 - 10 K lower in the mesosphere, the horizontal temperature distribution is in good spatial and temporal agreement with MLS and SABER up to ~ 80 km. Gravity wave momentum flux and planetary wave- 1 amplitudes are derived from HIRDLS and are in agreement with previous studies.

We are trying to understand the details and sequence of events that occur when a middle atmosphere (wind) anomaly propagates downward to near the tropopause. The wind anomaly could be caused by a warming or solar variations in the low-latitude <b>stratopause</b> region, or could have other causes.

40|$|Abstract. The first Rayleigh lidar {{observation}} of a <b>stratopause</b> warming over a tropical site, Gadanki (13. 5 ◦ N; 79. 2 ◦ E), {{is presented in}} this paper. The warming event was observed on 22 – 23 February 2001, and found {{to occur in the}} <b>stratopause</b> region (∼ 45 km). The magnitude of the warm-ing was found to be ∼ 18 K with respect to the winter-mean temperature profile derived from the lidar data collected over March 1998 to July 2001. The event observed by the li-dar has also been seen in data from the Halogen Occulta-tion Experiment (HALOE) on board the UARS satellite. The zonal-mean temperature at 80 ◦ N and the zonal-mean zonal wind at 60 ◦ N from the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis indi-cate that a major warming episode took place in the north-ern polar hemisphere a week before the day of the obser-vation over Gadanki. Eliassen-Palm (E-P) flux calculations from ECMWF analysis show evidence of propagation of planetary-wave activity from high and mid- to low latitudes subsequent to the major warming episode over the pole.

Between 30 km altitude and the <b>stratopause,</b> average temperatures from December to March and during July were cooler than the model (by an average of 5 K).
