5|$|Born in Kentucky, Bowie <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in Louisiana, {{where he}} was raised and where he later worked as a land speculator. His rise to fame began in 1827 on reports of the Sandbar Fight. What began as a duel between two other men {{deteriorated}} into a melée in which Bowie, having been shot and stabbed, killed the sheriff of Rapides Parish with a large knife. This, and other stories of Bowie's prowess with a knife, led to the widespread popularity of the Bowie knife.|$|E

He was ordained in 1839 and attended General Assemblies of the Presbyterian Church in addition to preaching in Columbia County.

He died in 1893 at the age of 78.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{was born}} in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 23 February 1443. He was the second son of John Hunyadi and his wife, Elisabeth Szilágyi. John Hunyadi was a {{pre-eminent}} military commander and political leader of the Kingdom of Hungary, who <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> away from the family estates. Because of his father's absence, his mother managed Matthias's education. Many of the most learned men of Central Europeincluding Gregory of Sanok and John Vitézfrequented John Hunyadi's court when Matthias was a child. Gregory of Sanok, a former tutor of King Vladislaus III of Poland, was Matthias's only teacher whose name is known. Under these scholars' influences, Matthias became an enthusiastic supporter of Renaissance humanism.|$|E
5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E

5|$|By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had {{achieved}} tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing {{a series of}} potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, Les Chouans ("The Chouans"), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including La Peau de chagrin ("The Magic Skin"), in 1831, Le Père Goriot ("Father Goriot") in 1835, and the two-volume Illusions perdues ("Lost Illusions"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, he <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by the muse and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre {{and one of}} his last plays was written in Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); he served as a delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, he <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 {{the estate}} was {{inherited}} by the Member's younger brother, George Ferguson, who was by then in his seventies. He {{was known as}} the Governor, reflecting his appointment as Lieutenant Governor of Tobago. He was laird from September 1820, but died in December that year. The Governor had <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in Trinidad and Tobago, where he was a principal landowner, and had inherited the Castara Estate on Tobago from Patrick. George was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Tobago in 1779, and after a battle with the French in 1781 surrendered the island to the French on 2 June. The Governor returned to Britain, although the terms of the surrender meant he still owned the Castara estate and all the slaves who worked on it. George had illegitimate children with an unknown woman. He continued to buy estates in the Caribbean and returned there in 1793, staying until 1810.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen {{had five}} children, {{two of them}} illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate {{daughter}} was born– Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became {{a professor at the}} University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital. The younger daughter Anne Marie, who graduated from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, married the Hungarian violinist Emil Telmányi (1892–1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans Børge, was handicapped as a result of meningitis and <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.|$|E
5|$|When King Henry II died in 1189, his son Richard I, who had <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in France, {{arrived in}} Portsmouth {{before he was}} crowned in London. When Richard {{returned}} from captivity in Austria in May 1194, he summoned a fleet of 100 ships and an army to the port. He granted the town a Royal charter, giving permission for an annual fifteen-day free market fair, weekly markets, and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from paying an annual tax of £18. Richard granted the town the arms of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, whom he had defeated during the Third Crusade in 1191, reflecting a significant involvement of local soldiers, sailors, and vessels in the holy war. The 800 anniversary was celebrated in 1994 as the city's founding.|$|E
5|$|Varlyn Stroud is a convict. His {{original}} biography gives {{insight into}} his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara {{as his first}} murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a Ferris wheel car so Clara fell to her death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in prison {{on a variety of}} charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a subliminal message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the route of the carnival. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking for. After delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his security manager, which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.|$|E
