5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each <b>side</b> <b>on</b> the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

This placed him second to Sid Barnes in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost more than they won, with two {{victories}} and three losses. At {{the end of the}} season, Brown captained an Australian <b>side</b> <b>on</b> a tour of New Zealand, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA.
