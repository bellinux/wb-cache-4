Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat.

At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, <b>stoning,</b> amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by the Taliban {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants.

Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E

During Hajj, pilgrims join processions {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic <b>stoning</b> of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: The role {{of protein}} {{components}} of pancreatic secretions has been controversial in pancreatic <b>stone</b> formation. OBJECTIVE: To study the lithogenic role of pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein and lactoferrin in <b>stone</b> formation in chronic pancreatitis. PATIENTS: Pancreatic <b>stones</b> {{were collected from}} 13 patients with alcoholic (n= 6) and nonalcoholic (n= 7) chronic calcified pancreatitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pancreatic <b>stone</b> extracts were analyzed for pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein and lactoferrin using enzyme immunoassay. The localization of pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein immunoreactivity in the <b>stone</b> was observed using immunogold staining and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Immunoreactivities for pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein were detected in the <b>stones</b> from all 13 patients with chronic calcified pancreatitis and for lactoferrin in the <b>stones</b> from five of the 13 patients. Pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein immunoreactivity distributed diffusely from the center to {{the periphery of the}} pancreatic <b>stones.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein seems to be constant from the initial step of the <b>stone</b> formation to subsequent steps of the <b>stone</b> growth. However, pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein {{is only one of the}} precipitating proteins in pancreatic secretions such as lactoferrin, trypsinogen, etc...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{develop a}} method for {{systematic}} classification of gallbladder <b>stones,</b> analyze the clinical characteristics of each type of <b>stone</b> and provide a theoretical basis {{for the study of}} the formation mechanism of different types of gallbladder <b>stones.</b> Methodology: A total of 807 consecutive patients with gallbladder <b>stones</b> were enrolled and their gallstones were studied. The material composition of gallbladder <b>stones</b> was analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and the distribution and microstructure of material components was observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy. The composition and distribution of elements were analyzed by an X-ray energy spectrometer. Gallbladder <b>stones</b> were classified accordingly, and then, gender, age, medical history and BMI of patients with each type of <b>stone</b> were analyzed. Principal Findings: Gallbladder <b>stones</b> were classified into 8 types and more than ten subtypes, including cholesterol <b>stones</b> (297), pigment <b>stones</b> (217), calcium carbonate <b>stones</b> (139), phosphate <b>stones</b> (12), calcium stearate <b>stones</b> (9), protein <b>stones</b> (3), cystine <b>stones</b> (1) and mixed <b>stones</b> (129). Mixed <b>stones</b> were those <b>stones</b> with two or more than two kinds of material components and the content of each component was similar. A total of 11 subtypes of mixed <b>stones</b> were found in this study. Patients with cholesterol <b>stones</b> were mainly female between the ages of 30 and 50, with higher BMI and shorter medical history than patients with pigment <b>stones</b> (P, 0. 05), however, patients with pigment, calcium carbonate, phosphat...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with renal <b>stones</b> treated at a single institute by flexible URS were retrospectively evaluated. To assess the clinical utility of CSD, relationships between stone-free (SF) status and <b>stone</b> burden (CSD and volume) were analyzed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. To identify <b>stone</b> number impact on CSD, the AUROC of CSD divided by <b>stone</b> number was evaluated. Correlation coefficients of CSD and <b>stone</b> volume were also calculated for groups by <b>stone</b> number. RESULTS: In cases with CSD < 20. 0 mm, CSD and <b>stone</b> volume revealed equal ability to predict SF status. In cases with CSD ≥ 20. 0 mm, <b>stone</b> volume showed higher predictive ability. The ROC curves for cases with ≥ 4 <b>stones</b> showed that CSD was less predictive of SF status than <b>stone</b> volume. The correlation coefficients of CSD and <b>stone</b> volume by <b>stone</b> number were 0. 922 for 1 <b>stone,</b> 0. 900 for 2 - 3 <b>stones,</b> and 0. 661 for ≥ 4 <b>stones.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In cases with CSD ≥ 20. 0 mm or ≥ 4 <b>stones,</b> we should evaluate <b>stone</b> volume for a more predictive <b>stone</b> burden, and pretreatment non-contrast CT seems sufficient. In cases with CSD < 20. 0 mm or 1 - 3 <b>stones,</b> CSD was as valid a predictor of preoperative <b>stone</b> burden as <b>stone</b> volume, so preoperative kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) films may be sufficient...|$|R
