Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.), also known as <b>slender</b> <b>foxtail,</b> ranks, with wild oats and annual ryegrass, among the most important grass weeds in winter cereal production in Europe. It infests other winter crops there as well, including grass seed, rapeseed, and forage legumes...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper focuses on One Year <b>Slender</b> Meadow <b>Foxtail</b> weed and options for its regulation. <b>Slender</b> Meadow <b>Foxtail</b> {{has become a}} significantly localized weed and {{it is necessary to}} stop it from spreading further. In certain locations the presence of One Year <b>Slender</b> Meadow <b>Foxtail</b> is very high; for example in Zitmunice in the district of Ceske Budejovice. This weed is to be found mainly in winter grain (cereal), rape (canola) growth, free growing spring grain (cereal), and also in clover growth. This paper describes the presence of One Year <b>Slender</b> Meadow <b>Foxtail</b> in spring barley and different methods of regulating its presence. Experiments with whether the amount of herbicide influences the regulation of weed growth have been carried out at selected locations...|$|R

30|$|Two {{kinds of}} the present Setaria seeds are shown in Fig.  3 (S. italica in e to h and S. glauca in i to l). The ratio of grain length to breadth for the two kinds of seed differs, with yellow <b>foxtail</b> having a <b>slender</b> shape and <b>foxtail</b> millet a round shape. Figure  7 e and f are the same seeds, as are g and h, i and j, and k and l, one from the ventral side and the other the dorsal side. Yellow foxtail shows {{distinct}} horizontal ridges on the lemma at the dorsal sides (Fig.  3 j, l). Thus, these characteristics provide reliable ways of separating the two species. Most of the smaller unearthed grains were not intact and had punctated husk fragments (Fig.  7 g–l), especially on SEM (Fig.  8 e–i). Because the sample chamber {{has to be in}} vacuum status for SEM observation, many of the Setaria seeds were crushed.|$|R
