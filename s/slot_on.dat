In this paper, effects of number of rotor <b>slots</b> <b>on</b> {{the performance of}} line start interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (LSIPMSMs) are analyzed in details. Magnetic, electrical and mechanical signals of two LSIPMSMs with 28 and 44 rotor slots are calculated, inspected and compared with each other. Influence of the rotor <b>slots</b> <b>on</b> the space harmonics is studied using spectra of the aforementioned signals around the fundamental harmonic and principle slot harmonic. Furthermore impacts of the load variation on the computed signals and their spectra are investigated. Time stepping finite element method is utilized to simulate above mentioned motors...|$|R

5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one extra train <b>slot</b> <b>on</b> the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E
