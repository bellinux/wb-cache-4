5|$|Color {{morphism}} {{occurs in}} the species. A near-black melanistic form occurs regularly. Jaguars with melanism appear entirely black, although their <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> still visible on close examination.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's dark <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> {{thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, the <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them {{a better chance of}} escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 22-25 mm. The forewings are pale brownish-grey, {{the costa}} edged with whitish. The stigmata is minute and fuscous. The first discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> found at one-fourth, the plical <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> beyond {{it and the}} second discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> found at three-fifths. The hindwings are greyish.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings are grey-whitish with a minute fuscous stigmata. The first discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> {{found at the}} middle and the plical <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> placed beyond it. The second discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> found at three-fourth {{and there are some}} minute obscure costal and terminal dots. The hindwings are whitish.|$|R
5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|Spots {{were found}} to {{correspond}} to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed {{in the vicinity of}} moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Open Cup is {{an annual}} American soccer {{competition}} {{open to all}} United States Soccer Federation affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of Major League Soccer (MLS). In 2009, Major League Soccer, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, was allowed to enter eight of its U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the previous season qualified automatically, and the remaining two <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> determined by preliminary qualification matches. The eight MLS entries begin play {{in the third round}} of the tournament.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Highly {{sensitive}} Coomassie {{brilliant blue}} SeePico ™ Stain {{was applied for}} proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). After staining with Flamingo ™ Fluorescent Gel Stain, {{the images of the}} protein <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> analyzed, and 424 protein <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> detected. After washing with Milli-Q water three times, the gels were re-stained with SeePico ™ Stain and the images of the protein <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> analyzed; 272 <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> detected. To assess whether SeePico ™ Stain alters MS analysis, a <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> picked up and was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The MS analysis showed good protein identification. These results show a possible role for SeePico ™ Stain in cancer proteomics using 2 -DE and MS. Proteomics is an established molecular profiling technolog...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, 30-second {{television}} <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> shown on TV — short trailers providing {{a glimpse of}} the story to unfold in Freedom 1.

Some of these <b>spots</b> <b>were</b> made available on the limited-edition Freedom Previsited DVD (see release notes below).|$|R
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.|$|E
5|$|The Anderson Street {{station is}} located at the {{intersection}} with Anderson Street and Linden Avenue in Hackensack. The station has one track running through it, with one lone asphalt side platform appearing on the northbound side. The station has a nearby parking lot at the same intersection, with fifty parking spaces maintained by Park America (under lease from New Jersey Transit). Two of these fifty parking spaces are handicap accessible, although the station itself is not. These parking <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> permit-only, but are free to use on evenings and weekends. The station is located in New Jersey Transit's fifth fare zone, tickets may be purchased at the station. Except for the Metro-North Railroad Express routes to Spring Valley, all trains serve the Anderson Street station, and there is nearby access to the 175 and 770 New Jersey Transit bus lines. The station is 18 minutes from Secaucus Junction, 21 minutes from Hoboken Terminal, and 39 minutes from Spring Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds the}} spaceship's crew long dead from {{exposure}} to a human virus. The trio then discover a sickbay where Avery's entire crew, Toby, and Rory are in medical care along with the TARDIS. The Siren {{turns out to be}} the ship's virtual doctor, caring for the injured humans; the black <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> tissue samples used as references. Amy convinces the Siren to release Rory into her care. Using Rory's nursing knowledge, Amy and the Doctor remove him from life support and are able to resuscitate him. Meanwhile, Avery decides to stay with his son and his crew, unable to go back to England himself while the ship will care for his crew. Avery takes the helm of the spaceship and, along with Toby and his crew, sets off to explore the stars.|$|E

40|$|The International Planetary Patrol {{collection}} of Jupiter photographs {{is used to}} examine the development of a temporary <b>spot</b> that <b>was</b> visible in the northern equatorial zone for a total of 211 days. The motion and color of this <b>spot</b> <b>are</b> compared with those of the Great Red <b>Spot.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the temporary <b>spot</b> <b>was</b> bluer than the Great Red Spot and has a longitudinal oscillation of approximately 4 deg with a period of about 45 days, implying that it may have possessed a significant dynamical property in common with other temporary spots and the Great Red <b>Spot.</b> It <b>is</b> concluded that the present <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> {{more likely to have been}} associated with a hole in the cloud deck rather than with an elevated surface feature...|$|R

5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. M. birostris has more angular {{shoulder}} markings, larger ventral dark spots on the abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded, while its ventral <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris, while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small square shaped teeth on the lower jaw but M. birostris also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike M. alfredi, M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.|$|E

50|$|It {{is similar}} in forewing and hindwing shape to Hippotion stigma, but the ground colour is much darker. The {{yellowish}} <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> present below the apex and tornus with a very clear W-shaped spot. The discal <b>spot</b> <b>is</b> comma-shaped.|$|R
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The <b>spots</b> <b>are</b> almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
