Purpose This paper examines how the Irish government mobilised accounting concepts to assist in implementing domestic water billing. While such is commonplace in other jurisdictions and is generally accepted as necessary to sustain a water supply, previous attempts were unsuccessful and a political hot potato. Design/methodology/approach We use an actor-network theory inspired approach. Specifically, the concepts of calculative spaces and their ‘otherness’ to non-calculative spaces are used to analyse how accounting concepts were mobilised and the effects {{they had in the}} introduction of domestic water billing. We utilise publically available documents such as legislation, programmes for government, regulator publications, media reports and parliamentary records in our analysis over the period from 1983 to late 2014. Findings Our analysis highlights how the implementation of domestic water billing involved the assembling of many divergent actors including the mobilisation of accounting concepts. Specifically the concept of ‘cost’ became a contested entity. The government mobilised it in a conventional way to represent the resourcing of the water <b>supply.</b> <b>Countering</b> this, domestic water users associated ‘cost’ with a direct impact on their own resources and lives. Thus, an entity usually associated with the economic realm was embroiled in political processes, with much of what they were supposed to represent becoming invisible. Thus we observed accounting concepts being mobilised to support the gaining of a specific political ends, the implementation of domestic billing, rather than as part of the means to implement a sustainable water supply within Ireland. Research limitations/implications This research has some limitations, one being we draw on secondary data. However, our research does provide a detailed base from which to continue to study a new water utility over time. Originality/value This study demonstrates the complications that can occur when accounting concepts are associated with gaining of a political ends rather than as a means in {{the process of trying to}} achieve a sustainable water supply. Further, the process saw the creation of a new utility, which is a rare occurrence in the developed world, and a water utility even more so; this study demonstrates the role accounting concepts can have in this creation.

40|$|In {{trying to}} {{evaluate}} the autonomy of central banks in the Middle East, the paper examines the determinants and implications of monetary policy across a sample of countries in the region: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Tunisia. Monetary policy is often established {{as a tool to}} facilitate government objectives. However, some of the announced objectives – price stability, economic growth, and full employment – may be contradictory. The governments may then set the reaction function for the monetary authority to devote more attention to specific objectives that they judge to be more urgent for economic performance. Models that attempt to identify the reaction function for the monetary authority differentiate between two types of policies: rules or accommodative policies versus discretion or stabilizing policies. An accommodative policy provides a regular supply of credit to an expanding economy. A stabilizing policy, in contrast, varies the money <b>supply</b> to <b>counter</b> shocks that may deviate the economy from its objectives. The present paper seeks to shed some light on the design of monetary policy across countries that have kept a sufficient data record for empirical investigation. The empirical investigation proceeds in two steps. The first step seeks to identify the reaction function for the design of monetary policy. The second step seeks {{to evaluate the}} varying effects of monetary policy in the light of variations in the policy design. Specifically, empirical models are estimated to identify the effects of growth in money supply on real output growth and price inflation.

Therefore, establishing energy cooperation in the Northeast Asian countries should start bottom-up, although top-down cooperation should be aimed for at the same time. By focusing on some more concrete topics first, the cooperation that is established {{on the basis of these}} topics could then be used as a basis for further cooperation. Some topics that could have this function are technology transfer on energy efficiency, joint stockpiling, transportation safety, and external policy to enhance bargaining power towards supplier states.

The tests include OM awareness, historic turnover comparisons and turnover intention comparisons. Interviews were held with the owners of twelve small IT firms. Fifty-three employee surveys were collected. Most firm owners were not formally aware of OM. Historic turnover and future turnover intentions were lower in open managed firms, thus affirming current literature. The practical implications are that small South African IT firm owners should endeavour to understand OM and also adopt it, first to remain competitive and second to retain key employees.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the impact of the prolonged import alert and automatic detention status on Guatemala 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness in the US snow pea market. ^ The US snow pea market is supplied by three dominant regions; California—domestically, and Guatemala and Mexico—internationally. The international <b>supply</b> is <b>counter</b> seasonal to the domestic supply, although both California and Guatemala ship snow peas year round. This research used an econometric model, a modified Armington demand model, to quantify the impacts of Guatemalan import detentions on Guatemala 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness with the other two major snow pea supplying regions. The study also used US market participant interviews to evaluate the impact of automatic detention on buyer perceptions in the US market. ^ The findings from this research indicate that being on automatic detention has had a negative impact on Guatemala in US snow pea market. Import detentions increase the costs of importing Guatemalan snow peas, cause delays that greatly reduce the marketability of those snow peas, and increase market volatility by detaining shipments at US ports of entry for prolonged periods. It was also found that some US importers stopped importing Guatemalan snow peas and now buy them from within the US market due to the increased difficulty associated with the import detention process. Findings from this research also indicate that at times Guatemala has an excess supply of snow peas in the US market. ^ These findings indicate that the Guatemalan snow pea program would benefit from the development and implementation of USDA Good Agricultural Practices to address FDA food safety concerns. In addition, Guatemalan producers and exporters would benefit from the development of viable alternative exports crops for snow peas producers. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of macroeconomic events and ideas from the late 1940 s to the present day. After a brief introduction that highlights the unique features of the main macroeconomic variables as compared to their behavior before 1947, the paper turns {{to an analysis of}} four main postwar sub-periods. The analysis of each sub-period begins with a summary of the dominant conceptual framework popular at the time, reviews the most surprising features of both demand fluctuations and supply phenomena, and concludes with a retrospective evaluation of policy. Many shifts in macroeconomic thinking {{can be traced to the}} influence of particular events. The small role that monetary changes played in explaining demand fluctuations in the first postwar decade helped maintain intact the Keynesian multiplier framework, but the increasing importance of autonomous monetary movements in the second decade laid the groundwork for a greater emphasis on the potency of monetary policy in the late 1960 s. The widespread acceptance of monetarism owes much to the coincidence in 1968 of an unexpected acceleration in inflation together with the failure of the tax surcharge enacted in that year. Similarly, the increased degree of inertia evident in the behavior of inflation from 1954 on helped win ready acceptance for the idea of a stable Phillips-curve tradeoff, while the refusal of inflation to abate in 1970 helped solidify the victory of the natural hypothesis. A major theme of the paper is the gradual but profound shift in macroeconomics from the dominance of demand issues to a new emphasis on supply topics. Price controls, crop failures, and OPEC actions in the l 970 s have brought supply shocks to the forefront of policy discussions, revived fiscal policy asa means of <b>countering</b> <b>supply</b> shocks, and lessened support for a monetarist reliance on simple policy rules. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{lactating}} {{dairy cow}} is fairly inefficient at converting dietary nitrogen to milk protein. When cows are fed to National Research Council (NRC, 2001) requirements, they convert approximately 25 % of dietary nitrogen to milk protein. There {{may be some}} inherent limitations to the efficiency {{that can be achieved}} by a ruminant; however, examination of the NRC model with respect to available data suggest several areas where requirement or supply predictions could be improved. Ruminally degradable protein (RDP) requirements appear to be too high. Reducing these requirements would allow reductions in dietary protein and improved animal efficiency. Amino acid (AA) flow to the small intestine appears to be predicted with good accuracy provided diets are within current NRC requirements for RDP. Absorption of AA from the gut lumen is not constant across AA within an ingredient or across ingredients as assumed by NRC. Thus, absorbed AA may be predicted with bias. The gut tissues as represented in the portal-drained viscera and the liver remove approximately 2 / 3 of the available AA on a daily basis, and this removal is dependent on supply. Variable use by these maintenance tissues violates the NRC assumption of fixed maintenance use and introduces a significant bias in our current predictions. Mammary AA removal is highly regulated and <b>counters</b> <b>supply,</b> i. e. as supply declines, transport activity increases and vice versa. Variable transport activity with respect to AA supply violates the NRC assumption of fixed conversion efficiencies for absorbed AA and introduces bias into predictions. Thus, our ability to successfully balance diets for adequate AA while minimizing dietary nitrogen inputs is currently hampered by a lack of data with respect to AA digestibility in the small intestine and poor representations of postabsorptive use of AA. Amino acid digestibility coefficients for individual ingredients are needed to address the first challenge and an alternate representation of postabsorptive use and recycling of AA is required to address the second challenge...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} work {{described in this}} thesis was carried out with the subject of obtaining information on the east-west asymmetry of cosmic rays in latitudes above the so called knee of the latitude intensity variation of the total cosmic ray intensity. As is explained in the Introduction, the variation of intensity with latitude and the east-west asymmetry observed between the geomagnetic equator and the latitude. of. the knee (about. 45 °geomagnetic) can be {{explained in terms of}} the effect on the primary radiation of the earth's magnetic field. At higher latitudes where little or no variation of the intensity with latitude has been found, the east-west asymmetry should vanish according to this theory. A small asymmetry has however been found by various workers, notably T. H. Johnson and F. G. P. Seidl, in latitudes above the knee. Johnson (1941) has given a theory to account for this as an effect produced by the deflection. of secondary cosmic ray particles in the earth's field. The values of the asymmetry calculated by Johnson for various zenith angles were compared with results obtained at 49 ° and 54 ° north geomagnetic latitude. Owing to the large probable errors of the experimental results, no more than a very general conclusion could be drawn from the comparison. The geomagnetic latitude of Hobart, 51. 7 °S, made it a suitable place to obtain results to supplement those of Seidl and Johnson, and the Hobart experiments were planned with the aim of improving the statistical precision of the results to a point where they could be used as the basis of a critical test of Johnson's theory. In the later sections of this thesis the theory is discussed in some detail. The values of the asymmetry which might be expected have been recalculated, using more recent data than that available to Johnson, graphical and -numerical methods being substituted for analytical methods {{in some parts of the}} calculations in order to use empirical data directly. It is important to establish as definitely as possible that the deflection of secondary cosmic rays between the top of the atmosphere where they are produced and sea level can lead to an asymmetry because of the apparent contradiction which the asymmetry observed in high latitudes presents to the general theory which has been found to explain the geomagnetic effects in a satisfactory manner. BY showing that Johnson's, or a similar theory can adequately explain this phenomenon, the contradiction can be removed. The history of the {{experimental work}} on this problem is as follows. In 1946, Dr. A. G. Fenton commenced work on the construction ofan automatic apparatus using a single geiger counter telescope pointing east and west alternately to measure the asymmetry. The author assisted with this work, and in 1947 when Dr. Fenton was absent on leave from the laboratory, completed the apparatus and operated it successfully to obtain results which were published in the Physical Review (Vol. 74, 589, 1948). While this setup was in operation it was decided to construct an apparatus using two geiger counter telescopes instead of one. The advantages of such an arrangement are discussed in the section in which this apparatus is described. The design and operation of this setup was almost entirely the work of the author. It was operated from the end of June 1948 until the beginning of August, 1949. At the end of 1948 the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition became interested in the. investigation of the asymmetry and made a grant of money to enable Dr. Fenton's brother, Mr. K. B. Fenton, to extend the work to geomagnetic latitude 60. 7 °S by operating an apparatus Similar to the Hobart one on Macquarie Island in 1950 and possibly 1951. Problems incident to the operation of apparatus remote from the facilities available in the laboratory made the construction of this apparatus a project of considerable magniitude, and it was accordingly shared between Dr. Fenton, his brother, and the author. Dr. Fenton Who had worked on the properties of geiger counters in Birmingham undertook to construct the counters required,. while his brother took responsibility for the design and construction of suitable recording circuits. The contributions of the author to this work are described in Part II, and included the design of an automatic 35 mm. camera to record the results, the modification of a turntable previously used in a Predictor unit to make it suitable for mounting of the apparatus, and the design of control gear to make the setup automatic in operation. The construction of this apparatus was successfully completed in time for it to be shipped to Macquarie Island in April, 1950. Between April and June, 1950, the Hobart apparatus was modified to include several improvements. The most important of these wee the fitting of larger trays of geiger counters to increase the counting rates, which was possible because of the improved <b>supply</b> of <b>counters</b> available at that time. The modifications were completed by the tithe the Macquarie Island gear was ready for use, and the two sets were put into operation on parallel schedules at the end of June, 1950...|$|R
40|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle or radiation enters the sensitive volume of a counter {{an avalanche of}} electrons is formed by the process known as ionization by collisions. In general a counter is operated with the central wire positive {{with respect to the}} cylinder, and consequently the electrons are collected by the wire. A negative voltage pulse is thus developed. On the wire, the size of which depends upon the capacitance of the wire system and the magnitude of the collected charge. The duration and form of the pulse will depend upon the characteristics of the particular counter usedand upon the time constant of the receiving system. In general each {{ionizing particle}} produces a voltage pulse, and it is the function of the associated electrical circuits to record these pulses and thus count the number of particles entering the sensitive volume of counter. The size of the voltage pulse varies with the counter and the type of particle being detected, but the pulses can be increased to the necessary size to actuate scaling and recording devices by means of an amplifier. For counters operating in the Geiger region the pulse size is independent of the type ofionizing agent being detected, providing the voltage across the counter is kept constant, as the counter voltage is increased the pulse size varies over a considerable range until the voltage is reached at which the counter goes into continuous discharge. In consequence, for use in conjunction with different counters, working at various operating potentials, an amplifier with variable gain is necessary. The amplifier can then be set to give a suitable output pulse to the following circuits independently {{of the size of the}} input pulse. For slow counting rates the counter and amplifier can be used directly in conjunction witha suitable mechanical recorder. Many counters have recovery times as short as 10 seconds and correspondingly high counting rates. Amplifiers can be designed with RC time constants as short as 10 seconds or less, so that the results are not affected by the amplifying stage. On the other hand mechanical recorders have comparatively long time constants and if used directly would seriously decrease the possible counting rate. This is avoided by the use of electrical scaling circuits which pass on only a certain proportion of the pulses to the recording circuit. In this case the recovery time and counting rate of the whole system is governed entirely by the characteristics of the counter itself. The pulses from the last stage of the scaling circuit pass on to the recording circuit. It is the function of this circuit to use these pulses to operate some mechanical recorder. The pulses are not usually able to influence the counter directly, and so a hard valve or thyratron is used in conjunction with a telephone or Cenco counter. It will be seen from the above discussion that the electrical circuits needed for use in association with a Geiger counter are as follows 1. Voltage supply circuits for amplifier, scaling and recording circuits. 2. Pulse amplifier. 3. Scaling circuit. 4. Recording circuit. 5. Stabilised high voltage <b>supply</b> for Geiger <b>counter.</b> The arrangement of these circuits will be such as is shown in block form in diagram I. <p...|$|R
40|$|History is not {{encouraging}} for Mr Howard, according to Brian Costar For someone who, {{in thirty years}} of public life, showed little interest or expertise in foreign policy or constitutional change, Prime Minister Howard has recently had some spectacular victories in both areas. Having rent asunder and euchered the republicans at the 1999 referendum, the wars on Iraq and Terrorism have, we are assured by his ally, President Bush, made him into another ‘Man of Steel’. This week the prime minister returned to the constitution and issued a sixty-page discussion paper entitled Resolving Deadlocks: A Discussion Paper on Section 57 of The Australian Constitution. While public discussion of constitutional affairs is always to be welcomed, little of enduring value is likely to result from this exercise. First, like other recent attempts to ‘reform’ the Senate, this one’s motives are not of the purest. We are told {{that the reason for}} change is that ‘the Senate’s record regarding legislation critical to the government’s reform agenda’ constitutes ‘a pattern of frustration’. In other words the executive is peeved at not been able to bend all of the legislature to its will on every occasion. It is hardly a state secret that many voters regard this as a good thing. Second, the paper asserts that ‘the minority [in the Senate] has assumed a permanent and absolute veto over the majority’. This is a misleading falsehood: at both the 1998 and 2001 Senate elections the government parties received a minority of both votes and seats compared to the non-government parties. Minor party and independent senators can determine the outcome of legislation only when the government and opposition are at loggerheads, and when they do so {{they are part of a}} ‘majority’ not a ‘minority’. To this the PM would doubtless respond that the government, in winning a majority of House of Representatives seats in 2001, has acquired a mandate which the Senate should respect. Setting aside the murkiness of the mandate doctrine, it is clear that a cohort of electors differentiate between the upper and lower houses in deciding which party to support. There is no doubt that the majority desired the return of the Howard government in 2001, but a slightly different majority didn’t want it to ‘control’ the Senate. The Prime Minister’s discussion paper is lenghty but most of it is an uncontroversial description of present and past relations between the two parliamentary chambers. It is much less impressive when arguing the case for change. When it does so, it relies on the hitherto long-forgotten 1959 Report from the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. That report was an admirable document for the times and was a credit to its executive secretary, Jack Richardson, whom Mr Howard has appointed to the reference group to consult on the current proposals. The 1959 report’s quality is not to be judged by the fact that Prime Minister Menzies all but ignored it (or perhaps it is?). But what must be remembered is that the Senate of the late 1950 s was a very different creature to that of the twenty-first century. While the government first lost its Senate majority in 1955 and again between 1961 and 1975, the current culture of accountability, which successive governments find so irksome, did not develop until after the reform of the Senate committee system in 1970. Before then Fred Daly’s description of the value of the Senate as ‘incontrovertible proof of life after death’ was not far off the mark. The Prime Minister’s discussion paper offers two alternative solutions to the current perceived ‘problem’: to allow the PM to ask the Governor General to convene a joint sitting of the two houses to vote on any bill rejected twice by the Senate with ‘the required three month interval’; or to allow the same process but only after an election and a third defeat of the bill(s) by the Senate. The first option is clearly an ambit claim. But what might be the outcome if the government, by granting concessions such as fixed terms, could secure Labor Party support for a version of the second - remembering that as the alternative government, the ALP has an interest in curbing Senate power? As the discussion paper notes, changes of this magnitude need to approved by the people at a referendum. To take to a referendum any proposals to increase government control over the Senate, even if supported by the ALP, would be to award a free-kick and a fifty-metre penalty to the Democrats, Greens and independents, all of whom would campaign vigorously for the NO case. But could these minnows prevail over the campaigning might of the major parties? Yes, if history is any guide. It is often forgotten that two referendum questions were put to the people on 27 May 1967 and they treated them very differently: by a record majority, they approved of Commonwealth power being extended to Aborigines; but they refused to amend section 24 of the constitution which would have broken the ‘nexus’ between the allowable sizes of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This occurred, despite bipartisan agreement between the major parties, because the minority Democratic Labor Party and a handful of dissident Liberal Senators (a species now extinct) campaigned against it on the grounds that it would reduce the power of the upper house. Given that the Senate was held in much lower esteem in 1967 than it is now, changes such as those currently proposed by the prime minister would struggle to win the approval of voters at referendum. In its initial response response to the prime minister’s discussion paper, the federal Labor Party is insistent that any changes to Section 57 of the constitution be yoked to the removal of the Senate’s power to reject supply and the introduction of fixed, four year terms for both the House and Senate. That Howard is reluctant to address the supply issue reflects Liberal Party sensitivity that to do so might cast doubts on the legitimacy of Coalition behaviour in the Senate in 1975. Yet cynics might question the reformist credentials of a prime minister who finds Senate amendment and occasional rejection of ordinary legislation extraordinary and reprehensible, but is quite comfortable with the Senate retaining the power to destroy popularly elected governments. There remains unfinished ‘supply business’ from 1975. When the Constitutional Convention meetings reconvened in 1976 the ALP moved that Section 53 of the constitution be amended to deny the Senate the power to block <b>supply.</b> The Coalition <b>countered</b> with a proposal that a failure to pass supply would produce a mandatory double dissolution. Neither side would budge and there the matter rests. At first glance, the Coalition’s position seems bizarre until it is realised that, by blocking supply, a Senate majority can force a House election without any senators having to face the people. This is so because the Senate, unlike the House, has fixed terms and that a supply rejection is not grounds for a double dissolution. Allowing the Senate to retain this power without accountability to the voters is taking bicameralism a little too far. Surprisingly, a tried solution is at hand in the procedures which applied in Victoria between 1984 and 2003. There, the state constitution was amended to provide for maximum four year lower house terms with the first three ‘fixed’ in such a manner that if the upper house blocked supply the Governor could not dissolve the Legislative Assembly. Given that opposition controlled upper houses are only likely to block supply to force a lower house election they are confident of winning, the constitutional ban on the calling of early elections removes the temptation. The Victorian model attracted the favourable attention of the Constitutional Commission which, in its 1988 report, recommended a modified version for the Commonwealth. No attempt has been made to do so and, ominously, John Howard went on the public record opposing the suggestion.
