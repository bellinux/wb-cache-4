In 1934, the designer Jack Shillan changed {{the engine to}} a 98 cc Villiers Midget single-cylinder engine and sold it for road use. The transmission was <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>operated</b> by a single pedal which opened the throttle on being pressed down and applied the brake when released. The clutch was automatic. There were no springs. Drive was {{to one of the}} rear wheels and the single brake operated on the other. It was said to be capable of reaching 15 mph (25 km/h). The body was open and had a single seat.|$|R

40|$|Non-contact {{measurement}} of gas turbine rotor blade vibration is a non-trivial task, with no method available which achieves this aim without some significant draw-backs. This paper presents a truly non-contact method to estimate rotor blade natural frequencies from casing vibration measurements at a <b>single</b> engine <b>operating</b> <b>speed.</b> An analytical model is derived {{to simulate the}} internal casing pressure in a turbine engine including the effects of blade vibration on this pressure signal. It is shown that the internal pressure inside a turbine contains measureable information about the rotor blade natural frequencies and in-turn the casing vibration response also contains this information. The results presented herein show the residual, pressure and casing vibration, spectrum {{can be used to}} determine the rotor blade natural frequencies with validation provided for the analytical model by experimental measurements on a simplified test rig. A simulated blade fault in one of the rotor blades is introduced with successful estimation of the simulated faulty blade natural frequency...|$|R

This allows them to climb hills and deal with obstacles and gradients better. This typically requires the rider to be more fit or skilled than the average rider in order to traverse the same terrain. <b>Single</b> <b>speed</b> bicycles designed for road riding typically have higher, or harder and faster, gear ratios.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: From {{the early}} last century, {{engineers}} have been designing roads to cater for {{the speed of}} motorised transport. This {{led to the development}} of the design speed approach, where a road link is designed based on a <b>single</b> theoretical <b>speed.</b> International research over the past few decades has found that actual speeds of vehicles often exceeded the design speed and that this has contributed to poor safety performance of some roads. Since the 1970 ’s road authorities around the world have been developing methodologies for predicting the actual speed that vehicles will travel on a road. In Australia, this began with the development of the Speed Environment Model in 1980 and continues with the ongoing evolution of the <b>Operating</b> <b>Speed</b> Model. This dissertation has reviewed current international practice regarding the use of <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> and design speed and has compared it with the methodology currently used in Australia. The <b>Operating</b> <b>Speed</b> Model has been reviewed in detail. A new spreadsheet tool was developed to provide assistance to designers using the <b>Operating</b> <b>Speed</b> Model. This is the <b>Operating</b> <b>Speed</b> Interactive Spreadsheet Tool or OSIST. OSIST was used in a case study to apply the <b>Operating</b> <b>Speed</b> Model to a rural arterial road upgrade being planned by the Queensland Department of Main Roads. The <b>Operating</b> <b>Speed</b> Model is a robust methodology for predicting <b>operating</b> <b>speeds</b> (or 85 th percentile speeds) along a road alignment. However, this dissertation has highlighted areas where the details of the methodology need to be further developed...|$|R

50|$|Many {{commercial}} aircraft use the ARINC 429 standard developed in 1977 for safety-critical applications. ARINC 429 utilizes a unidirectional bus {{with a single}} transmitter and up to twenty receivers. A data word consists of 32 bits communicated over a twisted pair cable using the bipolar return-to-zero modulation. There are two speeds of transmission: high <b>speed</b> <b>operates</b> at 100 kbit/s and low <b>speed</b> <b>operates</b> at 12.5 kbit/s. ARINC 429 operates {{in such a way}} that its single transmitter communicates in a point-to-point connection, thus requiring a significant amount of wiring which amounts to added weight.|$|R

However, the system missed its planned North American launch date of October 1995, and while SNK declined to give a specific reason for the delay, in their announcement of the new January 1996 launch date they stated that they had decided against using a double speed drive. Their Japanese division had produced an excess number of <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> units and found that modifying these units to double speed was more expensive than they had initially thought, so SNK opted to sell them as they were, postponing production of a double speed model until they had sold off the stock of <b>single</b> <b>speed</b> units.|$|R
