Three {{new cases of}} intrathoracic vagus nerve sheath tumour are presented. Two were neurofibromas {{associated}} with generalized neurofibromatosis, the third a neurilemmoma. All three presented as tumours of the superior middle mediastinum on the left in close association with the aortic arch. Previously reported cases are reviewed with special reference to the anatomical position and mode of clinical presentation. The tumours most often occur on the proximal part of the nerve close to the aortic arch and more often on the left than the right. They usually present as an incidental finding on a chest radiograph. To explain this anatomical localization {{it is suggested that}} the tumours tend to occur on the bulkiest part of the nerve which is in the upper thorax and where there is room for growth which is below the thoracic inlet. Proximal vagal tumours are more easily seen on a chest radiograph than those occurring distally and are therefore more likely to be detected. Symptoms occur only with proximal lesions...|$|R

40|$|The DIII-D tokamak {{has been}} {{operated}} since June 1995 with constrained ohmic heating capability as {{imposed by the}} abandonment of half of it`s solenoid system due to a cooling water leak. The solenoid is comprised of A and B windings with separate multiple power leads to each. The cooling water leak occurred in {{the lead of the}} <b>B</b> <b>winding.</b> This leak occurred in a remote area under the DIII-D vessel and is believed to be caused by magnetic forces developing cyclic bending loads on the conductor. Visual inspection of the lead using flexible bore scopes indicated that the structural fiberglass overwrap intended to band the supply and return leads into a primary-force canceling group had failed allowing individual conductors to become inadequately supported against bending loads. The overwrap failed as a result of poor epoxy encapsulation of the lead which was manufactured in 1978. Inspection of the A lead confirmed no overwrap failure and that the vacuum encapsulation of the A lead was proper and to specification. In order to continue operations, it was decided to abandon the <b>B</b> <b>winding</b> of the solenoid and operate under reduced (5 V-sec) capability. An in-situ repair approach was mandated by the extensive and lengthy effort required to disassemble, repair, and reassemble the tokamak. Access from outside the tokamak was severely limited. A plan to repair the damaged lead was developed and implemented over a 10 month period. This paper describes the repair of the solenoid lead. A VCR video tape of these remote installation efforts has been assembled and will be shown...|$|R

It is recommended to carry out a further study in order to gain more insight into a number of aspects related to the wind turbines' influence on the traffic safety.

40|$|Artículos en revistasThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} the cost of the provision of voltage control by wind power generation. A methodology for evaluating the economic impact of providing different types of voltage control is proposed. This evaluation examines the increase in costs caused by the change in active power losses due to the provision of wind farms voltage control. These losses are computed for different controllers: (a) wind farms are operated at a fixed power factor, (<b>b)</b> <b>wind</b> farms provide proportional voltage control, and (c) wind farms provide reactive power to minimize power losses. Furthermore, these three possibilities are compared with the option of adding flexible alternating current transmission system devices, which are another alternative for supporting the grid by controlling voltage. The methodology outlined is applied to a real and representative Spanish wind harvesting network. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
