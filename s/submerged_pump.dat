The quality of the incomplete gradient can be measured by checking whether it gives a descent direction or not, and also by comparing it to the result of a finite differences method.

The consecutive samples comprised 2 l- 36 segmental catches and each segment covered a horizontal sampling distance of 220 - 400 m. The total wet weight zooplankton biomass for a segmental catch varied from 20 upto 3700 mg/m 3. Local peaks of the biomass were mainly composed of Neocalanus plumchrus of the C 5 stage and Metridia pacifica of varying copepodite stages. The highest individual density of the C 5 of N. plumchrus and adult M. pacifica including the two sexes were 1002 and 1577 inds/m 3, respectively. These species formed local peaks independently from each other. Number of peaks detected was five in M. pacifica and six in N. plunchrus over the whole series. The spatial scales of these aggregations were estimated as 220 - 3700 m for N. plumchrus and 320 - 2900 m for M. pacifica. The average spacing distance between the two adjacent aggregations was approximately 8 km.

40|$|Abstract Motivation There is, at {{the present}} time, no {{submerged}} molasses pump on the market that is designed specifically for cargo tankers. Due to this I, find it interesting {{to look into the}} possibilities of installing a molasses pump in cargo tankers to transport molasses instead of transporting molasses in containers as it is done today. It is challenging {{to come up with a}} new product, and the motivation of actual be able to release a pump for the international marked is indescribable. Problem The goal is to make a prototype of a <b>submerged</b> <b>pump</b> specifically made for pumping molasses that can fulfill the customer requirements for flow and pressure. Obtaining reliable test result and demonstration of the pump is desirable before the new product is set into production. Approach Molasses is a very special and complex cargo, due to the complexity, 8 cdot 10 ^{ 3 }kg of molasses was ordered from Australia. Then it was possible to do several tests on the actual molasses which the current market is for. Different pump designs have to be evaluated and then some design can be put into prototyping. The prototypes needs to go through several test so as much knowledge as possible can be gained before the pump is released on the market. Conclusion There is definitely a large market for transporting molasses by cargo tankers. There are already several orders for a molasses pumping system. Molasses seems to be a more complicated cargo pump then first assumed because of its big variations in viscosity due to temperature and different batches. There are many unknown factors involved in pumping molasses and as further it was dogged in to the problems new ones occurred. But the problems have been solved, some has been hard to solve. After three prototypes the customers requirements were finally achieved, and then all the hard work has finally given result. Even if the pump design is ready for the first order, many new question have arrived and this is the motivation to continue with the process that has already started. Especially interesting is the new technology that will be available next year regarding CFX a motivation factor to keep trying to rise the efficiency. </p...|$|E

It {{is still in}} {{development}} concerning its domain of validity (e. g. molecules sampled, type of water studied, optimal exposure duration) and its performances, including the definition of molecules sampling rates, repeatability, accuracy of the evaluation of time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations. Performance reference compounds (PRCs) enable to decrease the effect of variable environmental conditions, {{so they can be}} used to obtain more reliable TWA concentrations in situ. To our knowledge, for POCIS, only one PRC has been identified to date: deisopropylatrazine-d 5, that has been used and proved efficient for polar herbicides monitoring in freshwater (Mazzella et al., 2007, 2010). In order to obtain in situ TWA contaminant concentrations, POCIS needs to be calibrated in laboratory for each molecule of interest. Our work was based on laboratory calibration of POCIS for 5 alkylphenols, 9 hormones, 12 pesticides, 29 pharmaceuticals, 3 phenols and 1 UV filter in a flow-through system. This system was composed of 2 aquaria (50 L) containing i) spiked tap water (circa 3 μg/L) and non-spiked POCIS for the determination of accumulation kinetics or ii) non-spiked tap water and spiked POCIS for the determination of desorption kinetics. In both experiments, water temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved organic carbon were controlled. Agitation in the aquaria was ensured via a <b>submerged</b> <b>pump.</b> The resulting flow velocity was 10 ± 5 cm/s and was directed perpendicularly towards POCIS surface. Triplicate POCIS were analyzed at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours and at 1, 3, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 28 days. We will present various results depending of molecules such as the duration of linear accumulation phase and sampling rates, sampling repeatability and possible PRCs. As for example, linear accumulation phase for estrogenic hormones seems to be 21 days, since at 28 days the equilibrium regime begins to be reached. For betablockers, linear accumulation phase is shorter: less than 14 days. Sampling rates for this 2 families of compound vary from 0. 058 L/d for sotalol to 0. 537 L/d for 17 -a-estradiol. Concerning the desorption experiments, atenolol-d 7 and sotalol-d 6 for example show a good potential as PRCs. Indeed, a desorption of 70 % for atenolol-d 7 and 50 % for sotalol-d 6 was observed in 24 days...|$|E

We tested the assumption that spatial variations observed for interactions between a highly “aggressive ” coral, Galaxea fascicularis (Linne) and its sub-ordinate neighbors can bc partly explained by hydrodynamic conditions. For several months, we used <b>submerged</b> <b>pumps</b> to expose transplanted corals in situ to intermittently enhanced flow. This manipulation rendered aggression by G. fuscicularis ineffective. Strong currents deflect the aggressor’s tentacles and possibly enhance the rate of tissue recovery in subordinate corals. Observations of naturally occurring pairs of G. fasciculuris and subordinate neighbors indicated that the proportion of cases. in which the subordinate neighbor exhibited damaged margins was significantly lower at sites exposed to strong currents compared with protected reefs. If other aggressive corals arc similarly affected by flow, then at nondisturbed reefs, corals using aggressive strategies should have an advantage at sites characterized by weak flow, whereas fast-growing corals that compete by overtopping their neighbors should be superior at exposed sites. These conclusions agree with observations that the abundance of G. fascicularis and the percentage of unoccupied substratum arc lower at the exposed sites...|$|R

The implementation of <b>submerged</b> dredge <b>pumps</b> and the application of longer and greater number of pipe sections of large diameter resulted in suction pipe constructions which distinguish themselves from traditional constructions by their bigger mass and deviating mass distribution. Given the fact that these characteristics have changed significantly and are features that determine the dynamic motion behaviour of a suction pipe construction, one enters a new field concerning the dynamic behaviour of these constructions. This paper describes a mathematical model, developed at IHC Holland’s R&D institute MTI Holland in co-operation with Delft University of Technology. With this mathematical model one can perform calculations in the frequency domain to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an arbitrary suction pipe construction during the hoisting or lowering operation above the water line. These eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the dynamic motion behaviour of the suction pipe construction. By implementing the motions of the vessel into the model it was furthermore made possible to determine th...|$|R
