5|$|Internet venues {{unrelated}} to medical issues {{have also been}} the audience for such cases. A member of an online fan club for the musical Rent divulged numerous illnesses that caused her to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> and out of comas, prompting some cast members to send sympathy cards. When other fan club members expressed their concern, even purchasing airline tickets to visit the sick woman, she reported that she had immediately improved.|$|E
5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{started the}} season with {{consecutive}} wins, rising {{to the top of}} the table by early October. After a home loss in the Clássico, the team's results became poorer, with three draws and two losses that caused the team to drop to third place by New Year. Benfica continued to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> January, losing the Lisbon derby and twice dropping to fifth place. A home win against Sporting CP for the Portuguese Cup had an apparent positive effect on the players; their best period all season came as they regained first place and opened a six-point lead over the team in second place.|$|E
5|$|In late April, Brown {{still held}} a 20 {{percentage}} point lead {{in public opinion}} polling. However, as Beshear began to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until {{a week before the}} election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign finance reform measures.|$|E

25|$|Peat {{is common}} {{on the islands}} and has {{traditionally}} been exploited as a fuel. Uncontrolled exploitation of this natural resource led to peat <b>slips</b> <b>in</b> 1878 and 1886. The 1878 peat <b>slip</b> resulted <b>in</b> the destruction of several houses, whilst the 1886 peat <b>slip</b> resulted <b>in</b> the deaths of two women {{and the destruction of}} the Exchange Building.|$|R
5|$|After a rest {{day on the}} Sunday of the game, England resumed on Monday with England still 223 runs in arrears. The Nottinghamshire {{secretary}} H. A. Brown broadcast {{an appeal}} to the spectators via the public address system, urging them to refrain from barracking Miller. In response, they clapped when the Australians took to the field. The chairman of Nottinghamshire reportedly apologised to Bradman in private regarding the crowd reaction to Miller. Taking the new ball in the fifth over of the day, in the overcast conditions that morning, Miller bowled a relatively full length, rather than bouncers, and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. Shortly after a break for bad light, he bowled Hutton with an off cutter. This brought in Hardstaff, who was dropped from his third delivery by Arthur Morris at <b>slip.</b> <b>In</b> the remainder of the over, Hardstaff played and missed, then edged two further balls; the second edge went for four runs through the slips. During the morning session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row to pressurise the Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|Littorio {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Ansaldo shipyards in Genoa on 28 October 1934 to commemorate the Fascist Party's March on Rome in 1922. Her sister Vittorio Veneto was laid down the same day. Changes to the design {{and a lack of}} armor plating led to delays in the {{building}} schedule, causing a three-month <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the launch date from the original plan of May 1937. Littorio was launched on 22 August 1937, during a ceremony attended by many Italian dignitaries. She was sponsored by Signora Teresa Ballerino Cabella, the wife on an Ansaldo employee. After her launch, the fitting out period lasted until early 1940. During this time, Littorios bow was modified to lessen vibration and reduce wetness over the bow. Littorio ran a series of sea trials over a period of two months between 23 October 1939 and 21 December 1939. She was commissioned on 6 May 1940, and after running additional trials that month, she transferred to Taranto where shealong with Vittorio Venetojoined the 9th Division under the command of Rear Admiral Carlo Bergamini.|$|E
5|$|After Coates left, the {{orchestra}} reverted to its preferred practice of engaging numerous guest conductors {{rather than a}} single principal conductor. Among the guests were Elgar, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Serge Koussevitzky; soloists in the 1920s included Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Schnabel and the young Yehudi Menuhin. Revenues were substantial, and {{the orchestra}} seemed to many to be entering into a golden age. In fact, for lack of any serious competition in the 1920s, the LSO allowed its standards of playing to <b>slip.</b> <b>In</b> 1927 the Berlin Philharmonic, under Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the poor standards then prevailing in London. Both the BBC and Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between the BBC and Beecham, they went their separate ways. In 1929 the BBC began recruiting for the new BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult. The prospect of joining a permanent, salaried orchestra was attractive enough to induce some LSO players to defect. The new orchestra immediately received enthusiastic reviews that contrasted starkly with the severe press criticisms of the LSO's playing. According to the critic W J Turner the LSO's problem was not that its playing had deteriorated, but that it had failed {{to keep up with}} the considerable improvements in playing achieved over the past two decades by the best European and American orchestras.|$|E
30|$|Thus, the 2010 {{event was}} similar to the {{previous}} long-term Bungo Channel slow <b>slips</b> <b>in</b> terms of both extent and magnitude. This suggests a characteristic slow-slip hypothesis that long-term slow <b>slips</b> <b>in</b> the Bungo Channel occur not only with a quasi-periodicity of 6 to 7 years but also with a similar moment magnitude, slip area, and duration.|$|R

25|$|Efficiency is a {{function}} of power output. A moderate load makes for high efficiency. Too heavy a load increases the <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the turbine and lowers the efficiency; with too light a load, little power is delivered to the output, which also decreases efficiency (to zero at idle). This behaviour is not exclusive to Tesla turbines.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{pretended that}} the {{decision}} had been Geddes’ alone, he let <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the Naval Estimates debate (6 March 1918) {{that he had been}} conveying “the decision of the Government”, i.e. of Lloyd George, who had never put the matter to the War Cabinet. MPs picked up on his slip immediately, and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) admitted in the same debate that he too had had prior knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Hope had no {{faith in}} his skills as a {{dramatic}} actor, and his performances of that type were not as well received. He had {{been a leader in}} radio until the late 1940s, but as his ratings began to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s, he switched to television and became an early pioneer of that medium. And, in keeping with his ever-hectic schedule, he published several books he dictated to ghostwriters about his wartime experiences.|$|E

25|$|When swimming, {{the waves}} become larger {{as they move}} down the snake's body, and the wave travels {{backwards}} faster than the snake moves forwards. Thrust is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed <b>slip.</b> <b>In</b> spite of overall similarities, {{studies show that the}} pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|$|E
25|$|Haughey's grip on {{political}} power began to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> {{the autumn of}} 1991. There {{was a series of}} resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey retired. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting Seán Power, one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who {{went on to win the}} no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{despite some}} probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under Suleiman Baltoghlu could {{not enter the}} Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had {{previously}} stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships managed to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened {{the morale of the}} defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan. Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Michael Lumb and ex-captain John Crawley {{opened for}} the Hawks, the latter departing for a golden duck, caught at second slip by Di Venuto. Zimbabwean Sean Ervine was next in, {{immediately}} edging to second <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> identical fashion leaving Ottis Gibson on a hat-trick. Kevin Pietersen survived that ball, but was soon {{back in the}} pavilion with 12. John Crawley managed a resilient 68 but was bowled by Paul Collingwood who was to finish with 3–33. The rain came down and play was delayed until the following day.|$|E
25|$|Javed Omar was {{the pick}} of the batsmen, scoring 22 before being caught by Marcus Trescothick off the most {{accurate}} of the English bowlers, Simon Jones. With six batsmen out in single figures, only Aftab Ahmed looked in control, before he also edged Andrew Flintoff to <b>slip.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Bangladesh made just 108 in 38.2 overs, despite being boosted by 12 English no-balls – eight from Hoggard, four from Harmison. Few batsmen even displayed the standard practice of getting behind a swinging ball and playing with a straight bat, preferring instead to stay still and nudge at the ball.|$|E
25|$|Gregory Beroza, a seismologist with Stanford University, {{made several}} distinctions {{regarding}} the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event's oblique-slip rupture was at 10km and below on a fault plane that dipped 70° to the southwest. Because {{much of the}} <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.|$|E
60|$|However, {{there came}} a day at last when it <b>slipped</b> <b>in</b> quite easily.

25|$|Cook was a {{prolific}} opening batsman both {{in his native}} South Africa and for Somerset County Cricket Club but South Africa's exclusion from Test cricket cost him a significant Test career. He played in all 19 of South Africa's 'unofficial Test matches' against rebel sides. Aged 39 and having waited two decades for an official Test cap, he edged Kapil Dev's opening ball, a late outswinger, to third <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the First Test between South Africa and India at Durban in November 1992, {{to become the first}} debutant to be dismissed by the first ball of a Test match; Leon Garrick of the West Indies also suffered this fate nine years later.|$|E
25|$|While the team's recent struggles {{compared}} to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be {{partly to blame}} (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s, the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since {{are believed to have}} also seen the team's popularity dipped. The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 June 2007 that an emergency appeal would be started on 25 June {{to raise funds}} for the repair bill. The total cost of the damage was revised upwards as a result of further damage and a massive potential <b>slip</b> <b>in</b> the Northwood Lane area following more rain and flooding in late July. The final repair bill was put at approximately £3.7m; this was funded by an initial grant from the European Regional Development Fund of £750k, a grant from Advantage West Midlands of £500k, £250k from the Heritage Lottery Fund, £1m from the SVR's insurers (£500k for embankments, £350k for structures, signalling and track, and £150k specifically for Borle Viaduct), a further grant of £377k from the ERDF, £560k from the public appeal and the balance from SVR reserves.|$|E
