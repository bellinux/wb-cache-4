25|$|Parnok's {{last great}} love was the Georgian physicist, Nina Vedeneyeva. The two may have met {{as early as}} 1927, through Tsuberbiller, a {{colleague}} of Vedeneyeva. Vedeneyeva's son, Yevgeny, was living in exile {{at that time and}} Tsuberbiller, who had written a textbook used for decades in the high schools of Russia, helped her obtain books for him to maintain his studies. In January, 1932, the relationship turned to romance, despite the facts that Parnok was still living with Tsuberbiller and Yevgeny disapproved of the relationship. As had happened before, her lover became her muse, inspiring her to write two cycles of poems, Ursa Major and Useless Goods. The frantic pace of her writing foretold the exhaustion she would suffer, which hastened her death, but Parnok was aware of the consequences. The references between these last two cycles and Parnok's adolescent poetry, make it clear that she had always known what she wanted to say, but until she reached her maturity, she {{did not know how to}} express her words. Their emotional bond, which accelerated after a trip to Vedeneyeva's <b>summer</b> <b>cottage</b> in Kashin in April, was destined to remain hidden from most of Vedeneyeva's family and friends. To keep up appearance of a mere friendship, they spent their summers apart.|$|E
