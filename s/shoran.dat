25|$|The United Nations again {{attacked}} the Sui-ho hydroelectric complex {{on the night}} of September 12–13, 1952, employing a strike force consisting of flak/searchlight suppression flights of B-26 Invaders and naval aircraft of USS Princeton, an electronic counter-measures flight of four specially modified B-29 Superfortresses to jam Soviet AAA radars and communications, and a bombing force of 25 B-29s of the 19th and 307th Bomb Groups using <b>SHORAN</b> navigation aids to locate the target.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{difficult}} tide and port conditions, the landing succeeded with support of naval tactical air. With United Nations ground forces {{both before and}} behind the North Korean Army, the latter fled northwards. By 22 September the routed North Korean units had lost unit cohesion and become easy targets for tactical air strikes. By 25 September, identification of the enemy from the air became difficult as they scattered. Meanwhile, three detachments of the 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group and the 1st <b>Shoran</b> Beacon Unit arrived in Korea {{with the aim of}} beginning a radar bombing program.|$|E

25|$|A {{strategic}} reconnaissance {{version of}} the B-50B, the RB-50 was developed in 1949 to replace the aging RB-29s used by SAC in its intelligence gathering operations against the Soviet Union. There were three different configurations produced, which were later redesignated RB-50E, RB-50F, and RG-50G respectively. The RB-50E was earmarked for photographic reconnaissance and observation missions; The RB-50F resembled the RB-50E but carried the <b>SHORAN</b> radar navigation system designed to conduct mapping, charting, and geodetic surveys, and {{the mission of the}} RB-50G was electronic reconnaissance. These aircraft were operated primarily by the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. RB-50Es were also operated by the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing as a replacement for RB-29 photographic reconnaissance aircraft flown over North Korea during the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 1951, {{the unit}} was re-designated the 12th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Night Photo. On 25 February, {{eight months after}} the Korean War started, it was {{activated}} at Komaki Air Base, Japan, and assigned to the 67th TRG once more. The 67th TRG was part of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, which had been formed in a reorganization of reconnaissance assets in Fifth Air Force. Personnel and equipment (RB-26s) came from the inactivated Ohio Air National Guard 162d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron which returned to the United States. On 15 March 1951, the unit moved to Taegu Air Base (K-2), South Korea, where the operations section had been located since {{the first part of the}} month. The primary mission of the squadron during the Korean War was to provide the night reconnaissance capability for the wing, both photographic and visual. During hours of darkness, the 12th Squadron was tasked to collect information on enemy activities, to make visual searches and perform route reconnaissance, to perform targeting, and bomb damage assessments, to determine the accuracy of <b>SHORAN</b> coordinates. In emergencies, the 12th was expected to assist the two-day visual and photo recon squadrons.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s and {{continuing}} into the 1980s surplus <b>SHORAN</b> systems had become widely used to provide precision navigation in {{oil and gas exploration}} industry. Companies like pioneer Offshore Navigation, Inc., Navigation Management, Coastal Surveys (based in Singapore) and Western Geophysical deployed <b>SHORAN</b> receivers to navigate seismic survey vessels and position drilling rigs around the world. The technology was key to the successful development of the offshore oil & gas industry in the postwar era. Truck-portable <b>SHORAN</b> transponders and up to 90 ft antennas were set up within a few feet of geodesic survey markers near the coast. <b>SHORAN</b> chains consisting of three or four shore stations were used to provide highly accurate navigation across large exploration tracts and as much as 200 mi offshore. Frequently, the massive vacuum tube transmitters were fitted with solid-state control boxes for more reliable operation and to improve reception of weaker signals over the horizon.|$|E

50|$|During the system's development, Seeley and an RCA manager flew to England to {{describe}} the system to American and British air force personnel. There they observed the Oboe, which could guide only a single aircraft, unlike <b>Shoran</b> which could guide multiple. On the return flight, nearly all information on <b>Shoran</b> was lost in a plane crash, and Seeley was forced to recreate the records from his own memory. He received a Magellanic award {{for his work in}} 1960.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938 RCA {{engineer}} Stuart William Seeley, {{while attempting}} to remove [...] "ghost" [...] signals from an experimental television system, realized that he could measure distances by time differences in radio reception. In summer 1940, Seeley proposed building <b>SHORAN</b> for the Army Air Force. Contract was awarded 9 months later, and <b>SHORAN</b> given its first military flight tests in August 1942. First procurement was spring 1944, with initial combat operations in northern Italy on December 11, 1944.|$|E

50|$|Gee-H {{was adapted}} by RCA into the US wartime <b>SHORAN</b> system with {{improved}} accuracy. The same basic concept remains in widespread use {{today as the}} civilian DME system.|$|E
50|$|<b>SHORAN,</b> which {{operates}} at 300 MHz, requires an airborne AN/APN-3 set and two AN/CPN-2 or 2A ground stations. The {{equipment on board}} the aircraft includes a transmitter, a receiver, an operator's console and a K-1A model bombing computer. The transmitter sends pulses {{to one of the}} ground stations and the system calculates the range in statute miles by clocking the elapsed time between transmitter pulse and the returned signal. The system was intended for use in navigation, but it became obvious that it would work well for blind targeting during bombing runs in poor visibility. The setup made up of the K-1A bombing computer combined with the navigation system was the first <b>SHORAN.</b> The <b>SHORAN</b> system is designed so that as the aircraft faces the target, the low-frequency station should be on the left, and the high-frequency station is on the right. This allows the computer to triangulate the two stations and the target.|$|E
50|$|Little new top-of-the-line {{technology}} {{was used in}} Korea, but <b>SHORAN</b> was an exception. B-26 planes were first equipped with the system in January, 1951, and first carried it into battle the following month.|$|E
5000|$|Seeley {{received}} the 1948 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award [...] "for his development of ingenious circuits related to frequency modulation", and the 1960 Magellanic Premium from the American Philosophical Society for <b>Shoran.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although <b>SHORAN</b> {{was used}} by the {{military}} only briefly, surplus equipment soon found a new use in the oil and gas industry, where it was used to position ships with high accuracy for seismic measurements.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately, an {{identical}} set of longitude-latitude four-corner limits {{has been identified}} in the 1907 geography by Tokunaga Isamijo's (德永勲美) Kankoku <b>Shoran</b> (韓國總覽; 한국총람) where the real geographical locations are given beside the abstract so-called four corners figures.|$|E
50|$|McDonald {{is the son}} of <b>Shoran</b> and Dale McDonald, {{with four}} {{siblings}} named Curtis, Sheldon, Monair, and Datia. McDonald and his family moved to the United States and to Roosevelt from Saint Catherine Parish in Jamaica when he was 11.|$|E
5000|$|<b>SHORAN</b> used {{ground-based}} transponders {{to respond}} to interrogation signals sent from the bomber aircraft. By measuring the round-trip time to and {{from one of the}} transponders, the distance to that ground station could be accurately determined. The aircraft flew an arcing path that kept it at a predetermined distance from one of the stations. The distance to a second station was also being measured, and when it reached a predetermined distance from that station as well, the bombs were dropped. The basic idea was similar to the Oboe system developed by the Royal Air Force, but in Oboe the transponder was on the aircraft. This limited Oboe to guiding a single aircraft per ground station, while <b>SHORAN</b> could guide dozens, limited only by how rapidity the ground station's transponders could respond.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{were made}} and by June 1951 ground {{stations}} were located in more useful areas, such as islands and mountaintops, and training of operators and technicians familiarized them with the system. By November 1952 these changes had developed <b>SHORAN</b> into a reliable accurate blind-bombing system which was used by B-29 and B-26 aircraft {{for the remainder of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|<b>SHORAN</b> is {{an acronym}} for SHOrt RAnge Navigation, a type of {{electronic}} navigation and bombing system using a precision radar beacon. It was developed during World War II and the first stations were being set up in Europe when the war ended. It saw its first combat use in the B-26 and B-29 bomber aircraft during the Korean War.|$|E
50|$|<b>SHORAN</b> {{was sent}} into combat {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the MiG-15 over Korea, which drove the B-29's from daylight combat in June 1951. Night operations were not very productive and the US Air Force became interested in any way to improve their results. The system was in place and the crews trained by November 1952, and <b>SHORAN</b> remained in use from then {{until the end of the}} war. It was particularly effective during early 1953 when the North Korean Air Force began to re-equip in case a new offense opened. B-29's began the campaign, but only a dozen aircraft were available, so they were soon supplanted by B-26s to maintain constant bombing of the airfields. The possible offensive never occurred; the armistice was signed in July. It was not used after that point, due to Strategic Air Command's increasing focus on long-range bombing with nuclear weapons.|$|E
