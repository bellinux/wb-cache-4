2500|$|Soundgarden {{frontman}} Chris Cornell, who {{had been}} Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood's roommate, approached former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament about working on material he had written {{when he was on}} tour with Soundgarden in Europe. The line-up eventually included Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomers Mike McCready (lead guitar) and Eddie Vedder (background vocals). McCready and Vedder were featured on the album due to their involvement with Ament and Gossard's next project, which became Pearl Jam. [...] The name Temple of the Dog is derived from the opening lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song [...] "Man of Golden Words", [...] "I want to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something,</b> like joy inside my heart, seems I been living in the temple of the dog".|$|E

6000|$|... --Here you are, says Alf, {{chucking}} out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{you never}} saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not vexed," [...] said Eric, [...] "and I {{think you}} will take it some day yet--after I have <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> I want <b>you</b> to see. Never mind about your looks, Kilmeny. Beauty isn't everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait, I would <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>something,</b> that no tittle of my crime may {{be hidden}} from thee. Do thou, oh Holly, open the garment on the breast {{of the dead}} Kallikrates, for perchance my lord may fear to touch it himself." ...|$|R
5000|$|James Smart of The Guardian {{wrote that}} [...] "This ambitious graphic novel pulls {{you to the}} chest of the world's latest superpower, <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of what it has gained and lost, and lets you go, 60 years later, drained and {{intrigued}} and feeling as though you know China's great, tangled present a little bit better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get 'em {{out here}} in the open, an' I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Lemme hide back o' you peoples, so's they won't see what I'm at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fool you? But no. I do but wish to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> that I {{learned in}} Italy. Tell {{me how you}} slew him, Monsieur le Capitaine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get 'em {{out here}} in the open, an' I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> Lemme hide back o' you peoples, so 's they won't see what I'm at." ...|$|E
60|$|But now, {{that the}} former things may be further made to appear--that is, what the sad {{condition}} of all them that are under the law is, as I have <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{of the nature of}} the law, so also shall I show that the law was added and given for this purpose, that it might be so with those that are out of the Covenant of Grace.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the family}} where Christiana was {{saw that they}} had a purpose to go forward, they called the whole house together, to give thanks to their King for sending of them such {{profitable}} guests as these. Which done, they said unto Christiana, [...] "And shall we not <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>something,</b> according, as our custom is to do to pilgrims, on which thou mayest meditate when thou art upon the way?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Another speaker {{laughs at}} your accent and compares {{you to a}} {{character}} in a humorous TV <b>show</b> (although <b>you</b> had <b>something</b> important to say).|$|R
6000|$|The Prioress was amused. 'Art dazed, my friend? This {{is but a}} {{poor country}} cell; we will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> much finer {{when we get to}} Derby.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, pretty lady," [...] said I to myself, [...] "we {{shall see}} if {{presently}} your lip will curl when I <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of my wizard's art." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will go no farther," [...] {{said the}} false uncle. [...] "I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> wonderful; {{only do you}} gather up sticks while I kindle a fire." ...|$|E
60|$|I have, as thou by {{this little}} book mayest see, adventured, at this time, {{to do my}} {{endeavour}} to <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>something</b> of the gospel-glory of Solomon's temple: that is, of what it, with its utensils, was a type of; and, as such, how instructing it was to our fathers, and also is to us their children. The which, that I might do the more distinctly, I have handled particulars one by one, {{to the number of}} threescore and ten; namely, all that of them I could call to mind; because, as I believe, there was not one of them but had its signification, and so something profitable for us to know.|$|R
50|$|YIPL {{believes}} that education alone cannot affect the System, but {{education can be}} an invaluable tool for those willing to use it. Specifically, YIPL will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> why <b>something</b> must be done immediately in regard, of course, to the improper control of the communication in this country {{by none other than}} bell telephone company.|$|R
5000|$|Yet it is {{impossible}} to find a narrative in their photography,and for good reason. [...] "They're mute, they don't have anynarrative ability at all, <b>you</b> know what <b>something</b> looked like,but <b>you</b> don't know what's happening ... there isn't a photographin the world that has any narrative ability, any of them. ...Theydo not tell stories -- they <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what <b>something</b> lookslike. To a camera." [...] bluntly stated by Garry Winogrand about his own photography.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you've got the agent's receipt, and {{the rest}} is not my business. Sit tight, and we'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> very like flying to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Second, I shall now <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> {{of what it}} is for Christ, by his intercession, to save to the 'uttermost.' 'He is able to {{save them}} to the uttermost.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> worth," [...] said Poney. [...] "When the Purple Emperor ain't on time, it's {{about time}} {{to amend the}} Constitution. The first stroke of twelve is--" ...|$|E

60|$|When {{the family}} where Christiana was, {{saw that they}} had a purpose to go forward, they called the whole house together, to give thanks to their King for sending of them such {{profitable}} guests as these. Which done, they said to Christiana, And shall we not <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>something,</b> according as our custom is to do to pilgrims, on which thou mayest meditate when thou art upon the way? So they took Christiana, her children, and Mercy, into the closet, and showed them one of the apples that Eve did eat of, and that she also did give to her husband, and that for the eating, of which they both were turned out of Paradise; and asked her what she thought that was? Then Christiana said, It is food or poison, I know not which.[161] So they opened the matter to her, and she held up her hands and wondered[162] (Gen. 3:6; Rom. 7:24).|$|R
6000|$|... "Study! I'm {{ready to}} begin right off," [...] {{answered}} Walter, earnestly. [...] "I'm just crazy to get at that gun you pointed out to me. Can't <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me <b>something</b> to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} hard to understand," [...] said his father. [...] "But I {{can make an}} {{experiment}} with a string, when we get home, that will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is one of {{the matters}} of which we will speak at a quarter to twelve. Meanwhile, let me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something.</b> It may amuse you as it has done me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I you. And as a {{proof of}} it I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> fine to see. Usually when I go I merely vanish; but now I will {{dissolve}} myself {{and let you}} see me do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Weekend Update co-anchor Jane Curtin would interrupt, saying, [...] "Roseanne, you're {{making me}} sick." [...] Curtin would then ask Roseannadanna what her {{comments}} {{had to do}} with the question. Radner would reply: [...] "Well, Jane, it just goes to <b>show</b> <b>you,</b> it's always <b>something</b> â€” if it ain't one thing, it's another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I didn't {{know you}} didn't write it," [...] faltered the porter. [...] "I axed the man where you was {{and he said}} you was visitin' his house and wanted to <b>show</b> him <b>something</b> <b>you</b> had in the case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see you'll {{have to be}} convinced. Very well; in {{the first}} place, the man would have stuck at nothing, and I've already tried to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that he'd <b>something</b> to gain by Benson's death." [...] He turned to the latter. [...] "I {{suspected}} when we took you away from him that you were running a risk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] Saton answered. [...] "But I {{warn you}} that {{if the person is}} one unknown to Lady Marrabel or myself, I cannot tell you who it was. All that I can do is perhaps to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> of how the thing was done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish," [...] {{his host}} replied, rising {{to his feet}} and strolling across the room. [...] "You know the whole trouble of the prosecution. They couldn't {{discover}} the weapon, or anything like it, with which the deed was done. Now I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> ingenious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say," [...] I answered, [...] "at {{least in}} words. But," [...] I added after reflection, [...] "as {{you ask for}} a token, perhaps I {{might be able to}} <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> that would bring proof to your heart, if there were any secret place----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's healed very well. I {{like the}} gold lace {{and the white}} glove resting, with quite a nice awkwardness, on the sword. When I {{was a little boy}} I wanted to wear clothes like that. And the stars! He's got the V. C. Most of these people here have at any rate <b>shown</b> pluck, <b>you</b> know--brought <b>something</b> off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{there it}} is--there's nothing like life!" [...] said his companion. [...] "When you're finished, {{squeezed}} dry and used {{up and you}} think the sack's empty, you're still appealed to, you still get touches and thrills, the idea springs up--out of the lap of the actual--and <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> there's always <b>something</b> to be done.

6000|$|... "I don't complain, Mr. Morris, of {{the hard}} things said of me in that letter; you are at liberty to suppose, if you like, that I deserve them. Attribute it to pride, or {{attribute}} it to reluctance to make needless demands on your time--I shall not attempt to defend myself. I leave you {{to decide whether the}} woman who has <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> that letter--having <b>something</b> important to say to you--is a person who is mean enough to say it under false pretenses." ...|$|R
