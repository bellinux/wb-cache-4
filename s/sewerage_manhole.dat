5000|$|Cameron {{served as}} Bossier City police chief. At {{the time of}} his {{election}} as mayor on May 16, 1957, he was the chief Bossier Parish deputy tax assessor. He succeeded the one-term mayor, Burgess McCranie, who was also a former police chief. Under Mayor Cameron, the city completed a master plan for orderly growth, a railroad underpass on Hamilton Road, and the municipal water plant. Cameron said that he tried to meet individual constituent needs as mayor. He recalled a woman who ran over a <b>sewerage</b> <b>manhole</b> that a city employee had accidentally left uncovered. When Cameron called the city insurance agent to request a new tire for the motorist, the agent balked at covering the expense. [...] "At first the insurance company wasn’t going to buy a new tire, but I said, 'Well, if she doesn't get a new tire, the first thing Monday morning, we’ll have a new insurance agent.' The agent said, 'Mayor, send that lady right down.'" [...] Cameron predicted that Bossier City would grow [...] "by leaps and bounds" [...] in population as well as attracting business and investment.|$|E

Since the major loss in the pipe is friction, {{it is possible to}} neglect energy losses while designing sewer systems with free surface flow, but under the pressurized condition, the energy losses may exceed the friction losses and reduce system capacity significantly, thus it is needed to consider the energy losses. Basically one-dimensional model is used to simulate <b>sewerage</b> system involving <b>manholes</b> and junctions with pipe configuration for calculating time and capacity efficiency although the head losses caused by manhole and pipe configuration are not one-dimensional (1 D) phenomena. It causes problems that non 1 D phenomena are artificially treated as one-dimensional. Therefore it is necessary to develop the model which can reflect the head losses depending on the pipe configuration and manhole shapes. In order to develop the simulation model, the fundamental laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate the effects of head loss depending on different manhole shapes with no benching and no invert. First, straight case experiments were conducted to evaluate the head loss for circular and square type manhole shape under the unsteady-state as well as steady-state condition and then numerical simulation model was developed and validated to confirm an applicability of the model using head loss coefficients obtained from laboratory experiments...|$|R
