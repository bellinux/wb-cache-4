40|$|Standardization of Working Time at Cocoa Processing Unit, Rimbun Cooperative, Pidie Jaya ABSTRACT. Rimbun Cooperative is a {{business}} unit operating a chocolate factory producing several chocolate products such as cocoa fat, cocoa powder, 3 in 1 instant drinks (sachets), and chocolate bars. This research aims to measure <b>standard</b> <b>times</b> of operators in all working stations of the chocolate factory. These standards comprised the standards in roasting, peeling, pasting, pressing, powdering, powder sieving, powder mixing, dough mixing, refining, and chonching working stations. The data were directly collected using Time Study method with Stop Watch. The samples were randomly selected with five (5) repetitions; and the <b>standard</b> <b>times</b> were measured using Westinghouse Method to quantify performance and allowance factors. The result shows that <b>standard</b> <b>times</b> of operators in each working station are as follows: roasting (36 minutes), peeling (193 minutes), pasting (276 minutes), pressing (78 minutes), powdering (17 minutes), powder sieving (14 minutes), powder mixing (36 minutes), dough mixing (17 minutes), refining (30 minutes), and chonching (30 minutes). In peeling, pasting, powdering, powder sieving working stations, <b>standard</b> <b>times</b> of operators cannot be separated with working times of machines because the operators are required to run the machines (sequence). In general, <b>standard</b> <b>times</b> of operators, after calculation, are larger than direct records because during the working times, operators would not or could not use allowance factors for personal uses, such as for going to bathroom, drinking, and socializing with their colleagues as means to reduce stress or boredom...|$|R
5|$|After {{entering}} the central Pacific, John left the area {{monitored by the}} NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As it moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on 22 August John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii <b>Standard</b> <b>Time)</b> reached its peak winds of 175 miles per hour (280 km/h). Also on August 22 (by Hawaii <b>Standard</b> <b>Time),</b> John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.|$|E

5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as summer time in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.

Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of publicly available information for several months after the disappearance.
