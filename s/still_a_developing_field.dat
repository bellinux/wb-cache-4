In this philosophy, mitigation and adaptation strategies ought to be appropriate to the sectors and communities that are targeted. There is a growing realisation that the effectiveness of both strategies hinges on climate governance, which also informs their sustainability. The application of the climate governance concept by the technocratic divide (policymakers and climate practitioners) to communities facing climate change impacts, however, is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> poorly <b>developed</b> <b>field,</b> despite extensive treatment by academia. By drawing heavily from conceptual and analytical review of scholarship on the utility of indigenous knowledge (IK) in climate science, these authors argue that IK can be deployed {{in the practice of}} climate governance.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to invigorate the participation of communities, with their IK, in designing climate change interventions, which in this view can be a means to attain the objectives of climate governance...|$|R

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) {{represent}} {{one of the}} most interesting progenitors to date, due to their biodiverse functionalities. Among the fascinating multiple properties of MSC are their supportive roles in wound healing and in the regen- eration of damaged tissues and organs. This implies the capacity of MSC to migrate towards injured tissue, to undergo differentiation, to modulate the acti- vation of immune cells and to activate endothelial cells contributing to both angiogenesis and neo-vascularisation. Together with their self-renewal capability, the maintenance of stem cell homeostasis, the release of several bioactive com- pounds like chemokines, cytokines, micro RNAs and exosomes, MSC can be certainly considered as cellular all-round supporters. These multi-functional MSC properties are highlighted in the present volume. While some chapters are focused on differentiation capacities of MSC, even beyond the more consolidated mesodermal lineages, others provide novel insights into the stimulatory signals involved in MSC survival and trafficking. Moreover, the MSC role in regulating cancer progression for novel therapeutics is assessed. In-depth molecular analyses of MSC functions are also covered, additionally including initial characterisations of distinct proteomic patterns that are specific for discrete MSC populations. Technical aspects for the isolation and enrichment of selected MSC populations are here additionally addressed in relationship to new cell sources and in the attempt to open new therapeutic platforms for potential clinical applications.

Failing to provide a feasible implementation of identity based encryption (IBE), Shamir <b>developed</b> <b>a</b> signature scheme, whereby signatures can be verified by publicly available information such as signer's identity. Since the first efficient implementation of IBE realized using pairing operation on elliptic curves due to Boneh and Franklin a plethora of papers has been published and many {{studies have been conducted}} covering different aspects of pairing-based cryptography. Today, pairing is used in many cryptographic applications including, identity based cryptography, key exchange protocols, short signatures, anonymous signatures and in many other newly emerging protocols and schemes. Also, pairing is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> research <b>field</b> yielding important challenges for the research community. Pairing computation involves fairly complicated operations compared to classical symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems. Multitudes of pairing types have been proposed after its first appearance in the literature. Also, each of them involves selection of many parameters such as the choice of the underlying field and its characteristics, order of the embedding degree, type of the elliptic curve etc. Therefore, different types of optimisations are possible rendering selection process extremely difficult. Because of the abundance of choices, for an efficient pairing implementation many criteria have to be examined. For instance, selection of pairing type, construction of finite fields and elliptic curves, coordinate systems to represent points on the curve and algorithms and architecture for arithmetic operations play a crucial role on the performance of the specific implementation of the pairing-based cryptography. A multitude of implementations regarding to pairing-based cryptography have been proposed in the literature. However, most of them are software realizations; the reason being is the complexity of the overall system. Some hardware implementations have already been proposed, but most of them are very specific, therefore lacks flexibility and scalability. Due to the complexity of the system, some researches advice to use dedicated implementations for specific set of parameters even in software, limiting the flexibility of the implementation further. In this thesis, we propose a very generic, flexible and compact hardware coprocessor for all kinds of pairing implementations intended for implementation on reconfigurable devices (e. g. FPGA). Our co-processor supports all types of pairing operations with different parameter classes via making use of highly-optimized hardware implementations of basic arithmetic operations common not only to pairing operations, but also to elliptic curve cryptography and other public key cryptography algorithms. Our design utilizes the idea of hardware-software co-design concept. To accelerate pairing computation we implement some units responsible for performing the most time-consuming operations as a generic, but highly optimized hardware circuits, whereas we prefer to implement some complex parts (unworthy of hardware resources) in low-level software of micro-instructions. Although we use two arithmetic cores running concurrently, our design still manages to be compact thanks to its careful and generic design...|$|R

However, multiple-camera tracking is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>developing</b> <b>field.</b> Surveillance products that can be produced with multiple video cameras include camera cueing, wide-area traffic analysis, tracking {{in the presence of}} occlusions, and tracking with in-scene entrances. All of these products require solving the consistent labelling problem. This means giving the same meta-target tracking label to all projections of a realworld target in the various cameras. This thesis covers the implementation and testing of a multiple-camera peopletracking algorithm. First, a shape-matching single-camera tracking algorithm was partially re-implemented so that it worked on test videos. The outputs of the single-camera trackers are the inputs of the multiple-camera tracker. The algorithm finds the feet feature of each target: a pixel corresponding to a point on a ground plane directly below the target. Field of view lines are found and used to create initial meta-target associations. Meta-targets then drop a series of markers as they move, and from these a homography is calculated. The homographybased tracker then refines the list of meta-targets and creates new meta-targets as required. Testing shows that the algorithm solves the consistent labelling problem and requires few edge events as part of the learning process. The homography-based matcher was shown to completely overcome partial and full target occlusions in one of a pair of cameras...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Epigenetics has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} potential mechanism by which adverse environmental stimuli can result in persistent changes in gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms function alongside the DNA sequence to modulate gene expression and ultimately influence protein production. The current review provides an introduction and overview of epigenetics with a particular focus on preclinical and clinical studies relevant to major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were interrogated from January 1995 up to December 2012 using combinations of search terms, including "epigenetic", "microRNA" and "DNA methylation" cross referenced with "depression", "early life stress" and "antidepressant". Results: There is an association between adverse environmental stimuli, such as early life stress, and epigenetic modification of gene expression. Epigenetic changes {{have been reported in}} humans with MDD and may serve as biomarkers to improve diagnosis. Antidepressant treatments appear to reverse or initiate compensatory epigenetic alterations that may be relevant to their mechanism of action. Limitations: As a narrative review, the current report was interpretive and qualitative in nature.

Interestingly, very little attention {{was given to}} protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), the counterparts to protein tyrosine kinases, {{in the development of}} asthma. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that pharmacological inhibition of PTPs induced a transient Th 1 response in the spleen. Therefore, we hypothesized that modulation of PTPs could influence asthma development. To assess PTP functions, we used the PTP inhibitor bis-peroxovanadium bpV(phen) in a murine model of asthma during either allergen sensitization or challenge. Inhibition of PTPs during allergen sensitization resulted in the reduction of key features of allergic asthma: serum IgE levels, lung tissue inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Of utmost interest, PTP inhibition at allergen challenge resulted in a very similar improvement of asthmatic features. Of further importance, we observed that bpV(phen) treatment modulated cytokine expression in the spleen and, more specifically, favored Th 1 cytokines while inhibiting Th 2 cytokines. Collectively, we show {{for the first time that}} intact activity of PTPs is required for a complete induction of asthma in a mouse model. This clearly suggests that PTPs have a pivotal regulatory role in the development of asthmatic diseases, which opens the possibility of new therapeutic avenues...|$|E

40|$|Prominent {{cognitive}} theories {{propose that}} attention biases {{play a central}} causal role in the onset and maintenance of emotional disorders (i. e., Beck, 1976). With {{the development of a}} procedure to experimentally manipulate selective attention (Attention Bias Modification; ABM; MacLeod et al., 2002), this causal status has been established empirically. Over the last 10 years, 35 studies on ABM have supported the view that attention biases contribute to emotional vulnerability and cannot be considered a mere by-product of emotional disorders. The ABM is designed to experimentally modify attention biases through repeated practice of computerized cognitive tasks. Many research groups show that the ABM procedure effectively modifies attention biases within not more than a single session of about 20 minutes. This change eventually leads to a congruent variation of emotional vulnerability. Clinically relevant, multisession ABM intervention can reduce emotional symptoms, with an effect size comparable to existent validated treatments of general anxiety, social phobia, depression, or alcohol abuse. Interestingly, the benefits of ABM prove to be stable for at least 4 months. The value of ABM was recognized in a recent article in The Economist (Mar 3 rd 2011, Therapist-free therapy: Cognitive-bias modification may put the psychiatrist's couch out of business).
