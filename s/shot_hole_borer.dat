50|$|The first clade proposed, E. fornicatus {{sensu stricto}} (commonly called the tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer),</b> is {{original}} from southern Southeast Asia and was introduced into Hawaii and Florida. A second clade, the Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> {{is believed to}} have originated in the Pacific islands and has since been introduced into San Diego county, California. The third clade is thought to originate from a more northern range in Southeast Asia and to have since been introduced into Los Angeles, California and Israel. This last clade has been given the common name Polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> in reference to the very broad host range. It has been severely affecting avocado trees in association with several Fusarium species. Multiple populations of the E. fornicatus complex have been introduced throughout the world, causing different damage in each region where they have been recently introduced.|$|E
50|$|Euwallacea fornicatus, {{commonly}} known as the tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> is an invasive ambrosia beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae: Xyleborini) that causes economic losses when introduced into a new region. As the rest of the ambrosia beetles, E. fornicatus larvae and adults feed on a symbiotic fungus carried in a specific structure called mycangium. In E. fornicatus, the mycangium is located in the mandible. The combination of massive numbers of beetles with the symbiotic fungus kill trees, even though the fungus alone is a weak pathogen.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the disease}} {{is caused by a}} {{relatively}} new symbiosis, it has already spread to a number of different counties, and is completely wiping out oak trees. As mentioned before, this is partially due to disease symptoms that are similar to other diseases leading to a misdiagnosis, it most resembles bacterial wetwood, polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (PSHB), and fusarium dieback. With the recent outbreak and growth in population of the western bark beetle, there is concern that the pathogen's range will expand. Oak trees are important for wildlife diversity and for the ecological services they provide like habitat, shelter and food.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease (also called Coryneum blight) is {{a serious}} fungal disease that creates BB-sized holes in leaves, rough areas on fruit, and {{concentric}} lesions on branches. The pathogen that causes <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> disease is Wilsonomyces carpophilus.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the next}} several weeks, non-Bt cornfields should be scouted for European corn borers. If populations do exceed the {{economic}} threshold, treatment is warranted to prevent substantial yield loss. Scouting should start in the tallest cornfields because adults (moths) are often attracted to these fields in larger numbers. Look for <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> in the leaves after corn reaches 17 to 21 inches in extended leaf height. When <b>shot</b> <b>holes</b> or larvae {{are found in the}} taller corn, scout fields with smaller corn.

50|$|The tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> {{has been}} known to cause devastating damage to tea (Camelia sinesis) in at least ten {{different}} countries, including India and Sri Lanka where it is a major economic pest. In 2009, specimens matching the description for E. fornicatus were introduced into Israel, where they were documented as vectors of a new fungal plant pathogen in avocado trees. In 2012, similar fungal disease was recorded in avocado trees in California (CA). Since 2007, specimens of E. fornicatus have been documented in Florida on avocado trees. However, it is not considered a health threat because no disease is expressed.|$|E
50|$|Tree injection, {{also known}} as trunk or stem injection, is a method of target precise {{application}} of pesticides, plant resistance activators, and fertilizers into the xylem vascular tissue of a tree {{with the purpose of}} protecting the tree from pests or nutrition for correction of nutrient deficiencies. This method largely relies on harnessing the treeâ€™s vascular system to translocate and distribute the active compounds into the wood, canopy and roots where protection or nutrition is needed. Tree injection is currently the most popular method for control of damaging insects, pathogens, and nematodes in landscape tree care. It has been developed primarily for use on large size trees and in proximity of urban areas where ground- and air-spray applications are impractical due to substantial drift-driven pesticide losses or not allowed due to potential human exposure. However, the prime driver of tree injection use has been a wide spread need for control of many invasive tree pathogens and insects pests. The most infamous examples are that of Ophiostoma fungi that cause Dutch Elm Disease (DED) and insect Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) which have specific biologies that lead to severe internal damage of wood and thus tree death, and which make their management extremely difficult or inefficient with classical pesticide application methods. Trunk injection for tree protection is viewed as environmentally safer alternative for pesticide application since the compound is delivered within the tree, thus allowing for selective exposure to plant pests. In landscapes and urban zones trunk injection significantly reduces the non-target exposure of water, soil, air, and wildlife to pesticides and fertilizers. In the last 20 years, tree injection is gaining momentum with the development and availability of new, efficient injection devices and injectable and xylem mobile formulations of pesticides, biopesticides and nutrients. Further, a number of newly occurring and fast spreading invasive insect pests and diseases such as Polyphagous <b>Shot</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>Borer</b> (PSHB) Euwallacea, which vectors plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae, and Sudden Oak Death (SOD) caused by an Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum, establish the use of trunk injection as the most efficient tree protection technique in landscapes and urban forestry.|$|E
40|$|The {{polyphagous}} <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> and Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> {{two members}} of the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), are invasive ambrosia beetles that harbor distinct species of Fusarium fungal symbionts. Together with the damage caused by gallery construction, these two phytopathogenic Fusarium species are responsible for the emerging tree disease Fusarium dieback, which affects over 50 common tree species in Southern California. Host trees suffer branch dieback as the xylem is blocked by invading beetles and fungi, forcing the costly removal of dead and dying trees in urban areas. The beetles are also threatening natural riparian habitats, and avocado is susceptible to Fusarium dieback as well, resulting in damage to the avocado industries in California and Israel. Currently there are no adequate control mechanisms for shot hole borers. This paper summarizes efforts to find a suitable lure to monitor <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> invasions and dispersal. Field trials were conducted in two counties in Southern California over a span of two years. We find that the chemical quercivorol is highly attractive to these beetles, and perform subsequent field experiments attempting to optimize this lure. We also explore other methods of increasing trap catch and effects of other potential attractants, as well as the deterrents verbenone and piperitone...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{eruption}} of a pernicious insect known as the <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea fornicatus). This pest is {{a major threat to}} the agricultural stability in Southern California. A plant pathogenic fungus is vectored by the borer. The fungus, Fusarium sp., clogs the tree's vascular system, causing dieback in the outer branches. Avocados (Persea americana), one of California's premium crops, are threatened by the <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> and associated fungus. The tree itself is not likely to survive the infestation. Other known hosts of the insect include Castor Bean (Ricinus communis), American Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), California Sycamore (Plantanus racemosa), and Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia); all of which are part of the campus flora and therefore, possible hosts. Our campus serves as a "living laboratory" for pests and disease issues that affect agriculture in Southern California. Being a major agricultural university, Cal Poly Pomona has several plots of trees prone to attack from the <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> and its affiliated fungus. In order to discover the range and severity of potential infected plants, a campus survey needed to be conducted. Using the iPad application, ArcGIS by Esri, and the information from a compiled database of Cal Poly flora, I was able to specifically inspect trees of a known host range. I subsequently surveyed the Cal Poly campus in search of symptoms of the fungus and beetle on proven hosts. The results reveled two main areas where the host population is over 50 % infected...|$|E
40|$|Three cryptic {{species in}} the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex were reared in {{laboratory}} colonies and investigated {{for the presence of}} pheromones. Collections of volatiles from combinations of diet, fungus, beetles, and galleries from polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp. # 1) revealed the presence of 2 -heneicosanone and 2 -tricosanone only in the presence of beetles, regardless of sex. Subsequent examination of volatiles from the other two species, tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp. # 2) and Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp. # 5), revealed these two ketones were present in all three species but in different ratios. In dual choice olfactometer behavioral bioassays, mature mated females were strongly attracted to a synthetic binary blend of ketones matching their own natural ratios. However, females in each species were repelled by ketone blends in ratios corresponding to the other two species. Males of each species responded similarly to females when presented with ratios matching their own or the other two species. The presence of these compounds in the three beetle species, in ratios unique to each species, and their strong species-specific attraction and repellency, suggests they are pheromones. The ecological function of these pheromones is discussed. In addition to the pheromones, the previously known attractant (1 S, 4 R) -p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol (also known as quercivorol) was discovered {{in the presence of the}} fungal symbionts, but not in association with the beetles. Quercivorol was tested in a dual-choice olfactometer and was strongly attractive to all three species. This evidence suggests quercivorol functions as a kairomone for members of the E. fornicatus species complex, likely produced by the symbiotic fungi...|$|E

40|$|The {{invasive}} {{ambrosia beetle}} species polyphagous <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer</b> (Euwallacea sp., PSHB) and its ambrosial fungal associates {{have been studied}} extensively since the beetleâ€™s discovery in the Los Angeles County in 2012. Another closely related ambrosia beetle species has been discovered in San Diego County (Kuroshio <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> KSHB), and the ambrosial fungal associates of this beetle species {{have been found to}} be distinct from the related fungal associates of PSHB, Fusarium euwallaceae and Graphium euwallaceae.

F. kuroshium was also found to differ in morphology and symptom severity compared to F. euwallaceae, while G. kuroshium was not found to differ from G. euwallaceae in morphology or symptom severity. The results of this study suggest that the KSHB-associated F. kuroshium and G. kuroshium are novel fungal associates of KSHB. A method to inhibit the Fusarium ambrosial fungi of PSHB and KSHB using plant-endophytic bacteria was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained from the wood tissues of avocado (Persea americana) and California sycamore (Platanus racemosa), and were identified using molecular identification methods. These bacteria were simultaneously cultured with F. euwallaceae in order to screen for endophytic bacteria with the ability to inhibit the Fusarium ambrosial fungi. 15 bacterial isolates were found to inhibit F. euwallaceae during the screen. Inhibition efficacies of the bacterial endophytes were calculated for both Fusarium associates of PSHB and KSHB as percent inhibition, and 4 Bacterial isolates that showed the highest percent inhibition were chosen to be used as injection treatments in the greenhouse in vivo study. In greenhouse, stems of avocado and California sycamore were bacterized using the endophytic bacteria then challenged with F. euwallaceae or F. kuroshium. The sizes of fungal lesions resulting from the Fusarium infection were measured then compared. The results showed that the endophytic bacteria had significant effects in the sizes of lesions, and bacteria were only recovered from bacterized plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{polyphagous}} <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> Euwallacea sp., and Fusarium euwallaceae, {{a fungus}} it carries, are an exotic pest complex causing dieback and mortality to numerous native and ornamental hardwood {{trees and shrubs}} in southern California. The ambrosia beetle carries several symbiotic fungi, including Fusarium euwallaceae which was newly identified as a species associated with recent tree dieback symptoms. Injury occurs when the ambrosia beetle bores into a tree to create tunnels (galleries) for its eggs and larvae and, in the process, inoculates the tunnels with its symbiotic fungi that subsequently clog the surrounding water conducting tissue, or xylem. These pests in combination have killed several hardwood species in urban areas and on National Forest lands. This ambrosia beetle attacks over 20 species as hosts, including bigleaf maple, Acer macrophyllum, California box elder, Acer negundo var. californicum, California sycamore, Platanus racemosa, coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, castorbean, Ricinus communis, red willow, Salix laevigata, valley oak, Q. lobata, and white alder, Alnus rhombifolia, {{all of which are}} found on public land. The large number of hosts increases the likelihood that this pest complex could spread to other areas. Identification Adults are oval in shape and brown to black in color. Adult females are approximately 2. 62 (Â± 0. 02) (mean (Â±s. e.) mm long and 1. 07 (Â± 0. 02) mm wide (Fig. 1) while adult males are smaller (approximately 1. 80 (Â± 0. 02) mm long and 0. 81 (Â± 0. 02) mm wide).

40|$|The tea shot-hole borer, Euwallacea fornicatus Eichhoff, is an {{ambrosia beetle}} endemic to Asia and a pest of {{commercial}} tea, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze. Recently, {{a complex of}} species morphologically similar to E. fornicatus has been recognized, which includes new pests established in Israel and the USA, both in California and Florida. Collectively termed E. nr. fornicatus, these cryptic species carry symbiotic Fusarium spp. fungi, some of which cause dieback disease in susceptible hosts, which include avocado, Persea americana Miller. Due to the threat to this economically important crop, research was initiated to evaluate efficacy of kairomone-based lures for detection of the beetle in Florida (termed the Florida tea <b>shot</b> <b>hole</b> <b>borer,</b> FL-TSHB). A series of field tests were conducted in 2016 in commercial avocado groves known to have FL-TSHB at various population levels. All tests evaluated lures containing quercivorol (p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol) and Î±-copaene, presented separately and in combination; and one test evaluated effect of trap type on beetle captures. In addition, electroantennography (EAG) was used to quantify female olfactory responses to lure emissions. This study identified (-) -Î±-copaene as a new attractant for FL-TSHB, equivalent in efficacy to quercivorol (the standard lure for Euwallacea detection in the USA); however, the combination of lures captured significantly more FL-TSHB than either lure alone. This combination resulted in synergistic attraction at two field sites and additive attraction at a third site. Sticky panel traps captured more FL-TSHB than comparably-baited Lindgren funnel traps. Females engaged in host-seeking flight from 11 : 00 to 16 : 00 hr (EST), with peak numbers observed between 12 : 00 and 13 : 00 hr. EAG analyses confirmed olfactory chemoreception of both kairomones, with a higher response elicited with the combination of volatiles. Results indicate that detection of pest E. nr. fornicatus in Florida can be improved by using a two-component lure consisting of p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol and (-) -Î±-copaene...|$|E
40|$|The Tijuana River Valley is {{the first}} natural habitat in California to be {{substantially}} invaded by the Kuroshio <b>Shot</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>Borer</b> (KSHB, Euwallacea sp.), an ambrosia beetle native to Southeast Asia. This paper documents {{the distribution of the}} KSHB in the riparian vegetation in the valley and assesses the damage done to the vegetation as of early 2016, approximately six months after the beetle was first observed in the valley. I divided the riparian habitats into 29 survey units so that the vegetation within each unit was relatively homogenous in terms of plant species composition, age and density. From a random point within each unit, I examined approximately 60 individuals of the dominant plant species for evidence of KSHB infestation and evidence of major damage such as limb breakage. In the 22 forested units,I examined the dominant arroyo and black willows (Salix lasiolepis Benth. and S. gooddingii C. R. Ball), and in the seven scrub units, I examined mule fat (Baccharis salicifolia (Ruiz & Pav.) Pers.). Evidence of KSHB infestation was found in 25 of the 29 units. In the forest units, infestation rates ranged from 0 to 100 % and were high (> 60 %) in 16 of the units. In the scrub units, infestation rates ranged from 0 to 33 %. Infestation rates were significantly correlated with the wetness of a unit; wetter units had higher infestation rates. Evidence of major physical damage was found in 24 units, and dense stands of willows were reduced to broken trunks in several areas. Overall, I estimated that more than 280, 000 (70 %) of the willows in the valley were infested, and more than 140, 000 had suffered major limb damage. In addition, I recorded evidence of KSHB infestation in the other common plant species in the valley; of the 23 species examined, 14 showed evidence of beetle attack. The four species with the highest rates of infestation were native trees in the Salicaceae family. The three species considered to be the worst invasive plants in the valley, Ricinus communis L., Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. and Arundo donax L., had low rates of infestation. Several findings from this study have significance for resource managers: (1) the KSHB attack caused extensive mortality of trees soon after being first discovered so, if managers are to control the spread of the beetle, they will need to develop an effective early detection and rapid response program; (2) infestation rates were highest in units that were wet, so resource managers trying to detect the beetle in other areas should thoroughly search trees near water, particularly nutrient-enriched water; (3) the infestation appears to be a novel form of disturbance, and the affected forests may need special management actions in order to recover; and (4) the infestation has altered the structure of the forest canopy, and this is likely to promote the growth of invasive plant species that were relatively inconspicuous in the forests prior to the beetle attack but will now need more attention...|$|E
