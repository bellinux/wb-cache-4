5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event. On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU or 10.8billion miles (17.3billion kilometers) from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> are deflected by the magnetosphere; <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere {{into a long}} tail. Because the velocity of the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E

When incentive and regulation lose their impacts {{on the cost of}} <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energies at the medium period, newly generated energy capacities of <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> systems decrease in a few iterations but then they recover their increasing state. This state stems from increasing <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy capacities that cause the increase in energy demand and reduce of energy price and profits such that model reacts to balance the system by decreasing supports (incentive and regulation) on <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energies.|$|R

5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted by the Sun, from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's bow shock, {{where the}} {{magnetosphere}} begins {{to slow the}} <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> occurs {{at a distance of}} 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the <b>solar</b> <b>wind,</b> which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} the solar wind's {{influence}} on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown; however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated solar activity. The auroral radio, optical and X-ray emissions, as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> pressure, indicating that the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.|$|E
30|$|Cost {{of solar}} (COSE)/wind (COWE) energy, {{technological}} applicability for solar (TASE)/wind (TAWE) energy and solar (SEI)/wind (WEI) energy incentive factors directly affect {{the amount of}} newly generated <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy capacities and also have indirect effects on other global factors. The cost of energy systems refers {{the total amount of}} cost that stem from investment cost, production, transmission and distribution costs. Technological applicability for energy systems represents the applicability of <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy technologies under the given geological, physical, and operational conditions for generation and distribution of the <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy. Other auxiliary factors around the <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy generations are an incentive and any type of governmental supports that encourage users and investors to direct the <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy usage and investments. <b>Solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy incentive are monetary (e.g., zero-interest loan, tax relief, feed-in-tariff) or non-monetary (e.g., law, regulation, policies) encouragement programs whose special purposes are to increase the use of <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy-efficient equipment and reduce non-renewable energy usage.|$|R

Decreasing investments and new generation capacities of the <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energies stimulate governments to take precaution for supporting these concepts by regulation and incentive. Also, decreasing cost of <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy systems are balanced by incentive and general energy demand and prices. Technical applicability for <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy are limited by <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy systems, so their positive active initial values decrease and reach steady states at zero values.|$|R

5|$|The <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> {{is quite}} {{different}} from a terrestrial wind, in that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere.

Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} <b>solar</b> <b>wind.</b> Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E

25|$|According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, {{most studies}} critiquing <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy look only at {{individual}} generators {{and not at}} the system wide effects of <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> farms. Correlations between power swings drop substantially as more <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> farms are integrated (a process known as geographical smoothing) and a wider geographic area also enables a larger pool of energy efficiency efforts to abate intermittency.|$|R
30|$|Increasing <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy {{generation}} capacities cause {{the increase of}} energy supply and reduce of the energy price that also increases the energy consumption and energy demand. Increase {{in the cost of}} <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy in the medium period cause the decrease of the newly generated <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> energy capacities and the energy supply. This energy bottleneck indicates that energy price will rise and energy demand will reduce in the same period. Energy supply, demand and price and new <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> {{energy generation}} capacities factors converge to steady state at zero value in small fluctuations.|$|R
5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator.

5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System.

The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the <b>solar</b> <b>wind</b> impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E

The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere.

40|$|Abstract <b>Solar</b> and <b>wind</b> {{generated}} {{power is}} expected to increase drastically in the future. Unlike fossil fuels, however, <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resource extraction introduces challenges of variability and intermittency. Several recent studies around the world have shown that since dissimilar climatological factors are responsible for <b>wind</b> and <b>solar</b> resources, they can often operate in tandem to offset lulls in each other. While most research on <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resource interaction has been undertaken over the Northern Hemisphere (America, Europe and China), {{there is a lack of}} understanding on how much (or even if) <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resources complement one another in other parts of the world. To partially address this issue in the Southern Hemisphere, this study provides a systematic quantitative analysis of the complementary characteristics of <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resources on the Australian continent. As such, wind power density and surface incident shortwave flux are derived from the hourly Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) product for the entire continent for the period from 1979 to 2014. It was found that the temporal synergy between <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resource is maximum along the western and southern coast of Australia. Tasmania, south-eastern (parallel to eastern Great Dividing Range), and northern regions (Cairns and Kimberley Plateau) of the continent also showed significant synergy (≈ 40 % within a distance of 93 km), which was mostly influenced by hours of daylight when the solar resource is available. Increasing the spatial extent increased the occurrence of synergy characteristics to 50 % within a distance of 465 km. These findings are significant because most of the synergy (and intermittency) in <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resources was found in proximity to transmission lines – locations where renewables are likely to be cited going forward. Amongst current large-scale <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> farms operating in south-eastern Australia, this study also finds that increased power production is possible by balancing existing assets with complementary <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> farms. While these results are limited to a single continent, the proposed approach (e. g. using similar metrics) can be readily applied to investigate synergies between <b>solar</b> and <b>wind</b> resource in other parts of the world using the global MERRA product...|$|R
