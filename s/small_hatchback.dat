5000|$|In 1964, Fiat {{subsidiary}} Autobianchi marketed the Primula hatchback, {{replaced by}} Autobianchi A112 in 1969. In Poland, a FSO Syrena prototype [...] "110" [...] <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> {{was developed in}} 1964.|$|E
50|$|Its {{exterior}} {{design is}} a mix of compact MPV and SUV; and its height (less than 1.6 m) makes it hard to classify it precisely. Handling characteristics are more like a <b>smaller</b> <b>hatchback</b> than any other comparable compact MPV. Also the Honda Stream has a top speed of 127 miles per hour.|$|R
5000|$|In road cars: Traction {{control has}} {{traditionally}} been a safety feature in premium high-performance cars, which otherwise need sensitive throttle input to prevent spinning driven wheels when accelerating, especially in wet, icy or snowy conditions. In recent years, traction control systems have become widely available in non-performance cars, minivans, and light trucks and in some <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Golf GTI {{was among}} the first [...] "hot hatch" [...] with mass market appeal, and many other {{manufacturers}} since have created special sports models of their regular volume-selling <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks.</b> Within a few years of its launch, it faced competitors including the Fiat Ritmo, Ford Escort XR3/XR3i, Renault 5 GT Turbo and Vauxhall Astra/Opel Kadett GTE.|$|R
5000|$|... 1990 - Launch of the Renault Clio, a new <b>small</b> <b>hatchback,</b> {{which will}} {{eventually}} replace the R5. It is voted European Car of the Year. Citroen ends {{production of the}} 2CV after 42 years, the last two of which saw the car produced in Portugal.|$|E
50|$|The Infiniti Q30 is a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> {{built and}} sold by Nissan's Infiniti luxury brand from 2016. The Q30 {{is built on}} the third {{generation}} Mercedes-Benz A-Class platform to create a small, premium hatchback.

5000|$|In October 1984, the Consumers' Association {{used the}} term in its annual Car Buying Guide. It gave an {{explanation}} {{at the start of}} a section entitled <b>Small</b> <b>Hatchbacks.</b> It said <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks</b> were known popularly as superminis and while similar to the Mini they were more spacious inside and more versatile. This definition made clear that a [...] "supermini" [...] was something larger than a Mini yet smaller than a typical car of the time. In its 1984 report, it included such cars as the Austin Metro, Vauxhall Nova (Later replaced by the Vauxhall Corsa) and Ford Fiesta. This report was also published soon after the launch of a host of other foreign-made superminis which were selling well in Britain - these included the Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra, Peugeot 205, Renault 5 and Volkswagen Polo. The Fiat Uno, launched during the first half of 1983, was widely praised for its high roof which set new standards for interior space and practicality in this size of car. The Peugeot 205, also launched in 1983, won plaudits for its sharp styling and excellent ride and handling.|$|R
5000|$|... 1976 - Renault {{launches}} a new <b>small</b> family <b>hatchback</b> model, the R14, {{which is similar}} in concept to the Volkswagen Golf from West Germany.|$|R
50|$|The compact Farina model bowed in 1958 {{with the}} Austin A40 Farina. This is {{considered}} by many to be the first mass-produced hatchback car: a small estate version was produced with a horizontally split tailgate, its size and configuration would today be considered that of a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback.</b> A Mark II A40 Farina appeared in 1961 and was produced through 1967. These small cars used the A-Series engine.|$|E
5000|$|The G3HG is a 3 cylinder, 9 valves, SOHC, 0.8 L (814 cc) {{version with}} a 67 mm bore and 77 mm stroke. Output is [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] at 4000 rpm. This engine {{has been used}} in Hyundai's new <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> Hyundai Eon. As the name {{suggests}} this G3HG engine is nothing but a G4HG engine with one fewer cylinders mainly designed for high fuel efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Mike {{introduces}} a buyer who {{is interested in}} purchasing {{a certain type of}} car e.g.: <b>small</b> <b>hatchback,</b> luxury car etc. He has three or more cars on offer, and the buyer decides which ones he or she is most interested in, taking usually two for a test drive. Mike gives details of any potential problems with the cars. At the end of the episode, the buyer decides which car to buy.|$|E
25|$|The {{oil crisis}} pushed West European car buyers away from larger, less {{economical}} cars. The most notable {{result of this}} transition was the rise in popularity of compact hatchbacks. The only notable <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks</b> built in Western Europe before the oil crisis were the Peugeot104, Renault5 and Fiat127. By {{the end of the}} decade, the market had expanded with the introduction of the Ford Fiesta, Opel Kadett (sold as the Vauxhall Astra in Great Britain), Chrysler Sunbeam and Citroën Visa.|$|R

50|$|The {{most famous}} Autobianchi models include the A112 {{released}} in 1969, a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> {{very popular in}} Italy for racing, and which ceased production in 1986; {{as well as the}} Y10, which was the first car to use Fiat's new FIRE (Fully Integrated Robotised Engine). The Primula was the car with which Fiat introduced the particular front-wheel drive arrangement of engine, transmission and differential (final drive) that has become prevalent in its cars today.|$|E
50|$|British Leyland {{entered the}} <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> market - pioneered during the 1970s {{by the likes}} of the Renault 5 and Volkswagen Polo - with its Metro which was {{launched}} in October 1980. The Metro would be built at the Longbridge plant, which had just been expanded to provide adequate production capacity for the new car. But with BL hoping to sell more than 100,000 Metros a year in Britain alone, more capacity for production was needed and production of the Allegro and the Mini were pruned back as a result.|$|E
5000|$|Most crash {{testings}} {{are done}} in a controlled laboratory environment, against static objects and thus many variables that affect a vehicle's real-world crash performance are not evaluated. One of the main problems with real world collisions is the huge disparity between weight, dimensions and body types of different vehicles on the road. When vehicles of different weight and size collide, the vehicle's passive safety features may not work as intended. The differences in vehicle designs may cause of the colliding vehicles to under-ride or over-ride, limiting the vehicle's frames to properly absorb / disperse the impact energy. This is particularly serious in a collision between a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> and a large sedan / SUV. Even on a collision between two same vehicle models, the differences in their ride height due {{to the number of}} occupants on board / actual weight is sufficient to cause the two vehicle's crash members to be out of alignment with each other, causing under-riding / over-riding.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Renault {{introduced}} the Renault 4, a small {{car with a}} top-hinged tailgate incorporating the rear window, and only short side windows between C & D-pillars aside the luggage space and a steep angle from roof to rear bumper. Although during its production run the R4 was called a small station wagon -even after the term hatchback appeared around 1970 - with over eight million cars built, {{this was the first}} mass-produced hatchback. Despite the success of subsequent <b>smaller</b> <b>hatchback</b> models including the Renault 5, the R4 continued in production in Europe until 1986 and through 1992 in Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The Opel Flextreme is {{a diesel}} plug-in hybrid concept <b>small</b> family <b>hatchback</b> created by Opel in 2008. The Opel Flextreme shares the same GM E-Flex {{platform}} as the Chevrolet Volt (front engine, four door).|$|R
50|$|The Oltcit Club was a {{supermini}} automobile {{developed by}} Oltcit in co-operation with Citroën of France in the 1980s. It is a <b>small</b> three-door <b>hatchback,</b> {{based on the}} Citroën Prototype Y and was built in Craiova, Romania.|$|R
40|$|The solar UV {{transmitted}} through automobile glass {{was measured in}} the field in two cars using a spectroradiometer. The two cars were identical except that one of the cars had all of the windows (except the windshield) tinted. The measured spectral erythemal UV on a horizontal plane with the windows fully closed was reduced in the tinted car by a factor of 42 when compared with the erythemal UV measured in the untinted car. The ambient UVA irradiances at various locations within four different makes of car and a tractor were also measured with a broad band UVA hand-held meter. The average normalized daily UVA exposure (measured with a broad band UVA meter) was 1. 3 times higher in a large family sedan when compared with that in a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> and the UVA exposure in a car with tinted windows was 3. 8 times less than in a similar untinted car...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of a series of}} interior vehicle noise measurements on a set of 1106 automotive vehicles, both petrol and diesel versions, from one manufacturer is presented: a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> model and a mid-sized family 5 -door car. The engines were run at 50 rpm intervals over therange from 1000 rpm up to 4000 and 5950 rpm for the diesel and petrol variants respectively, with full load in econd gear whilst the vehicle was on a dynamometer roller test rig, comprising a smooth rolling surface. The measured interior noise at four positions corresponding to passenger ear locations were subsequently analysed in third octave bands as well as the overall levels, with statistical tests being performed on the linear rms pressures. The normalised standard deviation of the linear data decreases with increasing frequency. It is typically less than 0. 1 over the whole audio frequency range irrespective of vehicle type or engine. A lognormal distribution provides the best fit to the majority of the engine noise results and the overall engine noise could be described by a lognormal or gamma distribution. A lognormal distribution fit implies that the values in dB are normally distributed...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of a series of}} measurements of the audio-frequency response of a large set of automotive vehicles is presented: a <b>small</b> <b>hatchback</b> model with both a three-door (411 vehicles) and five-door (403 vehicles) derivative and a mid-sized family five-door car (316 vehicles). The sets included vehicles of various specifications, engines, gearboxes, interior trim, wheels and tyres. The tests were performed in a hemianechoic chamber with the temperature and humidity recorded. Two tests were performed on each vehicle and the interior cabin noise measured. In the first, the excitation was acoustically induced by sets of external loudspeakers. In the second test, predominantly structure-borne noise was induced by running the vehicle at a steady speed on a rough roller. For both types of excitation, it is seen that the effects of temperature are small, indicating that manufacturing variability is larger than that due to temperature for the tests conducted. It is also observed that there are no significant outlying vehicles, i. e. there are at most only a few vehicles that consistently have the lowest or highest noise levels over the whole spectrum. For the acoustically excited tests, measured 1 / 3 -octave noise reduction levels typically have a spread of 5 dB or so and the normalised standard deviation of the linear data is typically 0. 1 or higher. Regarding the statistical distribution of the linear data, a lognormal distribution is a somewhat better fit than a Gaussian distribution for lower 1 / 3 -octave bands, while the reverse is true at higher frequencies. For the distribution of the overall linear levels, a Gaussian distribution is generally the most representative. As a simple description of the response variability, it is sufficient for this series of measurements to assume that the acoustically induced airborne cabin noise is best described by a Gaussian distribution with a normalised standard deviation between 0. 09 and 0. 145. There is generally considerable variability in the roller-induced noise, with individual 1 / 3 -octave levels varying by typically 15 dB or so and with the normalised standard deviation being in the range 0. 2 – 0. 35 or more. These levels are strongly affected by wheel rim and tyre constructions. For vehicles with nominally identical wheel rims and tyres, the normalised standard deviation for 1 / 3 -octave levels in the frequency range 40 – 600 Hz is 0. 2 or so. The distribution of the linear roller-induced noise level in each 1 / 3 -octave frequency band is well described by a lognormal distribution as is the overall level. As a simple description of the response variability, it is sufficient for this series of measurements to assume that the roller-induced road noise is best described by a lognormal distribution with a normalised standard deviation of 0. 2 or so, but that this can be significantly affected by the tyre and rim type, especially at lower frequencie...|$|E
50|$|Although the quoted {{power outputs}} {{are low in}} {{comparison}} to modern <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks,</b> or even to other hatchbacks of the time, the kerb weight was generally very low, with even the range-topping VTS having a kerb weight of just 935 kg, with other smaller engine models (except the diesel) being around 100 kg lighter than this. This meant a high power-to-weight ratio which meant for decent acceleration and made the car suitable for city driving. Aside from the VTS which had 16 valves, all engines were the older SOHC units which meant low MPG figures. Even the popular 1.1 engine would struggle to achieve more than 35-40mpg in town when driven carefully.|$|R
50|$|The GS was facelifted in 1979 {{and given}} a hatchback, and renamed the GSA. This change {{reflected}} {{the growing popularity of}} <b>small</b> family <b>hatchbacks</b> in Europe since the launch of the Volkswagen Golf. Other modifications included a new grille, new bumpers, new taillights, new hubcaps and new exterior handles. It also had a revised dashboard with the auxiliary controls on column-shaped pods so they could be reached without moving the hands from the single-spoked steering wheel; similar to the CX layout. It was partly replaced by the larger BX in 1982, although production continued in reduced volumes until 1986. Citroën did not re-enter the <b>small</b> family <b>hatchback</b> market until the launch of the ZX in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is typical}} of <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks</b> with MacPherson struts in front located by an L-shaped lower arm. At the rear, Viva is fitted with a torsion beam axle and trailing arms. The suspension geometry has been optimised for better steering response and ride comfort. The 1000 cc models have power-assisted steering, optional auto transmission and also a front stabilizer. The 660 cc and 850 cc are barebones basic models, devoid of power steering and auto transmission. As the Viva is based on Daihatsu Mira Avy, a kei car, it has a compact exterior dimensions and a small turning radius. It is roomy for its class, with enough room to seat five adults.|$|R
50|$|The N10 model Pulsar was {{introduced}} to Japan in May 1978, with European sales beginning in March 1979. While known as the Nissan Pulsar in Japan, it was called Cherry in Europe and many other export markets. The body styling was more boxy, and influenced by designs coming out of Europe at that time. It {{came at a time}} when <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks</b> were enjoying rising sales across Europe, with the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Polo, Renault 5 and Fiat 127 being particularly popular, along with the General Motors product which was known in Britain as the Vauxhall Chevette and on the continent as the Opel Kadett City. It continued to sell well in Britain, and the most popular foreign car there in 1981.|$|R
50|$|The {{equipment}} list was generally sparse, with budget models having drivers airbag, seat belt pre-tensioners, cassette player, heated rear screen and tinted windows, and early MK1s with keypad immobilisers and a clock {{in place of}} a tachometer and 3 stud wheels, much like the AX. Further up the list sunroofs, PAS, Electric windows, ultrasonic alarm, passenger airbag, CD player, tachometer, front fog lights, bodykits, colour-coded mirror caps and alloy wheels were added, to name a few. Although MK2 Saxos were generally better equipped than their older counterparts, the interiors were still dated in comparison to other <b>small</b> <b>hatchbacks</b> of the time, such as the Vauxhall Corsa, with many of the center console controls originating from the older Citroën AX model.|$|R
