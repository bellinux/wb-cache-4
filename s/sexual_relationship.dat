40|$|Background: Youth’s sexual {{behaviors}} have various consequences such as unwanted pregnancy, {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} and sexually transmitted infections. Little information is available {{about the impact of}} mass media in the development of premarital <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships.</b> This study aimed to explore the role of mass media on premarital <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> among Iranian youth. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted with 26 single boys and girls aged 18 - 24 years who were living in Isfahan, Iran and have already been started their <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships.</b> Also, 12 other participants who were involved in such an experience were recruited in this study. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews and the observation of youth’s sexual interactions in different fields. Conventional content analysis method was used for data analysis. Results: Three main categories were developed: “foreigner media as the role model”, “the ease of access to sexual contents and materials” and “the ease of interactions and relationships with the opposite sex”. Conclusion: The prominent role of mass media in the formation of premarital <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> was described in this study. This issue needs to be taken into consideration by policy makers for taking necessary actions for reducing the impact of mass media on the youth’s engagement in premarital <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years or so, he was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm {{in its attempt to}} take over Portland General Electric, a local utility company. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> with a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these {{have focused on the}} possible <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> between the two men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings {{he and his wife}} had with Texas Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as an outspoken critic of Goldschmidt. The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt's career, including reporters' difficulties accessing records from his time as governor, ultimately led to the revelation of an illegal <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> with a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his time as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt's extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking.|$|E

5|$|On May 6, under {{pressure}} from Willamette Week, Goldschmidt publicly {{announced that he had}} engaged in a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> with a 14-year-old girl (the victim later indicated she was 13) for an extended period during his first term as Mayor of Portland. Sex with a person under 16 years of age constitutes third degree rape under Oregon law, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. By the time the relationship had become public, however, the statute of limitations had expired, making Goldschmidt immune from any prosecution over the matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{friendship}} between Byron and Giraud {{has become a}} topic of interest among scholars and biographers of Byron. Many believe that the pair's relationship was platonic, but correspondence between Byron and his friends has been used since the late 20th century {{to argue that the}} two were engaged in a love affair. The earliest claim of a <b>sexual</b> <b>relationship</b> between them comes from George Colman's poem Don Leon, in which Byron is the principal character and Giraud is portrayed as his liberator from the sexual prejudices in Britain. The poem is not biographical; it promotes Colman's own social and political views.|$|E
40|$|The {{two most}} {{fundamental}} aspects of <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships,</b> passion and intimacy, are complex concepts, {{with at least}} partly paradoxical contents. Intimacy, for example, stands for unity and security, but also for shifting boundaries and exposure. Passion in its turn, stands for enthusiasm and energy, but also for surrender and dependency. It is this 'two sides of the coin' phenomenon that makes <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships</b> as interesting as they are dangerous. In terms of development, a relationship often starts with 'setting each other on fire' and ends with 'sexual burn-out'. In this paper, an analysis is made of the way patients, but also health care providers such as gynecologists and sexologists, cope with these unavoidable phenomena in <b>sexual</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
