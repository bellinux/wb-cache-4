5|$|The {{ship was}} {{laid down in}} 1896–97 by Normand at their Le Havre shipyard, {{as the last of}} the four s. She was named after a French type of blunderbuss; all of the ships in her class were named after weapons.

She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in December and made a number of port visits in France, Corsica and French North Africa throughout 1901. Her rudder was damaged after striking the bottom off Golfe-Juan and Espingole was under repair 3–27 September.|$|E

5|$|Chicado V started {{only six}} times because knee {{problems}} cut short her racing career. However, she won her first two starts while breaking or equaling track records, {{and was given}} the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1952. The next year <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> last four races, winning once and setting one more speed record. After her last race, in , she was retired from the track to become a broodmare, and had nine foals. Two of her offspring were named Champion Quarter Running Horses, and all her foals had a total of seven stakes race wins. One of her daughters, Table Tennis, {{went on to become}} a noted broodmare herself, as did Table Tennis' daughter Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks. However, three of ChicadoV's sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—were her best known offspring; all three became leading sires and are the main cause of her fame. She was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2006.|$|E

25|$|She faced strong {{competition}} on the European circuit: Jones took third at the London Grand Prix behind Sally McLellan and Perdita Felicien, and {{a run of}} 12.61seconds was only enough for third again at Herculis. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> second fastest time of the season (12.51) at the DN Galan meeting, but she was beaten to the line by Lopes-Schliep.

25|$|At the 1986 Asian Games the 21-year-old Isozaki {{was entered}} to defend all her titles. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> {{individual}} finals faster {{than she had}} done four years earlier, but the standard of women's sprinting in Asia had improved and this meant she was fifth in the 200m and third in the 400m. P. T. Usha succeeded Isozaki in both disciplines with another Indian, Shiny Abraham, finishing ahead of the Japanese sprinter in the 400m. The Japanese short relay team fell to fifth in the rankings but the national long relay team remained competitive as Isozaki anchored home a quartet including Keiko Honda, Koshimoto and Ayako Arai to the silver medal behind the Indian women.|$|E
25|$|She {{missed the}} 2009 indoor season due to achilles strain {{developed}} while training. Instead, {{she started her}} season in April at the Athletics Kenya meeting in Kakamega, running 200 and 1500 metres races for training purposes. On 23 May <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> first 800 metres race {{of the year at}} the Meeting International Mohammed VI in Rabat, Morocco, finishing sixth (time 2:02.46) – it was the first 800 m race that she did not win. Two weeks later she finished last at the Prefontaine Classic meeting in Eugene, Oregon. Due to these dismal results, she concentrated on training for over a month. She successfully returned to track by winning the Heusden-Zolder meeting on 18 July running under two minutes (1:59.59).|$|E

The 2005 Seoul Marathon marked a return to form, as she finished second {{with a time of}} 2:25:55 hours, but she was slower at the Beijing Marathon and came eleventh (a placing which also served for the 2005 Chinese Games). Her 2006 was below-par: she was sixth at the Xiamen Marathon and won the low-key Langfang Marathon with a run of 2:42:49 hours.|$|E

Nicole ran 4:11.65 in the 1500m beating Marielle Hall in Princeton. <b>She</b> <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> first 5000 meters at the Payton Jordan Invitational in May and surprised by taking third {{in a time of}} 15:05.58 minutes – this met the qualifying standard for the national team and was over 25 seconds faster than she anticipated before the race. In her second outing over the distance she won the national title at the 2015 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, beating much favoured opposition. Tully ran 2016 Olympic standard in 1500 metres (4:05.89) in Heusden, Belgium 18 July 2015.

25|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} in March 2002 for the World Cross Country Championships, {{being held in}} Dublin. She finished a very respectable 7th in the Short Race, and led Ireland to Team Bronze. At the European Championships in Munich later that year, O'Sullivan attempted a defense of her two European Golds she won in 1998. In the 10000 m she won silver in a National Record of 30:47.59. Despite this, she finished a full 46 seconds behind winner Paula Radcliffe who narrowly missed becoming the second woman to break 30 minutes in a European Record performance of 30:01.09. O'Sullivan admitted she had been outclassed in the race, saying that only world record holder Wang Junxia could have beaten her on the night. A few days later, O'Sullivan added a second silver in the 5000m as she was beaten into second place by Marta Dominguez of Spain {{in a time of}} 15:14.85. Shortly afterwards she set a season's best for the 3000 m in Zurich as she finished third in a time of 8:33.62. A week later, <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> <b>her</b> fastest 5000 m time since her Olympic Silver in London in a time of 14:46.97, as she finished third.

500|$|Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya {{was built}} by the ONZiV Shipyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 30 October 1911 as Ekaterina II, but {{this was just a}} {{ceremonial}} event as the design had not yet been finalized or the contract signed. ONZiV decided, on advice from Vickers, to increase her dimensions over those of her sisters to prevent her from being overweight. This added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months past her sisters. She suffered from a number of other delays during construction. First the method of fastening the armor to its supports was changed and the armor plates were locked together by a type of mortise and tenon joint to better distribute the shock of an impact. This was based on the full-scale armor trials conducted using the hulk of the old pre-dreadnought battleship [...] in 1913 and added almost [...] of weight to the ship.
