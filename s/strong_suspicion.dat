5|$|Historians {{believe that}} as many as 256 {{soldiers}} of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years. In 2012 Brooklyn historian and president of the Brooklyn Preservation Council, Robert Furman, stated that he had a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> of the location of the gravesite, believing it to be in an empty lot in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, the government's {{attempt to}} legislate Article 23 (National Security) of the Basic Law aroused <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> among Hong Kong citizens. This Article would grant Hong Kong's police force {{right of access}} to private {{property}} on grounds of 'safeguarding national security', but without court warrants. Coupled with years of economic hardships and discontent of Tung's pro-Beijing stance, a mass demonstration broke out on 1 July 2003. This demonstration hastened the resignations of two government ministers and, eventually, that of Tung on 10 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1839, Ranjang Pande was made the sole mukhtiyar. However, knowledge about Ranjang's war preparations and his communication with other princely states of India, fomenting anti-British sentiments, alarmed the Governor-General of the time, Lord Auckland, who mobilized some British troops near the border of Nepal. In order to resolve this diplomatic fiasco, Bhimsen was recalled from Gorkha {{and the rest of}} his confiscated property was also released. Bhimsen suggested some of the battalions under Ranjang's command to be given to other courtiers, thus severely weakening Ranjang's military power, and in the process convincing the British that Nepal was not on the path to war. The King agreed to this arrangement; however this aroused a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> in Samrajya Laxmi, who determined to eradicate Bhimsen's influence permanently.|$|E

25|$|According to Soviet sources, {{relations}} with Georgia deteriorated over alleged {{violations of the}} peace treaty, re-arrests of Georgian Bolsheviks, obstruction of convoys passing through Georgia to Armenia, and a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> that Georgia was aiding armed rebels in the North Caucasus. For its part, Georgia accused Moscow of fomenting anti-government riots in various regions of the country, and of provoking border incidents in the Zaqatala region, disputed with the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. The Lori “neutral zone” was another challenge, as Soviet Armenia categorically demanded that Georgia withdraw the troops that had been stationed in the region {{since the fall of}} the Armenian Republic.|$|E
25|$|April 1902 – When {{the charred}} remains of Dahlke and Constable George Doyle of the Upper Warrego police station, who {{had set out}} during Easter 1902 to arrest James and Patrick Kenniff for horse-stealing, were found in Lethbridge's Pocket, <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> fell on the Kenniffs. Although {{he did not see}} the actual murders, Doyle's Aboriginal tracker, Sam Johnson, heard {{shooting}} and when he neared the arrest scene, the Kenniffs pursued him but he escaped. Despite a reward of £1000 and a large police manhunt, they were not taken until 23 June at Arrest Creek, south of Mitchell.|$|E

Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant... My <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> [...] that I was involved in something great".

500|$|Traditionally a plain {{radiograph}} of the chest, ideally {{with the}} X-ray beams being projected {{from the back}} (posteroanterior, or [...] "PA"), {{has been the most}} appropriate first investigation. These are usually performed during maximal inspiration (holding one's breath); no added information is gathered by obtaining a chest X-ray in expiration (after exhaling). If the PA X-ray does not show a pneumothorax but there is a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> of one, lateral X-rays (with beams projecting from the side) may be performed, but this is not routine practice. It is not unusual for the mediastinum (the structure between the lungs that contains the heart, great blood vessels and large airways) to be shifted away from the affected lung due to the pressure differences. This is not equivalent to a tension pneumothorax, which is determined mainly by the constellation of symptoms, hypoxia, and shock.|$|E
500|$|The first {{review of}} History of a Six Weeks' Tour was {{published}} by The Eclectic Review in May 1818, which reviewed the book along with publisher Thomas Hookham's account of a Swiss tour, A Walk through Switzerland in September 1816. Although both works share the same fascination with Rousseau and his liberal ideas, only Hookham is attacked; as scholar Benjamin Colbert explains, [...] "Shelley tends to remain on more neutral territory", such as the cult of sensibility and the novel Julie. However, the reviewer questions {{the authenticity of the}} work: [...] "To us...the value of the book is considerably lessened by a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> that the dramatis personae are fictitious, and that the little adventures introduced for the purpose of giving life and interest to the narration, are the mere invention of the Author." [...] He identifies passages that remind him of similar travel narratives by Patrick Brydone, Ann Radcliffe, and John Carr, effectively identifying the generic tradition in which the Shelleys were writing.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} {{opened with}} excerpts {{from two of}} the interviews prior to the title sequence, followed by an introduction from Jonathan Dimbleby, who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was [...] "of critical importance for {{those who wish to}} find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month". The commentary cut to Manyon, who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA's bomb would have had, and then to Noreen Hill, whose husband was in a coma {{as a result of the}} Enniskillen bombing. Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen, but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar. Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members' backgrounds, before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry, who discussed the Spanish surveillance operation, of which viewers were shown a reconstruction with a voice-over from Manyon. The programme reconstructed Savage's movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar, parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell, after which it broadcast part of Howe's statement to the House of Commons: [...] "Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car". Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb, and introduced Styles, who believed that such an examination would have shown that the car did not contain a bomb, as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 August 2015, CICIG and the Guatemalan {{attorney}} general held a joint press conference where they issued {{a warrant for}} Baldetti's arrest and asked for president Pérez Molina's impeachment; they informed the press that they had gathered evidence during the 16 April operations that linked both to La Linea, and that the two were most likely the true leaders of the ring. On 17 April 2015 they had presented an intercepted phone conversation in which {{some of the other}} suspects talked about [...] "el Presidente", without saying his name, but said that [...] "el Presidente' had asked them to open four bank accounts since CICIG already had too much information. Besides [...] "el Presidente", the nickmanes [...] "la R", [...] "la R2" [...] and [...] "la Señora" [...] were heard in these conversations, all referring to a person who had ordered personnel changes in SAT. Despite <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> that these people were Pérez Molina and Baldetti, the CICIG did not ask for their arrest at that time because they did not have any incontrovertible proof against them.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious {{incidents}} of {{the latter part of the}} century was the trial and execution of Nanda Kumar, [...] who had been the governor of Hugging in 1756. In 1764 he had been appointed collector of Burdwan in place of Warren Hastings, which resulted in a long-standing enmity between the two men. In 1775, when Hastings was Governor-General, Nanda Kumar brought accusations of corruption against him, accusing him of accepting bribes and other abuses of power. These were taken up with enthusiasm by Hastings' rivals on the Governor General's Council, led by Philip Francis. Whilst this matter was still awaiting investigation Nanda Kumar was indicted for forgery of a deed, condemned and executed. There was a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> that the charges had been invented by Hastings, and that he had put pressure on the judges to pass sentence of death. At this date it was far from clear whether or not English law applied in Calcutta, and it was extremely rare for the death penalty to be applied for forgery even in England. Furthermore, Nanda Kumar was a Brahman, and his hanging caused widespread dismay and outrage in Calcutta.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through {{the corner of her eye}} wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E
2500|$|During the Stalin years, a purge {{was carried}} out against Communist Party {{officials}} and intelligentsia of Abkhaz provenance on the orders of Lavrentiy Beria, then-the Party Secretary in Transcaucasus and himself a native of Abkhazia, in order to break a resistance to forced collectivization of land. The Abkhaz party leader Lakoba [...] suddenly died shortly after his visit to Beria in Tbilisi in December 1936. There was a <b>strong</b> <b>suspicion</b> that he was poisoned by Beria who declared Lakoba an [...] "enemy of the people" [...] posthumously. The purges in Abkhazia were accompanied by the suppression of Abkhaz ethnic culture: the Latin-based Abkhaz alphabet was changed into Georgian and all the native language schools were closed, ethnic Georgians were guaranteed key official positions, many place names were changed to Georgian ones. In the terror of 1937-38, the ruling elite was purged of Abkhaz and by 1952 over 80% of the 228 top party and government officials and enterprise managers were ethnic Georgians; there remained 34 Abkhaz, 7 Russians and 3 Armenians in these positions. Between 1937 and 1953 {{tens of thousands of}} peasants from Western Georgia were settled in Abkhazia. In the 1926 Soviet census, the Abkhaz accounted for 26.4% of the region's population. The demographic engineering of the late Stalin period brought this proportion down to 17—18%. Abkhazia is mountainous and has a shortage of arable land, which made it difficult to send in new settlers. This {{was one of the reasons}} why in 1949 the Greek and Turkish minorities were deported from Abkhazia to Kazakhstan and other Central Asian republics, and Georgians were settled in the formerly Greek and Turkish villages. Abkhazia experienced collectivisation in 1936-1938, much later than most of USSR.|$|E
