5|$|The {{release of}} the game on September 22, 2005 <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> {{separate}} editions being made available. The standard edition included the game and manual, a collector's edition version in a presentation box that includes the official soundtrack, extra documentation, a hardback book titled Art of Empires that contains concept art and 3D renders from the game and a DVD entitled The Making of Age of Empires III.|$|E
5|$|The series also {{gained a}} new true/false {{guessing}} game called False Or True however {{perhaps the most}} significant was L Castaway which <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> teams (boys against girls) spend a week on a small island in Loch Lomond with Tammy Huff and Toby Waterman from Castaway 2000 as their team captains. Each week would see different teams and the overall winners {{at the end of the}} series would win a holiday.|$|E
5|$|Turnout {{has dropped}} {{consistently}} {{every year since}} the first election, and from 1999 it has been below 50%. In 2007 both Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs in by-elections, having joined {{at the beginning of}} 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6% and 28.3% respectively.|$|E

5|$|Activated in {{the summer}} of 2007, the brigade traces its lineage to the 7th and 16th Corps Support Groups which {{combined}} to form it. As the only sustainment brigade active in US Army Europe, the brigade provides sustainment for all of the forces of US Army's commands for Europe and Africa. It <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> deployments to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as the 16th Corps Support Group. It deployed to Iraq for its first tour as a Sustainment brigade from July 2008 to October 2009.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's League Cup run <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> notable debuts {{for young}} players. In the Second round against Leicester City, Stan Bowles scored {{twice in a}} 4–0 win. In the next round against Blackpool, Joe Corrigan made {{the first of his}} 605 {{appearances}} for the club. City progressed after a replay. Fulham were the opponents in the Fourth round, meaning City visited Craven Cottage {{for the second time in}} as many weeks. However, they could not replicate their league win, and lost 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Medals {{were awarded}} in 24 events contested in 4 sports (8 disciplines). The {{programme}} for the 1956 Winter Games <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> new events {{added to the}} four sports and twenty-two events from the 1952 Olympics, namely the men's 30kilometre cross-country ski race and the women's 3x5kilometre cross-country relay race. The Soviet Union requested {{the inclusion of a}} women's speed skating event, but this was rejected by the IOC at the 49th Session in Athens in 1954.|$|E

5|$|On 30 January 1963, a B-52E of the 6th Bomb Wing from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico, {{crashed in}} snow-covered {{mountains}} in northern New Mexico after turbulence tore off the vertical fin. The ECM operator and tail gunner were killed {{but at least}} three crew (pilot, radio operator and one other crew member) survived. Three Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars and, later, three Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports, circled the area trying to locate survivors; the pilots reported that they <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> other survivors after the first man walked to safety.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the period {{during the summer}} and fall of 1910 in which tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The season was fairly inactive, with only five storms; however, three grew into hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The season got off to a late start with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea on August 23. September <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> storms, and the final tropical cyclone—Hurricane Five—existed during October. All but one of the storms made landfall, and the only cyclone which remained at sea had some effects on the island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s and 1960s <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> {{developments}} {{that would affect}} stellar convection theory in red supergiants: the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure and Evolution of the Stars, principally the work of Martin Schwarzschild and his colleague at Princeton University, Richard Härm. This book disseminated {{ideas on how to}} apply computer technologies to create stellar models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced some of the finest images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|In the Spanish {{rebellion}} of 1808 {{against the}} occupying French forces, reports exist that some French officers were <b>sawed</b> in <b>two.</b> In {{one of those}} reports, it is colonel Rene (or Frene) who met this fate. In another report, Rene was merely thrown into a kettle of boiling water, whereas the officers Caynier and Vaugien were the ones <b>sawed</b> in <b>two.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Trøndelag Commuter Rail was {{established}} in 1993, increasing the frequency on {{the western part of}} the line. With the retirement of the Di 3 in 2000, the Class 92 multiple units were introduced also on the Meråker Line. The concept, originally named Mittnabotåget, <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> daily services, originally running all the way to Östersund Central Station. From 2007 a train change was introduced at Storlien. Through traffic was closed from November 2013 to March 2015 with a bridge closed on the Swedish side.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} feature {{complete}} as of December 2013, and the Respawn team continued to address game bugs and balancing issues before launch. Respawn ran a closed beta test {{with an open}} registration in February 2014 that <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> million unique users. An Xbox One patch to bring support for Twitch streaming video was designed to coincide with Titanfall release. Respawn announced that the release version was finalized for distribution ("gone gold") on February 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{reorganisation}} of {{the corps}} boundaries in December 1962 created a fourth region. The entire region surrounding the capital, Saigon, {{came under the}} purview of the III Corps, whereas the previous arrangement <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> corps controlling the regions to the north and south of the capital. As a key supporter of Diệm, Đính was named commander of the III Corps, because the Ngô family trusted him to defend them in the face of any coup attempts. Under the III Corps were the 5th and the 25th Divisions.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> other players injured {{to such an extent that}} they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives as a result of the crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E
5|$|About 30 {{houses in}} San Pablo, Laguna were either {{demolished}} by strong winds or by falling coconut trees. Elsewhere, in Zambales, {{a woman was}} killed after she was struck by lighting. In Lucena City, a farmer was swept away via floods and two boys died due to fallen trees. The resort city of Legaspi suffered severe damage because hundreds of dwellings were destroyed, forcing many residents to seek shelter in schools or churches. Along {{the east coast of}} Luzon, seven people perished when hit by falling coconut trees in Quezon. Meanwhile, three casualties occurred in a fire in the province of Sorsogon. A total of 15 people drowned in the town of Sexmoan. The nearby towns of Macabebe and Masantol <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> drownings each. In the city of Manila or the provinces of Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, 34,000 people were displaced. Overall, damage totaled $42 million (1983 USD). Infrastructure damage totaled $31 million. However, damage to crops totaled to only $9.4 million since residents were just beginning to replant fields.|$|E
5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E

5|$|Controversy hit the Championship in the 1921–22 season {{which saw}} the major clubs (including Pro Vercelli, Bologna and Juventus) in {{dispute with the}} FIGC. The best 24 teams had asked for a {{reduction}} in the number of clubs in the top division in accordance with a plan drawn up by Vittorio Pozzo, the Italian national team coach. Pozzo's plan was dismissed and the CCI (Italian: Confederazione Calcistica Italiana) was founded and organised a 1921–22 CCI league (Prima Divisione) to run concurrently with the 1921–22 season (Prima Categoria) organised by the FIGC. Therefore, that season <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> champions: Novese (FIGC) and Pro Vercelli (CCI). The schism ended when FIGC accepted to reduce the Northern Championship 1922–23 to only 36 clubs ("Compromesso Colombo/Colombo compromise"); from 1923–24 the Northern Championship was reduced to 24 clubs divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov {{shook his head in}} disbelief.|$|E
60|$|I {{went away}} very sick and miserable, {{and as the}} door closed I <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> drinking.|$|R

50|$|Saltillo was a {{shipping}} point, distributing cotton and staves {{as late as}} 1861. During this time period, the town had one Methodist church, a Masonic lodge, two general stores, multiple grist mills, <b>two</b> <b>saw</b> mills, <b>two</b> tanneries and stave manufacturers and dealers. Saltillo was also described historically as a fishing town.|$|R
