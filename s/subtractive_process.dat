The processes are examined {{from a local}} and isothermal perspective then as time-varying systems to determine the degree of coupling and time-dependent complexity they exhibit. It is shown that <b>subtractive</b> <b>processes</b> exhibit more coupling within the design matrix than additive manufacturing processes.

This facilitates the manufacture of internal, overhanging and high aspect ratio features with desirable geometric accuracy and surface characteristics. The ability to work, measure and then rework material enables the reincarnation and repair of damaged, high-value components. These techniques present significant opportunities to improve material utilisation, part complexity and quality management in functional parts. The number of single platform workstations for hybrid additive and <b>subtractive</b> <b>processes</b> (WHASPs) is increasing. Many of these integrate additive directed energy deposition (DED) with subtractive CNC machining within a highly mobile multi-axis machine tool. Advanced numerical control (NC), and computer aided design (CAD), manufacture (CAM) and inspection (CAI) help to govern the process. This research reviews and critically discusses salient published literature relating to the development of WHASPs, and identifies future avenues for research and development. It reports on state-of-the-art WHASP systems, identifying key traits and research gaps. Finally, a future vision for WHASPs and other hybrid machine tools is presented based upon emerging trends and future opportunities within this research are...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} {{of state of}} the art manufacturing processes has always been constrained by the capabilities either from technical limitations such as limited materials and complex part geometries or production costs. As a result, hybrid manufacturing processes - where varied manufacturing operations are carried out - are emerging as a potential evolution for current manufacturing technologies. However, process planning methods capable of effectively utilising manufacturing resources for hybrid processes are currently limited. In this paper, a hybrid process, entitled iAtractive, combining additive, <b>subtractive</b> and inspection <b>processes,</b> along with part specific process planning is proposed. The iAtractive process aims to accurately manufacture complex geometries without being constrained by the capability of individual additive and <b>subtractive</b> <b>processes.</b> This process planning algorithm enables a part to be manufactured taking into consideration, process capabilities, production time and material consumption. This approach is also adapted for the remanufacture of existing parts. Four test parts have been manufactured from zero and existing parts, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed hybrid process and the process planning algorithm...|$|R

5000|$|The 704 and its successors has a 36-bit {{word length}} and a 15-bit address space. These {{computers}} had two instruction formats, one of which, the Type A, had a short, 3-bit, operation code prefix and two 15-bit fields {{separated by a}} 3-bit tag. The first 15-bit field was the operand address and the second held a decrement or count. The tag specified one of three index registers. Indexing was a <b>subtractive</b> <b>process</b> on the 704, hence the value to be loaded into an index register was called a [...] "decrement". The 704 hardware had special instructions for accessing the address and decrement fields in a word. As a result it was efficient to use those two fields to store within a single word the two pointers needed for a list.|$|E
5000|$|As {{machining}} is a <b>subtractive</b> <b>process,</b> {{the time}} to remove the material {{is a major factor}} in determining the machining cost. The volume and shape of the material to be removed as well as how fast the tools can be fed will determine the machining time. When using milling cutters, the strength and stiffness of the tool which is determined in part by the length to diameter ratio of the tool will play the largest role in determining that speed. The shorter the tool is relative to its diameter the faster it can be fed through the material. A ratio of 3:1 (L:D) or under is optimum. [...] If that ratio cannot be achieved, a solution like this depicted here can be used. [...] For holes, the length to diameter ratio of the tools are less critical, but should still be kept under 10:1.|$|E

50|$|Charles Blanc's Grammaire {{des arts}} du dessin {{introduced}} Seurat to {{the theories of}} color and vision that would inspire chromo-luminarism. Blanc's work, drawing from the theories of Michel Eugène Chevreul and Eugène Delacroix, stated that optical mixing would produce more vibrant and pure colors than the traditional process of mixing pigments. Mixing pigments physically is a <b>subtractive</b> <b>process</b> with cyan, magenta, and yellow being the primary colors. On the other hand, if colored light is mixed together, an additive mixture results, {{a process in which}} the primary colors are red, green and blue. The optical mixture which characterized Divisionism—the process of mixing color by juxtaposing pigments—is different from either additive or subtractive mixture, although combining colors in optical mixture functions the same way as additive mixture, i.e. the primary colors are the same. In reality, Seurat's paintings did not actually achieve true optical mixing; for him, the theory was more useful for causing vibrations of color to the viewer, where contrasting colors placed near each other would intensify the relationship between the colors while preserving their singular separate identity.|$|E
5000|$|Dodge {{accomplished}} this by {{making use of}} every conceivable revenue, no matter how supposedly insubstantial. For one, he required all government agencies rank proposed programs and cut low-priority spending. Additionally, Dodge rose the rent in Government housing, admissions to national parks, and even told agencies to charge for supplying copies of records. He forbade government agencies and departments from filling vacant positions unless absolutely necessary. Construction work was reduced to only that which was critical. He even refused to replace government cars unless they were six {{years old and had}} 60,000 miles of service. Dodge himself never replaced his own official car. [...] "This is something you do all the time in business. But the <b>subtractive</b> <b>process</b> had all but disappeared in the government until we restored it." [...] The New Look was the administration department's attempt to balance national defense needs with those of a healthy economy. Dodge, being the first director of budget to also hold a membership in the cabinet and National Security Council, strongly supported the New Look. Ultimately, Dodge successfully removed $12 billion of extraneous government spending.|$|E
5000|$|The first Kodak {{product called}} Kodachrome {{was invented by}} John Capstaff in 1913. His Kodachrome was a <b>subtractive</b> <b>process</b> that used only two colors: blue-green and red-orange. It {{required}} two glass plate negatives, one made using a panchromatic emulsion and a red filter, the other made using an emulsion insensitive to red light. The two plates could be exposed as a [...] "bipack" [...] (sandwiched emulsion to emulsion, with a very thin red filter layer between), which eliminated the need for multiple exposures or a special color camera. After development, the silver images were bleached out with chemistry that hardened the bleached portions of the gelatin. Using dyes which were absorbed only by the unhardened gelatin, the negative that recorded the blue and green light was dyed red-orange and the red-exposed negative was dyed blue-green. The result {{was a pair of}} positive dye images. The plates were then assembled emulsion to emulsion, producing a transparency that was capable of surprisingly good (for a two-color process) color rendition of skin tones in portraits. Capstaff's Kodachrome was made commercially available in 1915. It was also adapted for use as a 35 mm motion picture film process.Today, this first version of Kodachrome is nearly forgotten, completely overshadowed by the next Kodak product bearing the name Kodachrome.|$|E
