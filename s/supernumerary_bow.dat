40|$|The {{existence}} of a supernumerary nuclear rainbow in inelastic scattering is reported. This is done by studying inelastic ^ 16 O scattering from ^ 12 C, exciting the 2 ^+ (4. 44 MeV) state of ^ 12 C and elastic scattering at the incident energies in the range 124 to 200 MeV, using the coupled channels method. An extended double folding potential is used. This is derived from realistic wave functions for ^ 12 C and ^ 16 O calculated with a microscopic α cluster model and a finite-range density-dependent nucleon-nucleon force. Excitations to the 2 ^+ (4. 44 MeV), 3 ^- (9. 64 MeV) and 4 ^+ (14. 08 MeV) states of ^ 12 C, and the 3 ^- (6. 13 MeV) and 2 ^+ (6. 92 MeV) states of ^ 16 O {{are included in the}} coupled channels calculations. The emergence of the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bow</b> is understood by the properties of both the Luneburg-lens-like potential in the internal region and diffuse attraction in the outer region. The {{existence of}} a supernumerary rainbow for inelastic scattering in addition to the {{existence of a}} dynamically created secondary rainbow and a dynamically refracted primary rainbow for elastic scattering, which are not observed in meteorological rainbows, further deepens the understanding of nuclear rainbows.

50|$|In certain circumstances, one {{or several}} narrow, faintly {{coloured}} bands {{can be seen}} bordering the violet edge of a rainbow; i.e., inside the primary bow or, much more rarely, outside the secondary. These extra bands are called supernumerary rainbows or supernumerary bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon {{is also known as}} a stacker rainbow. The <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows</b> are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual spectrum pattern. The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1 mm or less; the smaller the droplets are, the broader the supernumerary bands become, and the less saturated their colours. Due to their origin in small droplets, supernumerary bands tend to be particularly prominent in fogbows.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurements}} of radiance spectra of rainbows. The bows on two sunny days (3 and 6 June 2008) were {{produced by the}} fountain in the Parque de las Ciencias, Granada, Spain, that consists of a rectangular perimeter of 40 spray nozzles. Optical thickness of the spray from each nozzle was approxi-mately 0. 5. Spectral purity of the primary bow was highest for orange and blue, reaching values of 23 % and 7 %, respectively, while skylight 90 ° from the Sun had a color purity of 34 % (on 6 June). The secondary bow hadmuch lower color purity with red absent because the regions around the bows and in Alexander’s dark band were pale blue. The narrow sickle shape of the chromaticity curves for the primary bows {{and the absence of}} <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows</b> indicated that the drop radius was between 0. 2 and 0 : 4 mm. © 200...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive a {{physically}} based model for simulating rainbows. Previous techniques for simulating rainbows have used either geometric op-tics (ray tracing) or Lorenz-Mie theory. Lorenz-Mie theory {{is by far}} the most accurate technique as it takes into account optical effects such as dis-persion, polarization, interference, and diffraction. These effects are critical for simulating rainbows accurately. However, as Lorenz-Mie theory is re-stricted to scattering by spherical particles, it cannot be applied to real rain-drops which are non-spherical, especially for larger raindrops. We present the first comprehensive technique for simulating the interaction of a wave-front of light with a physically-based water drop shape. Our technique is based on ray tracing extended to account for dispersion, polarization, inter-ference, and diffraction. Our model matches Lorenz-Mie theory for spheri-cal particles, but it also enables the accurate simulation of non-spherical par-ticles. It can simulate many different rainbow phenomena including double rainbows and <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows.</b> We show how the non-spherical rain-drops influence the shape of the rainbows, and we provide a simulation of the rare twinned rainbow, which is believed to be caused by non-spherical water drops...|$|R
50|$|In theory, every rainbow is a circle, {{but from}} the ground, only its upper half can be seen. Since the rainbow's centre is {{diametrically}} opposed to the sun's position in the sky, more of the circle comes into view as the sun approaches the horizon, meaning that the largest section of the circle normally seen is about 50% during sunset or sunrise. Viewing the rainbow's lower half requires the presence of water droplets below the observer's horizon, as well as sunlight that is able to reach them. These requirements are not usually met when the viewer is at ground level, either because droplets are absent in the required position, or because the sunlight is obstructed by the landscape behind the observer. From a high viewpoint such as a high building or an aircraft, however, the requirements can be met and the full-circle rainbow can be seen. Like a partial rainbow, the circular rainbow can have a secondary <b>bow</b> or <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows</b> as well. It is possible to produce the full circle when standing on the ground, for example by spraying a water mist from a garden hose while facing away from the sun.|$|R
40|$|From {{the above}} discussion, we obtain the {{following}} result, where (1) represents {{the case of}} a point source, (2) a circular source: - (a) The positions of the maxima and minima of (2) approximately coincide with those of (1). Strictly speaking, the first maximum of (2) is displaced by a small amount towards θ= 0 as compared with (1), and for other maxima and minima this displacement becomes smaller and smaller. But the maxima of (2) may correspond to the minima of (1), and the minima to the maxima. (b) The value of (2), which corresponds to the maximum of (1), is smaller than that of (1), and the value of (2), which corresponds to the minimum of (1) is greater than that of (1). This difference between (1) and (2) increases with the value of Φ (i. e. with the increased diameter of the source). (c) As the value ofθ increases, the maximum value of (1) and (2) gradually decreases. While the minimum value of (1) always remains 0, the minimum value of (2) gradually increases until it becomes equal to the maximum value and assumes a stationary value, then the maxima and minima interchange, the difference of the maximum and minimum values at first increases and then decreases, then again assumes a stationary value, and so on. If in this interval between the two stationary values the maxima of 82) correspond to those of 81), then in the next interval the maxima of 82) correspond to the minima of 81). (d) For larger values of γ (radius of the drop) the intensity of (1) and (2) increase byγ 7 / 3. But at the same time for (2), the difference between the maximum and minimum values is diminished by another factor F. (e) The above is more manifestly shown {{in the case of the}} laboratory experiment with a cylindrical glass rod and a straight slit as the source of light. The stationary points of (2) at which the maximum value coincides with the minimum are easily found by χΦ = m x interval of the maximum and minimum of (1),where m represents an integer. (f) According to Airy's theory, the low of the distribution of the colours of the rainbow is independent of the magnitude of the drop. But in the case of the finite source, the colour distributions are changed by the magnitude of the drop, especially in the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows.</b> (g) The <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows</b> almost lose their colour as the consequence of the finiteness of the source. This effect is more remarkable when the drop becomes larger...|$|R
40|$|A Markov chain {{formalism}} {{is developed}} for computing {{the transport of}} polarized radiation according to Generalized Radiative Transfer (GRT) theory, which was developed recently to account for unresolved random fluctuations of scattering particle density and can also be applied to unresolved spectral variability of gaseous absorption as an improvement over the standard correlated-k method. Using Gamma distribution to describe the probability density function of the extinction or absorption coefficient, a shape parameter a that quantifies the variability is introduced, defined as the mean extinction or absorption coefficient squared divided by its variance. It controls the decay rate of a power-law transmission that replaces the usual exponential Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law. Exponential transmission, hence classic RT, is recovered when a→∞. The new approach is verified to high accuracy against numerical benchmark results obtained with a custom Monte Carlo method. For a<∞, angular reciprocity is violated {{to a degree that}} increases with the spatial variability, as observed for finite portions of real-world cloudy scenes. While the degree of linear polarization in liquid water cloudbows, <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows,</b> and glories is affected by spatial heterogeneity, the positions in scattering angle of these features are relatively unchanged. As a result, a single-scattering model based on the assumption of subpixel homogeneity can still be used to derive droplet size distributions from polarimetric measurements of extended stratocumulus clouds...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} on the optics of fogbows is scarce, and their polarization characteristics {{have never been}} measured to our knowledge. To fill this gap we measured the polarization features of 16 fogbows during the Beringia 2005 Arctic polar research expedition by imaging polarimetry in the red, green and blue spectral ranges. We present here the first polarization patterns of the fogbow. In the patterns {{of the degree of}} linear polarization p, fogbows and their <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows</b> are best visible in the red spectral range due to the least dilution of fogbow light by light scattered in air. In the patterns of the angle of polarization α fogbows are practically not discernible because their α-pattern is {{the same as that of}} the sky: the direction of polarization is perpendicular to the plane of scattering and is parallel to the arc of the bow, independently of the wavelength. Fogbows and their supernumeraries were best seen in the patterns of the polarized radiance. In these patterns the angular distance δ between the peaks of the primary and the first supernumerary and the angular width σ of the primary bow were determined along different radii from the center of the bow. δ ranged between 6. 08 ° and 13. 41 °, while σ changed from 5. 25 ° to 19. 47 °. Certain fogbows were relatively homogeneous, meaning small variations of δ and σ along their bows. Other fogbows were heterogeneous, possessing quite variable δ- and σ-values along their bows. This variability could be a consequence of the characteristics of the high Arctic with open waters within the ice shield resulting in the spatiotemporal change of the droplet size within the fo...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the time {{integrated}} detection of scattered femtosecond laser pulses, and illumination from a continuous wave semiconductor laser source with optical feedback and adaptable coherence length, is investigated for small particles. In this context the scattering function for small particles is numerically advanced. The angular distribution of local maxima of the scattering function is presented for small particles under ultrashort pulse illumination. The position of local maxima relating to scattering angle, particle size and refractive index is calculated with Fourier-Lorenz-Mie theory. Moreover, {{an estimate of}} the sensitivity of the scattering function to non-sphericity is presented, utilizing general Lorenz-Mie theory. For ultrashort pulse illumination the maxima of the <b>supernumerary</b> <b>bows</b> of the primary rainbow, which hold information on particle size and refractive index, are freed from disturbing interferences with reflection order and higher refractive order contributions. The presented results indicate the feasibility of precise in-situ measurements with Rainbow refractometry for highly spherical small particles with compact and cost-efficient sources of illumination and quantify the pulse duration or coherence length for the desired lower size range, which is essential information for future experimental studies. Moreover, a substantial reduction of morphology dependent resonances for microscopic water droplets is successfully demonstrated. For the first time, an electrodynamic Paul trap with novel geometry is applied to successfully observe the scattering of femtosecond laser pulses on small water droplets not only during a short period of milliseconds as in a droplet stream, but also over the temporal evolution of an evaporating droplet. Beyond Rainbow refractometry, the acquired results indicate the feasibility of new measurement techniques and the significant enhancement of existing methods. Under the aspect of the separation of scattering orders, interferometric particle imaging (IPI) is enhanceable by fitting the coherence length to the angle of detection. Illumination of small particles with femtosecond laser pulses is shown to facilitate direct size measurement from focused images of a thin spray by measurement of the intensity ratio of specific glare points on individual particles. Moreover, the smoothing of the diameter-intensity function for small particles allows for more precise determination of the Sauter mean diameter in the named size range. Due to the introduction of coherence length as a variable parameter for small particle characterization, the advantages of time integrated detection of femtosecond laser pulses scattered by small particles are underscored by the outlook of utilizing spatially compact and cost-efficient semiconductor laser devices with the important benefit of adjustable coherence length...|$|R
