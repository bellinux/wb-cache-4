25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>side</b> of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the <b>secondary</b> <b>side.</b> The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E
25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power {{is transferred to}} the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An {{induction motor}} resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the <b>secondary</b> <b>side.</b> Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.|$|E

When an error occurs, from Vds monitoring or power supply supervision for example, no information is provided {{about the origin of}} the problem. In this paper, we propose a solution that allows exchanging information (like the details of the errors, measurement of some key parameters or configuration data) between the primary and the <b>secondary</b> <b>sides</b> of the gate driver.

25|$|During power operation, {{heavy water}} was {{circulated}} by primary pumps through the U-tubes containing the fuel assemblies which heated the water. The heated water then flowed through an inverted U-tube steam generator where {{the heat was}} transferred to the <b>secondary</b> <b>side</b> light water which turned to steam. The steam flowed to an oil-fired superheater which increased the steam quality before the steam entered the turbine which spun the electrical generator. After passing through the steam generator, the primary loop water was pumped back to the reactor by the primary pumps to repeat the cycle. The primary loop heavy water was pressurized to ensure that the heavy water remained liquid and did not flash to steam at any point in the loop.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, <b>secondary</b> <b>side</b> of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E

500|$|In {{conventional}} graph {{representation of}} circuits, {{there is no}} means of explicitly representing mutual inductive couplings, such as occurs in a transformer, and such components {{may result in a}} disconnected graph with more than one separate part.

[...] This makes no difference to the theoretical behaviour of the circuit so analysis carried out on it is still valid. [...] It would, however, make a practical difference if a circuit were to be implemented this way in that it would destroy the isolation between the parts. [...] An example would be a transformer earthed on both the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>side.</b> [...] The transformer still functions as a transformer with the same voltage ratio but can now no longer be used as an isolation transformer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conversion}} to electrical energy takes place indirectly, as in conventional thermal power stations. The fission {{in a nuclear}} reactor heats the reactor coolant. The coolant may be water or gas or even liquid metal {{depending on the type}} of reactor. The reactor coolant then goes to a steam generator and heats water to produce steam. [...] The pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage steam turbine. After the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam, the remaining vapour is condensed in a condenser. The condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a <b>secondary</b> <b>side</b> such as a river or a cooling tower. The water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again. The water-steam cycle corresponds to the Rankine cycle.|$|E
2500|$|A {{drawback}} of resonant coupling {{theory is}} that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency {{of the system is}} no longer constant but [...] "splits" [...] into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be tuned to the new resonance peak. The case of using such a shifted peak is called [...] "Single resonant". The [...] "Single resonant" [...] systems have also been used, in which only the secondary is a tuned circuit. The principle of this phenomenon is also called [...] "(Magnetic) phase synchronization" [...] and already started practical application for AGV in Japan from around 1993.
