The specific gravity of the NaCl solution was 1.13  g/cm 3 for the selection of NT, gNAS 1, and gNAS 1 [*]+[*]gNAAT seeds. Because there were not enough seeds from the gIDS 3 line, gIDS 3 seeds were selected using 1.06  g/cm 3 NaCl solution. After size selection, the seeds were soaked overnight in fungicide solution (Momi-guard, Hokuko, Japan) and then soaked in water at 20 °C for 6  days to break dormancy. The seeds were then incubated in water at 30 °C overnight to accelerate germination. The seeds were <b>sown</b> <b>in</b> nursery <b>bed</b> soil by 3 April 2006.

60|$|As no {{variability}} {{of this kind}} can be detected in plants raised from seeds, the parents of which have grown during many successive generations in close proximity, we may infer that they cannot have intercrossed. What does occasionally occur {{is that in a}} row of plants raised from seeds of one variety, another variety true of its kind appears; for instance, in a long row of Scarlets (the seeds of which had been carefully gathered from Scarlets for the sake of this experiment) two Purples and one Painted Lady appeared.

Factorial arrangement of the following factors was used: three N rates (90, 120 and 150 kg pure N in hectare) and six different phonological stages (T 1 : using leaf color chart with number 4; T 2; 1 / 3 base fertilizer, 1 / 3 in rise primary bud stage, 1 / 3 in booting stage; T 3; 1 / 3 base fertilizer, 1 / 3 in tillering stage, 1 / 3 in rise primary bud stage; T 4 : 1 / 2 base fertilizer, 1 / 4 in tillering stage, 1 / 4 in booting stage; T 5 : 1 / 3 base fertilizer, 1 / 3 in tillering stage, 1 / 3 in booting stage; T 6; 2 / 3 base fertilizer, 1 / 3 in rise primary bud stage) with a control plot in each replication. After <b>sowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> nursery the twenty days old seedlings were transplanted in the experimental plots. Results of analysis of variance clearly showed significant differences between different phonological stages on many characteristics. Means differences were highly significant for grain yield. The T 6 treatment produced the highest yield of 8. 373 and 7. 920 t ha- 1 in two years, respectively. However, 120 kg N ha- 1 when applied as T 5, produced the highest yield (8. 760 t ha- 1). Combined analysis of variance showed that yield and yield components. were affected by time of N application. Combined comparison of means also showed that the T 5 treatment and 120 kg N ha- 1 produced the highest yield of 7. 925 and 7. 514 t ha- 1 {{in the first and}} second year, respectively. According to the results, it can be recommended that for Bahar hybrid rice maximum yield could be achieved by application of 120 kg N ha- 1 when split as defined in T 5 (1 / 3 based fertilizer + 1 / 3 first tillering stage + 1 / 3 booting stage).

The treated seeds including control were <b>sown</b> <b>in</b> sand <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> size 4. 6 x 0. 7 m 2 in a greenhouse at Horticulture Unit, Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Campus (UPMKB). After germination, plants were transferred into polybags. Each polybag contained 1. 2 kg blended growth medium with top soil, sand, and processed chicken dung ratio of 3 : 2 : 1. Standard procedures were used to observe and record the variables studied in this research. The experiment was designed as a 4 x 6 factorial Completely Randomized Design with 3 replications. Lethal dose 50 % of population (LD 50) was assayed. The study revealed that germination percentage, plant height, survival percentage, root length, root dry weight and shoot dry weight decreased with increasing dose of gamma ray. The 800 Gy gamma ray dose in particular had a pronounced effect on these morphological characteristics probably because of injury it might have caused to the seeds of the long bean. As a result, poor growth and development was noticed. The LD 50 for survival and height ranged between 600 - 800 Gy and 400 - 500 Gy, respectively.

40|$|A direct-seeded rice {{cultivation}} {{system has been}} widely adopted in Asian countries. Optimum germination and vigorous seedling growth under submergence are key traits {{for the practice of}} direct seeding. We studied the post-germination seedling vigour in Vietnamese lowland rice accessions based on three bio-parameters, shoot elongation growth under five-day submergence in water-filled test-tubes, seedling recovery rate five days after transferring submerged seedlings to pots with soil and seedling survival rate 21  days after <b>sowing</b> seeds <b>in</b> nursery <b>beds</b> and immediate incubation under submergence. A large diversity was found in seedling vigour thus estimated among the accessions. Significantly high correlations were observed among all three bio-parameters, verifying the contribution of seedling vigour to the manifestation of submergence tolerance at this critical stage of rice development. To examine the roles of anoxia/hypoxia-responsive genes, the expression of 17 candidate genes was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and compared between selected vigorous and non-vigorous groups of accessions. Transcripts of all but two genes showed marked accumulation in submerged seedlings. No differences, however, were found between the two contrasting groups. The observed common and coordinate expression of anoxia/hypoxia-induced genes suggests that they might assume roles in attaining baseline tolerance against submergence stress. It was also suggested that some unknown genetic factors are operating in determining cultivar/genotype-specific levels of submergence tolerance as assessed by post-germination seedling vigour...|$|R

The microtitration serum neutralization test was used, and antibody titers ≥ 1 : 8 were considered positive. The overall prevalence <b>in</b> 267 <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> various groups was 37. 8 % (range 20 - 86 %). The prevalence <b>in</b> <b>sows</b> maintained <b>in</b> total confinement {{was significantly lower}} than <b>in</b> <b>sows</b> not maintained <b>in</b> total confinement (p = 0. 01).
