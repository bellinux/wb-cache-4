Holloway owned a small fleet of windjammers that were engaged in the business of bringing coal from Southampton to the town quay.

500|$|Having {{found his}} {{substitute}} for the chorales, Tippett wrote off to America for a collection of spirituals. When this arrived, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one for every key situation in the oratorio". He chose five: [...] "Steal Away"; [...] "Nobody Knows the Trouble I See, Lord"; [...] "Go Down, Moses"; [...] "O, By and By"; and [...] "Deep River". The first, fourth and fifth of these are placed {{at the ends of}} the oratorio's three parts, [...] "Deep River" [...] as the finale expressing, according to Tippett, the hope of a fresh spring after a long, dark winter. [...] Kenneth Gloag, in his detailed analysis of the oratorio, writes: [...] "As well as constructing the pathway through the dramatic narrative, the five spirituals also combine to provide moments of focus and repose ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work". Tippett felt that the work encapsulated all his current political, moral and psychological preoccupations.|$|E

500|$|The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on Sunday, July 14 {{with the}} broad {{daylight}} abductions {{of two women}} from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah, [...] east of Seattle. Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as [...] "Ted," [...] he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him {{as far as his}} car, <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, and watched her leave the beach in his company. About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned. Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that one was forced to watch as the other was murdered—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis {{on the eve of his}} execution.|$|E

[...] Rabbi Johanan taught that [...] thus bears out the text of [...] "Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope ( [...] , sivro) is in the Lord his God." [...] Similarly, Resh Lakish taught that [...] "whose hope ( [...] , sivro) is in the Lord his God," [...] refers to Joseph, who was the hope for the entire world {{when he was in}} Egypt. And God showed Jacob that his hope ( [...] , sivro) was in Egypt, as [...] can be read, [...] "Now Jacob <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> hope ( [...] , sever) in Egypt." ...|$|E

Tylo said: [...] " [...] probably equally feels that Thorne deserves to {{have a shot at}} Forrester in the driver’s seat. Taylor does not like the way Brooke has been running everything through Ridge." [...] However, Tylo <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "sticky point" [...] between them because of Darla, and noted that Taylor [...] "would do anything to make up for that". The actress said, [...] "I think it’s very cool that there is so much history behind the two characters. First of all, it does not seem like a sexually based relationship. So I think the audience can appreciate it and go, 'Wow. [...] I can understand these two emotionally bonding,' and then let it grow into something that doesn’t look forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|After losing much of {{his fortune}} in a divorce {{settlement}} in 1987, George Lucas {{had no desire to}} return to Star Wars, and had unofficially canceled the sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. At that point, the prequels were only still a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of [...] "The Star Wars". Nevertheless, technical advances in the late 1980s and 1990s continued to fascinate Lucas, and he considered that they might make it possible to revisit his 20-year-old material. The popularity of the franchise was reinvigorated by the Star Wars expanded universe storylines set after the original trilogy films, such as the Thrawn trilogy of novels written by Timothy Zahn and the Dark Empire comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics. Due to the renewed popularity of Star Wars, Lucas <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing.|$|E
2500|$|Futurama {{was also}} revived in 2007 by Comedy Central for similar reasons: {{impressive}} viewership in syndication {{as well as}} high DVD sales. In 2006, Twentieth Television struck a deal to produce four direct-to-video animated features based on Futurama, and, in 2009, the series was revived in normal half-hour installments beginning in 2010 on Comedy Central. In a 2006 interview, Futurama creator Matt Groening explained [...] "There's a long, regal history of misunderstood TV shows, and to Fox's credit, the studio looked at the ratings on the Cartoon Network and how the show does overseas, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more money to be made." [...] Before Adult Swim lost the rights to Futurama reruns, they aired an all-night marathon on December 31, 2007, thus, marking Futurama's end on the block. On New Years Eve 2005, Adult Swim had a countdown {{for the new year}} featuring characters from the shows. Beginning on March 27, 2006 Adult Swim's time began at 10:30pm ET weekdays.|$|E

2500|$|At 09:40 {{the signal}} to {{withdraw}} was sent to all the assault forces - [...] "Vanquish 1100 hours". This presented great difficulties for the LCAs as they were designed best to beach on rising tides and the tide would not rise again for some hours. A few soldiers managed to swim out and {{be picked up by}} friendly craft but many more were killed in the attempt. Unarmoured craft could not come near the beach because the fire was too heavy. Several LCAs went in to evacuate troops, including the four surviving craft of the 10th LCA Flotilla, but suffered due to the intense fire from mortars and machine-guns; two 10th Flotilla craft were sunk. When Ferguson <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no sign of life on the beach, he reluctantly obeyed an order to withdraw. Only one craft, LCA 209, managed to touch down on Blue Beach for the evacuation and while taking wounded aboard it was unable to raise its ramp before it pushed off the beach. Grenades and mortar bombs added more casualties, and with men hanging on to LCA 209's sides, mortar bombs finally sank it. By 08:30 the Royal Regiment had surrendered.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{the seven years}} of plenty ended and famine struck, and when Egypt was famished, Joseph opened the storehouses, and sold food to the Egyptians. People from all {{countries}} came to Egypt to buy grain, because the famine struck all the earth. Jacob <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> grain in Egypt, asked his sons why they sat around looking at each other, and sent them down to Egypt to buy some. Ten of Joseph's brothers went down to Egypt, but Jacob kept Benjamin behind, so that no harm might befall him. Joseph's brothers came to buy grain from Joseph and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth. Joseph recognized his brothers, {{but they did not}} recognize him, for he made himself strange to them and spoke roughly with them. Joseph remembered his dreams, and accused them of being spies. But they protested that they were not spies, but upright men come to buy food, ten sons {{of a man who had}} twelve sons, lost one, and kept one behind. Joseph told them that to prove their story, they would have to send one of them to fetch their brother, and he imprisoned them for three days. On the third day, Joseph told them his plan, because he feared God. The fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|In 1551 Philip [...] {{received}} all {{the minor}} orders, and was ordained deacon, and finally priest (on 23 May). He {{thought of going}} to India as a missionary, but was dissuaded by his friends who <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> abundant {{work to be done}} in Rome. Accordingly, he settled down, with some companions, at the Hospital of San Girolamo della Carità, and while there tentatively began, in 1556, the institute with which his name is more especially connected, that of the Oratory. The scheme at first {{was no more than a}} series of evening meetings in a hall (the Oratory), at which there were prayers, hymns, and readings from Scripture, the church fathers, and the Martyrology, followed by a lecture, or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration. The musical selections (settings of scenes from sacred history) were called oratorios. Giovanni Palestrina was one of Philip’s followers, and composed music for the services. The scheme was developed, and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout Rome, notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening, a completely new idea at that time. He also spent much of his time hearing confessions, and effected many conversions in this way. [...] Philip [...] sometimes led “excursions” to other churches, often with music and a picnic on the way.|$|E
