40|$|Our {{understanding}} {{of the evolution of}} domestication has changed radically in the past 10 years, from a relatively simplistic rapid origin scenario to a protracted complex process in which plants adapted to the human environment. The adaptation of plants continued as the human environment changed with the expansion of agriculture from its centres of origin. Using archaeogenomics and computational models, we can observe genome evolution directly and understand how plants adapted to the human environment and the regional conditions to which agriculture expanded. We have applied various archaeogenomics approaches as exemplars to study local adaptation of barley to drought resistance at Qasr Ibrim, Egypt. We show the utility of DNA capture, ancient RNA, methylation patterns and DNA from charred remains of archaeobotanical <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> <b>low</b> latitudes where preservation conditions restrict ancient DNA research to within a Holocene timescale. The genomic level of analyses that is now possible, and the complexity of the evolutionary process of local adaptation means that plant studies are set to move to the genome level, and account for the interaction of genes under selection in systems-level approaches.

40|$|Background: Whole genome {{amplification}} (WGA) is a challenging, key step in metagenomic {{studies of}} samples containing minute amounts of DNA, such as <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> <b>low</b> biomass environments. It {{is well known}} that multiple displacement amplification (MDA), the most commonly used WGA method for microbial samples, skews the genomic representation in the sample. We have combined MDA with droplet microfluidics to perform the reaction in a homogeneous emulsion. Each droplet in this emulsion can be considered an individual reaction chamber, allowing partitioning of the MDA reaction into millions of parallel reactions with only one or very few template molecules per droplet. Results: As a proof-of-concept, we amplified genomic DNA from a synthetic metagenome by MDA either in one bulk reaction or in emulsion and found that after sequencing, the species distribution was better preserved and the coverage depth was more evenly distributed across the genomes when the MDA reaction had been performed in emulsion. Conclusions: Partitioning MDA reactions into millions of reactions by droplet microfluidics is a straightforward way to improve the uniformity of MDA reactions for amplifying complex samples with limited amounts of DNA...|$|R

At Rote island, <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> the <b>lowest</b> emergent reef (c. 1 - 2 m) on both north and south sides of the island yield late Holocene ages and an average short-term uplift rate of c. 1 - 1. 5 m per 1000 years.

30|$|In 1970, Senchukov and Shmurak {{discovered}} that the DL hysteresis existing under both elastic and plastic deformation is consistent with electrons being released from F-centers as cited in [1]. At low stresses, dislocation lines bend elastically about their pinning points (point defects). As they bend, electrons are released from the F-centers [1]. The electrons will then combine with luminescent centers to produce DL. In 1969, Shmurak showed that {{the total number of}} photons emitted from irradiated KCl is proportional to the area swept out by the dislocation lines as cited in [1]. It was also {{discovered that}} after removing the <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> <b>low</b> stress, the dislocation lines return to their original positions by the tensions acting along these lines. As they do, they move through the regions of the crystal cleared of F-centers. To produce new luminescence, a stress must be applied which will bend the dislocation lines further than in the previous cycle. At even higher stresses, a dislocation line will unpin itself. This freely moving dislocation processes a glide in the crystal. This is consistent with the observation that the DL peaks which occur during plastic deformation do so in the glide region of the stress–strain curve [1].|$|R
40|$|Two sets {{of cooling}} {{experiments}} were run at 500 MPa conditions for one anhydrous and one hydrous (H 2 O= 1. 3 wt. %) starting basaltic melts: a) five cooling rates (15, 9. 4, 3, 2. 1, and 0. 5 °C/min) between 1250 and 1000 °C, and b) a 0. 5 °C/min cooling rate from 1250 to 1191, 1167, 1100, 1090, 1075, 1050, 1025 and 1000 °C final temperatures. Cooling rate {{plays a major}} role in the differentiation of run products. At the lower cooling rate, glasses of tephri-phonolitic and trachy-andesitic composition have been detected. At comparable cooling rate, the dry glasses show a larger compositional variability and degree of differentiation than the hydrous products. The amount of crystallizing solid phases is always larger in the dry products. It is strongly controlled by both cooling rate and water content and massive crystallization occurs only at lower cooling rates. At a constant cooling rate, massive crystallization is observed at lower temperatures. Clinopyroxene, plagioclase and oxide occur in the anhydrous products, whereas plagioclase crystallization is suppressed in the hydrous ones. The lack of plagioclase results from the faster crystallization kinetics for Feand Mg-bearing phases than for tectosilicates. Textural coarsening occurs at high cooling rate and, for a constant cooling rate, at higher temperatures. The textural and compositional variability observed at the margin of dikes may not mirror flow differentiation processes but could be due to cooling rate variations. Early homogeneous magma batches subjected to cooling rate-induced differentiation may also produce heterogeneous rocks similar to that originated by magma mingling. Cooling rate-related differentiation influences the physical properties (viscosity and density) of magmas. Dry or H 2 O-poor magmas resulting <b>from</b> <b>low</b> <b>cooling</b> rate differentiation are not allowed to rise within dikes. Viscosity variations induced by cooling rate may be responsible for flow localization within conduits. The effects of cooling rate should be incorporated in fluid-mechanical models of magma ascent...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} algorithm, Hierarchical ISOmetric Self-Organizing Map (H-ISOSOM), for a concise, {{organized}} manifold representation of complex, non-linear, large scale, high-dimensional input {{data in a}} low dimensional space. The main contribution of our algorithm is threefold. First, we modify the previous ISOSOM algorithm by a local linear interpolation (LLI) technique, which maps the data <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> <b>low</b> dimensional space back to high dimensional space and makes the complete mapping pseudo-invertible. The modified-ISOSOM (M-ISOSOM) follows the global geomet-ric structure of the data, and also preserves local geomet-ric relations to reduce the nonlinear mapping distortion and make the learning more accurate. Second, we propose the H-ISOSOM algorithm for the computational complexity problem of Isomap, SOM and LLI and the nonlinear com-plexity problem of the highly twisted manifold. H-ISOSOM learns an organized structure of a non-convex, large scale manifold and represents it {{by a set of}} hierarchical organized maps. The hierarchical structure follows a coarse-to-fine strategy. According to the coarse global structure, it “un-folds ” the manifold at the coarse level and decomposes the sample data into small patches, then iteratively learns the nonlinearity of each patch in finer levels. The algorithm si-multaneously reorganizes and clusters the data samples in a low dimensional space to obtain the concise representa-tion. Third, we give quantitative comparisons of the pro-posed method with similar methods on standard data sets. Finally, we apply H-ISOSOM to the problem of appearance-based hand pose estimation. Encouraging experimental re-sults validate the effectiveness and efficiency of H-ISOSOM. 1...|$|R

Methane formation was measured in all enrichments and correlated with metal weight loss. Methanogens were prominently represented in pipeline solids <b>samples,</b> scraped <b>from</b> the inside of a pipeline, comprising over 85 % of all pyrosequencing reads.

Here we report the optimization and use of SAWN as a nebulization technique for the introduction of <b>samples</b> <b>from</b> a <b>low</b> flow of liquid, and the interfacing of SAWN with liquid chromatographic separation (LC) {{for the analysis of}} a protein digest. This demonstrates that SAWN can be a viable, low-energy alternative to ESI for the LC-MS analysis of proteomic samples...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effect of heat {{treatment}} upon the wear resistance of low and high carbon steels as determined by the ball on a plate wear-testing machine (diamond indenter) under combined action of rolling and sliding friction under pressures. Total ten samples of the steel (5 <b>samples</b> each <b>from</b> <b>low</b> carbon and high carbon range) were subjected to five different heat treatments i. e. annealing, normalizing, oil quenching, water delay quenching and water quenching heated to a temperature of 960 ¢ªC. One from each heat treated types was prepared for microstructural and hardness studies. The hardness of the five different heat treated samples was measured by Vickers hardness testing machine. Optical microscopies to study the microstructure and Scanning electron microscopic analysis of wear surface have been done...|$|R
