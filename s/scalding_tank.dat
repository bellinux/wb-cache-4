40|$|Poultry {{slaughtering}} {{encompasses a}} series of processing steps {{with the objective of}} harvesting the consumable meat. The scalding process consists of the submersion of carcasses in hot water tanks to facilitate the removal of feathers during slaughter. However, the use of a common <b>scalding</b> <b>tank</b> increases the likelihood of carcass cross contamination considering that dirt, fecal material and even digestive and intestinal contents carrying pathogens and other bacteria are widely spread during this operation. Similar cross contamination occurs in the process of chilling carcasses, which also requires submersion of broilers in communal tanks filled with ice and cold water. A plausible approach to reduce contamination in scalders or chillers is the use of Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) to decontaminate scalder/ chiller water. PEF uses electricity to kill bacteria suspended in liquid media and could be utilized in poultry scalders and chillers to reduce bacterial contamination on carcasses and reduce the potential risk of pathogens reaching the final consumer. A pilot scale system was assembled by the use of a pulse electric field generator (Model SF- 700, Simmons. Eng. Co., Dallas, GA) coupled with a commercial <b>scalding</b> <b>tank</b> (Dunkmaster?, Knase Company Inc, MI). C. coli and C. jejuni along with marker strains of Novobiocin and Nalidixic acid resistant S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis strains were used in challenge studies evaluating the effects of the PEF on carcasses, scalder and chiller water contamination. The system was evaluated with 0, 0. 5, and 1 % sodium chloride in the water with 40 volts of electric current and 0. 54 of amperage. Samples were collected at 0, 40, 80, 160, 200 s of treatment with a 10 s on, 5 s off cyclical pulses. The use of PEF in regular scalder/chiller water showed little effect on Salmonella and Campylobacter reductions. However, with the addition of 0. 5 % NaCl caused a significant (P< 0. 5) log CFU/ml reduction of Salmonella and Campylobacter within the scalder/chiller water at 40, 80, and 160 seconds respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{very high}} {{proportion}} (75 %) of the pigs slaughtered in Hong Kong {{were found to}} be infected with salmonellas. Seven serotypes including Salmonella choleraesuis were isolated but the majority (91 %) were S. anatum and S. derby. These serotypes, especially S. anatum and S. derby, had been isolated frequently from clinical cases, symptomless carries and in this study from abattoir workers, suggesting that the pig was a significant source for human salmonella infection. The majority of pigs slaughtered are imported and the high level of apparent infection was thought to be due to cross-infection during transport of the pigs under stress. S. anatum and S. derby were also isolated from pigs at 60 degreesC for 5 min caused no great reduction in the degree of superficial contamination.

40|$|There {{is growing}} public {{concern about the}} {{well-being}} of animals in modern intensive husbandry systems. Much of this concern is well-founded, especially regarding the poultry industry where throughout the world many millions of broilers are transformed into poultry meat every day. Most people who worry about the way broilers are housed and raised are too squeamish to give any thought to the slaughter process. This report by the Compassion in World Farming Trust highlights the fact that procedures in far too many poultry slaughterhouses do not ensure that the birds are adequately stunned, leaving an unknown number alive, and some still conscious, when they enter the <b>scalding</b> <b>tank.</b> This {{is not a new}} problem, nor is it one incapable of resolution. The report summarises the latest scientific views on the current density and the arrangement of the stunners required to ensure that all birds are either dead or stunned before being bled out by severing both carotid arteries.

40|$|Salmonella spp. {{is one of}} the {{important}} foodborne pathogens, and the slaughtering process is recognized as a potential point of contamination and the spread of the pathogens. The three objectives of this study are first, to quantify the contamination levels of Salmonella spp. in pig skins and carcasses, second, to evaluate the outcomes from different pig supply sources and different practices at three critical steps (scalding, splitting, and washing) for Salmonella spp. contamination, and third, to assess risk of Salmonella spp. contamination in pork products after slaughtering level. The study was performed in three representative slaughterhouses in Chiang Mai and Lamphun provinces, Thailand. Investigation conducted from May 2013 through October 2013 found the overall prevalence and contamination levels mean to be 11. 85 % and 0. 34 MPN/cm 2, respectively. There was no statistically significant in Salmonella spp. prevalence and contamination levels detected with different patterns at the slaughterhouses which were supplied pigs from either co-operative or integrated farms. Factors found to reduce Salmonella spp. loads on carcasses included good practices, e. g., regular changing of water in the <b>scalding</b> <b>tank</b> after each batch and the use of chlorine in the washing step. Risk of Salmonella spp. contamination of pork products at the final stage of slaughtering was nearly 10 %.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model of {{inactivation}} of Campylobacter jejuni in industrial scalding of chickens. Models can be used as a guide for broiler slaughterhouse operations for reducing levels of C. jejuni contamination on broiler carcasses. Mean concentrations of C. jeuni in terms of colony farming units (CFU) in <b>scald</b> <b>tank</b> water and in carcass rinse solution after scalding were 2. 90 ± 0. 07 and 3. 86 ± 0. 11 LogCFU/ml, respectively. <b>Scald</b> <b>tank</b> water temperature, flow rate, pH, and total solids in scalding process water were 54. 15 ± 0. 2 °C, 172. 0 ± 8. 4 L/min, 8. 0 ± 0. 01, and 2, 565 ± 114. 3 mg/L, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT Scald {{water and}} whole carcass rinse samples were {{collected}} on 9 different d in a commercial broiler processing plant operating adjacent lines that processed birds from the same flock simultaneously. A conventional, single-tank, two-pass scalder was installed on one line and the other line had a three-tank, two-pass, counterflow scalder in which water mixed across the two lines of carcasses within each tank. Water samples from the turn around point in each tank were analyzed for aerobic bacteria and suspended solids. At {{the same time that}} water samples were taken, six carcasses were removed from the processing line immediately after feather removal and rinsed in 100 mL of phosphate-buffered saline; recovered rinse solution was analyzed for aerobic bacteria using a most probable number procedure. Estimated numbers of aerobic bac-teria were significantly reduced in the third tank of the counterflow scalder compared to the second tank, or compared to the single tank of the conventional scalder. Despite the differences in aerobic bacteria between <b>scald</b> <b>tanks,</b> numbers of aerobic bacteria in carcass rinses were not affected by scalder design. Organic and total solids were significantly reduced in the third tank of the counterflow scalder compared to the first and second tanks, and in the third tank of the counterflow scalder compared to the conventional scalder.

40|$|ABSTRACT Predetermined {{areas from}} 24 {{selected}} {{pieces of equipment}} in thirteen Georgia poultry processing plants were swabbed prior to start-up and before and after midday cleanup on two consecutive days {{in an attempt to}} detect potential sources of contamination and to determine the effectiveness of the cleanup procedure. A moistened calcium alginate swab was used to take samples {{from the surface of the}} equipment. A one percent sodium citrate solution was used in making serial dilutions. Significantly less contamination of equipment was found on Mondays than Tuesdays. Picker fingers were found to be the most difficult piece of equipment to clean. Knives and scissors used in the evisceration procedure and in cut-up operations were found to be highly contaminated before start-up in most of the plants surveyed which indicated inadequate clean-up. When <b>scald</b> <b>tanks</b> and chillers were permitted to overflow during lunch break, a dilution effect occurred which reduced the microbial load. Microbial counts of ice ranged from a low of 10 to a high of 4, 500 per ml. Packaging materials were found to have higher microbial counts prior to start-up than before or after lunch break. Gloves were found to be more highly con-taminated than the hands of the employees wearing the gloves.

During operations and after 75 - 100 pigs were processed we collected 185 samples. The prevalence of Salmonella spp in 4 visits was 9. 09, 15. 22, 6. 38 and 2. 13 % respectively. The prevalence in <b>scalding</b> <b>tank</b> overflow water, floors, workers’ hands, workers’ knives, livers tank, pork carcasses, livers, and tongue surfaces and ileoceacal lymph nodes and caecal contents samples was 14. 2 % (range: 0 - 50), 11. 1 % (0 %- 50 %), 0 %, 0 %, 0 %, 2. 5 % (0 - 10), 2. 5 % (0 - 20), 2. 5 % (0 - 20), 15 % (0 - 40) and 35 % (0 - 80) respectively.

40|$|Contamination {{of fresh}} meat by {{pathogenic}} and spoilage microorganisms can occur at any {{stage of the}} slaughter process. Pathogens which are frequently found in fresh meat and which pose a public health problem include Salmonella spp. Campylobacter spp. and Yersinia spp. Contamination with spoilage bacteria affects the storage stability and shelf life of meats. Factors that contribute to meat spoilage include physical damage, biochemical changes in the meat tissues and the activity of microorganisms, of which bacteria are undoubtedly the most important. Fresh meats present a rich medium {{for the support of}} microbial growth and will ultimately be rendered unacceptable to consumers as a consequence of spoilage due to such growth. The source of spoilage bacteria can be the slaughter animals themselves, the environment, water and personnel working in the processing plants. This study was conducted to determine the effect of some processing operations on the level of contamination of the pig carcass with aerobic bacteria and to establish microbial quality control points based on the Hazards Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. As a component of the HACCP system and a step in the setting up of an HACCP plan for microbial quality control of fresh carcass meat, this study aims at identifying hazards at various stages of processing, evaluating preventive measures and establishing critical control points. Where appropriate, corrective measures to ensure that bacterial contamination is within an acceptable level are recommended. The study was carried out at a processing plant in the North Island of New Zealand during the period April to July 1998. Based on observations at the plant, a flow chart of pig processing was drawn up. A number of processing stages were selected as points where potential risks of bacterial contamination were most likely to occur. These points initially included dehairing, polishing and scraping, evisceration, and inspection. Eight visits to the abattoir were made and a total of 32 paired swab samples from carcasses at each process stage were collected. With four process stages selected for sampling, the total number of samples was 128. In addition, 12 <b>scalding</b> <b>tank</b> water samples were collected for analysis. All samples were processed in the Microbiology Laboratory at Massey University. The aerobic plate count (APC) technique employing incubation at 30 °C for 3 days was used for enumeration of aerobic bacteria. A matrix table was designed for entering APC data after each count. The mean of colony forming units per square cm (CFU/cm 2) for pig carcass surfaces and CFU/ml for scalding water were calculated and log 10 transformation was performed. The highest mean APC was found after the carcasses had passed the dehairing machine (5. 1 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 57) and the lowest number before the dehairing step (4. 31 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 61). A rapid increase in APC at the dehairing stage indicated a heavy recontamination of the pig carcass with bacteria from the equipment and from detritus accumulated during the operation. After the operation, the count gradually decreased to 4. 4 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 38 at the post-evisceration point but then slightly rose again to 4. 5 log 10 /cm 2, ST. D. = 0. 4 at the post-inspection step. The increase in the APC at the dehairing stage by 0. 8 log 10 /cm 2 (p = 0. 0002, n = 16) is significant. There was little change in the APC at the polishing and scraping and evisceration stages. There was an insignificant difference of 0. 2 log 10 /cm 2 in the APC between samples taken at the start {{and at the end of}} the shift. The scalding water temperature fluctuated between 60 °C and 67. 5 °C (mean = 63. 2, n = 12). Bacterial contamination of the scalding water remained almost unchanged with time (2. 55 log 10 /ml at the beginning and 2. 62 log 10 /ml at the end of the shift). An expected inverse correlation between scalding water counts and water temperature could not be verified. Although this study is confined to the microbiological assessment of only a few operational stages that can contribute to the storage quality of fresh pork, the results showed that recontamination of the pig carcass at the dehairing stage is serious and may pose potential safety and quality hazards. Control of bacterial contamination at this step is likely to have a beneficial effect on the microbial quality and safety of the final products. A quality Critical Control Point should be established at the dehairing step which can be considered as a safety CCP as well. However, some technological modification at this step such as installation of hot water showers to make the operation "specifically designed", may be needed to meet the criteria for establishing a CCP. At the polishing and scraping step the results of the study indicated a slight decline in bacterial numbers, provided that brushing and washing of the carcasses was done properly. Any deviation from the normal procedure e. g. inadequate water supply to the brush and scraping table, reduced frequency of hand and knife washing, or increased frequency of touching the carcass by the worker's hands, is likely to result in an increased level of bacterial contamination. Monitoring measures and corrective actions at this stage could be crucial for maintaining an effective CCP. At the evisceration step, preventive measures such as plugging or tying the anus should be considered. This step could be an important CCP for both quality and safety. Further investigations are required to assess the effect of meat inspection procedures on the spread of bacteria from multiple incisions of lymph nodes, internal organs and tonsils. If this step were to be considered a CCP, it would mainly have safety implications...|$|E
40|$|Suspended {{bacteria}} were enumerated in scald {{water and}} carcass rinse samples from a commercial broiler chicken processing plant with a multiple-tank, counterflow scalder.

Mean coliform concentrations in Tanks 1, 2, and 3 were 4. 6, 2. 5, and 1. 6 log 10 (cfu/ml), respectively. E. coli concentrations followed the same pattern with means of 4. 4, 2. 1, and 1. 4 in Tanks 1, 2, and 3, respectively, with significant differences (P< 0. 05) in the concentrations of both coliforms and E. coli between tanks. Mean Campylobacter concentration in four positive samples from Tank 1 was 4. 0 log 10 (cfu/ml), but only one water sample from Tank 2 and none from Tank 3 were Campylobacter positive. Coliforms and E. coli were found in dip tank samples in only two instances, with no isolations of Campylobacter or salmonellae. Mean numbers of coliforms, E. coli, and Campylobacter in carcass rinses were 3. 1, 2. 7, and 3. 3 log 10 (cfu/ml).

40|$|One {{objective}} of the present investigation was to compare Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery incidence from commercially processed turkeys immediately prior to and following pre-chill and immersion chiller intervention strategies being used in three distinct turkey processing facilities. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 100 carcass rinse samples prior to and following each post-evisceration, pre-chill intervention and following immersion chilling were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Two of three plants demonstrated a trend of decreased Salmonella on carcasses following the Inside Outside Bird Wash (IOBW), with reductions of 13 %, and 11 % being observed for Plants 1 and 2, respectively. Results for reductions of Campylobacter contamination were not as straightforward, with only Plant 3 showing decreased levels (11 % reduction) following the IOBW. Plant 2 used an additional pre-chill intervention, a low pressure, acetic acid final wash, which was not shown {{to be effective in}} causing an additional reduction in either Salmonella or Campylobacter on carcasses. In all three plants, properly managed immersion chilling systems were the most effective microbial intervention for achieving Salmonella andCampylobacter reduction on processed turkey carcasses. While not as effective, the IOBW present in each plant likely contributed to the effectiveness of immersion chiller interventions. If managed properly these intervention points have demonstrated themselves as a viable means to effectively reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter on processed turkeys. Another objective was to modify the scalder environment to an alkaline pH and determine the effects of thermal killing of Salmonella and Campylobacter. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 50 carcass rinse samples prior to and following <b>scald</b> <b>tank</b> immersion and following feather removal were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Modification of the scald water to alkaline conditions (pH 9 - 10) did not result in increased thermal killing of Salmonella or Campylobacter on turkey carcasses, as hypothesized before the investigation. Alkaline conditions are known to facilitate a more efficacious pluck and aid in the detachment of bacteria. Due to this, the bacteria that were recovered at these points on the processing line could have {{had an impact on the}} observed data...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 31 - 35). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Several alternative sampling methods have been recently evaluated for detection of Salmonella on broiler carcasses during commercial processing. The present study evaluated and compared four sampling techniques: carcass rinse, vent skin flap sampling, thoracic skin flap sampling, and the FSIS approved sponge method in a turkey processing plant. Carcass rinse was consistently and significantly superior to tested alternatives for the detection of Salmonella in this plant. Salmonella recovery using the carcass rinse technique on split flocks at the re-hang area from 2 different scald systems suggested that countercurrent water flow improved the microbiological quality when temperatures were similar. However, elevations of the concurrent <b>scald</b> <b>tank</b> temperature eliminated the apparent benefit of directional flow. In contrast to most previously-reported observations in broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery did not increase during processing and a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower overall recovery incidence from 4 flocks was observed immediately pre-chill as compared to post-feather removal. Also in contrast to previously-reported data from broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery incidence in the turkey ceca was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in the crop in 9 flocks evaluated. These data suggest that microbiological investigations to determine plant-specific critical control points in turkey plants are warranted prior to implementation of intervention strategies. After evaluation of turkey processing, we evaluated broiler carcasses in a commercial broiler processing plant for Salmonella incidence on carcasses that had been passed or retained by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) with regard to visible fecal or ingesta contamination. Contaminated and non-contaminated carcasses were removed from the processing line at the site of FSIS inspection (pre-immersion chilling) and subjected to the carcass rinse sampling procedure for Salmonella incidence recovery. Broiler flocks were evaluated over a 2 day period. Although a numerical association of increasing Salmonella recovery with visible contamination was observed, no significant (P < 0. 05) differences in Salmonella recovery incidence were identified in any single flock or combined data when evaluated. These data suggest that focus on organoleptic parameters of inspection may result in disappointing microbiologic improvements in broiler carcass quality...|$|R
