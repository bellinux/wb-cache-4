50|$|In shipyards, bucket {{wheels are}} used for the {{continuous}} loading and unloading of ships, where they pick up material from the yard for transfer to the delivery system. Bucket chains {{can be used to}} unload material from a ship's hold. TAKRAF's continuous <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> is capable of removing up to 95% of the material from a ship's hold, owing to a flexibly-configured digging attachment.|$|E
50|$|The plant uses a {{continuous}} <b>ship</b> <b>unloader,</b> {{the only one}} of its type in the continental United States. The solid fuel is transferred from barges onto the fuel conveyor system, which in turn transports it to the two largest fuel storage domes in North America. Pet coke and coal travel from the ship to the domes in about twenty minutes, entirely inside a sealed system to prevent dust particles from escaping into the surrounding environment.|$|E
50|$|The Belledune {{plant is}} {{attractive}} for shipping {{as it is}} situated {{on the shore of}} Chaleur Bay adjacent to a ship-unloading pier; Terminal II at the Port of Belledune was built in 1991-1992 by the Canada Ports Corporation as part of the Belledune Generating Station project. Terminal II has a 307 metre long wharf with a 28 metre wide apron and depth alongside of 15.9 metres, thus capable of handling up to Capesize vessels of 100,000 DWT. An automated coal continuous <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> moves coal at 1750 metric tonnes per hour to stockpiles adjacent to the plant.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews methodologies {{for fatigue}} {{analysis}} {{with emphasis on}} <b>ship</b> <b>unloaders.</b> Maintaining the performance of <b>ship</b> <b>unloaders</b> at a satisfactory level is essential for any port 2 ̆ 7 s operation in order {{to comply with the}} global demand of shipping and trading. <b>Ship</b> <b>unloaders</b> are subject to alternating operational loadings and to adverse environmental conditions, and as a result, they show a rapid rate of deterioration that makes them susceptible to failure by cumulative damage processes such as corrosion and fatigue. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review key features of the most common methodologies for fatigue analysis and to underline the limitations and uncertainties involved. Finally, developments in reliability-based approaches are suggested for a more accurate fatigue assessment of <b>ship</b> <b>unloaders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is hard {{to acquire}} the failure data of <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> and the {{mean time to failure}} is not {{independent}} identically distributed, and there are many defects existed in the maintenance method such as high cost and bad effect. In this work, we propose a method based on Weibull Distribution model to deal with the failure data of a large-scale grab <b>ship</b> <b>unloader,</b> build up the model of MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) and preventive maintenance time, and show the example with failure data, which provides references to maintenance of the <b>ship</b> <b>unloader.</b> Finally, we present the decision process of the reliability-centered maintenance strategy, maintenance type of the grab <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> and the maintenance of the key parts, which provides scientific decision support for the maintenance of the <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> equipments...|$|E
40|$|The {{main problem}} of the {{presence}} of high velocity winds that will cause the unloader to move from its position and cause damages to the cargo and the machineryfor grab type <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> is solved using a spring loaded hydraulic rail clamp mounted on a rail on which it can move to the ship and unload materials steadily. Data collected from the FACT department about the wind characteristic of the area for a particular period were used and the wind loads acting on the <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> is calculated. The maximum wind load that the <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> can withstand which has to be the one at which the spring loaded hydraulic clamp will disable is calculated After carefully studying the already existing clamping system, we found that using an alternative spring concentrically, we can increase the wind load capacity which is the maximum load the clamp can withstand. After carefully analyzing different springs we found that with the use of concentric spring, the clamp can withstand a higher amount of wind load, thus increasing the performance of <b>ship</b> <b>unloader.</b> This is proved by spring load calculations and using Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS software...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} most common causes of failure in ship unloaders. The {{structural}} forms employed {{in the design of}} ship unloaders and the characteristics of the loads acting on these structures are introduced first. Then, typical failures including overloading, joint failure, cable breaking, corrosion and fatigue failure amongst others, are described. Fatigue failure is discussed in further detail. When assessing a <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> for fatigue, it is necessary to define the fatigue demand and the fatigue strength capacity of those structural details under investigation. The latter experiences stress cycles that accumulate over time until reaching a limit that leads to cracking. Loads and stresses need to be monitored to describe those cycles, and critical locations must be checked to prevent a catastrophic failure...|$|E

There are three belts from the Harbour which bring the coal into the plant via six <b>ship</b> <b>unloaders,</b> 2 bucket type and four screw type.

30|$|It {{is a big}} {{challenge}} to reduce part weight without decreasing its performance. Many scholars have conducted the research on this topic. Nguyen et al. [3] presented a heuristic optimization method in combination with additive manufacturing for synthesizing large mesoscale lattice structure of complex shaped parts. Park et al. [4] proposed a weight reduction design process of suspension link, {{which was based on}} the variation of von-Mises stress contour by substituting an aluminum alloys (A 356) having tensile strength of 310 MPa grade instead of STKM 11 A steels. Raj et al. [5] evaluated the performance of two different design configurations of a bimetal brake drum by means of dynamometer test in order to improve heat dissipation and to reduce its weight. Zhang et al. [6] used the orthogonal experiment method to optimize the structure of <b>ship</b> <b>unloader</b> and realized the light weight design. Tan et al. [7] proposed a linkage-based evolutionary design method of the part structure to solve the unified representation problem between the geometric elements and the design intent attached to the geometric elements. Zhang et al. [8] established the design guidelines of equivalent static toughness for using aluminum hubs and rims instead of the original steel components to reduce the weight of action components of heavy vehicle. Qu et al. [9] proposed an algorithm by combining ant colony algorithm with a mutation-based local search and used for a real crane metal structure optimal design.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the impact of}} dynamic amplification factors in remaining fatigue life assessment of <b>ship</b> <b>unloaders.</b> In practice, the widely accepted procedure for these structures is {{to carry out a}} fatigue life assessment envisages: (1) carrying out static analysis, (2) taking into account dynamics via the application of dynamic amplification factors, and (3) applying Miner's rule. This factor, provided by the standard, is applied to the structure as a whole without considering the vibration of each structural member individually. This paper characterizes the dynamic behavior of each element using location-based dynamic amplification factors estimated from measurements. This caters for a more accurate assessment of the structure, whilst maintaining the simplicity of the standard procedure...|$|R
