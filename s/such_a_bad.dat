25|$|Two Mark 3 {{sets were}} stored at Dundalk post {{withdrawal}} {{and it was}} reported that their bodies were in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> state that they could not be brought to Dublin to be scrapped. Since the poor condition of the coaches precluded their transferral to Dublin for scrap, they were scrapped where they stood in Dundalk yard on 10 February 2014.|$|E
25|$|The first chapel of the Convent, {{which had}} been built around 1850, was in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{condition}} {{that it was necessary}} to build a new one. At the end of the 19th century, the Sisters started fund-raising by various means for the new chapel. The old one was becoming so dangerous that the Sisters decided to celebrate mass in Caldwell House.|$|E

25|$|After the war a {{substantial}} amount of residential housing, particularly to the east of modern Stoke Newington, in Hackney borough at the time, had been either destroyed or left in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> state that it was seen by the urban planners of that era as better to demolish it. Postwar redevelopment has replaced many of these areas with large estates, some more successful than others. Much of this residential redevelopment was planned by Frederick Gibberd, the designer of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was dire, {{and at the}} time of Sir Thomas's death in 1349 the construction of the Priory was still not fully complete. Since then – with the decline in finances – the Priory had fallen into an even worse state of disrepair. In a report issued to Pope John XXIII (Antipope) in 1411 it was revealed that a gale had blown down the bell-tower, ruining the church and other buildings and that a fire had destroyed the Priory gateway and nearby offices. The Priory was in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> state of disrepair it afforded poor accommodation for those living there.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe, naturally, {{could not}} answer this, {{and they were}} up against a much {{stronger}} bowling attack than their own. The openers Brendan Taylor and Stuart Carlisle survived 14 overs, scoring 62 runs, but Chris Cairns and Andre Adams inspired a collapse to 123 for 6. At one point, Zimbabwe threatened to break the record of highest ODI defeat ever (256 runs), but 45 from Heath Streak, including two sixes, took them past 200. Overall, 205 all out wasn't <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> score. The problem {{was that they had}} been so utterly demolished in the first innings – and two days later, they were to meet India's feared batting line-up, including people like Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag.|$|E

5000|$|The Story of <b>a</b> <b>Bad</b> Boy (1870) is a semi-autobiographical {{novel by}} American writer Thomas Bailey Aldrich, fictionalizing his {{experiences}} as a boy in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E
25|$|For 46 years, {{up until}} 778, Lourdes was possessed by Muslims of Al-Andalus. However, during the 8th century, Lourdes and its {{fortress}} {{became the focus}} of skirmishes between Mirat, the Muslim local leader, and Charlemagne, King of the Franks. Charlemagne had been laying siege to Mirat in the fortress for some time, but the Moor had so far refused to surrender. According to legend, an eagle unexpectedly appeared and dropped an enormous trout at the feet of Mirat. It was seen as <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> omen that Mirat was persuaded to surrender to the Queen of the sky by the local bishop. He visited the Black Virgin of Puy to offer gifts, so he could make sure this was the best course of action and, astounded by its exceptional beauty, he decided to surrender the fort and converted to Christianity. On the day of his baptism, Mirat took on the name of Lorus, which was given to the town, now known as Lourdes.|$|E
25|$|Following the season, Tom Renney {{replaced}} Quinn as the Oilers head coach. The {{one advantage}} to <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> season {{was that the}} Oilers {{were able to make}} the first pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. The Oilers selected two-time Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy winner Taylor Hall, from the Windsor Spitfires with their pick. They used the off-season to begin the rebuild of the club around their young talent. Patrick O'Sullivan was traded to Phoenix, in exchange for Jim Vandermeer, Robert Nilsson was bought out of his contract and Oilers captain Ethan Moreau was placed on waivers and claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Along with these players, several others were allowed to enter free agency including Mike Comrie, Marc-Antoine Pouliot and Ryan Potulny. Also during the off-season, radio announcer Rod Phillips announced his retirement. Phillips had been the Oilers' play-by-play announcer since 1973–74. Phillips would call ten specific games in 2010–11 before calling it quits. The 2010–11 Oilers season would be documented in the series Oil Change.|$|E

500|$|The {{additional}} weight, {{going from}} the 18.4 tons (Ausf A) to about 25 tons(Ausf J), of these modifications strained the chassis. The overloaded and primitive leaf-spring suspension gave its crew a shaky ride, earning the Panzer IV the nickname [...] "ravistin" [...] ("shaker") in Finnish Service. This not only affected crew comfort, but also hampered the accurate aiming of the main gun. What exactly caused this vibration that gave the PzKw IVJ <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> name among Finnish tank crews remains somewhat unclear, but suspension {{seems to be the}} most likely suspect.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{singled out}} the {{excessive}} use of angled camera shots. [...] " [...] Roger Christian has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras," [...] wrote Ebert, [...] "but he has not learned why." [...] Derivative special effects and illogical plotting were also widely criticized. The Providence Journal highlighted the film's unusual color scheme: [...] "Battlefield Earth's primary colors are blue and gray, adding to the misery. Whenever we glimpse sunlight, the screen goes all stale yellow, as though someone had urinated on the print. This, by the way, is not <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{assert that}} Escrivá and the {{organization}} supported radical right-wing governments, {{such as those of}} Franco, Augusto Pinochet and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s. Both Pinochet's and Fujimori's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments. Likewise, among Opus Dei members there were also strong detractors of Franco, such as Antonio Fontán. [...] There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler. One former Opus Dei priest, Vladimir Felzmann, who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic, says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been [...] "badly treated" [...] by the world and he further declared that [...] "Hitler couldn't have been <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> person.

500|$|... "Local Ad" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode a favorable review, saying [...] "This episode {{is a prime}} example of how The Office is able to do broad comedy while at the same time treating its characters as real people." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting of Rainn Wilson as a depressed Dwight, as well as the story's twist. [...] Fickett stated that [...] "A great twist here is that we think we're watching Michael pilot a sinking ship as usual, but in fact – the ad is quite good. There's some clever stuff in there, albeit some of it not exactly professional in its production, but Michael doesn't do <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> job." [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a favorable review. [...] Fenno said that [...] "The premise of this episode, 'Local Ad' — the Scranton staffers shoot a commercial — was strong, and allowed almost every ensemble member to shine." [...] Fenno also praised the acting work of Ed Helms as Andy, as well as Steve Carell as Michael. [...] Oscar Dahl, a Senior Writer for BuddyTV, praised the episode, but also felt that the episode's thirty-minute length created a stark contrast to the previous four episodes' hour-long run, saying [...] "tonight's episode felt short. [...] Really short." ...|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the series}} [...] "sophomoric, gross, and unfunny", Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel {{believed}} that this episode [...] "makes <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> impression that it's hard {{to get on the}} show's strange wavelength." [...] Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle considered the show [...] "made by and for childish grown-ups" [...] and for [...] "adults who enjoy kid shows". Seeing the show as the inheritor of The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt-Head, Ginia Bellafante of Time noted its failure to cohere and considered the show [...] "devoid of subtext". Caryn James of The New York Times commented that the series [...] "succeeds best in small touches" [...] but [...] "seems to have a future". In a generally negative review of the first three episodes of the series, Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self-conscious and self-congratulatory in its vulgarity: flatulence jokes, repeated use of the word 'dildo' (in the literal as well as pejorative sense) and a general air of malicious unpleasantness." [...] In one of the few generally positive reviews, Eric Mink of the Daily News praised the South Park universe and the [...] "distinct, interesting characters" [...] within it. He singled out Cartman, calling him [...] "the most vibrant of the bunch", describing him as [...] "a bitter old man living in an 8-year-old's body".|$|E
