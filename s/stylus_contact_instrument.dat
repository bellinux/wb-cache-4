40|$|Making {{no claim}} to be a {{definitive}} review, a several techniques in nanometrology are examined in order to identify critical challenges for the coming years. First, barriers to the wider application of X-ray interferometry are considered, showing that its use is likely to remain highly specialized. Sub-micrometre surface topography is then used to highlight how basic concepts, sensor technology and analytical software interact to both define and restrict instrument design and International Standards. Measurements should relate to the function of the surfaces, but suffer from poor fundamental understanding of their behaviour. Attempts to reconcile information from <b>stylus</b> <b>contact</b> <b>instruments,</b> from optical instruments and from atomic force microscopes are similarly impeded. Possible approaches to calibration are compared. Consideration of the wider issue of surface integrity shows additional challenges in defining and controlling surface cleanliness and in calibrating nano-friction and nano-harness instruments. Two topics are identified as having wide implications and in need of significant research: good models of probe-surface interactions and methods for calibrating forces to nanonewtons...|$|R
40|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments</b> with {{sufficient}} range to resolution that could measure and analyze aspheric surfaces {{first appeared in}} the 1980 s. These where limited to the measurement of a single profile over a rotationally symmetric aspheric surface. Although limited in use they proved to be very useful for the characterization of both optical and non-optical aspheric surfaces, correction of tool paths for aspheric generators etc. The work described here reviews recent developments in the measurement and characterization of aspheric surfaces by <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> instrumentation and includes measurement over an area rather than a single profile and measurement and the characterization of non-rotationally symmetric aspheric surfaces. Some of the challenges involved in the areal measurement of aspheric surfaces by <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> instrumentation will be described together with the techniques and considerations used to overcome these challenges. Specifically we will describe the mathematical models used to describe the aspheric surfaces and how these can be used to eliminate measurement set-up errors. How the finite size of the stylus can be corrected using techniques developed for image analysis. The automatic detection and removal of asperities using wavelet technology will be described. Finally the benefits and limitations of data fusion techniques to improve the range of the instrument will be reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{measurement}} of surface topographies was further developed using the capabilities of 3 D optical profilers based on different measuring principles. These instruments have significant advantages over <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> measuring <b>instruments</b> but also some limitations. One limitation is depending from {{the interaction of the}} surface with the numerical aperture of the objective. Because of the surface slope, some parts of the surface are not correctly detected by the instrument, resulting on void pixels i. e. missing information on the measured topography. Data generated using fitting algorithms can be used to reconstruct the surface and replace the missing data, and the way this operation is performed affects the evaluation of surface parameters. As an alternative, the calculation of parameters may be performed on non-reconstructed datasets. In this work, the effect of void pixels on the determination of 3 D parameters on different manufactured surfaces has been investigated using computer simulation starting from actual measurement data. Both randomly distributed and slope-dependent void pixels are considered. A sensitivity analysis with different distributions of void pixels as well as the effect of increasing slope are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Contact</b> <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> has {{difficulties}} in tracing large slope angle (LSA) lens for surface profile measurement {{due to the}} dilation of measured profile image by the shape of stylus tip. This research {{is to develop a}} surface profile reconstruction method for tip profile with LSA lens and then verified the result by estimating the form error. Experimental set-up is configured of a surface profile and roughness analyzer, Panasonic Ultra Accuracy 3 -D Profilometer (UA 3 P), and the feasibility of the developed program is compared with the results of a commercial operation software, UA 3 P software. The figure form error (FFE) is used to evaluate the developed method. Experiments have been performed by measuring the LSA lens of a s 55 ml spherical gage with measuring ranges increasing from ± 30 °, ± 45 ° to ± 60 ° and measuring an aspheric lens with range ± 50 °. Experimental results showed that the FFE of the developed method has smaller FFE values than those obtained by the UA 3 P software as the measuring range of ± 30 ° and ± 45. Similar result of FFE is obtained as 0. 891 µm for the aspheric lens by the developed method than FFE 0. 896 µm by the UA 3 P software. Therefore, the developed method has been verified for estimating the FFE of LSA lens with variant measuring ranges. Future work is to develop related compensation methodology of FFE for LSA lens measurement and also to find appreciated tip profiles for measuring LSA lens of higher order nonlinear terms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The longterm aim in {{the design}} of modern {{evaporators}} is to find a heat transfer calculation method based on the phenomena of growing and departing vapour bubbles on the heated surface. New developments in computer calculation and in measurement technique support the local analysis of the heat transfer, bubble formation and the microstructure of the heated surface. All three kinds of data originate from the same equipment and from experiments performed with equal detail and precision. The influence of different rough and structured surfaces on the heat transfer coefficient will be investigated by a joint research project of Brunel and Hannover Universities with refrigerants boiling in single microchannels of different inner diameter. The microchannels are capillary tubes and they are manufactured by industrial processes. The samples of the microchannels have to be prepared by special methods, because the surfaces inside the microchannels cannot be measured {{in the same way as}} used for the heat transfer measurements. The microstructure of the surfaces of three microchannels (D = 0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 8 mm) is measured by a <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument.</b> The paper will focus on the detailed description of the profiles and the topographies of the samples. The roughness parameter in accordance with standard practice are calculated for ca 1000 runs (profiles). The roughness parameters of the smaller microchannels are twofold higher than those of the largest microchannel investigated. The scattering of the roughness of the largest microchannel (D = 0. 8 mm) is less and the cavities are smaller than those of the other ones (D = 0. 4 and 0. 5 mm).

50|$|The RIAA {{equalization}} curve (used since 1954) de-emphasizes (weakens) {{the bass}} notes during recording, allowing closer spacing of record grooves and hence more playing time. It also boosts the high frequencies so the playback mirror image correction reduces surface noise. On playback, the turntable cartridge pre-amplifier reverses the RIAA curve to flatten out the frequencies again restoring the bass notes to normal {{and reducing the}} high frequencies to normal while reducing the inherent background hiss produced by the <b>stylus</b> <b>contacting</b> an imperfect vinyl surface. The net effect of RIAA equalization is to allow longer playing time and lower background noise while maintaining full fidelity of music or other content.|$|R
50|$|There are long-armed and short-armed linear arm designs. On a {{perfectly}} flat record a short arm will do, {{but once the}} record is even slightly warped, a short arm will be troublesome. Any vertical motion of the record surface at the <b>stylus</b> <b>contact</b> point will cause the stylus to considerably move longitudinally in the groove. This will cause the stylus to ride non-tangentially in the groove and cause a stereo phase error as well as pitch error everytime the stylus rides over the warp. Also the arm track can come into touch with the record. A long arm will not completely eliminate this problem but will tolerate warped records much better.|$|R

The initiative of developing such system arose from three main needs: • performing analyses of surfaces having geometrical irregularities which cannot be easily detected with traditional <b>stylus</b> <b>contact</b> profilometry; • analyzing and processing the data acquired in electronic format; • speeding up and automating the whole measuring process on a large scale. The developed system performs different types of measures on the acquired data, furthermore the integration of an optical profilometer and a stylus texture measuring instrument allows extending the types of materials which can be analyzed.

Eighty-one medical practitioners answered the IIP (interest inventory for physicians) which was constructed to measure their vocational interests. Results show: (1) reliability coefficients of 0. 85, 0. 92 and 0. 83 for the <b>contact,</b> <b>instruments</b> and sensation components of the IIP, respectively; and (2) correlations of 0. 31, 0. 27 and 0. 53 between interest-specialty congruence in <b>contact,</b> <b>instruments</b> and sensation, respectively, on the one hand, and satisfaction with the medical speciality choice on the other.

40|$|In this study, 35 {{retrieved}} ceramics femoral {{heads with}} evidence of metallic dark lines on the surface were analysed. The surface roughness of these femoral heads was acquired using both a <b>stylus</b> <b>contact</b> profiler and an optical non-contact profilometer. The metallic deposition on hip ball surface, also known as Metal Transfer (MT), appeared as dark metallic and can occur during the surgery or during the reduction of a dislocated prosthesis. In this study, we validate a new protocol to measure surface roughness on retrieved femoral heads, by using the aforementioned two different acquisition techniques and also to investigate the hypothesis that such metal transfer retrieved ceramic femoral head is associated with increased surface roughness. All femoral components of this investigation showed remarkable differences in roughness values between MT-affected and MT-unaffected areas. The two acquisition procedures - conventional stylus and 3 D confocal profilometer - confirmed a satisfying agreement, even considering the obvious resolution difference...|$|R
40|$|Stylus {{scanning}} {{remains a}} crucial method in surface micro- and nano-topography measurement. Its accuracy, especially at shorter wavelengths, {{depends on the}} relation of the stylus geometry to surface parameters. We present a 3 D computer simulation of measuring non-Gaussian random surfaces with arbitrary tip shapes, studying both the surface distortion and the <b>stylus</b> <b>contact</b> distribution. After a brief discussion of the surface generation and geometrical contact algorithms, this paper concentrates on examples of symmetrical styli having characteristic sizes not much smaller than the surface correlation lengths. It thus attempts to examine the breakdown region as we seek to measure finer topographies. The measuring error appears to be generally smaller with a three-pyramid stylus than with other styli as limits are approached. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the errors in common parameters on surfaces of a similar correlation length and roughness amplitude can be smaller when their kurtosis is high, a condition that might become more common with deliberately imposed nanostructuring. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>Stylus</b> {{technology}} utilizes a touch-probe to {{ride along}} the tire surface as it rotates.

When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance.
