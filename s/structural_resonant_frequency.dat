The actuators are bonded {{directly to the}} structure and error information is taken from up to two microphones located in the interior acoustic field. The results demonstrate that global attenuation {{of the order of}} 10 to 15 dB of interior noise can be achieved with piezoceramic actuators, irrespective of whether the shell system is vibrating at an acoustic or <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency.</b> The work also proves that active control using vibration (moment) inputs works well when a floor simulating that of an aircraft is installed in the model.

In this study, an acceleration sensor {{is used to}} measure the resonant vibration. Firstly, the finite element method (FEM) is utilized to derive the dynamics model of the system, and modal analysis is carried out. Secondly, an acceleration feedback-based proportional-integral control algorithm and variable structure control algorithms are designed, and a numerical simulation is performed. Finally, a doubly-clamped piezoelectric flexible beam experimental setup is constructed. Experiments are conducted on resonant vibration suppression using the designed control algorithms. The numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the resonant vibration can be suppressed by using the designed control methods, and the improved variable structure control method shows better control performance in suppressing the resonant vibration...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of the occupied vehicle seat is still challenging. This {{is due to the}} complex and non-linear dynamic behaviour of the human body when exposed to vibration excitation. The structural dynamics of seat system changes when the seat is occupied by volunteers with different weights and different posture. Adding the occupant to the seat is reported to change the seat structural resonant frequencies. However, {{it is not clear how}} different occupants&# 039; weights and seat posture may change the seat vibration responses. The results of this investigation show that when the seat occupant weight increases, the lateral resonant frequencies of the seat decrease while fore-aft resonant frequency increases. Nevertheless, the results show that the seat torsion resonant frequency was not affected significantly by the occupant weight. Comparison of the lean-on and lean-off seating posture shows that the occupied seat in lean-off posture seat do not show significant <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> changes from its corresponding unoccupied seat. This indicates that the interaction of the human body trunk and the seatback is relatively significant for the transmission of the vibration to the human body...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterisation}} of {{the occupied}} vehicle seat structural dynamics is still challenging owing to the complex and nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the human body. The human body has significant influences on the occupied vehicle seat structural dynamics. In this paper, the structural dynamics of the unoccupied seat, occupied seat in lean-on posture, and occupied seat in lean-off posture are investigated. The results of this investigation show that, in lean-on condition when the occupant weight increases, the lateral <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the seat decrease whereas both fore-aft <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> and twisting <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> increase. The <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{of the occupied}} seat in lean-off condition are considerably different {{from those in the}} corresponding lean-on condition.

Both functions are needed, however, for mobile robots on extended missions when actuators and generators must be used together. In this paper, we present a unique piezoelectric cellular system that combines motion generation and energy harvesting capabilities into a single, scalable device. Each of the discrete cellular units provides linear, contractile motion at 10 % strain using the converse piezoelectric effect. These units may also be back-driven from environmental loading and thereby generate energy using the direct piezoelectric effect. Furthermore, each cell has the capability to toggle between a low stiffness ON state and a high stiffness OFF state, which allows an assembly of individual cells to tune both their static stiffness and <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> online.

40|$|Micro-perforated {{absorbers}} {{have been}} studied for decades. In the experimental results of some previous works, an unexpected peak due to the flexible panel vibration effect {{was found on the}} absorption coefficient curve. In this paper, the acoustic absorption of a finite flexible micro-perforated panel backed by an air cavity is studied in detail. The absorption formula that is developed for the micro-perforated absorber is based on the modal analysis solution of the classical plate equation coupled with the acoustic wave equation. Another approach to derive a simpler absorption formula is also developed. The predictions from the two formulas are very close, except for those at the resonant frequencies of the higher structural modes and acoustic modes parallel to the panel surface. The theoretical results show good agreement with the measurements. It can be concluded that (1) as the panel vibration effect can dissipate more energy, the corresponding absorption peaks can widen the absorption bandwidth of a micro-perforated absorber by appropriately selecting the parameters such as panel thickness, perforation diameter, and perforation spacing, etc., such that the <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> is higher than the absorption peak frequency caused by the perforations; (2) the comparison of the cases of different panel mode shapes does not show {{a significant difference in the}} absorption performance; and (3) the structural damping effect can improve the absorption performance at the frequencies between the structural resonant frequencies and the peak frequency of the micro-perforation effect, and decrease the peak absorption values of the structural resonances.

40|$|Predicting the {{responses}} of the combined human body-seat structure to vibration excitation is still a challenging task. This is mainly due to the complex dynamics behaviour of the seated human body in response to vibration. It is however essential to characterize and predict the critical frequencies and the corresponding vibration patterns of the seat when it is coupled with a human occupant. This study provides important knowledge to predict the structural resonant frequencies and corresponding vibration mode shapes of the vehicle seat coupled with occupant from the seat alone or seat bare-frame (seat without foam cushion). An experiment is designed to measure the frequency responses, resonant frequencies, and corresponding mode shapes of the three different selected vehicle seats when mounted on the test rig. Six volunteers have participated in the experiments. The experiment data for each of the seats were collected for the seat bare-frames, seat alone (seat with foam cushion), and seat with human occupant. The results indicate that the vehicle seat bare-frame, seat alone, and seat with occupant have similar main seatback lateral, seatback fore-aft, and seat twisting structural resonant frequencies below 80 Hz. The coupling of the seated human body with the seat shows that the human occupant is not adding any new <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> or mode shape to the seat below 80 Hz. It is therefore possible to characterize and predict the key vibration attributes such as occupied seat structural resonant frequencies and mode shapes from their corresponding unoccupied seat or bare frame characteristics.

40|$|In this paper, three {{controllers}} are {{investigated for}} active vibration control (AVC) of a pedestrian walkway structure. They comprise of direct velocity feedback (DVF), observer-based and independent modal space (IMSC) controllers that are implemented in single-input single-output (SISO), multi-SISO and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The {{objective of the}} SISO controller schemes is to compare vibration mitigation performances arising from global control versus selective control of <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a given frequency bandwidth. The objectives {{set out for the}} multi-SISO and MIMO controllers are to realise global control within the same frequency bandwidth considered in the SISO studies. A novel aspect of these latter studies is the independent control of selected <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> at different locations on the structure with the aim of imposing global control. Vibration mitigation performances are evaluated using frequency response function measurements and uncontrolled and controlled responses to a synthesized walking excitation force. In the SISO studies, selective control of specific <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> has a slight degradation in the global vibration mitigation performance although it reflects better performance around the target frequencies. For the multi-SISO and MIMO controller studies, the selective control of the two lowest and dominant frequencies of the structure at two different locations still offers comparative vibration mitigation performances with the controllers considered as global {{in the sense that they}} target both structural frequencies at both locations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an in-depth analysis of vehicle seat structural dynamics based on detailed experimental modal analysis. The experimental methodology {{to measure the}} <b>frequency</b> responses, <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and corresponding mode shapes of the three different vehicle seats in the mounted configuration is described in this thesis. It investigates {{the effect of the}} foam cushion, the seated human body and occupant weight on the dynamic characteristics of the bare-frame of the seat. Consequently, the effect of the dynamic properties on subjective ride comfort is then investigated according to the IS 02631 - 1 international standard. All seat structures were discovered to have three fundamental resonance and mode shapes below 80 Hz. This is within the human sensitivity to vibration range of 0. 5 - 80 Hz. The addition of the foam cushions or seated human body does not contribute new resonances or mode shapes to the seat system. However, significant changes in the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> were observed. Results indicated the cushion significantly increases the modal mass of the backrest thereby reducing <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The human body, contrary to expected results, increases the modal stiffness of the seat system and generally <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> increased with the addition of the occupant. Furthermore, the research discovered that increases in occupant weight reduces the seatback lateral frequency while increasing the fore/aft <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> These effects of the human body on the seat dynamics was shown to be predominantly caused by the body weight on the seat backrest. The experiments done with volunteers without leaning on the backrest showed no significant changes in <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> from an unoccupied seat. In the comfort survey, the twisting <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> was seen to cause the highest discomfort to the seated occupant even though the frequency weighted vibration levels were similar to that of other test environments. Further investigation in the research showed that the accelerometer pad measurement point for the IS 02631 - 1 is located close to the node point of the twisting mode shape. This caused inaccuracy in the measurement of the vibration transmitted to the occupant&# 039;s back. The outcome of this research firstly provides a method to characterise and predict the key vibration attributes such as occupied seat <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> and mode shapes from their corresponding unoccupied seat or bare frame characteristics. This alleviates the need for complex modelling or detailed analysis of the human body structure itself.

40|$|The {{detailed}} analysis {{of a series of}} acoustic measurements taken near several large wind turbines (100 kWand above) has identified the maximum acoustic energy as being concentrated in the low-frequency audible and subaudible ranges, usually less than 100 Hz. These measurements have also shown any reported community annoyance associated with turbine operations has often been related to the degree of coherent impulsiveness present and the subsequent harmonic coupling of acoustic energy to residential structures. Thus, one technique to assess the annoyance potential of a given wind turbine design is to develop a method which quantifies this degree of impulsiveness or coherency in the radiated acoustic energy spectrum under a wide range of operating conditions. Experience has also shown the presence of annoying conditions is highly time dependent and nonstationary, and, therefore, any attempts to quantify or at least classify wind turbine designs in terms of their noise annoyance potential must be handled within the proper probabilistic framework. A technique is described which employs multidimensional, joint probability analysis to establish the expected coincidence of acoustic energy levels in a contiguous sequence of octave frequency bands which have been chosen because of their relationship to common <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> in residential buildings. Evidence is presented to justify the choice of these particular bands.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Future {{launch vehicle}} payload {{fairings}} will be manufactured from advanced lightweight composite materials. The loss of distributed mass causes {{a significant increase}} in the internal acoustic environment, causing a severe threat to the payload. Using piezoelectric (PZT) actuators to control the fairing vibration and the internal acoustic environment has been proposed. To help determine the acoustic control authority of piezoelectric actuators mounted on a rocket fairing, the internal acoustic response created by the actuators needs to be determined. In this work the internal acoustic response of a closed simply-supported (SS) cylinder actuated by PZT actuators is determined using an impedance model for the actuator and boundary element analysis. The experimentally validated model is used to extrapolate results for a SS cylinder that emulates a Minotaur payload fairing. The internal cylinder acoustic levels are investigated for PZT actuation between 35 and 400 Hz. Significant reductions in the structural response due to increased damping do not equate to similar reductions in the acoustic sound pressure levels (SPLs) for the cylinder. The sound levels at the acoustic <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are essentially unaffected by the significant increase in structural damping while the acoustic levels at the <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> are mildly reduced. The interior acoustic response of the cylinder is dominated by the acoustic modes and therefore significant reductions in the overall interior acoustic levels will not be achieved if only the structural resonances are controlled. As the actuation frequency is reduced, the number of actuators required to generate acoustic levels commensurate to that found in the fairing increases to impractical values. Below approximately 100 Hz, the current demands reach levels that are extremely difficult to achieve with a practical system. The results of this work imply that PZT actuators do not have the authority to control the payload fairing internal acoustics below 100 Hz...|$|R
40|$|In a vibration-based damage {{detection}} paradigm, a structural health monitoring (SHM) {{system is designed}} to acquire data from which damage-sensitive features will be observed in order to classify the damage {{state of the structure}} without providing false positive indications of damage. An optimization routine is introduced that exploits the concept of SHM as a pattern recognition problem for which there is a space of solutions that can be searched by global optimization algorithms to improve {{damage detection}} sensitivity. The optimization procedure is general in that {{it can be used to}} improve a number of elements that are particular to the problem of damage detection including: the excitation, method of data conditioning, detection features, and statistical metrics of comparison. In particular, this work focuses on tailoring excitations for global, active sensing SHM applications via evolutionary algorithms. Indications of damage in the response are shown to be more detectable in both computational and experimental platforms using excitations that have been tailored to the application via the optimization routine. Using the routine, a class of excitations that significantly enhance damage detection relative to untailored inputs is discovered and shown to do so because of a change in the state-space representation of structural response. When state-space features are employed, the relative power of structural response frequencies is shown, in the most basic case, to significantly affect the 2 -torus representation of the response. The routine is also used to show that sensitivity is significantly affected by the employed detection feature. In particular, the introduction of temporal information in the feature formulation dictates that improved detection occurs for a class of chaotic excitations. In addition, a method is introduced that allows tailored inputs to be generated for more complicated structures by training on a simple infinite impulse response filter. Design of the filter only requires identification of two <b>structural</b> <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies.</b> A 6 % reduction in bolt stiffness in an experimental structure is clearly classified as damaged using state-space features and excitations that have been trained on the filter.

Based on a cantilever beam-bending model with a rigid mass at the free end and mode analysis, an analytical solution is developed in the present study to deal with the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> and mode shapes of a SWCNT- based mass sensor. The <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> shift and mode shape of the fixed-free SWCNTs caused by the addition of a nanoscale particle to the beam tip are examined in order to explore the suitability of SWCNTs as a mass detector device. The simulation results reveal that the volume of the added particle has little effect on the first <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency.</b> In contrast, the second <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases with increasing the volume of the added particle. Furthermore, the <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> shift of the first mode is very obvious for the amount of added mass, and the second <b>resonant</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases rapidly with increasing volume of added particle. Therefore, the first and second <b>resonant</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be used in the measurement of the mass of added particle and its volume, respectively...|$|R
