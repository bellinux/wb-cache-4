500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge <b>somebody</b> <b>for</b> on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
500|$|Previous {{series of}} Jonathan Creek had {{featured}} first Caroline Quentin, and then Julia Sawalha as Jonathan's assistants Maddy Magellan and Carla Borrego, respectively. Quentin {{departed from the}} show {{at the end of}} its third series in 2000 in order to try for a second child, while Sawalha temporarily retired from acting in 2004, having become so disillusioned that she was [...] "dragging self out of bed" [...] by the end of the show's fourth series in order to film episodes. Davies explained that Renwick had always believed Jonathan needed a sidekick character, and that: [...] "You can't really have Jonathan Creek without his sounding board when all the stuff is going on in his mind. In a novel you can have an interior monologue when a leading character is working out what's going on, but for a film or television you have to have Dr Watson for Sherlock Holmes, it's <b>somebody</b> <b>for</b> Holmes to explain it to." [...] For [...] "The Grinning Man", a new sidekick was created in the form of Joey Ross, played by actress Sheridan Smith. Renwick described the opportunity to work with Smith as a major catalyst in his decision to revive the show. The actress had previously appeared in his series Love Soup, and Renwick's wife suggested pairing her with Davies in the new episode. Smith was approached about the role before the episode's script was written, and after readily agreeing to take the part of Ross, Renwick wrote the character's dialogue with Smith's northern accent in mind. The actress found accustoming herself to [...] "detective talk" [...] the hardest part of the role, explaining: [...] "You slow down, and then speed up at the end. I kept watching Alan and going, 'I can’t do this figuring out talk.' But I learned from the master." [...] Smith enjoyed the challenge the role presented, stating: [...] "He's [...] written this feisty little northern character, and I am really honoured because he's such a great writer. I have always played chavs and slappers so I wasn't used to being an intelligent young girl." ...|$|E

500|$|Crackdown was envisioned {{to exceed}} the {{gameplay}} of Grand Theft Auto, giving the player [...] "toys" [...] {{to create their own}} in-game moments that could be verbally shared with others. [...] The crackdown logo is {{in the shape of the}} agency tower, modified. The entire playfield was to be open at the start, requiring the need to create a progression for the player, while still allowing for experimentation. [...] Realtime Worlds had hired a number of former Grand Theft Auto developers who experimented with refining the game's sandbox element. [...] "It was a big part of the idea to just let people do things", Realtime Worlds producer Phil Wilson said about the gameplay; [...] "testers would do things we were completely blown away by". Dave Jones, CEO of Realtime Worlds, described the concept of the game as [...] "How do we reward <b>somebody</b> <b>for</b> just having fun?" [...] They had initially planned to have 200 Xbox Live Achievements for the game towards this purpose, exceeded the then-current cap of 50 set by Microsoft, and pressured Microsoft to lift the cap. [...] Microsoft subsequently increased the maximum number of Achievements in a game to 80. [...] Through playtesting, the team noticed that many players performed certain out-of-the-way actions, such as climbing to the top of the Agency Tower. [...] They created in-game content to reward the player for performing these actions; for example, they created a special rendering procedure for the clouds during the in-game day/night cycle. The renderer would behave differently each day, and could only be viewed from atop the Agency Tower. [...] An initial fear of Jones' was that in the early part of the game, when the Agent is underpowered, the player may not realize the potential of the game and would not complete it; [...] "People weren't quite sure, because at that level, you're kind of like most characters in most other games". [...] Jones also expressed concern that [...] "This game does not look good in screenshots". [...] They took two major steps to overcome this. [...] First, the demo for the game on Xbox Marketplace allowed for accelerated growth of the player's abilities. [...] Second, the full game included five in-game movies that would be presented early on to the player that would give them a taste for what a fully powered character could do.|$|E

At the {{conclusion}} of a play during this game, Redskins safety Sean Taylor spat in the face of Buccaneers running back Michael Pittman. Pittman retaliated with a slap to Taylor's helmet. Carey could be heard through a live microphone immediately ejecting Taylor from the game.
