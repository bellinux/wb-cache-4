5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We saw this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to <b>safety.</b> <b>On</b> the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E

5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers {{who fail to}} comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill.

5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E
5|$|Immortalité almost reached <b>safety.</b> <b>On</b> {{the morning}} of 20 October, Captain Jean-François Legrand was {{approaching}} Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Fisgard. Fisgard, part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. Immortalité initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster Fisgard at 11:00. During the bitter, close–range action, Fisgard took severe damage and almost lost her opponent. Immortalité, which had lost a mast and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard Immortalité were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General Monge (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead. Fisgard, {{with the aid of}} other ships of the blockade squadron, successfully brought her prize into port.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944 Fleming {{oversaw the}} {{distribution}} of intelligence to Royal Navy units in preparation for Operation Overlord. He was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944, but maintained some involvement. He visited 30AU in the field during and after Overlord, especially following an attack on Cherbourg {{for which he was}} concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force rather than an intelligence-gathering unit. This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives, and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Afterwards, the management of these units was revised. He also followed the unit into Germany after it located, in Tambach Castle, the German naval archives from 1870.|$|E
40|$|Relatively little {{previous}} research has investigated the meechanisms by which safety climate affects safety behavior.

If it scores a field goal on its first possession, however, it then kicks off to the opposing team, which {{has an opportunity to}} score; if the score is tied again after that possession, true sudden death rules apply and whoever scores next will win.|$|E
5|$|In {{his senior}} season at the University of Alabama in 1934, Hutson was {{recognized}} as a consensus All-American and won a national championship with the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. After his career at Alabama, he joined the Packers in 1935 and played eleven seasons before he retired in 1945. He {{led the league in}} receiving yards in seven separate seasons and in receiving touchdowns in nine. A talented <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> defense, he also led the NFL in interceptions in 1940. Hutson was an eight-time All-Pro selection, a four-time Pro Bowler, and was twice awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the NFL Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida {{subsequent to the}} discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all small craft to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range missiles from Cape Canaveral. Fishermen on dozens of boats left the open ocean for <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely rode out the hurricane. Small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the effects of national culture and leadership style <b>on</b> <b>safety</b> performance in bulk shipping companies. Survey data collected from 322 respondents working in dry bulk carriers was used, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of national culture and leadership styles (i. e. transformational, passive management, and contingent reward) <b>on</b> <b>safety</b> attitude and safety behavior. The results indicate that national culture dimensions such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and long-term orientation had a positive influence <b>on</b> <b>safety</b> behaviour. Long-term orientation had a positive influence <b>on</b> <b>safety</b> attitude, whereas masculinity had a negative influence <b>on</b> <b>safety</b> attitude of seafarers. Specifically, this research found that transformational leadership had a positive influence <b>on</b> <b>safety</b> attitude and safety behaviour of seafarers. Moreover, practical implication from the research findings to improve ship safety in dry bulk shipping were discussed...|$|R
5|$|The Brazilian {{prisoners were}} placed {{together}} aboard a brig bound for Buenos Aires, {{capital of the}} United Provinces. They suffered severe hardship, starving and almost naked. Under the leadership of Joaquim Inácio, the Brazilians staged an uprising, {{took control of the}} ship and made prisoners of their captors. The ship successfully eluded two corvettes and one schooner-brig that had pursued them, and sailed on to Montevideo, capital of Cisplatina, which they reached in <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> 29 August 1827. Despite Joaquim Inácio's daring rescue of Brazilian prisoners of war from both the invasion's land-based forces and from the two schooners, he was reprimanded by the commander-in-chief Vice-Admiral Rodrigo Pinto Guedes, Baron of Rio da Prata (who had replaced Rodrigo Lobo) for the loss of the Constança.|$|E
5|$|The Marathas {{were still}} in a very strong {{position}} when the new Governor General of British controlled territories Cornwallis arrived in India in 1786. After the treaty of Salabai, the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north. The British and the Marathas enjoyed {{more than two decades}} of peace, thanks to the diplomacy of Nana Phadnavis, the Brahmin minister in the court of the 11-year-old Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. The situation changed soon after Nana's death in 1800. The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in Pune in 1801, since the Peshwa sided with Shinde. The Peshwa Baji Rao II fled Pune to <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> a British warship. Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the treaty of Bassein. This made the Peshwa in effect a subsidiary ally of the British.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> the opposite bank.|$|E

5|$|The quickest {{score in}} NFL history {{occurred}} on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> the opening kickoff three seconds into the game. Darius Reynaud of the Titans fielded the kickoff {{and took a}} short step backwards (into the south end zone) for what was ruled to be a safety, not a touchback, because the ball {{was not in the}} end zone when it was fielded. The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the Soviet {{pilots were}} {{familiar}} with Hartmann's radio call sign of Karaya 1, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot's head. Hartmann, for a time, used a black tulip design around the engine cowling near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him Cherniy Chort ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative <b>safety.</b> <b>On</b> 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted {{just like the rest}} of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Route 10 was {{designated}} to run along a new, never-built alignment {{farther to the}} north, running through Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Montclair, West Orange, and along the Livingston/Roseland border, roughly along much of the routing of present-day CR 611 (Eagle Rock Avenue), and following its current alignment through Morris County to Ledgewood. A spur of the route was also planned in 1952 to run from Montclair south to Orange. A year later, in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 10 was defined onto its current alignment, with its eastern terminus moved to Prospect Avenue in West Orange. In 1998, the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus of the route was replaced with a signalized T-intersection. In the mid-2000s, an $11.5 million project was undertaken to improve <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> the portion of Route 10 in Hanover and East Hanover Townships by widening existing lanes and adding turning lanes to the road.|$|E

5|$|Olivier's {{life was}} under {{threat from the}} Nazis and pro-German sympathisers. The studio owners were {{concerned}} enough that Samuel Goldwyn and Cecil B. DeMille both provided support and security to ensure his <b>safety.</b> <b>On</b> the completion of filming, Olivier and Leigh returned to Britain. He had spent the previous year learning to fly and had completed nearly 250 hours {{by the time he}} left America. He intended to join the Royal Air Force but instead made another propaganda film, 49th Parallel, narrated short pieces for the Ministry of Information, and joined the Fleet Air Arm because Richardson was already in the service. Richardson had gained a reputation for crashing aircraft, which Olivier rapidly eclipsed. Olivier and Leigh settled in a cottage just outside RAF Worthy Down, where he was stationed with a training squadron; Noël Coward visited the couple and thought Olivier looked unhappy. Olivier spent much of his time taking part in broadcasts and making speeches to build morale, and in 1942 he was invited to make another propaganda film, The Demi-Paradise, in which he played a Soviet engineer who helps improve British-Russian relationships.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel {{appear to}} have entered into an {{alliance}} with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan {{at the request of}} the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil. When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies. Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled. The causeway was too narrow for the horses, therefore the conquistadors dismounted and crossed to the island before the inhabitants could break the bridges. The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to <b>safety</b> <b>on</b> another island. The Spanish could not pursue the survivors further because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April.|$|E
