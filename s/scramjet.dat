5|$|Apart from railguns, 16 inch <b>scramjet</b> rounds with {{ranges of}} up to 400 {{nautical}} miles that have a 9-minute time of flight are being proposed by Pratt and Whitney working with Dr. Dennis Reilly, a plasma physicist with extensive experience with munitions. Alliant Techniques is also developing a ram-jet projectile for 5-inch and 155mm gun. Unfortunately, the navy had no interested sponsor according to both Pratt and Whitney representatives and Dr. Reilly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scramjet</b> (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While <b>scramjet</b> combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a <b>scramjet</b> combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a <b>scramjet</b> flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a <b>scramjet</b> engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, <b>scramjet</b> engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E
25|$|In Supersonic Propulsion -- ramjet, <b>scramjet,</b> unstart.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scramjets</b> are {{mechanically}} {{very similar}} to ramjets. Like a ramjet, they consist of an inlet, a combustor, and a nozzle. The primary difference between ramjets and <b>scramjets</b> is that <b>scramjets</b> do not slow the oncoming airflow to subsonic speeds for combustion, they use supersonic combustion instead. The name [...] "scramjet" [...] comes from [...] "Supersonic Combusting Ramjet." [...] Since <b>scramjets</b> use supersonic combustion they can operate at speeds above Mach 6 where traditional ramjets are too inefficient. Another difference between ramjets and <b>scramjets</b> comes from how each type of engine compresses the oncoming airflow: while the inlet provides most of the compression for ramjets, the high speeds at which <b>scramjets</b> operate allow them {{to take advantage of}} the compression generated by shock waves, primarily oblique shocks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scramjets</b> are an {{evolution}} of ramjets that {{are able to}} operate at much higher speeds than any other kind of airbreathing engine. They share a similar structure with ramjets, being a specially shaped tube that compresses air with no moving parts through ram-air compression. <b>Scramjets,</b> however, operate with supersonic airflow through the entire engine. Thus, <b>scramjets</b> do not have the diffuser required by ramjets to slow the incoming airflow to subsonic speeds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scramjets</b> {{currently}} are not practical for passenger-carrying vehicles due to technological limitations.|$|R

25|$|A {{combustor}} is {{a component}} or {{area of a}} gas turbine, ramjet, or <b>scramjet</b> engine where combustion takes place. It {{is also known as}} a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or <b>scramjet</b> engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E
50|$|The thermal {{situation}} for airbreathers (particularly <b>scramjets)</b> can be awkward; normal rockets fly steep initial trajectories to avoid drag, whereas <b>scramjets</b> would deliberately {{fly through the}} relatively thick atmosphere at high speed generating enormous heating of the airframe. The thermal {{situation for}} the other airbreathing approaches is much more benign, although {{is not without its}} challenges.|$|R
50|$|The {{designed}} thrust-to-weight {{ratio of}} SABRE is fourteen compared to about five for conventional jet engines, and two for <b>scramjets.</b> This high performance {{is a combination}} of the denser, cooled air, requiring less compression, and, more importantly, the low air temperatures permitting lighter alloys to be used in much of the engine. Overall performance is much better than the RB545 engine or <b>scramjets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber in gas turbines and jet engines (including ramjets and <b>scramjets)</b> {{is called the}} combustor.|$|R
25|$|Shcramjet - {{similar to}} a <b>scramjet</b> engine, however it takes {{advantage}} of shockwaves produced from the aircraft in the combustion chamber to assist in increasing overall efficiency.|$|E
25|$|With some exceptions, the {{knowledge}} of hypersonic aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of hypersonic flow is understood, building a <b>scramjet</b> aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful <b>scramjet</b> aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Brazilian Air Force's Institute for Advanced Studies {{started the}} 14-X development, a {{hypersonic}} <b>scramjet</b> demonstrator envisaged to fly at 30km of altitude at 3km/s, corresponding to Mach number 10. In March 2012 a Mach 7 variation has been suggested, named as 14-X S.|$|E

25|$|Many ways {{to reach}} space other than rockets have been proposed. Ideas {{such as the}} space elevator, and {{momentum}} exchange tethers like rotovators or skyhooks require new materials much stronger than any currently known. Electromagnetic launchers such as launch loops might be feasible with current technology. Other ideas include rocket assisted aircraft/spaceplanes such as Reaction Engines Skylon (currently in early stage development), <b>scramjet</b> powered spaceplanes, and RBCC powered spaceplanes. Gun launch has been proposed for cargo.|$|E
25|$|The Directorate {{currently}} {{manages the}} X-51A program, which {{is developing a}} <b>scramjet</b> demonstration vehicle. The X-51 program is working to develop a flight demonstrator for a hypersonic cruise missile which could reach anywhere on the globe in an hour. In January 2008, the Directorate used a modified Scaled Composites Long-EZ aircraft to demonstrate that a pulse detonation engine could successfully power flight. That aircraft has now been transferred to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB for display.|$|E
25|$|The {{shock wave}} {{is one of}} several {{different}} ways in which a gas in a supersonic flow can be compressed. Some other methods are isentropic compressions, including Prandtl-Meyer compressions. The method of compression of a gas results in different temperatures and densities for a given pressure ratio which can be analytically calculated for a non-reacting gas. A shock wave compression results in a loss of total pressure, meaning that it is a less efficient method of compressing gases for some purposes, for instance in the intake of a <b>scramjet.</b> The appearance of pressure-drag on supersonic aircraft is mostly due to the effect of shock compression on the flow.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people use}} the term 'jet aircraft' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines, but rockets and <b>scramjets</b> are both also {{propelled}} by jet propulsion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scramjets</b> {{start working}} at speeds {{of at least}} Mach 4, and have a maximum useful speed of {{approximately}} Mach 17. Due to aerodynamic heating at these high speeds, cooling poses a challenge to engineers.|$|R

Results with nitrogen as coolant for different sintered porous materials, different blowing ratios and different boundary conditions with and without wedge are shown. A detailed analysis using i. a. optical Schlieren investigations is presented. Phenomena like choking and shock-coolant plenum feedback are addressed.

25|$|To attain such speeds, Lockheed Martin {{has been}} collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne since 2006 on an {{appropriate}} engine. The company is developing the system from the scramjet-powered HTV-3X, which was canceled in 2008. The SR-72 is envisioned with an air-breathing hypersonic propulsion system that {{has the ability to}} accelerate from standstill to Mach6.0 using the same engine, making it about twice as fast as the SR-71. The challenge is to design an engine to encompass the flight regimes of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Using turbine compression, turbojet engines can work at zero speed and usually perform best up to Mach 2.2. Ramjets, using aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly under Mach 0.5 and are most efficient around Mach 3, being able to go up to around Mach 6. The SR-71's specially designed engines converted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting the airflow around the core and into the afterburner for speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Finally, scramjets with supersonic combustion cover the range of high supersonic to hypersonic speeds. The SR-72 is to use a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) system to use a turbine engine at low speeds and a <b>scramjet</b> engine at high speeds. The turbine and ramjet engines share common inlet and nozzle, with different airflow paths in between.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of the Skylon's design is its powerplant, known as Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of liquid air cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around Mach5.5 (1,700m/s), [...] altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a <b>scramjet,</b> but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.|$|E

50|$|With the {{exception}} of <b>scramjets,</b> jet engines, deprived of their inlet systems can only accept air at around half the speed of sound. The inlet system's job for transonic and supersonic aircraft is to slow the air and perform some of the compression.|$|R
