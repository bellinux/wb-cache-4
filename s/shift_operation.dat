Our analyses indicated that extended shift or multi-shift work schedules would not lead to sufficient production to reduce production costs below those of 9 -hour single <b>shift</b> <b>operations.</b> This finding runs counter to economic analyses by Mitchell (2008) where the productivity of night shift south-eastern USA harvesting operations would need to fall by 43 %, compared with day <b>shift</b> <b>operations,</b> before production costs for double <b>shift</b> <b>operations</b> were higher than single <b>shift</b> <b>operations.</b> Drops in productivity of this magnitude were found for the “double shift − 18 hour” work schedule operated by Forestal Mininco.

40|$|AbstractClustering is {{the problem}} of {{grouping}} objects {{on the basis of a}} similarity measure among them. Relational clustering methods can be employed when a feature-based representation of the objects is not available, and their description is given in terms of pairwise (dis) similarities. This paper focuses on the relational duals of fuzzy central clustering algorithms, and their application in situations when patterns are represented by means of non-metric pairwise dissimilarities. Symmetrization and <b>shift</b> <b>operations</b> have been proposed to transform the dissimilarities among patterns from non-metric to metric. In this paper, we analyze how four popular fuzzy central clustering algorithms are affected by such transformations. The main contributions include the lack of invariance to <b>shift</b> <b>operations,</b> as well as the invariance to symmetrization. Moreover, we highlight the connections between relational duals of central clustering algorithms and central clustering algorithms in kernel-induced spaces. One among the presented algorithms has never been proposed for non-metric relational clustering, and turns out to be very robust to <b>shift</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
