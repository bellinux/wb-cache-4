This research {{focused on}} analysing {{and finding the}} types of syntactical rank-shift of translation in Oliver Bowden’s novel Assassin’s Creed Revelation and its Indonesian translation by Melody Violine. There are 100 data of syntactical rank-shift of translation found in the novel. The data were analyzed by descriptive qualitative method. It is a method of research which discribes the data and does not establish calculation. The data were analyzed by describing why the rank-shift happened. The data were then analyzed and categorized into five types of syntactical rank-shift that belong to Simatupang’s theory. Those types are syntactical rank-shift of word to phrase, phrase to clause, phrase <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> clause <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> and <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> passage. However, the researcher did not find the syntactical rank-shift of phrase <b>to</b> <b>sentence</b> which included in Simatupang’s theory. The researcher also found eight types of syntactical rank-shift. Those are syntactical rank-shift of word to clause, word <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> phrase <b>to</b> word, clause to phrase, passage <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> phrase, clause <b>to</b> word, and <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> clause. Those types were then categorized into upper rank-shift where the level ascended and lower rank-shift where the level decended. The most types of syntactical rank-shift found by the researcher is syntactical rank-shift of word t phrase which has 32 cases or 32 % of total data and the least found are syntactical rank-shift of clause <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> word <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> clause <b>to</b> phrase, passage <b>to</b> <b>sentence,</b> and <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> phrase which has 1 case each of rank-shift...|$|R
