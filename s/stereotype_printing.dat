[...] However, Guibord's notability is based on events after his death: as a member of the Institut Canadien de Montréal, he was denied ecclessiastical burial by the Roman Catholic Church in the Montréal cemetery of Notre-Dame-des-Neiges. His widow, Henriette Brown, challenged the refusal in the courts, and for five years his body lay in temporary accommodation in a Protestant cemetery as the court action worked its way through the Quebec courts. Finally, five years after his death, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire, allowed his widow's appeal in the Guibord Case and ordered the Church to provide a burial in the portion of the burial ground reserved for Roman Catholics. [...] Religious and political passions were highly aroused by the Judicial Committee's decision and a military escort was needed to carry out the order for burial.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{depiction}} of females in advertising has received considerable academic attention, fuelled by {{the feminist movement}} {{and the evolution of}} women's roles in the society. Early studies revealed the prevalence of traditional portrayals such as housewives, women dependent on a man's protection and depictions of sexual objectification. Even though a decrease in female stereotyping would be reasonable considering the contemporary structure of society that prescribes multiple gender roles, this {{does not seem to be}} the case: The literature is replete with studies documenting that female stereotyping is alive and well, even if it manifests itself with different types and patterns than it did some decades ago. This study strives to adopt a holistic outlook to the phenomenon of female <b>stereotypes</b> in <b>print</b> advertisements, tracing its origins, analyzing the interplay of stereotypes and advertising, undertaking an exhaustive perusal of the particular stream of literature, addressing methodological issues and proposing directions for further research...|$|R
50|$|A {{stereotype}} is one {{of three}} types of extensibility mechanisms in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the other two being tags and constraints. They allow designers to extend the vocabulary of UML in order to create new model elements, derived from existing ones, but that have specific properties that are suitable for a particular domain or otherwise specialized usage. The nomenclature is derived from the original meaning of <b>stereotype,</b> used in <b>printing.</b> For example, when modeling a network you might need to have symbols for representing routers and hubs. By using stereotyped nodes you can make these things appear as primitive building blocks.|$|R
50|$|In 1731 {{the press}} syndics of the University of Cambridge leased their {{privilege}} of printing bibles and prayer-books for eleven years to W. Fenner, who, with the brothers James, was {{in partnership with}} William Ged for carrying into operation <b>stereotype</b> <b>printing</b> invented by the latter. Ged describes at length the intrigues of the king's printer (Baskett) with his own partners, {{with a view to}} damage the success of the innovation. Baskett shortly afterwards became bankrupt, and in 1732 his assignees filed a bill in chancery against W. Fenner and the university of Cambridge for printing bibles and prayer-books. The case came on again in August 1742, and was ultimately decided in the court of King's Bench, 24 November 1758, in favour of the university. About the year 1738 Baskett's printing-office was burnt; and, as was the custom on such occasions, he was helped through his losses by gifts from his brethren of presses and money. The name of John Baskett is last seen on a 12mo New Testament of 1742. He died on 22 June of that year. His sons Thomas and Robert printed the Old Testament in 1743. The name of Thomas alone appears on bibles after 1744, and the imprint so continued down to 1769. He issued editions of the Prayer Book between 1746 and 1757. We find that 'Mark Baskett and the assigns of Robert Barker' printed two quarto bibles at London in 1761 and 1763, and a folio prayer-book, 1706. With the name of Mark Baskett is connected a remarkable bibliographical mystery. Isaiah Thomas, our chief authority for the history of printing in North America, assures us that 'Kneeland and Green' printed Boston about 1752, principally for Daniel Henchman, an edition of the Bible in small 4to. This was the first Bible printed in America in the English language.|$|E

Thus, we see that it is both a myth that all Klondike women were dance-hall girls, and that dance-hall girls lived completely different, and separate, lives from respectable women. The first section of the thesis looks at how the Klondike community fits into the broader culture of the Victorian Era as well as similarities and differences to life in other mining towns. This section also introduces several women from all different walks of life that the thesis will use to demonstrate how each type of women was affected by, and how she affected, the culture of Dawson. These women include: a famously dubbed dance-hall girl “Queen of the Klondike” or “Klondike Kate,” a mother and housewife Martha Black, a school teacher Laura Berton, and a single young woman Edna Berry, among many other colorful characters. The second section divides the type of work women did into three categories [...] prostitution, dance-hall entertaining, and “respectable” work. Information about the more salacious work is culled from newspaper articles because many sex-workers and dancers were illiterate and none of them were likely to leave behind evidence of their careers. Memoirs of the more elite women provide information about the other side of society—that of the housewife. This section also explores the topics of clothing and gender relations as they relate to the different positions women took in the community. By first dividing the type of work and then looking at individual women, we begin to see how many women were either forced or voluntarily moved in and out of the stereotype of the Klondike woman. After debunking the Klondike myth by demonstrating the existence and importance of women who did not work in red-light jobs, the last section explores more in-depth some of the mundane tasks Victorian housewives were expected to do and the adaptations they made to perform these tasks in the Klondike region. The tasks include marriage, raising children, creating the comforts of “home” out of a cabin, and preparing food. To come full circle and return to the myth of the dance-hall girl with which the thesis started, we can now look at these girls in a new light. Their lives were just as complex as and intertwined with the Victorian women they lived beside...|$|R

50|$|On {{arriving}} in America, Johnson secured {{a position in}} Troy, New York, with The Northern Budget, a Republican weekly newspaper. In spring 1819, he began working in New York City in the printing office of Bunce and Gray, often working sixteen to eighteen hours a day. Having observed the art of stereotyping in England, where his first employer, Brightly and Childs, had been {{among the first to}} adopt it, Johnson sought {{to learn more about the}} practice, and in 1820 he entered the employment of B. & J. Collins, one of two firms that did nearly all of the stereotyping in New York. Having acquired a sufficient knowledge of stereotyping, he soon left for Philadelphia to establish his own enterprise. There, despite his limited means and knowledge, he managed to develop a successful stereotyping business. Initially his stereotype foundry was located at 17 Cypress Alley in Philadelphia. By the late 1820s it was located at 6 George Street (later renamed 606-608 Sansom Street), where it remained until 1906 when the property was sold to the Curtis Publishing Company. Prior to the establishment of Johnson's foundry, those publishers in Philadelphia who wanted to use <b>stereotyping</b> for book <b>printing</b> sent their orders to New York. One of Johnsons's earliest successful efforts in stereotyping was Henry's Commentary on the Scriptures for the publishers, Tower and Hogan.|$|R

From a semiotic analysis of seven print adverts appearing in the Swedish lifestyle Magazine Café were we able to gain a thorough understanding about how male stereotypes are communicated and built. The result showed that different kinds of stereotypes are in fact used but it is still a hegemonic masculinity that is predominating. Traditional male characteristics are still in use but we were able to see strong indications of effemination, sexualizing and objectifying. Metro sexuality is a recurring feature in the adverts, and one of the factors that indicate that masculinity is something complex and multi layered. Our study also shows that activity is still essential when it comes to form male qualities, but the impression of the same are nowadays of more importance than the actual activity itself. Attributes and surroundings are key components, and something that implicates that the social climate is focusing on material things...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} if the following elements in the curriculum of graphic arts programs in public secondary schools have been effective in enabling students to formulate adequately accurate occupational stereotypes in the field of printing: 1. educational philosophy 2. industrial experience of students such as work experience, personal contacts with people in the trade, and field trips 3. socioeconomic backgrounds of the students 4. vocational maturity of the students 5. occupational plans of the students. In the spring of 1971, students enrolled in advanced graphic arts classes of public secondary schools in Monroe County, New York (excluding Rochester Public Schools) were used for the {{purpose of this}} investigation. Each student was requested to complete a testing instrument (semantic differential) which was designed to measure the stereotypes of a socioeconomic range of printing occupations. The results were compared with a similiar instrument administered to employees in the printing industry. The comparison between the responses were used to derive a score which represented the similarity between the student 2 ̆ 7 s stereotype and the occupational concept held by a person employed in that occupation. The resulting score was correlated with a questionnaire which identified gender, vocational maturity, socioeconomic background, industrial experiences, philosophy of the graphic arts courses taken, and the occupational plans of each respondent. The correlation made it possible to compare the effect that the curriculum of graphic arts programs had in the student conceptualization of accurate <b>stereotypes</b> of <b>printing</b> occupations. The method for analyzing the data obtained was by analysis of variance. A further analysis on 2 ̆ 2 individual effects 2 ̆ 2 revealed which level (s) of a significant factor were responsible for improved accuracy in stereotyping. The results of the analyses were: 1. The accuracy of the stereotypes of low socioeconomic printing occupations were significantly greater when students were of a high vocational maturity or have gone on field trips. 2. The accuracy of the stereotypes of medium socioeconomic printing occupations were significantly greater when students were first given instruction under an industrial arts philosophy and then enhanced by instruction in a vocational philosophy, or the student had definite plans to enter into a printing career directly after high school. The analysis also revealed that students from a vocational philosophy were significantly more accurate in stereotyping than students from an industrial arts philosophy. 3. The accuracy of the stereotypes of high socioeconomic printing occupations were significantly greater when students were of a high socioeconomic background, or have had work experience, or personal contacts with people in the trade, or plan to go on for additional education directly after graduation from high school. The analysis also revealed that students who plan to enter into a printing career were significantly more accurate than students who plan on some other career. In short, the accuracy in which students stereotyped occupations was enhanced whenever these students were provided with an opportunity to spend additional hours in a career oriented environment. For instance, the effectiveness of vocational programs, work study, programs, and visitations were associated with the additional hours required to obtain their objectives. Vocational programs requests students for two to three hours a day in order to obtain their curriculum goals. The additional time spent for the purpose of making visitations provided students with increased exposure to the world of work. Work study programs furnished students the opportunity to spend part of their day obtaining on the job training. In all cases, the extra time required for students to participate in these programs have been beneficial in improving the accuracy in which they stereotyped and judged career possibilities. The prime consideration, it would seem, when planning a career oriented curriculum would be to increase the amount of exposure that students have in a vocational environment. In this way, students would have an ample opportunity to acquire adequate occupational stereotypes from which to base a career choice...|$|R
5000|$|How to {{go about}} getting this work {{published}} {{would prove to be}} a tedious affair. By June 23, of 1864, Whitman {{was on the verge of}} a mental breakdown and grew to be so terribly ill from all the work he had been doing in the hospitals that he was forced to retire to his home in Brooklyn. He managed to declare himself [...] "gradually alleviated, until now I go about pretty much the same as usual" [...] on July 24 and dedicated himself to, at last, publishing his collection of poems. [...] "I intend to move heaven & earth to publish my Drum-Taps as soon as I am able to go around", Whitman told his friend and associate William O'Connor. [...] He was excessively motivated to get his work out there but an obstacle had developed. Ironically, it was the perception that his past works had been so highly controversial that had now scared off any legitimate publishers from wanting to buy his fresh compilation of poetry. If this were to be the case, Whitman explained to O’Connor, “I shall probably try to bring it out myself, <b>stereotype</b> it, & <b>print</b> an edition of 500 - I could sell that number by my own exertions in Brooklyn and New York in three weeks." [...] O'Connor was not as confident. He was justifiably concerned that a privately published book would not be available to a large-scale. It was his desire to have this book cement Whitman’s fame. He was going to have to wait for this however. [...] Whitman's dedication to the hospital remained true as well for he would return to Washington as soon as he was physically fit to. Months later, on March 6, of 1865, he received a letter from his mother explaining that George, who had survived the poor conditions experienced at many prisoner of war camps, had been released and was now going home to Brooklyn on medical leave. Walt now desperately wanted to be home. Not only so he could see his brother but he also felt with the way the war was progressing so well now for the Union, this was the perfect time to publish his book. He was only able to gain minimal momentum however after receiving some money from the government. On this date, Whitman signed a contract with printer Peter Eckler to produce five hundred copies of Drum-Taps. Things began to proceed smoothly until the morning of April 15, 1865 when the newspapers told the story of the assassination of President Lincoln. Like the rest of the country, Whitman was deeply saddened by his passing. Over the following months he would split time between Brooklyn and the Capitol while also adding several additions to his compilation of poems. His poem [...] "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" [...] was extremely popular. It was this success (Roy Morris Jr. later wrote that this would be the final success of his career) that finally lead to the publication of Drum-Taps, along with a twenty-four page insert called Sequel to Drum-Taps, on October 28, 1865.|$|R
