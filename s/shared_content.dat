Using the Internet to <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online is {{not only}} a daily {{activity}} for many people, yet a means to share their experiences and emotion with others. This study aims to answer why Internet users in South Africa <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online and to better understand the role of emotion in viral marketing. There are three main objectives of this study: to determine what encourages people to <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online, to investigate the role of emotion in <b>sharing</b> <b>content</b> online and to determine whether {{there is a difference between}} <b>sharing</b> <b>content</b> that elicits positive emotion versus <b>sharing</b> <b>content</b> that elicits negative emotion. The findings assist marketers in conducting viral marketing campaigns that appeal to consumers. Using a two-stage research design, qualitative and exploratory research was conducted. The first-stage is netnography, which is a derivation of ethnography, and was based on YouTube. The second-stage consisted of semi-structured interviews that included two viral video marketing campaigns. This study found that people <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online when content that appeals to people is relevant. Whether people find content relevant or not can depend on their age and/ or gender. People <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online to be altruistic, for self-benefit and social capital. An additional reason for <b>sharing</b> <b>content</b> online is when the content is emotionally appealing. Particularly, it was found that content that elicits positive emotion is more likely to be <b>shared</b> than <b>content</b> that elicits negative emotion. This study addresses gaps in literature in the following ways. Firstly, viral marketing is a growing concept that requires updated research about to provide an understanding of viral marketing that is consistent with its changes in its practice. Secondly, the model provided in this study defines what sharing means in terms of viral marketing, which no other study has done. Thirdly, where previous authors disagree about the difference between <b>sharing</b> <b>content</b> that elicits positive emotion versus <b>sharing</b> <b>content</b> that elicits negative emotion, this study contains updated findings which show that content which elicits positive emotion is more likely to be shared. Additionally, this study shows how the Social Sharing of Emotion theory can be applied to a viral-marketing and online context. The contribution that this study makes is that literature can benefit by understanding that content is king and relevance is important in encouraging people to <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online. Additionally, marketers should focus on creating content that is useful or makes the sender look good socially. Most importantly, to encourage people to <b>share</b> <b>content</b> online, the content should be emotionally appealing and focus should be placed on ensuring the content elicits positive emotion...|$|R
