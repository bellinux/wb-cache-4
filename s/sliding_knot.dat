A suture tensioner device was used to secure the posterior round endobuttons. Once the implant was tensioned, we secured it with half hitches and cut suture tails (Taverna et al., 2014). After bone block procedure, graft stability was tested and humeral head stability and position were evaluated.|$|E
30|$|On the {{evidence}} of these experiments, {{there is no significant}} difference between regular Vicryl and Vicryl Plus. Apparently, the adding of an aseptic compound to the suture to prevent wound infection has no demonstrable effect on the friction coefficient of the suture and its knot reliability. The comparison of Vicryl and Safil showed superior results for Vicryl in all knot types tested, except for the identical <b>sliding</b> <b>knot</b> with three throws (S=S=S). The comparison of Vicryl and Novosyn showed no differences, except for the identical slipknot with five throws (S=S=S=S=S) in which Vicryl did better. All the knot types showed higher LHCs with Novosyn in comparison with Safil, besides the identical slipknots with three and five throws (S=S=S and S=S=S=S=S). These findings indicate that Safil has inferior knot performance as compared to Vicryl and Novosyn. Novosyn and Vicryl showed similar knot profiles.|$|E

We describe the double-twist knot (DTK) technique, having tested the knot's tensile strength and compared it with other commonly used arthroscopic knots. The DTK is a modified Lark's head knot that can be tied only on a double suture. A No. 2 braided polyester suture {{was used to test}} the DKT against the Tennessee slider knot and Snyder's knot by means of a material testing system. Results showed a statistically significant (P <. 001) higher tensile strength with the DTK than with the other 2 knots. The rationale for using a stitch with a double suture is to double the tensile strength while using the same number of surgical steps and operating time as with single-suture stitches...|$|E
30|$|Although {{the flat}} square knots are {{considered}} very secure with low failure rates across {{a variety of}} suture materials [4], <b>sliding</b> <b>knots</b> are the most frequently used in surgery. Gynaecologic surgeons also prefer <b>sliding</b> <b>knots,</b> because of the advantage that one suture end can be kept under constant tension while tying in the narrow deep spaces of the vagina and the pelvis.

40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} {{the feasibility of}} a novel technique that modifies the configuration of a thoracic stent-graft after deployment {{to comply with the}} arch curvature. Technique: The principle of a Bowden cable has been applied to direct a conventional thoracic stent-graft in situ after deployment. A suture placed at the proximal inner curve of a conventional thoracic stent-graft is fitted with a sliding, self-locking knot attached to a line that runs inside a catheter through the central rod of the stent-graft. Traction applied to this line directs the endograft post deployment, which allows for better apposition to the aortic wall. Shortening the inner curve makes the stent-graft bend. The extent of bending is fully controlled by the surgeon and held in place with the <b>sliding</b> <b>knot.</b> A release mechanism allows removal of all luminal components of the mechanism. Conclusion: The described technique of directing a thoracic stent-graft in situ seems feasible and enables better apposition of the stent-graft in a glass model. It may improve the durability of thoracic stent-grafts in the aortic arch...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Too {{develop a}} {{flexible}} drill device {{that can be}} inserted into the shoulder joint so that arthro-scopic transosseous suture repair for Bankart lesion is possible. Materials and Methods: We created a device composed of a flexible drill unit and a guide pipe unit. The flexible drill unit was made of flexible multifilament wires (1. 2 mm in diameter) that was twisted into one cord {{so that it can}} flex in any direction and a drill bit (1. 2 mm in diameter) that is attached onto one end of the flexible wire. The guide pipe unit was a 150 mm long metal pipe (2. 0 mm in inner diameter and 3. 0 mm in outer diameter), with one end bent to 30 degrees. The flexible drill set was inserted into the shoul-der joint through the posterior portal of the joint. The guide pipe component was placed onto the medial wall of the glenoid so that the pipe was placed 5 mm posterior to the margin of the anterior glenoid rim. The flexible drill was driven through the glenoid by the power drill so that holes were made in the gle-noid. A non- absorbable suture was passed through the hole. Tying of a <b>sliding</b> <b>knot</b> tying was accom-plished over the capsule and labrum after making a stitch through the capsule and labrum with a suture hook loaded with suture passer.

40|$|Background: Forces {{applied to}} knots used for {{interrupted}} vs. continuous closures are very different. We studied the knot strength and knot security of three knots when simulating a continuous wound closure: the square, the sliding, and a hybrid constructed using a surgeon’s square knot {{followed by a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>knot.</b> Mate-rials and Methods: Knot holding capacity (KHC) of single-strand 1 - 0 polypropylene was determined by slow distraction on a horizontal testing sled of the strand {{that would be used}} to complete a continuous (“running”) closure following placement of an anchoring knot with six throws. Distraction continued until failure of the knot defined as breakage or slippage of the knot. Results: The mean and standard deviation of KHC meas-ured in pounds was determined (n = 30 for each knot) : standard square 8. 94 +/– 1. 04; sliding 10. 72 +/– 1. 35; and hybrid 10. 95 +/– 1. 10. For each knot the relative knot security [(KHC of the knot/Tensile strength of untied strand) x 100] was calculated: standard square 69. 5 %; sliding 83. 4 %; hybrid 85. 2 %. Significant dif-ferences (p < 0. 0001) in KHC exist between square and sliding knots (favoring sliding knots) and between square and hybrid knots (favoring hybrid knots). Hybrid and sliding knots were not statistically different. Conclusion: Sliding knots and hybrid knots are superior to square knots as anchoring knots for single-strand continuous wound closure...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: A new locking <b>sliding</b> <b>knot</b> (HK-Knot) was {{developed}} in the author’s institute. A biomechanical study was performed to compare the properties of HK-Knot with Revo knot, SMC knot and Duncan Loop. Methodology: A total of 80 knots (20 in each group) were tested. All the knots were tied by a single surgeon using No. 2 FiberWire®. The knot was created around two metal bars separated by 10 mm {{with the help of a}} single-hole knot pusher. The biomechanical testing protocol of the original paper describing SMC knot was adopted (Kim, 2003). The initial slack in suture loop, average displacement at cyclic loading, load to clinical failure, ultimate load to failure and mode of failure were documented. Results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was assumed if p< 0. 05. Result: There was no difference between HK-Knot and SMC knot in both load to clinical failure (98 N versus 99 N) and ultimate load to failure (139 N versus 149 N). The result of the current study compared favourably with the data of SMC knot published by Kim (92 N and 107 N respectively). HK-Knot had the best performance in loop security (0. 13 mm, p < 0. 001, Kruskal-Wallis test). The average initial slack in Revo knot, SMC knot and Duncan Loop were 0. 43 mm, 0. 3 mm and 0. 17 mm respectively. Discussion and Conclusion: Among all the four knot configurations studied, HK-Knot had the optimal balance between knot strength and loop security...|$|E
30|$|Experimental {{laboratory}} study {{was made to}} test the knot integrity of identical, non-identical and parallel sliding knots, with three and five throws, made with synthetic resorbable multifilament suture materials. The knots were made with Novosyn (polyglactin 612), Safil (polyglycolic acid), Vicryl (polyglactin 612) and Vicryl plus (polyglactin 910 + triclosan), all with suture size: 3 - 0 USP. Per material 10 knots for every kind of knot were tested in a tensiometer, {{resulting in a total}} of 240 tests. Sliding knots with three throws were compared with the five throw sliding knots, and a comparison of the loop-holding capacities (LHC) of the different suture materials was made. Differences in suture material, knot type, and number of throws in the knot had a remarkable effect on knot performance. Adding two extra throws to a three throw non-identical or parallel <b>sliding</b> <b>knot</b> resulted in significantly more reliable knots (P[*]<[*] 0.05). In identical sliding knots, this effect was not seen, but these knots showed low LHCs, indicating poor knot reliability. Compared to the other suture materials, Safil showed significantly lower LHCs. Most of the mean LHCs of the various knots with Vicryl, Vicryl Plus or Novosyn were not statistically different from each other. Identical sliding knots appeared to be very unreliable, especially when made with three throws. Non-identical and parallel slipknots with five throws demonstrated superior knot integrity compared with the same knot types with three throws. Safil had inferior knot properties as compared to the other materials, but Vicryl, Vicryl Plus and Novosyn behaved virtually the same. The type of knot and the use of different suture materials have important influence on the integrity of the knot. A high knot reliability is nowadays all the more important because of the frequent use of resorbable suture materials. The suture gradually loses strength during the resorption process, so that an extra margin of safety neutralizes the effect of this process.|$|E
40|$|Myomectomy {{remains the}} {{standard}} surgical treatment {{for women with}} uterine myoma, who wish to preserve their fertility. However, it {{is often associated with}} increased blood loss and adhesion formation. Laparoscopic myomectomy has multiple advantages over open myomectomy 1. A newer approach, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, also known as LESS, has been developed and applied in gynecologic field. 2 This is a case of a 41 -year-old G 2 P 1 patient, with the complaints of irregular menstrual cycles and lower abdominal pain for 6 months. Transvaginal ultrasound showed uterine myoma at the anterior corpus, measuring 6  ×  5  cm 2. The procedure is started by grasping the bilateral edges of the umbilicus with Allis forceps. A vertical incision, 1. 5 – 2  cm, is made from the superficial skin of the umbilicus to the ventral peritoneum. A wound retractor of appropriate size is inserted and adjusted. A multiple instrument access port (LagisEndosurgical, Taichung, Taiwan) is placed over the wound retractor (Figure  1). Prior to the procedure, inspection of the pelvic organs is performed to determine the pathology. Vasopressin is injected over the area of the myoma to decrease blood loss. Location of the myoma is then identified. Uterine incision is made on the serosa over the area of the myoma using the monopolar scissors. Using a bipolar instrument LigaSure®, ValleyLab, Inc., Boulder, Colorado), the incision is extended until the myoma is exposed. The myoma is grasped gently using the tenaculum forcep, and dissected bluntly along with it's pseudocapsule using the tip of suction irrigation gear. At the base of the myoma where feeding vessels may be located, coagulation by the advanced bipolar, is performed to prevent bleeding. The specimen is removed through the umbilicus. A <b>sliding</b> <b>knot</b> is made at the tail of one zero monofilament suture to fasten the anchor of the first knot. The uterus is then repaired with a continuous non-locking method. Hemostasis is ensured after the suturing. A fibrin sealant, Tisseel (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL), is applied over the suture site as an adjunct to hemostasis and also to prevent adhesion. The fundamental advantage of LESS is less incision, as a result, improves cosmesis. LESS myomectomy has many technical difficulties, including reduced visualization, loss of triangulation, and instrument interference. Thus, the type, location and numbers of the myomas are critical to succeed LESS myomectomy. The Food and Drug Administration has approved fibrin sealant in 1998 as an adjunct to hemostasis and sealing. Besides, certain studies have reported its anti-adhesion property. Upon mixing of the two components in the lumens of Tisseel, the combinations of thrombin and fibrinogen transformed into fibrin, forming a rubber-like tissue that adheres to the wound surface...|$|E
40|$|PurposeA {{straight}} thoracic {{stent graft}} often complies poorly with the {{curvature of the}} aortic arch. We have previously reported an in vitro model of a modified stent graft that can be bent in situ after deployment to improve conformance to the aortic arch. We now report the first clinical experience with this technique in three consecutive patients. MethodsBetween September 2007 and August 2008, three patients were treated for different pathologies of the aortic arch with a modified thoracic stent graft that was fitted with a <b>sliding</b> self-locking <b>knot</b> and a detachable Bowden cable. Transfemoral traction on the Bowden cable enables controlled shortening of the proximal part of the stent graft at the inner curve after deployment. The stent graft is thereby directed to allow for better apposition to the aortic wall. ResultsThe modified thoracic stent grafts were correctly orientated and deployed in all patients. Transfemoral traction on the Bowden cable successfully bent all stent grafts and improved vessel wall apposition without a residual gap on the inner curve. The Bowden cable was successfully released and withdrawn in all patients. ConclusionIn situ bending of thoracic stent grafts with a <b>sliding</b> self-locking <b>knot</b> is feasible and improves proximal apposition of the device at the inner curve of the aortic arch. More data and longer follow-up are required to confirm the applicability of this technique...|$|R
50|$|Make {{a secure}} loop of a cord (see Double fisherman's knot) that is {{definitely}} narrower than the rope. Wrap {{from one end}} around the rope {{two or three times}} in a direction that will be down. The loose end is then threaded through the starting end, and carefully tightened to leave the wraps neat. In use, strain must be taken only on the hanging end. If the knot slips when load is placed on the hanging loop, re-tie around the climbing rope another time or two, until there is no slippage. Holding around the wraps will let you <b>slide</b> the <b>knot</b> up or down. Making the wraps slide when the hitch is under tension will create friction heat on the rope and the knot.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the viscoelastic properties of 6 common arthroscopic <b>sliding</b> <b>knots</b> (Tennessee slider, Roeder knot, SMC knot, Duncan loop, Weston knot, and Nicky's knot) with 3 reversing half-hitches on alternating posts, tied with No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex, Naples, FL). Knot configuration was designed to simulate a double-row rotator cuff repair with suture bridges. Methods: Constructs were loaded in 20 -N increments to 100 N and held for 2 minutes to monitor the viscoelastic behavior in tension. Suture was also tested without tying a knot. Results: Stress relaxation increased with loading but did not differ between knot configurations. Initial elongation was highest during the first loading to 20 N. Relaxation was greater for the Roeder knot at 20 N and for the Roeder and SMC knots at 80 N (P <. 05) {{when compared with the}} loop with no knot. Elongation was greatest for the Roeder knot throughout all loads. This difference was significant at 60 N compared with the knotless loop. At 100 N, all knots showed greater elongation than the knotless loop (P <. 05). Testing of suture, without any knots, accounted for more than 75 % of the overall stress relaxation and loop elongation of the suture-knot construct. Conclusions: In our in vitro evaluation of the Tennessee slider, Roeder knot, SMC knot, Duncan loop, Weston knot, and Nicky's knot in a simulated suture bridge construct, knot configuration was not a variable that influenced elongation or stress relaxation. Overall response was primarily due to the suture itself. With the exception of the Roeder knot, relaxation was similar provided that a secure knot was formed at the time of original tying. Clinical Relevance: With the evolution of surgical devices, the reliance on knots is decreasing. The {{results of this study suggest}} that using knotless techniques for securing the rotator cuff will not change the stress relaxation characteristics of the suture bridge. 5 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Three of {{the most}} common arthroscopic knots in the {{literature}} were tested in this study: the SMC knot, the Weston knot, and the surgeon’s knot (Baumgarten and Wright 2010). The SMC and Weston <b>knot</b> are <b>sliding</b> <b>knots</b> while the surgeon’s knot is a static, non-sliding knot. After obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, these knots were taught to orthopaedic surgery residents at our institution, the trainees, by a fellowship trained sports medicine orthopaedic surgeon, the instructor. Education consisted of each knot being demonstrated by the instructor with an arthroscopic knot simulator followed by a period of hands on practice with the same simulators. The “SAWBONES” (Pacific Research Laboratories) “FAST” (Fundamentals of Arthroscopic Training) box-trainer was utilized by the instructor to demonstrate the various arthroscopic knots. Each knot was demonstrated by the instructor five successive times while verbally explaining how the knot is tied. The trainees were then given up to thirty minutes to practice all three knots on the box-trainer simulator. The instructor was available during the practice period to answer any questions and assist the residents with knot tying. Formal testing did not begin until the resident felt ready to proceed or thirty minutes of practice had elapsed. Trainees were not formally “approved” to proceed by the instructor and only trainees themselves determined when they were appropriate to begin formal testing. Formal testing consisted of 3 SMC knots, 3 Weston knots and 3 surgeon’s knots during the initial session. Following a one-week washout period the same 9 knots were again tied at a second session. Therefore, each resident tied a total of n[*]=[*] 18 knots. A single orthopaedic sports medicine fellow tied the same number of knots to serve as a positive control and allow for a baseline comparison for the study cohort. The knots were tied on an arthroscopic knot-tying simulator using standard arthroscopic portals and knot pusher. Upon completion, the knots were carefully slid off of the arthroscopic testing apparatus without violating the integrity of the knot. The knot tails were then cut to a length of 5  cm and placed into de-identified bags to blind the researchers during biomechanical testing. A braided, nonabsorbent suture material was used for all knots (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ).|$|R
2500|$|When a {{shoelace}} is {{secured with}} a knot, the lace is crimped, or squashed. Primarily {{this is what}} stops the lace from coming undone. In effect, the lace is narrower inside the knot than {{it is on the}} loose end, and the loose end cannot make itself smaller and <b>slide</b> though the <b>knot.</b> [...] Generally, a flat tubular lace will stay tied more easily than a round lace with a core because the flat lace can be more crimped within the knot. Most laces, however, are round and have core of cotton yarn, especially boot laces. For these to stay tied securely, the core {{on the inside of the}} lace must be soft and compressible. A secondary factor of laces coming undone is the knot itself slipping. This is due to a lack of friction. Cotton laces have a rough surface and will make a more reliable knot compared to polyester (the most common yarn used in shoelaces). In addition, a lace can be smooth or have a coarse surface, which will also affect performance. Finishing processes are available, including waxing and silicone treatments, which enhance friction and stop knot slippage. These are important design factors in the manufacture of hiking-boot laces.|$|R
