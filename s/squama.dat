5|$|At the {{posterior}} {{angle of the}} wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} membranous lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer <b>squama</b> (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner <b>squama</b> (d) arises from {{the posterior}} scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer <b>squama</b> of the alula is turned upside down above the inner <b>squama,</b> the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer <b>squama</b> of the alula.|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Currently, {{only a limited}} numbers of tumor markers for non small lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis, new biomarker, such as serum autoantibody may improve the early detection of lung cancer. Our objective is construction human lung squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma T 7 phage display cDNA library from the tissues of NSCLC patients. Methods mRNA was isolated {{from a pool of}} total RNA extract from NSCLC tissues obtained from 5 adenocarcinomas and 5 squamous carcinomas, and then mRNA was reverse transcribed into double stranded cDNA. After digestion, the cDNA was inserted into T 7 Select 10 - 3 vector. The phage display cDNA library was constructed by package reaction in vitro and plate proliferation. Plaque assay and PCR were used to evaluate the library. Results Two T 7 phage display cDNA library were established. Plaque assay show the titer of lung <b>squamas</b> carcinoma library was 1. 8 × 106 pfu, and the adenocarcinoma library was 5 × 106 pfu. The phage titer of the amplified library were 3. 2 × 1010 pfu/mL and 2. 5 × 1010 pfu/mL. PCR amplification of random plaque show insert ratio were 100 % (24 / 24) in adenocarcinoma library and 95. 8 % in human lung <b>squamas</b> carcinoma library (23 / 24). Insert range from 300 bp to 1 500 bp. Conclusion Two phage display cDNA library from NSCLC were constructed...|$|R

The internal structure of the scales shows a stack of planar sheets, separated by a well-organized network of spacers, a structure which belongs to the family of the layer-by-layer photonic crystals.
