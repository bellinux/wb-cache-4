25|$|Amid the Diocletian Persecutions, Anthony {{wished to}} become a martyr and in 311 went to Alexandria. He visited those who were imprisoned {{for the sake of}} Christ and comforted them. When the Governor <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> confessing his Christianity publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be {{tortured}} and martyred, but it did not happen.|$|E
25|$|Fog {{shrouded}} {{the area}} at dawn on 12 April. When it cleared, several French cannons began firing from Monte Negino on the Austrians below them and Argenteau <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{confronted by a}} large force. Shortly afterward, Masséna's soldiers launched their attack on the weakly held Austrian right flank, swamping the defenders with superior numbers. Argenteau deployed the Stein and Pellegrini battalions under Oberstleutnant Nesslinger to hold the center and assigned the two Archduke Anton battalions to defend the left flank on Monte Pra. Then he took the Alvinczi battalion {{to the rescue of}} the 3rd Terzi battalion on his right flank.|$|E

500|$|It was a {{conflict}} with the pagan Mercians under Penda {{that proved to be}} Oswald's undoing. He was killed by the Mercians at the Battle of Maserfield, at a place generally identified with Oswestry (although other candidates for the location of the battle have been suggested) in 642, and his body was dismembered. Bede mentions the story that Oswald [...] "ended his life in prayer": he prayed for the souls of his soldiers when he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to die. Oswald's head and limbs were placed on stakes.|$|E
500|$|On 10 March 1322 Edward's main force {{crossed the}} river at Walton and {{proceeded}} to {{the south side of}} Burton. [...] Lancaster moved his men outside the town, intending to face the King in open battle, but withdrew northwards when he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> heavily outnumbered. [...] Lancaster was pursued closely by the King's men and eventually captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge; he was later executed on the King's orders. [...] Lancaster's defeat removed the immediate threat to Edward's rule, but the King continued to prove unpopular with his barons, and in 1327 was forced to abdicate the throne in favour of his son Edward III.|$|E
500|$|Around May 1951, Gravel <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{about to}} be drafted and instead enlisted in the U.S. Army for a three-year term {{so that he could}} get into the Counterintelligence Corps. After basic {{training}} and counterintelligence school at Fort Holabird in Maryland and in South Carolina, he went to Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia. While he expected to be sent off to the Korean War when he graduated as a second lieutenant in early 1952, he was instead assigned to Stuttgart, West Germany, as a [...] Special Adjutant in the Army's Communications Intelligence Service. There he had an adventurous time moving around the country, conducting surveillance operations on civilians, and paying off spies. After about a year he transferred to Orléans, France, where his French language abilities (if not his Quebec-American accent) allowed him to infiltrate French communist rallies. He worked as a Special Agent in the Counterintelligence Corps until 1954, eventually becoming a first lieutenant.|$|E

His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E

I <b>saw</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his voice as he added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'" [...] Peter Stoddart died on 4 July 1988 following a stroke.|$|E

2500|$|In 645, Emperor Taizong was attacking Goguryeo. Cen {{followed}} {{him on the}} campaign and was {{deeply involved in the}} logistics—so much so that his energy was drained.

Although previously he had worked closely with British colonists, Onyango became bitterly anti-British after his abuse. According to his third wife, Sarah, Onyango had converted from tribal religion to Catholicism early in life. When he later converted to Islam, he took the first name Hussein. She said that he passed on the name of Hussein to his children, but not the religion. Onyango is {{sometimes referred to as}} Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama.

2500|$|One year later, Abd-Allah ibn Amir sent an army under Rabi ibn Ziyad Harithi to Sakastan. After some time, {{he reached}} Zaliq, a border town between Kirman and Sakastan, where he forced the dehqan {{of the town}} to {{acknowledge}} Rashidun authority. [...] He then did the same at the fortress of Karkuya, which had a famous fire temple, which is mentioned in the Tarikh-i Sistan. He then continued to seize more land in the province. He thereafter besieged the capital Zrang, and after a heavy battle outside the city, its governor Aparviz surrendered. When Aparviz went to Rabi ibn Ziyad to discuss about the conditions of a treaty, he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> using the bodies of two dead soldiers as a chair. This horrified Aparviz, who in order to spare the inhabitants of Sakastan from the Arabs, made peace with them {{in return for a}} heavy tribute of 1 million dirhams, including 1,000 slave boys (or girls) bearing 1,000 golden vessels. Rabi ibn Ziyad was then appointed as the governor of province.|$|E

2500|$|However, in 1172, the anti-Byzantine {{coalition}} that Nemanja had {{joined with the}} Kingdom of Hungary, the Venetian Republic and the Holy Roman Empire collapsed. Venice faced a mutiny and an outbreak of plague that devastated her navy, while the King of Hungary died and a new, pro-Byzantine King ascended that throne. Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos had launched an expedition and Nemanja's defeat seemed certain. Thus, the Grand Župan sought leave to parley and met the Emperor in Niš [...] with his head and feet bare and a halter around his neck, much as the rebel Reginald of Chatillon who had established himself as Prince of Antioch had 13 years before, and received reinstatement. However, although Nemanja bowed before Emperor Manuel and surrendered his personal sword, he was imprisoned and brought to the Imperial Capital of Constantinople {{to take part in}} a triumphal entry as a defeated barbarian. However, the emperor also befriended Nemanja and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> tutored. Nemanja vowed to never again attack Manuel, while the Emperor in return recognized Stefan Nemanja and his bloodline as the rightful Grand Župans of the Rascian lands.|$|E

2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest.

2500|$|The Mexico City police {{department}} {{noticed that the}} Matamoros killings were similar to murders carried out in Mexico City between 1987 and 1989. After consulting local witchcraft practitioners and sorcerers, the police heard that Constanzo was probably hiding in Cuauhtémoc, one of the city's boroughs. Another contact told the police {{that there was an}} address of interest in the [...] neighborhood, next to Cuauhtémoc. The {{police department}} sent 16 officers to search the area. At a supermarket, they interrogated a shoemaker who claimed to have seen a woman who matched Aldrete's description. The police then spotted a man at the supermarket who was attempting to buy large amounts of groceries with U.S. dollars. They followed the man and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> living at an apartment on Río Sena. By the end of the week, the police concluded that the man was De León and that he was buying groceries for Constanzo. On May 6, 1989, the police surrounded the building and waited for traffic to subside before raiding the premises. However, a black vehicle {{pulled up in front of}} the apartment complex and the police walked over to investigate. Constanzo noticed the police from the window of his apartment and opened fire at the officers who were at ground level. Constanzo threw golden coins and paper money from the window, and burned some of his money on a stove. Constanzo eventually ran out of ammunition and began to lose his patience. After about 45 minutes, and worried of his imminent capture, Constanzo ordered De León to kill him and Quintana Rodríguez.|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
