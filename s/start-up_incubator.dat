We use five incubator archetypes (university, regional business, company-internal, independent commercial, and virtual incubators) to identify key services and describe their implementation. Case-research was conducted on 10 incubators (from an estimated total of 50) in Italy. We concluded that differences in competitive scope (industry, geography, and segment focus) and differences in strategic objectives (profit versus non-for-profit) influence the nature, quality and implementation of incubation services {{and the way they}} are managed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationships}} between university and industry {{have become increasingly}} important. On the one hand, investment in new technologies, {{as a response to}} the rapid and constant changes in the competitive environment, is vital to firms, and on the other hand, the universities have been call upon to have a more intervening stance in the enterprise context, reinforcing their so-called “third mission ” in terms of a direct intervention in the economic circuit. Policy directives have led to an almost generalized adoption of specific measures by the part of the higher education sector, including the implementation of organizational structures that deal with technology transfer (technology transfer offices, science parks and <b>start-up</b> <b>incubators</b> near the university premises’), the implementation or reinforcement of new regulatory structures concerning intellectual property (the possibility to protect research findings by university staff through the patent mechanism) and stimulus for greater interaction with society at large (alterations in the requirements for career progression). In this work we propose to look at the perspective of the enterprise, and explore the motives, the mechanisms, and the practice of firms that interact with universities. We privilege an integrated view of the phenomenon, focusing on the process of evaluation and adoption of technologies generated in the universities, and licensed or acquired by firms. Research on this theme is scattered and difficult t...|$|R

40|$|As the United States slowly {{emerges from}} the great recession, a {{remarkable}} shify is occurring in the spatial geogrpahy of innovation. For the past 50 years, the landscape of innovation {{has been dominated by}} places like Silicon Valley - suburban corridors of spatially isolated corporate campuses, accessible only by car, with little emphasis on the quality of life or on integrating work, housing, and recreation. A new complementary urban model is now emerging, giving rise to what we and others are calling "innovation districts.

50|$|Nabel {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of reimagining how care is delivered to patients, and created a number of new initiatives at BWH to advance this work. The Integrated Care Management Program assigns a nurse care coordinator to high-risk patients.

The Care Redesign <b>Start-up</b> and <b>Incubator</b> Program encourages teams of frontline clinicians to submit proposals to improve the quality of care and reduce health care costs, and then provides them with resources and support to implement their ideas. The new Vidscrips program allows BWHC care providers to record videos and “prescribe” them to patients, while a Virtual Visits program enables patients to remotely see and talk with their clinician.|$|R

30|$|We have briefly {{mentioned}} that two <b>incubator</b> <b>start-ups</b> are now collaborating to leverage a spinoff. Anecdotally, {{this can be}} described as “the exception that proves the rule,” but {{it is worth noting that}} these are the only entrepreneurs that have emerged from what we have labelled “start-up communities.” This may indicate that such start-ups have a greater proclivity to be flexible and open-minded in terms of generating novel ideas.
