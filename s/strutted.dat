40|$|Open cell foams {{are formed}} by an {{interconnected}} network of <b>struts</b> whose thickness varies locally.

Conflating these estimates based on the <b>strut</b> lengths results in a <b>strut</b> thickness profile for the entire foam.

In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds to her from the US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and she had long been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of La Prensa and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua {{is one of the most}} religious countries in Latin America.

40|$|Abstract: A twin-gas-chamber {{hydropneumatic}} suspension <b>strut</b> concept is proposed to achieve enhanced bounce and pitch ride, and pitch attitude control. The response char-acteristics of the twin-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension are {{compared with those}} of a single-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension to demonstrate not only superior performance potentials but also the added design flexibility offered by the twin-gas-chamber <b>struts.</b> The relative responses of both <b>strut</b> suspensions are evaluated through analysis of a pitch plane vehicle model, subject to straight-line braking inputs and excitations arising from randomly distributed road elevations. A generalized formulation for the <b>strut</b> forces is presented to derive the bounce and pitch rates of the proposed <b>strut</b> suspensions. The results reveal that the twin-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension exhibits a slightly lower pitch stiffness in the vicinity of design ride height, but progressively hardening effects with increasing pitch deflections. Moreover, the twin-gas-chamber <b>strut</b> suspension exhibits considerably fewer hardening–softening effects in suspension rate compared with the suspension involving the single-gas-chamber <b>struts.</b> The results attained from the parametric studies are also discussed to demonstrate superior design flexibility of the twin-gas-chamber <b>struts</b> for tuning of the suspension bounce and pitc...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the phenomenon of buckling using simple <b>struts.</b> These results were then compared with the theoretical predictions. Three steel <b>struts</b> of different length {{were used in the}} experiment; one of them had fix/pinned-end all the others had pin/pin-end joint. The applied load was placed at different eccentricities for each <b>strut.</b> Six aluminium pin-end <b>struts</b> of varying length were also tested. The measured critical load for each <b>strut</b> was compared against the corresponding Euler and Southwell predictions. For a steel <b>strut,</b> it would be expected that buckling would be symmetrical for left and right eccentricities. However, {{this was not the case}} due to imperfections in the <b>struts.</b> The <b>struts</b> buckled with half sine-wave and if one end of the <b>strut</b> was fixed the effective length was reduced and the critical load was increased. In the case of the aluminium <b>struts,</b> due to plastic behaviour in the deformation it was much harder to find the critical load. For steel <b>struts</b> both Euler and Southwell predictions were close to initial estimates of critical load...|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} efficiency of carbon-epoxy tapered <b>struts</b> is considered through trade studies, detailed analysis, manufacturing and experimentation. Since {{some of the}} lunar lander <b>struts</b> are more highly loaded than <b>struts</b> used in applications such as satellites and telescopes, {{the primary focus of}} the effort is on these highly loaded <b>struts.</b> Lunar lander requirements include that the <b>strut</b> has to be tapered on both ends, complicating the design and limiting the manufacturing process.
