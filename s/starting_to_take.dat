5|$|In early 1903, Harding {{announced}} he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by {{the withdrawal of the}} leading candidate, Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a dimmer view of the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E

25|$|ABC, CBS and NBC are {{headquartered}} in New York City, {{which is the}} largest television market in the U.S., so their respective radio and television stations in that market are considered the overall network flagship stations. As programming schedules increased and modern technology improved transmission to affiliates, the networks set up operations centers in New York City (for the East Coast feed) and Los Angeles (for the West Coast feed). Los Angeles is the second largest television market in the U.S., and traditional home to the motion picture industry and its pool of popular talent, {{one of the reasons the}} radio networks set up operations there in the 1930s and 1940s (just as the medium of television was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off).|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay in the past, that there was a reason for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E

25|$|His {{popularity}} in Australia saw Hall invited {{to play with}} Queensland for the 1961–62 Sheffield Shield season. Hall enjoyed an immensely successful season with Queensland and {{a key part of}} the team's second place in the Sheffield Shield competition—behind perennial powerhouse New South Wales. Hall took 43 wickets for the season at an average of 20.25, trailing only Richie Benaud of New South Wales in the season aggregate. Hall's 43 wickets set a new record for a Queensland bowler in a first-class cricket season. Hall returned for a second season with Queensland in 1962–63, taking 33 wickets for the season as Queensland again finished runner-up in the Sheffield Shield, this time to Victoria. Towards the end of Hall's second season, it became clear that the demands of playing cricket 12 months of the year were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a toll on Hall. Queensland were keen to see Hall return for another season in 1963–64 but Hall declined, fearing his body would not stand up to the strain.|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you {{have something to say about}} the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

[...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E

2500|$|While the Torah {{may have}} been {{considered}} canon by Israel {{as early as the}} 5th century BCE [...] and the Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, Michael Coogan says that the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century CE. According to T. Henshaw, as early as 132 BCE some references suggesting that the Ketuvim was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> shape, though it lacked a formal title. Jacob Neusner says something different, he argues that the notion of a biblical canon was not prominent in 2nd-century Rabbinic Judaism or even later.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{suffered}} from sickle-cell anemia, which frequently wrought [...] havoc on his physical health. In 1965, Williams began {{an affair with}} Winnie Brown, hair stylist for The Supremes and a relative of Supremes member Florence Ballard.
