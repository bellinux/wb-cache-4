40|$|AbstractThe {{inhibition}} {{of the rate}} and amplitude of assembly of microtubule protein at low GTP concentration is shown by measurement of microtubule length distributions {{to be due to}} the suppression of microtubule nucleation. This inhibitory effect is enhanced by GDP added before assembly, but can be overcome by a number of molecules such as pyrophosphate or ADP. The selective {{inhibition of}} nucleation by GDP in vitro, which occurs in addition to inhibition of elongation, could provide a mechanism for the control of <b>spontaneous</b> microtubule <b>nucleation</b> in vivo...|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of amorphous ice {{hinges on the}} fast rate of cooling. Liquid water must be cooled to its glass transition temperature (about 136 K or −137 °C) in milliseconds to prevent the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> of crystals.

Thymosin and Profilin both exist as actin-monomer-sequestering proteins that maintain the ability to limit <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> from occurring, thus halting the actin remodeling process and returning the cycle to its first step. Additionally, the cell utilizes polyphosphoinositides to aid in the removal of all known [...] "barbed end" [...] capping proteins.|$|E
50|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} or c-BN was first {{synthesized}} in 1957 by Robert H. Wentorf at General Electric, {{shortly after the}} synthesis of diamond. The general process for c-BN synthesis is the dissolution of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in a solvent-catalyst, usually alkali or alkaline earth metals or their nitrides, followed by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> of c-BN under high pressure, high temperature (HPHT) conditions. The yield of c-BN is lower and substantially slower compared to diamond's synthetic route due to the complicated intermediate steps. Its insolubility in iron and other metal alloys makes it more useful for some industrial applications than diamond.|$|E

2500|$|Water {{and other}} [...] liquids can {{superheat}} when heated {{in a microwave}} oven in a container with a smooth surface. That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start explosively when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in <b>spontaneous</b> boiling (<b>nucleation)</b> which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe scalding.|$|R

Experiments were conducted in a three-electrode high-pressure electrochemical cell in a 0. 1 M Ba(OH) 2 electrolyte at 150 °C. Results showed that the <b>spontaneous</b> initial <b>nucleation</b> linked to pure hydrothermal BaTiO 3 formation can be inhibited by cathodically protecting the titanium electrode from the moment it is immersed in the electrolyte. The application of initial nucleation pulses of varying cathodic potentials affected the grain size of the deposit.

50|$|The {{condition}} {{that the number}} of droplets should be much larger than the number of ice crystals depends on the fraction of cloud condensation nuclei that would later (higher in the cloud) act as ice nuclei. Alternatively, an adiabatic updraft has to be sufficiently fast so that high supersaturation causes <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> of many more droplets than cloud condensation nuclei are present. In either case, this should happen not far below the freezing point as this would cause direct nucleation of ice. The growth of the droplets would prevent the temperature from soon reaching the point of fast nucleation of ice crystals.|$|E
50|$|It is unlikely, however, {{that new}} phases often arise by this {{fluctuation}} mechanism {{and the resultant}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation.</b> Calculations show that the chance, e−ΔS/k, is usually too small. It {{is more likely that}} tiny dust particles act as nuclei in supersaturated vapours or solutions. In the cloud chamber, it is the clusters of ions caused by a passing high-energy particle that acts as nucleation centra. Actually, vapours seem to be much less finicky than solutions about the sort of nuclei required. This is because a liquid will condense on almost any surface, but crystallization requires the presence of crystal faces of the proper kind.|$|E
50|$|These results led to {{the problem}} of how new phases can ever arise from old ones. For example, if a {{container}} filled with water vapour at slightly below the saturation pressure is suddenly cooled, perhaps by adiabatic expansion, as in a cloud chamber, the vapour may become supersaturated with respect to liquid water. It is then in a metastable state, and we may expect condensation to take place. A reasonable molecular model of condensation would seem to be that two or three molecules of water vapour come together to form a tiny droplet, and that this nucleus of condensation then grows by accretion, as additional vapour molecules happen to hit it. The Kelvin equation, however, indicates that a tiny droplet like this nucleus, being only a few ångströms in diameter, would have a vapour pressure many times that of the bulk liquid. As far as tiny nuclei are concerned, the vapour would not be supersaturated at all. Such nuclei should immediately re-evaporate, and {{the emergence of a new}} phase at the equilibrium pressure, or even moderately above it should be impossible. Hence, the over-saturation must be several times higher than the normal saturation value for <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> to occur.|$|E

Analysis of the crystallisation process at three stages of the simulation using Voronoi polyhedra indices shows that both bcc and fcc nuclei continue to grow. Methods of delineating the nuclei and the effects on their resulting shape and size are discussed, and it is shown how ambiguities in structure which arise both for particular index types and local arrangements can be resolved using computer graphics techniques. Some of the drawings displayed {{give the impression of}} localised phase change from bcc to fcc structure though these events have yet to be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a crack in iron is studied using computer simulation. A Morse interatomic potential is used which is of a longer ranged nature than the potentials used in previous studies. With this potential, blunting of the crack tip by <b>spontaneous</b> dislocation <b>nucleation</b> occurs under most conditions. The presence of hydrogen appears to inhibit this blunting and thus to encourage brittle fracture. In the absence of hydrogen, a temperature dependent brittle-ductile transition is observed for some loads. This behavior {{is quite different from}} that observed when shorter ranged potentials are used, and it appears to be in somewhat better agreement with experimental results. This agreement with experiment is not conclusive, however, indicating the need for further work to determine more accurate potentials...|$|R
40|$|Water keeps puzzling {{scientists}} {{because of}} its numerous properties which behave oppositely to usual liquids: for instance, water expands upon cooling, and liquid water is denser than ice. To explain this anomalous behaviour, several theories have been proposed, with different predictions for the properties of supercooled water (liquid at conditions where ice is more stable). However, discriminating between those theories with experiments has remained elusive because of <b>spontaneous</b> ice <b>nucleation.</b> Here we measure the sound velocity in liquid water stretched to negative pressure, and derive an experimental equation of state, which reveals compressibility anomalies. We show by rigorous thermodynamic relations how these anomalies are intricately linked with the density anomaly. Some features we observe are necessary conditions for the validity of two theories of water. Comment: 17 pages, 3 figures, 24 reference...|$|R
50|$|Flux {{method is}} a method of crystal growth where the {{components}} of the desired substance are dissolved in a solvent (flux). The method is particularly suitable for crystals needing to be free from thermal strain. It takes place in a crucible made of highly stable, non-reactive material. For production of oxide crystals, metals such as platinum, tantalum, and niobium are common. Production of metallic crystals generally uses crucibles made from ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and boron nitride. The crucibles and their contents are often isolated from the air for reaction, either by sealing them in a quartz ampoule or by using a furnace with atmosphere control. A saturated solution is prepared by keeping the constituents of the desired crystal and the flux at a temperature slightly above the saturation temperature long enough to form a complete solution. Then the crucible is cooled in order to allow the desired material to precipitate. Crystal formation can begin by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> or may be encouraged by the use of a seed. As material precipitates out of the solution, the amount of solute in the flux decreases and the temperature at which the solution is saturated lowers. This process repeats itself as the furnace continues to cool until the solution reaches its melting point or the reaction is stopped artificially.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} eighties, Rosakis {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "laboratory earthquakes" [...] and since then his research interests have mainly focused on the mechanics of seismology, the physics of dynamic shear rupture and frictional sliding and on laboratory seismology. The goal of this body of work is to create, in a controlled and repeatable environment, surrogate laboratory earthquake scenarios mimicking various dynamic shear rupture process occurring in natural earthquake events. Such, highly instrumented, experiments are used to observe new physical phenomena and to also create benchmark comparisons with existing analysis and field observations. The experiments use high-speed photography, full-field photoelasticity, and laser velocimetry as diagnostics. The fault systems are simulated using two photoelastic plates held together in frictional contact. The far field tectonic loading is simulated by pre-compression while the triggering of dynamic rupture (<b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation)</b> is achieved by suddenly dropping the normal stress in a small region along the interface. The frictional interface (fault) forms various angles with the compression axis to provide the shear driving force necessary for continued rupturing. Rosakis and his co-workers, investigate the characteristics of rupture, such as rupture speed, rupture mode, associated ground motion under various conditions such as tectonic load, interface complexity and roughness. Both homogeneous and bimaterial interfaces (abutted by various elastic and damaged media) are investigated. Rosakis and his coworkers have been credited with the experimental discovery of the [...] "intersonic" [...] or [...] "supershear rupture" [...] phenomenon. They also have investigated this new phenomenon in various engineering and geophysical settings involving shear dominated rupture {{in the presence of}} weak interfaces or faults. Their experimental discoveries of supershear rupture has refocused the attention of the geophysics community to the study of supershear earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|The {{condensation}} {{process in}} a steam turbine is in reality an essentially unsteady phenomenon. There are differences between steady and time-accurate calculations introduced by the large-scale temperature fluctuations which are caused by the segmentation of blade wakes by successive blade rows. Consequently, {{it is important to}} consider the additional losses caused by condensation in unsteady simulations. In this work a time-accurate Eulerian-Lagrangian two-phase model is presented. The algorithm is applied to the compressible Navier-Stokes solver TRACE to predict the influence of <b>spontaneous</b> homogeneous <b>nucleation</b> using source terms for heat, mass and momentum transfer between the phases. In simulations presented in this work the capability of the two-phase model is demonstrated through comparisons with one and two dimensional experiments of nozzles and a cascade blade from literature.

40|$|Nonequilibrium {{condensate}} {{systems such}} as exciton-polariton condensates are capable of supporting a <b>spontaneous</b> vortex <b>nucleation.</b> The spatial inhomogeneity of pumping field or/and disordered potential creates velocity flow fields that may become unstable to vortex formation. This letter considers ways in which turbulent states of interacting vortices can be created. It is shown that by combining just two pumping intensities {{it is possible to}} create a superfluid turbulence state of well-separated vortices, a strong turbulence state of de-structured vortices, or a weak turbulence state in which all coherence of the field is lost and motion is driven by weakly interacting dispersive waves. The decay of turbulence can be obtained by replacing an inhomogeneous pumping by a uniform one. We show that both in quasi-equilibrium and during the turbulence decay there exists an inertial range dominated by four-wave interactions of acoustic waves. Comment: 4. 3 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nucleation {{processes}} {{are at the}} heart of a large number of phenomena, from cloud formation to protein crystallization. A recently emerging area where nucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein self-assembly, a process that has broad implications from medicine to nanotechnology. As such, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> of protein fibrils has received much attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies focussing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step forward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous protein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an overview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> of protein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the cluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the reaction order of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation,</b> are directly related to the physical size of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case of filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the nucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process. Using computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the nucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate to the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the portion of the aggregate that actively participates in the conformational conversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of the common kinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction order of the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into perspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} there exists an {{exponentially}} large discretuum of vacua in $G_ 2 $-compactifications of M-theory without flux. In M-theory-inspired $G_ 2 $-MSSM, quantities relevant for particle physics remain virtually insensitive to large variations of the vacuum energy across the landscape. The purely non-perturbative vacua form a special subset of a more general class of vacua containing fractional Chern-Simons contributions. The cosmological constant can be dynamically neutralized via a chain of transitions interpolated by fractional gauge instantons describing <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> of M 2 -brane domain walls.

40|$|We {{describe}} and demonstrate a general strategy for engineering binary and ternary hybrid nanoparticles based on <b>spontaneous</b> epitaxial <b>nucleation</b> {{and growth of}} a second and third component onto seed nanoparticles in high-temperature organic solutions. Multifunctional hybrid nanoparticles that combine magnetic, plasmonic, and semiconducting properties and that are tunable in size and morphology can be realized, as demonstrated for combinations of Au, Fe 3 O 4, and PbS or PbSe. The properties of each component within the hybrids can be modulated strongly by the conjugating component(s) aided by the coherent interfaces between them. An important research direction in nanomaterials synthesis is the expansion from single-component nanoparticles to hybrid nanostructures with discrete domains of different materials arranged in a controlled fashion.

40|$|A new {{material}} {{model for the}} dynamic fracture analysis of anisotropic materials has been proposed {{within the framework of}} the bond-based peridynamic theory. This model enables predicting complex fracture phenomena such as <b>spontaneous</b> crack <b>nucleation</b> and crack branching, curving and arrest, a capability inherited from the bond-based peridynamic theory. An important feature of the model is that the bond properties, i. e. the stiffness constant and critical stretch, are continuous functions of bond orientation in the principal material axes. This facilitates fracture analysis of anisotropic materials with random orientations, such as polycrystalline microstructures. Elastic and fracture behaviour of the model has been verified through simulating uniaxial tension of a composite plate and fracture of a cortical bone compact tension specimen, and making quantitative comparisons to analytical and experimental data. To further demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model, dynamic fracture of a polycrystalline microstructure (alumina ceramic) has been simulated. The influence of the grain boundary and grain interior fracture energies on the interacting and competing fracture modes of polycrystalline materials, i. e. intergranular and transgranular fracture, has been studied...|$|R
40|$|We present lattice Boltzmann {{simulations}} {{to study}} the hydrodynamics of active fluids with spatially inhomogeneous activity. By patterning the system {{so that there are}} stripes of active fluids intercalated by passive regions, we show {{that it is possible to}} control the shape of the resulting spontaneous flow. Even with one single active stripe, the phenomenology is significantly richer than for uniform systems, and we observe a transition between a shear-like and a Poiseuille like spontaneous flow, corresponding to a switch between apparently free and no slip hydrodynamic boundaries on the edge of the active stripe. With a 2 -dimensional patterning, in which activity is confined to spherical patches, we find that extensile gels tend to form rotating vortices which can synchronise, whereas contractile ones show a more complicated behaviour with <b>spontaneous</b> defect <b>nucleation.</b> We discuss possible experimental realisations of the system and geometries we are interested in, via, for instance, cytoskeletal fibers interacting with micropatterned surfaces with immobilised molecular motors, or via microfluidic devices containing bacterial colonies or suspensions...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} observations it is :known {{that various}} biological cells exhibit a persistent random walk during migration on flat substrates. The persistent random walk {{is characterized by}} 'stop-and-go' movements: unidirectional motions over distances {{of the order of}} several cell diameter are separated by localized short time erratic movements: Using computer simulations the reasons for this phenomena had been unveiled and shown to be attributed to two antagonistic nucleation processes during the polymerization of the cell's actin cytoskeleton: the (ordinary) <b>spontaneous</b> <b>nucleation</b> and the dendritic nucleation processes. Whereas spontaneous nucleations generate actin filaments growing in different directions and hence create motions in random directions, dendritic nucleations provide a unidirectional growth.

50|$|Although {{the process}} of {{subduction}} as it occurs today is fairly well understood, its origin remains a matter of discussion and continuing study. Subduction initiation can occur spontaneously if denser oceanic lithosphere is able to founder and sink beneath adjacent oceanic or continental lithosphere; alternatively, existing plate motions can induce new subduction zones by forcing oceanic lithosphere to rupture and sink into the asthenosphere. Both models can eventually yield self-sustaining subduction zones, as oceanic crust is metamorphosed at great depth and becomes denser than the surrounding mantle rocks. Results from numerical models generally favor induced subduction initiation for most modern subduction zones, which is supported by geologic studies, but other analogue modeling shows the possibility of spontaneous subduction from inherent density differences between two plates at passive margins, and observations from the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system are compatible with <b>spontaneous</b> subduction <b>nucleation.</b> Furthermore, subduction {{is likely to have}} spontaneously initiated at some point in Earth's history, as induced subduction nucleation requires existing plate motions, though an unorthodox proposal by A.
