40|$|Motivation: The 3 D {{structure}} of protein sequence A can be assembled by the substructures corresponding to small segments of A. A <b>sequence</b> <b>segment</b> {{does not take}} on all the structural fragments and thus it is desirable to build a short customized structural candidate list for each <b>sequence</b> <b>segment.</b> For each <b>sequence</b> <b>segment,</b> these substructures are its “specific structural alphabet”. The smaller these candidate lists are, the faster the protein structure can be constructed; the more accurate these candidate lists are, the more accurate the final protein structure will be. A major obstacle in protein structure prediction is to construct a small set of structural candidates for each segment such that the native structure can be rebuilt from these structural candidates accurately.

40|$|Local protein {{structure}} prediction efforts have consistently failed to exceed approximately 70 % accuracy. We characterize the degeneracy of the mapping from local sequence to local structure {{responsible for this}} failure by investigating {{the extent to which}} similar <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> found in different proteins adopt similar three-dimensional structures. <b>Sequence</b> <b>segments</b> 3 - 15 residues in length from 154 different protein families are partitioned into neighborhoods containing <b>segments</b> with similar <b>sequences</b> using cluster analysis. The consistency of the sequence-to-structure mapping is assessed by comparing the local structures adopted by <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> in the same neighborhood in proteins of known structure. In the 154 families, 45 % and 28 % of the positions occur in neighborhoods in which one and two local structures predominate, respectively. The sequence patterns that characterize the neighborhoods in the first class probably include virtually all of the short sequence motifs in proteins that consistently occur in a particular local structure. These patterns, many of which occur in transitions between secondary structural elements, are an interesting combination of previously studied and novel motifs. The identification of sequence patterns that consistently occur in one or a small number of local structures in proteins should contribute to the prediction of {{protein structure}} from sequence...|$|R

In addition to this, five more mcy genes (mcyBCDEG) were also amplified during this study. The resultant mcyA PCR products (518 bp) were purified and sequenced and gave nucleotide <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> of 408 bp sizes.

Simple, quantitative criteria are desirable for identifying transmembrane helices (TMs) that must be included into or should be excluded from start <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> in similarity searches aimed at finding distant homologues. Results We found that {{there are two types of}} TMs in membrane-associated proteins. On the one hand, there are so-called simple TMs with elevated hydrophobicity, low sequence complexity and extraordinary enrichment in long aliphatic residues. They merely serve as membrane-anchoring device. In contrast, so-called complex TMs have lower hydrophobicity, higher sequence complexity and some functional residues. These TMs have additional roles besides membrane anchoring such as intra-membrane complex formation, ligand binding or a catalytic role. Simple and complex TMs can occur both in single- and multi-membrane-spanning proteins essentially in any type of topology. Whereas simple TMs have the potential to confuse searches for sequence homologues and to generate unrelated hits with seemingly convincing statistical significance, complex TMs contain essential evolutionary information. Conclusion For extending the homology concept onto membrane proteins, we provide a necessary quantitative criterion to distinguish simple TMs (and a sufficient criterion for complex TMs) in query sequences prior to their usage in homology searches based on assessment of hydrophobicity and sequence complexity of the TM <b>sequence</b> <b>segments.</b> Reviewers This article was reviewed by Shamil Sunyaev, L.

40|$|Motivation: A {{large body}} of {{experimental}} and theoretical evidence suggests that local structural determinants are frequently encoded in short <b>segments</b> of protein <b>sequence.</b> Although the local structural information, once recognized, is particularly useful in protein structural and functional analyses, it remains a difficult problem to identify embed-ded local structural codes based solely on sequence infor-mation. Results: In this paper, we describe a local structure prediction method aiming at predicting the backbone structures of nine-residue <b>sequence</b> <b>segments.</b> Two elements are the keys for this local structure prediction procedure. The first key element is the LSBSP 1 database, which contains {{a large number of}} non-redundant local structure-based sequence profiles for nine-residue struc-ture segments. The second key element is the consensus approach, which identifies a consensus structure from a set of hit structures. The local structure prediction proce-dure starts by matching a query <b>sequence</b> <b>segment</b> of nine consecutive amino acid residues to all the sequence profiles in the local structure-based sequence profile database (LSBSP 1). The consensus structure, which {{is at the center of}} the largest structural cluster of the hit structures, is predicted to be the native state structure adopted by the query <b>sequence</b> <b>segment.</b> This local structure prediction method is assessed with a large set of random test protein structures that have not been used in constructing the LSBSP 1 database. The benchmark results indicate that the prediction capacities of the novel local structure prediction procedure exceed the prediction capacities of the local backbone structure prediction methods based on the I-sites library by a significant margin.

40|$|Through sequence-based classification, {{this paper}} tries to {{accurately}} predict the DNA binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) in an unannotated cellular context. Related methods {{in the literature}} fail to perform such predictions accurately, since they do not consider sample distribution shift of <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> from an annotated (source) context to an unannotated (target) context. We, therefore, propose a method called "Transfer String Kernel" (TSK) that achieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using knowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatch string kernel framework. In this high-dimensional space, labeled examples of the source context are re-weighted so that the revised sample distribution matches the target context more closely. We have experimentally verified TSK for TFBS identifications on fourteen different TFs under a cross-organism setting.

The query protein sequence is dissected into overlapping short <b>sequence</b> <b>segments.</b> Ten different physicochemical features describe each amino acid; therefore nine residues long segment is represented as a point in a 90 dimensional space. The database of <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> with confirmed by experiments post-translational modification sites are used for training a set of ANNs. Results: The efficiency of the classification {{for each type of}} modification and the prediction power of the method is estimated here using recall (sensitivity), precision values, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and leave-one-out tests (LOOCV).

Technology for monitoring rRNA is well established but has not generally been applicable to GEMs {{because of the lack}} of unique rRNA target sequences. In the work described herein, it is demonstrated that a deletion mutant of a plasmid-borne Vibrio proteolyticus 5 S rRNA gene continues to accumulate to high levels in Escherichia coli although it is no longer incorporated into 70 S ribosomes. This deletion construct was subsequently modified by mutagenesis to create a unique recognition site for the restriction endonuclease BstEII, into which new sequences could be readily inserted. Finally, a novel 17 -nucleotide identifier sequence from Pennisetum purpureum was embedded into the construct to create an RNA identification cassette. The artificial identifier RNA, expressed from this cassette in vivo, accumulated in E. coli to levels comparable to those of wild-type 5 S rRNA without being seriously detrimental to cell survival in laboratory experiments and without entering the ribosomes.

We identified <b>sequence</b> <b>segments</b> of the human gamma subunit forming epitopes recognized by four embryonic AChR-specific CD 4 + T cell lines, propagated from MG patients' blood by stimulation with synthetic peptides corresponding to the human gamma subunit sequence.

Most T epitope sequences were highly diverged between the gamma and the other AChR subunits, confirming the specificity of the T cells for embryonic AChR.
