40|$|Abstract: Efficient {{and secure}} {{communication}} architecture for e-health system is proposed {{in this paper}} to support online treatment of patients by medical specialists working in any hospital registered to RA (registration authority). The proposed architecture comprises three actors and two use cases, where the actors like patients and hospitals register themselves to RA and doctors registers themselves at different hospitals through the registration use case, and all registered patients get their treatment through the patients ’ treatment use case. In our proposed treatment procedure, initially a patient communicates RA for registration and receives a unique master secret. Later on, this master secret is used to negotiate a session key between the RA, patient and registered hospital and finally the session key in turn is used to negotiate a user token for treatment. A service user token is also generated by the hospital according to the disease syndromes and after which a <b>selected</b> <b>doctor</b> starts the treatment. After completion of treatment, the doctor generates the patient’s PHI (protected health information) data and uploads the same to RA. A digital public-key certificate based authentication protocol for registration phase and symmetric encryption/decryption based protocols have been proposed for secure communication of the proposed e-health system. The in-depth security and performance analysis of the proposed communication architecture shows {{that the system is}} efficient and well secured...|$|E

40|$|Abstract There is {{a crisis}} in primary care health {{workforce}} shortages in Australia. Its government has attempted to fix this by role-substitution (replacing medical work with nursing instead). This was not completely successful. Obstacles included entrenched social roles (leading to doctors 'checking' their nurse role-substituted work) and structures (nurses subservient to doctors) - both exacerbated by primary care doctors' ageing demographic; doctors owning their own practices; doctors feeling themselves to have primary responsibility for the care delivered; and greater attraction towards independence that may have <b>selected</b> <b>doctors</b> into primary care in the first place. Yet {{there is much to}} be optimistic about this social experiment. It was conducted, if not ideally, at least in an environment that the Australian government has enriched with capacity for research and evaluation. </p...|$|R

Valerie can prevent a patient from dying by using the Healing Touch. When she uses this technique, the patient's vitals will temporarily stabilize. The player can continue the procedure without having to worry about the patient's vitals dropping. However, the player cannot improve the patient's vitals during this time.|$|R

40|$|Using novel methods, {{this paper}} explores sources of {{uncertainty}} and gender bias {{in primary care}} doctors' diagnostic decision-making about coronary heart disease (CHD). Claims about gendered consultation styles and quality of care are re-examined, along with the adequacy of CHD models for women. Randomly <b>selected</b> <b>doctors</b> in the UK and the US (n= 112, 56 per country, stratified by gender) were shown standardised videotaped vignettes of actors portraying patients with CHD. Patients' age, gender, ethnicity and social class were varied systematically. During interviews, doctors gave free-recall accounts of their decision-making, which were analysed to determine patient and doctor gender effects. We found differences in male and female doctors' responses to different types of patient information. Female doctors recall more patient cues overall, particularly about history presentation, and particularly amongst women. Male doctors appear less affected by patient gender but both male and especially female doctors take more account of male patients' age, and consider more age-related disease possibilities for men than women. Findings highlight the need for better integration of knowledge about female presentations within accepted CHD risk models, and {{do not support the}} contention that women receive better-quality care from female doctors...|$|R
40|$|Three {{independent}} {{methods of}} study of prescription errors {{led to the}} development of a classification of errors based on the potential effects and inconvenience to patients, pharmacists and doctors. Four types of error are described: type A (potentially serious to patient); type B (major nuisance - pharmacist/doctor contact required); type C (minor nuisance - pharmacist must use professional judgement); and type D (trivial). The types of frequency of errors are detailed for a group of eight principals from one health centre. There were a total of 504 errors from 15, 916 prescription items (3. 17 %) during a three month observation period. A close correspondence was found between individual doctor's types of error rates, suggesting that doctors who make type C and D errors are also likely to make type B (major nuisance) errors. A system of feedback of errors from each doctor was devised. No significant reduction was seen in error rates, possibly because the group of self <b>selected</b> <b>doctors</b> taking part had low error rates initially. It is suggested that pharmacists and doctors should work closely together to prevent the potentially harmful consequences of prescription errors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} UK and US {{primary care}} doctors' decision-making about older (aged 75 years) and midlife (aged 55 years) patients presenting with {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD). Using an analytic approach based on conceptualising clinical decision-making as a classification process, it explores {{the ways in which}} doctors' cognitive processes contribute to ageism in health-care at three key decision points during consultations. In each country, 56 randomly <b>selected</b> <b>doctors</b> were shown videotaped vignettes of actors portraying patients with CHD. The patients' ages (55 or 75 years), gender, ethnicity and social class were varied systematically. During the interviews, doctors gave free-recall accounts of their decision-making. The results do not establish that there was substantial ageism in the doctors' decisions, but rather suggest that diagnostic processes pay insufficient attention to the significance of older patients' age and its association with the likelihood of co-morbidity and atypical disease presentations. The doctors also demonstrated more limited use of ‘knowledge structures’ when diagnosing older than midlife patients. With respect to interventions, differences in the national health-care systems rather than patients' age accounted for the differences in doctors' decisions. US doctors were significantly more concerned about the potential for adverse outcomes if important diagnoses were untreated, while UK general practitioners cited greater difficulty in accessing diagnostic tests...|$|R
