40|$|To {{quantify}} springs discharge over a 1 km {{reach in}} the Ngongotaha Stream, Rotorua, New Zealand, {{a new approach}} was developed in this study in which a one dimensional transient heat transport model was fitted to fibre optic distributed temperature sensing measurements where the main calibration parameters of interest were the unknown spring discharges. The heat transport model requires {{a large number of}} input parameters that affect the accuracy of the temperature simulation and ultimately quantification of groundwater discharge. To understand the model input-output relationship, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) techniques including the Morris method (Morris, 1991) using PEST++ software (Welter et al., 2015) was investigated. For comparison, a linear sensitivity analysis method (Doherty, 2015), was used to quickly explore alternative model representations. To measure stream temperature, the fibre optic cable was deployed at the streambed near the left and right banks as the groundwater fed springs discharge laterally at both banks. Thirteen springs were identified in the study reach. The left and right bank temperature profiles showed that full mixing of the spring and stream water does not occur between most of the springs due to their close spacing. Datasets of measured temperatures at the left and right bank were transformed to a new single dataset using a weighted average where the weights reflect the degree of mixing downstream of a spring. The primary objective function for the sensitivity analysis was to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the stream temperature model predictions and the weighted average of the left and right bank temperature. Streamflow gauging upstream and downstream of the study reach showed that the stream gains 500 L/s from groundwater which was used as the second objective function. The most sensitive parameters using the method of Morris were the <b>shadow</b> <b>factor,</b> discharge of springs no. 5, 4 and 1 and the view to sky coefficient. The most sensitive parameters using the composite parameter sensitivity method were the temperature of springs no. 13, 12 and 3, discharge of springs no. 13, solar radiation and <b>shadow</b> <b>factor.</b> The results showed that the two methods provided different parameter importance rankings. The standard deviation of elementary effects in the method of Morris identifies the extent of interaction between parameters and non-linear effect of each parameter (Saltelli et al., 2004). Two parameters with high standard deviation of the elementary effects were view to sky coefficient and <b>shadow</b> <b>factor.</b> It is believed that the method of Morris results for these two parameters are more reliable than the composite method as this method {{does not take into account}} the interaction between parameters and non-linearity...|$|E

40|$|Various {{implications}} of new, non-perturbative pomeron inspired enhancement of small-x neutrino-nucleon structure functions for high-energy neutrino astrophysics are discussed. At x larger than 10 ^{- 5 } these functions are given by perturbative QCD, while at lower x {{they are determined}} by a specific generalization of F_ 2 ^{ep}(x,Q^ 2) description, proposed by A. Donnachie and P. V. Landshoff (their two-component model comprises hard and soft pomerons), to neutrino-nucleon scattering case. We found that i) such enhancement causes the most rapid growth of neutrino-nucleon cross-sections at high energies, ii) pomeron effects may be perceptible in the rates of neutrino induced events in future giant detectors and iii) the rate of high-energy neutrino flux evolution (due to absorption (CC+NC) and regeneration (NC)) on its pass through a large column depth of matter may be subjected to additional influence of hard pomeron.

O objetivo desta dissertação é desenvolver células solares n+pn+ em lâminas de Si-Cz do tipo p, grau solar, com metalização por serigrafia e avaliar a influência do emissor n+ e das pastas de prata PV 159 e PV 16 A. Parâmetros como tempo, temperatura da difusão de fósforo, recozimento, processo de queima das pastas metálicas e espessura do filme antirreflexo foram otimizados experimentalmente. Também foi avaliada a influência do fator de sombra relativo à malha metálica, da concentração de POCl 3 durante a difusão de fósforo. Para a metalização com a pasta PV 159, concluiu-se que a temperatura de difusão (TD) de 875 °C e resistência de folha (R□) de 59 Ω/□ resultam na melhor eficiência de 13, 7 %. Com o aumento da TD para 900 °C verificou-se que todos os parâmetros elétricos tendem a diminuir com o aumento da R□, e a melhor eficiência obtida foi de 13, 4 %. Verificou-se que o recozimento após a difusão de fósforo praticamente não afeta a eficiência das células solares, porém, aumenta levemente a profundidade da junção. A velocidade de esteira e a temperatura de queima para a pasta PV 159 que resultaram em maior eficiência e maior fator de forma (FF) foram, 240 cm/min e 840 °C, respectivamente. Comprovou-se que a diminuição do fator de sombra de 9, 4 % para 8, 2 %, aumentou a JSC sem reduzir o FF. Com a pasta PV 16 A, a TD de 875 °C resultou na eficiência de 13, 7 %, devido ao elevado FF. No entanto, com a redução da TD para 850 °C, o FF sofre redução, devido ao aumento da R□. Com a introdução da etapa de recozimento, a JSC diminuiu, porém o FF aumentou, elevando a eficiência de 10, 8 % para 13, 2 %. A concentração de POCl 3 de 0, 1 % sem redução da vazão de O 2 e N 2 resultou na melhor eficiência para células com a pasta PV 16 A, de 13, 9 %. Juntamente com o aumento do FF, a R□ diminuiu, limitando a JSC. A redução do fluxo dos gases levou a valores menores de JSC, devido ao aumento da espessura da “zona morta”. Para ambas as pastas, o FF reduziu-se com o aumento da R□. The {{main goal}} of the solar cell industry is to obtain high efficiency and low production cost. One line of action {{is to increase the}} efficiency of industrial solar cell. The goal of this dissertation is to develop n+pn+ solar cells in p-type Si-Cz wafer, solar grade, with metallization by screen printing and to evaluate the influence of the n+ emitter and PV 159 and PV 16 A silver pastes on cell efficiency. Parameters such as time, temperature of phosphorus diffusion, annealing, metal paste firing and antireflection coating thickness were optimized experimentally. We also evaluated the influence of the <b>shadow</b> <b>factor</b> metal grid, and the POCl 3 concentration during P diffusion. For the metallization with the PV 159 paste, it was concluded that the diffusion temperature (TD) of 875 °C and sheet resistance (R□) de 59 Ω/□ results in better efficiency of 13. 7 %. With the increase in TD to 900 °C it was found that all electrical parameters tend to decrease with increasing of R□ and the better efficiency obtained was 13. 4 %. It was verified that the annealing after the phosphorus diffusion hardly affects the efficiency of solar cells, however, slightly increases the junction depth. The belt speed and the temperature of the PV 159 paste firing process resulting in higher efficiency and fill factor (FF) were 240 cm/min and 840 °C, respectively. It was shown that the reduction of the <b>shadow</b> <b>factor</b> from 9. 4 % to 8. 2 %, increased the JSC without decreasing the FF. With the PV 16 A paste, the TD of 875 °C results in efficiency of 13. 7 %, due to the elevated FF. However, with the reduction of TD to 850 °C, the FF is reduced due to the increase of R□. With the introduction of annealing step, the JSC decreased, but the FF increased, raising the efficiency from 10. 8 % to 13. 2 %. The use of POCl 3 concentration of 0. 1 % without reducing O 2 and N 2 flows resulted in better efficiency for cells with PV 16 A paste, achieving 13. 9 %. Jointly with the increase of FF, the R□ decreased, limiting the JSC. The reduction of the gas flows led to lower values of JSC, due to the increase of "dead zone" thickness.

Previously proposed sampling schemes for popular analytic BSDFs typically begin by choosing a microfacet normal at random {{in a way that is}} independent of direction of incident light. To sample the full BSDF using these normals requires arbitrarily large sample weights leading to possible fireflies. Additionally, at grazing angles nearly half of the sampled normals face away from the incident ray and must be rejected, making the sampling scheme inefficient. Instead, we show how to use the distribution of visible normals directly to generate samples, where normals are weighted by their projection factor toward the incident direction. In this way, no backfacing normals are sampled and the sample weights contain only the <b>shadowing</b> <b>factor</b> of outgoing rays (and additionally a Fresnel term for conductors). Arbitrarily large sample weights are avoided and variance is reduced. Since the BSDF depends on the microsurface model, we describe our sampling algorithm for two models: the V-cavity and the Smith models. We demonstrate results for both isotropic and anisotropic rough conductors and dielectrics with Beckmann and GGX distributions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An ad hoc {{network with}} a finite spatial extent {{and number of}} nodes or mobiles is analyzed. The mobile {{locations}} may be drawn from any spatial distribution, and interferenceavoidance protocols or protection against physical collisions among the mobiles may be modeled by placing an exclusion zone around each radio. The channel model accounts for the path loss, Nakagami fading, and shadowing of each received signal. The Nakagami m-parameter can vary among the mobiles, taking any positive value {{for each of the}} interference signals and any positive integer value for the desired signal. The analysis is governed by a new exact expression for the outage probability, defined to be the probability that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) drops below a threshold, and is conditioned on the network geometry and <b>shadowing</b> <b>factors,</b> which have dynamics over much slower timescales than the fading. By averaging over many network and shadowing realizations, the average outage probability and transmission capacity are computed. Using the analysis, many aspects of the network performance are illuminated. For example, one can determine the influence of the choice of spreading factors, the effect of the receiver location within the finite network region, and the impact of both the fading parameters and the attenuation power laws. Index Terms—Ad hoc networks, transmission capacity, Nakagami fading, spread spectrum...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} the result of an {{empirical}} research, a study that includes a theoretical framework. The data used to test our hypotheses come from 60 small tourism firms from Bihor County, Romania. The research conducted has revealed that actions focusing on innovation must be based on a solid analysis, supported by the knowledge and the understanding of the contextual factors (environment, culture as a mental programming, values) also based on the organizational factors (the management commitment, systemic perspective, learning and practice of experimentation, rapid transfer of knowledge within the organization). For the purpose of this work, the contextual factors that are exogenous represent the <b>shadow</b> <b>factors.</b> The studies performed in three European projects implemented in tourism SMEs of Bihor County have allowed us to advance the idea that contextual and organizational factors, that are identified as the source of innovation are based on rationality, which is enlarged by affectivity and imagination. The identified correlations may be considered, in our opinion an element of novelty and originality. Finally, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to provide a possible model, based on the idea of building an innovative firm, the one that has learned how to determine their own employees to be innovative.
