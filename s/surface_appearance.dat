5|$|The unusual <b>surface</b> <b>appearance</b> of the {{cerebellum}} conceals {{the fact}} that most of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the cerebellar cortex. Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human cerebellar cortex were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story was}} born from wanting to expand upon the {{original}} game's {{theme of the}} growing rift between mankind and the gods. The Greek Underworld was the one major mythical location that the developers of Titan Quest had not yet approached. As it offered {{a rich source of}} material for their creative staff, it was made the location for the expansion. The story concept the team began with was the possibility of a secondary hostile force besides the Titans that had only kept away from humans due to the presence of the Olympians, and now rose up as they retreated from human affairs. With the quests, the team worked to improve on the structure and impact they had in the original, introducing famous places and people from history and mythology. They also expanded the variety of side quests, and included elements such as legends and customs related to the dead. The script was written by Dean O'Donnell. While an experienced playwright, he encountered new challenges in writing for the video game medium, as he needed to always assume that the player had spoken first to a selected NPC and to contain the necessary information in the first line of dialogue with embellishment in additional lines. Aesthetically, the tone of Immortal Throne was darker than that of its predecessor, with one of the main elements of this change being the cover art: according to designer Arthur Bruno, this was in reaction to the unfavorable impression players received from the <b>surface</b> <b>appearance</b> of Titan Quest when compared to the darker take on Grecian mythology in the God of War series.|$|E

The glowing colours also help to highlight the realism, and to show the material wealth and opulence of Arnolfini's world.

The medium of oil paint also permitted van Eyck to capture <b>surface</b> <b>appearance</b> and distinguish textures precisely. He also rendered the effects of both direct and diffuse light by showing the light from the window on the left reflected by various surfaces. It has been suggested that he used a magnifying glass in order to paint the minute details such as the individual highlights on each of the amber beads hanging beside the mirror.|$|E

40|$|Selective laser melting {{is gaining}} {{importance}} to manufacture reliable and highly complex parts. However, {{the surfaces of}} the selective laser melted parts exhibit for many applications an insufficient high roughness, thus require subsequent post processing steps. A relatively new {{way to reduce the}} surface roughness is the laser polishing technique. In the present paper, additively manufactured AlSi 10 Mg samples were polished with different laser intensities and laser modes. The investigations contain the potential of roughness reduction and enhancement of the <b>surface</b> <b>appearances,</b> which can be achieved by laser polishing of the as-built surfaces. An initial arithmetic mean roughness of 8. 43 μm was remarkably reduced up to 98 %. The compositions of the polished surfaces were detected and the <b>surface</b> <b>appearances</b> were examined. Reasons and mechanisms were explained and depicted for the occurred shade formations on the polished surfaces. High laser intensity led to segregation of silicon and magnesium on the surface. A higher laser intensity enabled an increased melt depth within the conture layer of the selective laser melting structure. Through increasing melt depth, a porosity of max. 1. 7 % was detected in the remolten area. Hardness investigations of the initial and laser remolten cross section revealed no significant reduction in hardness. No Full Tex...|$|R

Leaving out the flocculonodular lobe, which has distinct connections and functions, the cerebellum can be parsed functionally into a medial sector called the spinocerebellum and a larger lateral sector called the cerebrocerebellum.

40|$|A {{comparison}} based tile classification {{technique has}} been developed and applied computationally in order to compile a mosaic, which constituting tiles emplaced as to form a particular figure. The mosaics are generated using the surficial shapes of the tiles. Unlike the conventional mosaic tiling process, geometric properties of the tiles {{do not have any}} role for the proposed methodology. Therefore, square breccia rock tiles, having variable <b>surface</b> <b>appearances,</b> have been used by processing with the developed algorithm and lined up as to form targeted sample images. The technique showed satisfactory results even with a limited number of tiles in the database. The compilation of the mosaic with the proposed methodology is a very fast and cheap process, which makes it ideal to follow the different requirements of the individual customers and eliminates skilled workforce in the production. Since the mosaic contains different ratios of breccia tiles, having variable <b>surface</b> <b>appearances,</b> the gap between the market prices of the tile groups has been eliminated and an extra value to the final product has been added by attributing an artistic value. The technique offers practically no size limitation for a mosaic, which makes it suitable for large coverings such as ones in museums, lobbies and even for open spaces.

2500|$|There are, however, also Marxists {{who think}} that value-theory is still a useful [...] "add-on" [...] to {{ordinary}} post-Keynesian price theory, because value-theory penetrates through the [...] "appearances" [...] of commodity fetishism to the [...] "essence" [...] of exploitation. According to this interpretation, price-relationships express the observable <b>surface</b> <b>appearance</b> {{of what happens in}} the economy, while value relationships express the unobservable essence of what happens. But there is no necessary connection between price-relationships and value-relationships, quantitative or otherwise, because the value theory models and the price theory models exist at qualitatively different levels of abstraction. It then follows quite logically, that value theory cannot offer any substantive explanation of price movements (including empirical profits), whether in theory or in reality and that price theory is a completely separate area of concern. The three main objections to this approach are (1) that it makes the theory of value an untestable, metaphysical theory, (2) that the observable/unobservable distinction being drawn is false, since some prices are observable, while others are not (since they are inferred or derived magnitudes), and (3) that general talk about [...] "levels of abstraction" [...] is vacuous, unless the exact limits of application of the abstractions can be specified clearly.
