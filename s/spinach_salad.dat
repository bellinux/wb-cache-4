40|$|Zeaxanthin is a {{carotenoid}} {{produced by}} plants {{and has been}} associated with protection of the photosynthetic machinery under light stress and, together with lutein, in protection of the central retina of the eye. Zeaxanthin levels in blood plasma have been negatively correlated to the development of AMD (age-related macular degeneration) (Gale et al, 2003). Under normal conditions, plants have a low content of zeaxanthin. The aim {{of this study was to}} increase the zeaxanthin content in green vegetables by post harvest treatments. Efficient conditions for activation of the endogenous enzyme system generating zeaxanthin was established and included incubation at low pH (2. 5 - 5. 5), with the membrane permeable acetic acid/acetate buffer at room temperature or above for 30 min or more. Typically more than 20 -fold increase in zeaxanthin content was obtained for <b>spinach,</b> corn <b>salad,</b> parsley, basil, lemon balm and peas. For spinach up to 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight of leaves were obtained. In consequence less amount of vegetables would be needed in the diet to provide the same amount of zeaxanthin for the eye.

Women (n = 12) each consumed 5 salads containing equivalent amounts of carrot, cherry tomato, romaine lettuce and <b>spinach.</b> The <b>salads</b> with salad dressings containing 0, 2, 4, 8 or 32 g tocopherol-stripped soybean oil were ingested in random order separated by ¡Ý 2 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 2, 3. 5, 5, 7, and 9. 5 h postprandially. Chylomicron fractions were extracted and analyzed by HPLC with coulometric array electrochemical detection. When the salads were ingested with 0 g oil, there was negligible absorption of ¦Á- and ¦Â-carotenes, lutein, lycopene, phylloquinone, retinyl palmitate, ¦Á- and ¦Ã-tocopherols. For ¦Á- and ¦Â-carotenes, lycopene, retinyl palmitate, and ¦Á- and ¦Ã-tocopherols, absorption was increased with each amount of oil compared with 0 g oil (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|AbstractGreen-leafy {{vegetables}} {{are rich in}} nutritionally important constituents including carotenoids. Their potential health benefits depend among others on their liberation from the plant matrix. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of particle size and heat treatments on lutein and β-carotene liberation from <b>spinach</b> and Asia <b>salads</b> by applying an in vitro digestion protocol and UHPLC analysis. Reduction of particle size resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in liberation of lutein and β-carotene when comparing whole leaf and puree preparations of spinach. However, this positive effect was shown to be nullified by the severe heat impact during stir-frying of minced spinach, showing that domestic treatments need to be chosen carefully to maximise carotenoid liberation. Steaming significantly improved lutein liberation from Asia salads, but had no or a negative effect in spinach samples, possibly due to differences in liberation or degradation between the two plant matrices...|$|R

50|$|Week 12(b) - The Biggest Loser Cook-Off - This {{challenge}} was {{set by the}} trainers (Shannon and Michelle) {{to see how much}} the contestants had learnt about healthy cooking. Each contestant had 45 minutes to prepare an entrée, a main and a dessert. Each course had to include {{at least one of the}} three base ingredients: blueberries, chicken and bok choy. Shannon and Michelle would be the judges, and judge each dish on presentation and taste. The winner of the challenge would win a $4500 Everdure barbecue. Sammy presented her courses first: grilled eggplant with mushroom, cottage cheese and bok choy for entrée; stir-fried snow peas, carrot, mushroom, onion, garlic and chilli with Worcestershire and soy sauces for the main course; and carb-smart ice cream with berries and vanilla essence for dessert. Tiffany was next and presented: grilled capsicum and garlic bok choy tapas with cottage cheese for entrée; mustard chicken on a bed of lime and lemon greens for main course; and vanilla blueberries and yoghurt for dessert. Cameron then served his courses: cajun chicken and mushroom for entrée; stir-fried chicken with bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrots, capsicum, with worcestershire sauce for main course; and blueberries with yoghurt and light chocolate syrup for dessert. Sharif was the favourite to win the competition, being the best chef in the house. He first presented his entrée, baby <b>spinach</b> <b>salad</b> with cottage cheese and balsamic dressing (containing red, yellow and green capsicum, Spanish onion and cherry tomatoes), but unfortunately he forgot to put bok choy in the dish. He then presented the main course: wilted bok choy with stir-fried chicken, chilli, garlic and ginger plus a squeeze of lemon. His dessert was a punnet of blueberries with 100g of cottage cheese and a raspberry cooler on top. The judges awarded one point each to a contestant that they felt had the best dish within each course. Sammy got both points for the entrée. Tiffany got both points for the main course. For the dessert, Shannon gave a point to Tiffany and Michelle gave a point to Sharif. Therefore, Tiffany won the challenge and the barbecue with 3 points. Shannon and Michelle also awarded the Coach's Encouragement Award to Cameron because he has improved so much.|$|E

[...] With {{the prospect of the}} plague, as well as war with England looming, the English ambassador commented in May 1664: [...] "there are dead this last week to the number 338 at Amsterdam and if the plague thus increases within, and a warre with His Majestie without, there will be little need of that vast new towne which they are making there". [...] Rich people left the cities to avoid the disease, but in the worst week of the pandemic of 1664, in Amsterdam there were 1,041 burials compared with 7,000 in the late summer of 1665 in London, a city twice its size. [...] The mayors warned the population that eating <b>salad,</b> <b>spinach</b> or prunes could be unhealthy.

40|$|To acclimatize a {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} rhizobacterium (PGPR) to the ambient soil environment, the pyoverdin-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 7 NSK 2 and its pyoverdin-deficient mutant MPFM 1 were grown in soil from 0 to 4 {{weeks prior to}} sowing with or without adding easily-degradable sugars. Pot experiments with corn <b>salad,</b> <b>spinach</b> and maize revealed that the acclimatized strain 7 NSK 2 showed a more pronounced beneficial effect (from 13 to 32 %) on plant growth than the non-acclimatized strain (from 7 to 19 %).

40|$|We {{report a}} method for {{detecting}} Giardia duodenalis cysts on lettuce, which we subsequently use to examine salad products {{for the presence of}} Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts. The method is based on four basic steps: extraction of cysts from the foodstuffs, concentration of the extract and separation of the cysts from food materials, staining of the cysts to allow their visualization, and identification of cysts by microscopy. The concentration and separation steps are performed by centrifugation, followed by immunomagnetic separation using proprietary kits. Cyst staining is also performed using proprietary reagents. The method recovered 46. 0 % ± 19. 0 % (n = 30) of artificially contaminating cysts in 30 g of lettuce. We tested the method on a variety of commercially available natural foods, which we also seeded with a commercially available internal control, immediately prior to concentration of the extract. Recoveries of the Texas Red-stained Giardia cyst and Cryptosporidium oocyst internal controls were 36. 5 % ± 14. 3 % and 36. 2 % ± 19. 7 % (n = 20), respectively.

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} numbers of outbreaks caused by the consumption of vegetables contaminated with human pathogenic bacteria were reported. The application of organic fertilizers during vegetable production {{is one of the}} possible reasons for contamination with those pathogens. In this study laboratory experiments in axenic and soil systems following common practices in organic farming were conducted to identify the minimal dose needed for bacterial colonization of plants and to identify possible factors like bacterial species or serovariation, plant species or organic fertilizer types used, influencing the success of plant colonization by human pathogenic bacteria. <b>Spinach</b> and corn <b>salad</b> were chosen as model plants and were inoculated with different concentrations of Salmonella enterica sv. Weltevreden, Listeria monocytogenes sv. 4 b and EGD-E sv. 1 / 2 a either directly (axenic system) or via agricultural soil amended with spiked organic fertilizers (soil system). In addition to PCR- and culture-based detection methods, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied in order to localize bacteria on or in plant tissues. Our results demonstrate that shoots were colonized by the pathogenic bacteria at inoculation doses as low as 4 x 10 CFU/ml in the axenic system or 4 x 105 CFU/g in the soil system. In addition, plant species dependent effects were observed. Spinach was colonized more often and at lower inoculation doses compared to corn salad. Differential colonization sites on roots, depending on the plant species could be detected using FISH-CLSM analysis. Furthermore, the transfer of pathogenic bacteria to plants via organic fertilizers was observed more often and at lower initial inoculation doses when fertilization was performed with inoculated slurry compared to inoculated manure. Finally, it could be shown that by introducing a simple washing step, the bacterial contamination was reduced in most cases or even was removed completely in some cases...|$|R
