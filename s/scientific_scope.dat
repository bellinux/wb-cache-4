40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} extent and nature of {{existing}} Public Health Informatics (PHI) studies in the past 15 years on MEDLINE. Methods: This thesis adopted the <b>scientific</b> <b>scoping</b> review methodology recommended by Arksey and O’Malley in 2005. It proceeded with the five main stages, which were: Stage I - identifying the research question; Stage II - identifying relevant studies; Stage III - study selection; Stage IV - charting the data; and Stage V - collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Each methodological stage was carried out with the joint collaboration with the academic supervisor and a final result and conclusion were set forth. Results: The {{results of this study}} captured a total number of 486 articles in MEDLINE focused in PHI. Out of them, a majority belonged to the USA followed by the UK, Australia and Canada. Only about one fifth of the articles were {{from the rest of the}} world. Further, About 60 % of the articles represented infectious disease monitoring, outbreak detection, and bio-terrorism surveillance. Furthermore, about 10 % belonged to chronic disease monitoring; whereas public health policy system and research represented 40 % of the total articles. The most frequently used information technology were electronic registry, website, and GIS. In contrast, mass media and mobile phones were among the least used technologies. Conclusion: Despite multiple research and discussions conducted in the past 15 years (starting from 2000), the PHI system requires further improvements in the application of modern PHT such as wireless devices, wearable devices, remote sensors, remote/ cloud computing etc. on various domains of PH, which were scarcely discussed or used in the available literature...|$|R

Although the law is very complex, including a large number of issues, including general and special requirements on the units, care and housing of animals, animal species that can be used in procedures, there are a number of issues for which the law requires the development of a secondary legislation in areas such as: authorize breeders and users of laboratory animals, create a bank of organs and tissues of animal origin, able to reduce the number of animals used in experiments, authorization of projects, setting and punishing contraventions and others.

40|$|Background Aboveground, plants release {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) that act as chemical signals between neighbouring plants. It is now well documented that VOCs emitted by the roots in the plant rhizosphere also play important ecological roles in the soil ecosystem, notably in plant defence because {{they are involved in}} interactions between plants, phytophagous pests and organisms of the third trophic level. The roles played by root-emitted VOCs in between- and within-plant signalling, however, are still poorly documented in the <b>scientific</b> literature. <b>Scope</b> Given that (1) plants release volatile cues mediating plant-plant interactions aboveground, (2) roots can detect the chemical signals originating from their neighbours, and (3) roots release VOCs involved in biotic interactions belowground, the aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the roles of VOCs in between- and within-plant signalling belowground. We also highlight the technical challenges associated with the analysis of root-emitted VOCs and the design of experiments targeting volatile-mediated root-root interactions. Conclusions We conclude that root-root interactions mediated by volatile cues deserve more research attention and that both the analytical tools and methods developed to study the ecological roles played by VOCs in interplant signalling aboveground can be adapted to focus on the roles played by root-emitted VOCs in between- and within-plant signalling.

40|$|In {{this article}} I flesh out support for {{observations}} that scientific accounts of social groups {{can influence the}} very groups and mental phenomena under investigation.
