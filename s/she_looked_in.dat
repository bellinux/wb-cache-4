5|$|List {{five things}} the person would {{see if he}} or <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> a mirror.|$|E
2500|$|... "Something Big" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan, from {{a story by}} Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, Adam Muto, and Moynihan. [...] "Something Big" [...] marked {{the first of three}} episodes that Moynihan storyboarded and wrote entirely by himself. Art {{direction}} was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Andres Salaff. Steve Agee returns as the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant, and Keith Ferguson returns to the series to voice Colonel Candy Corn. Prolific voice actor Alan Oppenheimer voices both Darren and the Sun. Finally, actress Jill Talley reprises her role as Maja. The design for Maja was redrawn for the episode, because Moynihan was unhappy with how <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Sky Witch".|$|E
2500|$|Oilill died like {{a prince}} it was reported. [...] His head {{was cut off}} by a triumphant Fergus and was impaled on a lance and {{brought back to the}} fort at Rathmorgan to prove to Flidhais that she was now a free woman. [...] Fergus {{presented}} her husband's severed head as a courtship present to Flidhais. [...] However, Flidhais was overcome with guilt as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> Oilill's unblinking all-knowing eyes and she was horrified at {{what had happened to her}} husband. [...] She burst into tears and demanded his body be brought back to their fort. The troops retrieved Oilill's body and when Flidhais looked at his body, gashed all over and covered in blood, she was again filled with such remorse she began to recount his every worthy action during his lifetime. [...] Tradition maintains that Oilill is buried just north of Inver in a tumulus which is marked on today's maps as a 'mound'.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes--she's very vain. 'Tis {{said that}} {{every night at}} going to bed <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the glass to put on her night-cap properly." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> that direction; and, {{entering}} one {{of those}} undemonstrative phases so common with her, walked quietly on.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the aunt {{of the young}} lady came in. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> wonder at the others, for both were making wry faces.|$|E
60|$|He {{followed}} her into the house. There seemed to Arnold to be a curious silence everywhere. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at several rooms and nodded.|$|E
6000|$|Susan outstrips the Captain, {{and comes}} up with it. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> at the window, sees Walter, with the gentle face beside him, and claps her hands and screams: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{instruction}} manual for Totally Rad {{is filled with}} surfer lingo, in addition to comical picture breaks and comments about the author's [...] "babe" [...] and how attractive <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the picture he put {{of her in the}} {{instruction manual}}.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> the eyes, with dismay in {{her growing}} intelligence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not clapped eyes on 'er, zir, {{since she}} went to the ball come Monday evenin'. An' a picture <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> 'er white gown...." ...|$|E
6000|$|A light, girlish laugh followed. He {{sprang to}} his feet. It was Susy {{standing}} beside him--and Susy even as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the old days! ...|$|E
6000|$|She yielded with a weary sigh. Ah, how lovely <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{her pretty}} night-dress, {{on her knees}} at the bed-side--the innocent, afflicted creature--saying her prayers! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>in</b> {{his face}} anxiously, but his smile {{reassured}} her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>in</b> his face, puzzled. His old self-confident look seemed strangely past away.|$|R
50|$|She is {{now being}} managed by KB Entertainment, and <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> forward <b>in</b> doing more TV guestings.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Roxy now {{proceeded}} to pour out {{another cup of}} tea, and having mixed and flavored it, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> a weird and sibylline manner across it, and inquired,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Fancy Mrs. Berry's face as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> in {{the midst}} of that Bacchanalian ditty, when she saw no less a person than the Reverend Lemuel Whey carolling it! ...|$|E
60|$|Helen, when <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> her mirror, {{seeing the}} {{withered}} wrinkles made {{in her face}} by old age, wept, and wondered why she had twice been carried away.--Leonardo da Vinci.|$|E
60|$|She did not flinch {{from before}} him. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> the face, coldly and without fear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> me <b>in</b> the face. Her tired {{eyes lit}} with a gleam {{of her former}} humor.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> sorry. <b>In</b> fact, her manner was exquisitely {{expressive}} of sympathy, but Ormsgill contrived {{to answer}} lightly.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{could answer}} she stood upon the threshold, I saw the {{delightful}} little smile fade {{from her lips}} as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in.</b> She hesitated, and seemed {{for a moment about}} to retreat.|$|E
60|$|One day, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{from the}} door of her room, in her white dressing-gown, and asked to be forgiven if she kept the lessons of the morning waiting for a little while.|$|E
60|$|Even {{among these}} <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> vain for destitution; {{she could find}} that in {{satisfactory}} degree only in straggling veterans of the great army of tramps which once overran country places in the summer.|$|E
50|$|What's worse is that Mikan and Yoshioka have {{attended}} the same academies since Elementary School, and people (including her own Mother) persuade her to date Yoshioka. At times, when <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> {{the direction of}} Iwaki and Yoshioka, Shimi-chan gets the wrong idea and assumes Mikan is staring at Yoshioka, not Iwaki.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Wilhelmina pays a {{visit to}} a person whose face is {{partially}} wrapped up and it is discovered that the two are already discussing behind-the-scenes sinister plans to take over Meade Publications. While <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the mirror, <b>she</b> also says that they should {{keep a close eye on}} [...] "...that ugly assistant..." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{young and}} girlish did <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> her soft, white muslin frock that at {{sight of her}} the tension in Déroulède's face seemed to relax. Instinctively he had thrown the papers back into the desk, but his look had softened, from the fire of obstinate energy to that of inexpressible tenderness.|$|R
6000|$|She shuddered visibly: [...] "But I do blame myself," [...] {{she exclaimed}} with feeling. [...] "I am ashamed." [...] And, {{dropping}} her head, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{a moment the}} very picture of remorse and shame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who's there?" [...] she asked, in {{a startled}} voice. [...] "Is that you, Basilio?" [...] <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> and saw Martin Decoud walking about, {{with an air}} of having lost something, amongst the chairs and tables.|$|E
60|$|The mammas {{looked on}} and helped about supper, and Bess {{sat in the}} tent like an old woman, and told {{pleasant}} fortunes, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the palms of the soft little hands the children showed her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> the eyes, very sweetly, {{but with}} {{the shadow of a}} great {{disturbance}} in her face.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> him <b>in</b> the face, and I {{can still}} see those black eyes of hers {{softening}} before the gaze.|$|R
50|$|The movie {{opens with}} Manoja (Wamiqa Gabbi) {{suffering}} from insomnia. Her ex-boyfriend Tarun (Sharran Kumar) tries to propose to her, after wishing {{her on her}} birthday. She genuinely refused his proposal. She moves {{to her room and}} <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> her photo gallery where she sees the birthday celebration pictures when she had celebrated with her husband.|$|R
