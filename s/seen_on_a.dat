5|$|The Norman chapel in Durham Castle, {{built around}} 1078 by Saxon stonemasons, has what is {{probably}} the earliest surviving artistic depiction of a mermaid in England. It can be <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> south-facing capital above {{one of the original}} Norman stone pillars.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flight {{with his own}} boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 2011, a prequel to {{the episode}} was {{released}} online. The Doctor (Matt Smith) is <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spaceship holding a red button which, when he lets go, {{will cause the}} space ship to explode. While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond asking her to rescue him, although {{he does not have}} his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and the spaceship explodes.|$|E

5|$|Other {{television}} appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Wonder Woman, Highway to Heaven, Dolphin Cove, seaQuest DSV, and The Penguins of Madagascar, {{in which}} a dolphin, Doctor Blowhole, is a villain. In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne, a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog, and in Bermuda Triangle, a girl named Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins. Human and dolphin interaction segments shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center as <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Halloween episode of The Simpsons, Treehouse of Horror XI.|$|E
5|$|Although {{horse and}} ox-drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China {{long before the}} Han dynasty, {{it was not until}} the 1st century BCE that {{literary}} evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods. While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs. In the final stage of evolution, the modern horse collar was invented in China by the 5th century CE, during the Northern Wei period.|$|E
5|$|Having {{long been}} {{agricultural}} land, in the 18th century {{the town was}} divided up into five farms: Tanyard, Partington, Oakfield, Broadoak, and Elm. Hale Chapel was established in Hale Barns by Nonconformists in 1723 on what is now Chapel Lane. It underwent alterations around 1880. The chapel is the earliest place of worship in either Hale or Hale Barns and is a Grade II* listed building, one of only nine in Trafford. It also houses an eighteenth-century pulpit and nineteenth-century stained glass. In 1740, a school was founded by the Unitarian minister of Hale– a time when education was a rare commodity– and can be <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> map of 1800 along with a tithe barn, two inns, five farms, four cottages, the school house and school rooms.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Morgan Lawley, was released through Black's YouTube channel on July 18, 2011, and a behind-the-scenes video was uploaded the day after. The video opens with Black in a studio, finishing the song recording with a studio band; guitarist Kellen McGee, bassist Jeremy Steel, and keyboardist Jourdan Steel. The video intercuts {{scenes of the}} studio with footage of Black making TV appearances, walking on red carpets, driving around Hollywood and greeting fans. Next, the singer is <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> makeup chair and rehearsing several dance steps. She then starts the full choreography with So You Think You Can Dance finalists Robert Roldan and Kent Boyd. So You Think You Can Dances Allison Holker and Lauren Gottlieb also appear in the dance sections of the video. The video ends with Black at the premiere of My Moment, a fictional film about her.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kesha waking {{up next to}} her love interest; she then {{proceeds}} to run away while being chased by the man. Kesha walks through the desert while split scenes of her are shown where she is riding an elephant and wearing a tiger mask while crawling around in the sand. They are later <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boat singing and pretending to row while digitally animated water is added. It then cuts to a scene of all animation in which Kesha is portrayed as a mermaid. The mermaid and the man share a kiss; the video then jumps to a scene on a rocky hillside with Kesha walking around the sand with the man standing above on a rock. The video then cuts to another scene where Kesha is covered in glow in the dark body paint while dancing around in a cave with a python around her neck. The video ends with Kesha and her lover sitting around a campfire while still in the desert.|$|E

5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage can be <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance {{is a factor in}} determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
