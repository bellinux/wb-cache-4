5|$|In 1990, Edward Witten {{introduced}} topological <b>string</b> theory, {{a simplified}} version of <b>string</b> theory, and physicists {{showed that there}} is a version of mirror symmetry for topological <b>string</b> theory. This statement about topological <b>string</b> theory is usually taken as the definition of mirror symmetry in the mathematical literature. In an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994, mathematician Maxim Kontsevich presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of mirror symmetry in topological <b>string</b> theory. Known as homological mirror symmetry, this conjecture formalizes mirror symmetry as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the Fukaya category of its mirror.|$|E
5|$|In physics, <b>string</b> {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary <b>string.</b> <b>String</b> theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the <b>string</b> scale, a <b>string</b> will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the <b>string.</b> Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|<b>String</b> {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In <b>string</b> theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. <b>String</b> theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of <b>string</b> theory, {{there is only one}} kind of <b>string,</b> which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary <b>string,</b> and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the <b>string</b> scale, a <b>string</b> will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the <b>string.</b> In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a <b>string</b> gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of <b>string</b> theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of <b>string</b> theory called type IIA <b>string</b> theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected <b>string</b> and the maximum number of boxes in a <b>string</b> varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the <b>string</b> of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the <b>string</b> of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new <b>string</b> of boxes causes the previous <b>string</b> to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, several theorists {{generalized}} Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different <b>string</b> theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in {{the context}} of heterotic strings in four dimensions. Chris Hull and Paul Townsend showed that type IIB <b>string</b> theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different <b>string</b> theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to <b>string</b> theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, <b>string</b> theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of <b>string</b> theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In <b>string</b> theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E

5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal <b>string,</b> any force directed along the <b>string</b> by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the <b>string</b> in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same <b>string</b> multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every <b>string</b> that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the <b>string</b> acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of <b>string</b> that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E

The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a <b>string.</b> In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic <b>string.</b>|$|E
