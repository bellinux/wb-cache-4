500|$|Wishing {{to shoot}} the film in France, Besson could not find {{suitable}} facilities and [...] "with a heavy heart" [...] filmed in London. It was primarily filmed at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages including the 007 Stage. Construction of sets began in October 1995. The opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House. Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in Mauritania; the first shoot for the film, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996. Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later. Willis finished filming on 16 May, while Oldman only commenced filming the following week; the film's protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time. Despite being filmed in London, The Fifth Element was a French production, {{and went on to}} become the costliest European film ever made at the time. The buildings in New York were derived from both metabolist-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s, and the futuristic designs of architect Antonio Sant'Elia in the 1910s. Besson demanded that most of the action shots in the film take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science fiction films, and wanted a brighter [...] "cheerfully crazy" [...] look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one. Gaultier designed every one of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the film's Fhloston Paradise scenes, and checked each costume every morning. His designs, described as [...] "intellectually transgressive", were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms. A <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> he designed for the film cost $5,000.|$|E

60|$|Ah, what royal {{memories}} are mine, as I flutter through the aeons {{of the long}} ago. In <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> trances I have lived the many lives involved in the thousand-years-long Odysseys of the early drifts of men. Heavens, before I was of the flaxen-haired Aesir, who dwelt in Asgard, and before I was of the red-haired Vanir, who dwelt in Vanaheim, long before those times I have memories (living memories) of earlier drifts, when, like thistledown before the breeze, we drifted south before {{the face of the}} descending polar ice-cap.|$|E

50|$|Their {{music is}} mostly hip hop, {{but is also}} {{inspired}} by pop and rock music. All members in the group are from Hachiōji, Tokyo. They are known for featuring celebrities in their promotion videos and <b>singles</b> <b>jackets.</b> The band {{is also known as}} Fan-mon (ファンモン) in short.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>single's</b> <b>jacket</b> {{features}} vocalist Shiho Ochi {{holding a}} different object representing each {{song on the}} single: a dahlia flower for [...] "Wildflower", a djembe drum for [...] "Tamashii Revolution", a globe for [...] "Free Planet" [...] and on the back cover a rainbow for [...] "Roll Over the Rainbow".|$|R

50|$|The <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> design {{consists}} of an outer jacket which surrounds the vessel. Heat transfer fluid flows around the jacket and is injected at high velocity via nozzles. The temperature in the jacket is regulated to control heating or cooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} flux {{cooling jacket}} {{is a relatively}} recent development. It is not a <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> but has a series of 20 or more small jacket elements. The temperature control valve operates by opening and closing these channels as required. By varying the heat transfer area in this way, the process temperature can be regulated without altering the jacket temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Extra {{clothing}} {{to match the}} weather. Multiple layers are superior to a <b>single</b> massive <b>jacket,</b> because layered clothing is adaptable {{to a wide range}} of temperatures.|$|R

50|$|The half coil {{jacket is}} made by welding a half pipe around {{the outside of the}} vessel to create a semi {{circular}} flow channel. The heat transfer fluid passes through the channel in a plug flow fashion. A large reactor may use several coils to deliver the heat transfer fluid. Like the <b>single</b> <b>jacket,</b> the temperature in the jacket is regulated to control heating or cooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{plug flow}} {{characteristics}} of a half coil jacket permits faster displacement of the heat transfer fluid in the jacket (typically less than 60 seconds). This is desirable for good temperature control. It also provides good distribution of heat transfer fluid which avoids the problems of non uniform heating or cooling between the side walls and bottom dish. Like the <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> design however the inlet heat transfer fluid is also vulnerable to large oscillations (in response to the temperature control valve) in temperature.|$|E
50|$|The Mark 6, gun Nos. 293 - 356, was the bag-ammunition {{equivalent}} to the Mark 5 gun. Mod 0, Nos. 323 - 356, had a <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> constructed of nickel-steel, that replaced the jacket, chase hoop and locking ring of the Mark 5. Mod 1, Nos. 293 - 306 and 308, was built of gun-steel with a chamber of a different design with some external differences to fit it onto different mountings. The Mod 2, Nos. 307 and 309 - 322, had the same chamber as the Mod 0 but was otherwise almost identical to the Mod 1.|$|E
5000|$|... "Stand Up" [...] {{is a song}} by Japanese singer-songwriter Mai Kuraki {{from her}} second studio album, Perfect Crime (2001). It was {{released}} as the third single from the album on April 18, 2001. The lyrics to the song were penned by Kuraki and the track was produced by Akihito Tokunaga. The single peaked at number two on the Oricon Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). It has sold about 476,000 copies in Japan as of October 2014. The <b>single's</b> <b>jacket</b> image was {{compared to that of}} Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run (1975).|$|R
60|$|But I {{had grown}} too {{used to the}} jacket during my incorrigible days to let a <b>single</b> <b>jacketing</b> injure me. Naturally, it {{weakened}} me, took {{the life out of}} me; but I had learned muscular tricks for stealing a little space while they were lacing me. At {{the end of the first}} hundred hours' bout I was worn and tired, but that was all. Another bout of this duration they gave me, after a day and a night to recuperate. And then they gave one hundred and fifty hours. Much of this time I was physically numb and mentally delirious. Also, by an effort of will, I managed to sleep away long hours.|$|R

50|$|The <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> is {{probably}} the oldest design of external cooling jacket. Despite being a tried and tested solution, it has some limitations. On large vessels, it can take many minutes to adjust {{the temperature of the}} fluid in the cooling jacket. This results in sluggish temperature control. The distribution of heat transfer fluid is also far from ideal and the heating or cooling tends to vary between the side walls and bottom dish. Another issue to consider is the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid which can oscillate (in response to the temperature control valve) over a wide temperature range to cause hot or cold spots at the jacket inlet points.|$|E
50|$|Where the D.II {{differed}} from the Austro-Daimler was largely in mechanical arrangement. For instance, the D.II featured a single overhead cam, powered by a shaft leading up from the crankshaft {{at the rear of}} the engine, whereas the Austro-Daimler had a more conventional valvetrain using pushrods driven from the crankcase. Another unique feature was the ability to shift the camshaft to a half-compression position for starting. The D.II used two carburetors located together on one side of the engine, feeding the cylinders through two manifolds; the Austro-Daimler separated its carburetors to locate them closer to the cylinders they fed. The D.II also used a unique cooling jacket design, with every two cylinders being covered by a <b>single</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In August 9, Universal Sigma and DSP Media {{announced}} that a Japanese re-recorded version of the song {{will serve as the}} group's second single. In September 28, Sigma updated the news with more details of the <b>single,</b> <b>jacket</b> covers and track listing. The single will be released in four editions: a CD+DVD, including the CD single and a DVD including the song's music video and a special off-shot video, a CD+Photobook edition, including the CD and a special photobook and two Regular editions: first press, with a cover of the song [...] "A Song Calling Your Name", originally sung by SS501, as bonus track and a normal edition, including only the CD single with the normal track list.|$|E
50|$|The single was {{released}} in both regular and a CD + DVD limited version. The CD contained the title song plus three different couplings, all with their own karaoke version, {{for a total of}} eight songs on the single.

5000|$|In {{the case}} of jackets, vents were {{originally}} a sporting option, designed to make riding easier, so are traditional on hacking jackets, formal coats such as a morning coat, and, for reasons of pragmatism, overcoats. Today there are three styles of vent: the single-vented style (with one vent, either directly at the center or roughly 3 cm to the right); the ventless style; and the double-vented style (one vent on each side). Vents are convenient, particularly when using a pocket or sitting down, to improve the hang of the jacket, [...] so are now used on most <b>jackets.</b> <b>Single</b> vents <b>jackets</b> are associated with Italian tailoring, while the double-vented style is typically British. (This {{is not the case}} with all types of jackets. For instance, dinner jackets traditionally take no vents.) ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 17, 2013, member Kiyomura {{announced}} {{that she would be}} [...] "restraining" [...] from activities with Fairies in order to concentrate on her studies, leaving the remaining six to continue. Although the group had been using the name [...] "Fairies" [...] in Latin script until then, from February onwards it was changed to Japanese on all their official sites and <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> covers. However, no announcement was ever made about which was the official notation. On February 1, 2013 the subunit [...] "M Three" [...] (Mスリー) with Hayashida Mahiro, Fujita Miria, and Shimomura as members was announced. The name was due to [...] "M" [...] being the initial of all three girls' given names. Their debut single [...] "Yumemiru Dancing Doll" [...] was released on March 27.|$|E
50|$|Many {{animals have}} been killed for the Siberian fur trade, which has had severe {{negative}} effects on Siberian ecology. In {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century, about 10-15 million squirrels were killed in Siberia each year, in addition to tens of thousands of ermines, rabbits, martens, foxes, sables, lynx and wolverine. Most of these animals are small and a <b>single</b> <b>jacket</b> requires many pelts. For example, several hundred squirrel pelts are needed to make one fur cloak. In Irkutsk, a major fur trade center, more than 150,000 sable pelts, thousands of Arctic foxes, and hundreds of thousands of squirrels passed through its customs house each year. Hunters also came to Siberia with the false image of Siberia as an endless wilderness that could not be exhausted, and they hunted and killed without regard to maintaining the animal populations.|$|E
