To enable carrier-grade services, protocols must {{be designed to}} achieve a predictable performance and allow for quality differentiation.

Moreover, AAA and related mechanisms must be built <b>into</b> <b>meshes.</b> In contrast <b>to</b> wired networks where service guarantees are achieved with overprovisioning today, {{it is clear that}} such an approach is not feasible in a wireless world—at least not by scaling bandwidth.|$|R

Harris Corporation has provided deployable reflector antennas for NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).

40|$|Brokering is an {{essential}} element of service-oriented architectures and utility resource sharing. Brokers act as intermediaries that match client needs with provider services by aggregating information about multiple providers and client requests. In these systems, broker architectures facilitate efficient and effective service management by distributing services to their “highest and best use”. Brokers must create pairings in a way that accommodates system requirements of flexible and extensible management to achieve scalability and autonomy. This project explores broker architectures in the context of two economic, service-oriented architectures: Cereus and Tuscany. These research systems are currently under development at Duke and HP Labs, respectively. In this proposal we will explore alternatives for broker architectures, such as the distribution of brokers, the mode of client interaction, and the incentives for brokers to participate in and help maintain a sustainable system. One crucial aspect of our broker architectures is that brokers organize <b>into</b> a <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> share system information. Services and resources flow through this <b>mesh</b> according <b>to</b> local broker policies, ultimately resulting in global service management. We propose future work to explore the benefits brokers provide to the clients and providers in service-oriented systems, as well as investigate how different design decisions in the broker architecture affect service and resource allocation outcomes. Most significantly, we plan to examine how broker allocation policies affect the stability and agility of service control and the effectiveness of the broker <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> match system supply and demand. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – A {{growing number}} of users {{communicate}} on the move with each other utilising wireless network technologies. The heterogeneity level of networks is increasing with various wired and wireless parts as well as access technologies. Mobile ad hoc communications can fill the connectivity gaps in such networks. However, the increasing amount of multimedia content shared over the wireless medium makes quality of service (QoS) and resource efficiency essential requirements for mobile ad hoc networks. The {{growing number of}} group-oriented applications also requires efficient utilisation of network resources. The mesh-evolving ad hoc QoS multicast (MAQM) routing protocol proposes a solution to these problems. It achieves multicast efficiency by tracking resource availability in each node’s neighbourhood and monitoring the QoS status continuously. Nodes decide on joining multicast sessions based on the sustainability of QoS. MAQM also evolves the initial multicast tree <b>into</b> a <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> improve robustness. This article describes the modules of MAQM and presents its performance evaluation with regard to session-and packet-level QoS criteria. The results show that MAQM significantly improves multicast session efficiency. Index Terms – Mobile ad hoc networks, multicast routing, next generation networks, quality of service. 1...|$|R
40|$|Systems of {{implicit}} delay differential equations, including state-dependent problems {{neutral and}} differential-algebraic equations, singularly perturbed problems, and small or vanishing delays are considered. The numerical integration of such problems is {{very sensitive to}} jump discontinuities in the solution or in its derivatives (so-called breaking points). In this article we discuss a new strategy - peculiar to implicit schemes - that allows codes to detect automatically and then to compute very accurately those breaking points which have to be inserted <b>into</b> the <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> guarantee the required accuracy. In particular for state-dependent delays, where breaking points are not known in advance, this treatment leads to a significant improvement in accuracy. As a theoretical result we obtain a general convergence theorem which was missing in the literature (see cite{BZ 03 }). Furthermore, as a useful by-product, we design strategies {{that are able to}} detect points of non-uniqueness or non-existence of the solution so that the code can terminate when such a situation occurs. A new version of the code RADAR 5 together with drivers for some real-life problems is available on the homepages of the authors...|$|R

A Delaunay background mesh is defined over which a neighborhood based interpolation scheme is used to interpolate element sizes. A brief description of natural neighbor interpolation is included and compared to linear interpolation. Two specific applications are presented that utilize the sizing function, namely boundary layer meshing and surface curvature refinement. For these applications, criteria used for insertion of additional interior vertices <b>into</b> the background <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> control element sizing is discussed. Introduction In recent years CAD software has become a popular means for generating geometry for the finite element method.

40|$|An {{inherent}} {{problem that}} restricts the practical application of superhydrophobic materials {{is that the}} superhydrophobic property is not sustainable; it can be diminished, or even lost, when the surface is physically damaged. In this work, we present an efficient approach for the fabrication of superhydrophobic fibrous fabrics with great rinse-resistance where a block copolymer has been electrospun <b>into</b> a nanofibrous <b>mesh</b> while micro-sized beads have been subsequently electrosprayed to give a morphologically composite material. The intricate nano- and microstructure of the composite was then fixed by thermally annealing the block copolymer to induce self-assembly and interdigitation of the microphase separated domains. To demonstrate this approach, a polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-co-butylene) -b-polystyrene (SEBS) nanofibrous scaffold was produced by electrospinning before SEBS beads were electrosprayed <b>into</b> this <b>mesh</b> <b>to</b> form a hierarchical micro/nanostructure of beads and fibers. The effects of type and density of SEBS beads on the surface morphology and wetting properties of composite membranes were studied extensively. Compared with a neat SEBS fibrous mesh, the composite membrane had enhanced hydrophobic properties. The static water contact angle increased from 139 ° (± 3 °) to 156 ° (± 1 °), while the sliding angle decreased to 8 ° (± 1 °) from nearly 90 °. In order to increase the rinse-resistance of the composite membrane, a thermal annealing step was applied to physically bind the fibers and beads. Importantly, after 200 hours of water flushing, the hierarchical surface structure and superhydrophobicity of the composite membrane were well retained. This work provides a new route {{for the creation of}} superhydrophobic fabrics with potential in self-cleaning applications...|$|R

40|$|The current Army {{infrared}} signature code, PRISM, {{does not fully}} {{meet the needs of}} vehicle designers. In this age of rapid prototyping and advanced signature and heat management designs, an overhaul of the infrared modeling process is required. The Army awarded a SBIR Phase II program at the end of 1997 to create a new design tool called MuSES (Multi-Service Electro-optics Signature) code capable of meeting these arising requirements. MuSES will provide a virtual prototyping platform for both concept and retrofit design efforts. Because of the strong connections between signature management for military ground vehicles and heat management for commercial automobiles, there is considerable dual-use collaboration and commercial commitments from the automobile industry. This SBIR program will create an innovative design tool for the Army, provide considerable technology transfer to other tri-service defense organizations, and be positioned for Phase III follow-on commercialization with the automobile industry. A description of the MuSES code is detailed in this paper.

40|$|Functional {{artificial}} vascular meshes from biodegradable polymers {{have been}} widely explored for certain tissue engineered meshes. Still, the foreign body reaction and limitation in endothelialization are challenges for such devices. Here, degradable meshes from phase-segregated multiblock copolymers consisting of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and polydepsipeptide segments are successfully prepared by electrospinning and electrospraying techniques. The pEGFP-ZNF 580 plasmid microparticles (MPs-pZNF 580) were loaded <b>into</b> the electrospun <b>meshes</b> <b>to</b> enhance endothelialization. These functional meshes were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells on the meshes were enhanced in loaded mesh groups. Moreover, the hemocompatibility and the tissue response of the meshes were further tested. The complete tests showed that the vascular meshes modified with MPs-pZNF 580 possessed satisfactory performance with an average fiber diameter of 550 ± 160 nm, tensile strength of 27 ± 3 MPa, Young’s modulus of 1. 9 ± 0. 2 MPa, water contact angle of 95 ° ± 2 °, relative cell number of 122 % ± 1 % after 7 days of culture, and low blood platelet adhesion as well as weak inflammatory reactions compared to control groups...|$|R
