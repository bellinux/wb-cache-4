25|$|The crash {{investigation}} {{determined that}} the aircraft had entered a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> after encountering strong vertical gusts. Loads during the dive increased to approximately 5.76 g, exceeding the design stress limits of the Fokker F27 type and causing its right wing to separate. The flight crew were believed to have erred in taking off during known thunderstorm conditions.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, HASELL or {{alternatively}} HASEL, {{is a standard}} mnemonic to prompt a series of checks prior to carrying out many types of manoeuvres, such as stalls, spins, <b>spiral</b> <b>dives</b> or aerobatics.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>dives</b> put {{a strong}} G-force {{on the wing}} and glider and must be done {{carefully}} and skilfully. The G-forces involved can induce blackouts, and the rotation can produce disorientation. Some high-end gliders have {{what is called a}} [...] "stable spiral problem". After inducing a spiral and without further pilot input, some wings do not automatically return to normal flight and stay inside their spiral. Serious injury and fatal accidents did occur when pilots could not exit this maneuver and spiraled into the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The Donek is a Macedonian {{breed of}} fancy pigeon {{developed}} {{over many years}} of selective breeding. The name Donek is of Macedonian origin and means, [...] "falling down from the sky." [...] The Donek, along with other varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants from the rock pigeon (Columba livia).The breed {{is known for its}} aerial acrobatics (<b>spiral</b> <b>diving)</b> and as such is more of a performance breed rather than a purely fancy variety. Their aerial spiraling return when called back to the loft makes a spectacular sight.|$|R
500|$|An {{analysis}} by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents—an in-flight upset (e.g., stall), a glide event (e.g., engine failure, fuel exhaustion), and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event—concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event [...] "best fit the available evidence" [...] for the five-hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track, likely on autopilot. No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory. If no control inputs were made following flameout and the disengagement of autopilot, the aircraft would likely have entered a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> and entered the ocean within [...] of the flameout and disengagement of autopilot. The analysis of the flaperon showed that the landing flaps were not extended, supporting the <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> at high speed.|$|E
2500|$|... 24 May 1995 G-OEAA, an Embraer EMB-110-P1 {{operated}} by UK domestic airline Knight Air flight between Leeds and Aberdeen entered a steeply descending <b>spiral</b> <b>dive,</b> broke up in flight {{and crashed into}} farmland at Dunkeswick Moor near Leeds. All 12 occupants were killed. The probable cause of the accident was the failure of one or both artificial horizon instruments. There was no standby artificial horizon installed (as there was no airworthiness requirement for one on this aircraft) and the accident report concluded that this left the crew without a single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed. The aircraft entered a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> from which the pilot, who was likely to have become spatially disoriented, was unable to recover.|$|E
2500|$|Blind {{flying in}} fog or cloud {{should only be}} {{undertaken}} with gyroscopic instruments, which they did not have, and Alcock twice {{lost control of the}} aircraft and nearly hit the sea after a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive.</b> [...] Alcock also had to deal with a broken trim control that made the plane become very nose-heavy as fuel was consumed.|$|E

5000|$|There are 15 {{teams in}} town (about 900 {{in the whole}} of Attica) of skilled flying (high flying, <b>diving,</b> <b>spiralling</b> etc.) pigeons, most of them {{belonging}} to the Aspropyrgos Association of Pigeon-Owners.|$|R
2500|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} lasted 19 months, and it {{was discovered}} that a number of fatigue cracks had formed on the aircraft's wings due to improper and shoddy maintenance. The area over Pedro Bay had been the site of extreme, unreported turbulence, with winds in excess of [...] The stresses due to turbulence and air pressure caused a structural failure in the aircraft's right wing, forcing it into a <b>spiraling,</b> uncontrollable <b>dive.</b>|$|R
50|$|A spin {{differs from}} a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> in which neither wing is stalled {{and which is}} {{characterized}} by a low angle of attack and high airspeed. A <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> is not a type of spin because neither wing is stalled. In a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive,</b> the aircraft will respond conventionally to the pilot's inputs to the flight controls and recovery from a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> requires a different set of actions from those required to recover from a spin.|$|E
50|$|Thus, a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> {{results from}} the netting-out of many forces {{depending}} partly {{on the design of}} the aircraft, partly on its attitude, and partly on its throttle setting (a susceptible design will <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> under power but may not in the glide).|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise <b>spirals,</b> and steep <b>dives.</b> The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.|$|R
5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would <b>spiral</b> into a <b>dive.</b> If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is in spring. During {{the beginning of}} the {{breeding season}}, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep <b>spiralling</b> or swooping <b>dives.</b> The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies N. p. ginginianus and N. p. majorensis.|$|R

50|$|The <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> is {{the most}} rapid form of {{controlled}} fast descent; an aggressive <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> can achieve a sink rate of 25 m/s. This maneuver halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes {{on one side and}} shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this maneuver by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.|$|E
50|$|Such {{increases}} in tip lift under load causes the wing to tighten into turns and {{may result in}} a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> from which recovery is not possible.|$|E

5000|$|Puller has a {{promising}} history. ... Baldacci’s strategy {{up to the}} dining dilemma works moderately well.

50|$|The DC-7B, with {{a portion}} of its left wing sheared off, {{remained}} airborne {{for a few minutes}} then rolled to the left and began an uncontrollable, <b>spiraling,</b> high-velocity <b>dive</b> earthward. In doing so, it began raining debris onto the Pacoima neighborhoods below as the aircraft began to break apart. Seconds later, part of the hurtling wreckage slammed onto the grounds of the Pacoima Congregational Church, killing all four Douglas crewmen aboard while the major portions fell onto the adjacent playground of Pacoima Junior High School. On the school playground, where some 220 boys were just ending their outdoor athletic activities, the wreckage broke upon impact into numerous pieces and intense fires began due to the aircraft's fuel and oil. Distinct craters were made in the playground by each of the four engines and the main center fuselage section. Two students, Ronnie Brann, 13, and Robert Zallan, 12, were struck and killed by this wreckage and debris. A third gravely injured student, Evan Elsner, 12, died two days later in a local hospital. An estimated 75 more students on the school playground suffered injuries ranging from critical to minor.|$|R
5000|$|The rate of {{rotation}} in a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> {{can be reduced}} by using a drogue chute, deployed just before the spiral is induced. This reduces the G forces experienced.|$|E
50|$|Spiraling is inherent. Most {{aircraft}} trimmed for straight-and-level flight, if flown stick-fixed, {{will eventually}} develop a tightening spiral-dive. If a <b>spiral</b> <b>dive</b> is entered unintentionally, {{the result can}} be fatal.|$|E
5000|$|... 10 January 2000: After {{taking off}} from Zürich Airport, Crossair Flight 498 banked steeply and entered a {{high-speed}} <b>spiral</b> <b>dive,</b> crashing into a field in Niederhasli. All ten people on board were killed.|$|E
40|$|Audiograms and {{behavioural}} {{responses to}} ultrasound reveal that male geometrid winter moths (Agriopis and Erannis spp.; Ennominae, and Alsophila aescularia; Oenochrominae), which have large wings and a slow flight, have good, broadly tuned ultrasonic hearing with best frequencies at 25 - 40 kHz, {{coinciding with the}} frequencies used by most sympatric aerial-hawking bats. Ultrasonic pulses (27 kHz 110 dB at 1 m) delivered at distances of 1 - 12 m evoked consistent reactions of free flying, male A. marginaria in the lab {{as well as in}} the field; those at < 5 m resulted in the moth <b>spiralling</b> or <b>diving</b> towards the ground, those at 5 - 12 m resulted in one or several changes in the flight path, but did not end on the ground. The differential reaction probably reflects whether the moth is likely to have been detected by the bat or not. The micropterous (and flightless), and hence cryptic, females have strongly reduced tympanic organs and are virtually deaf. Sexual dimorphism in hearing and behavioural reactions to ultrasound reflect differential natural selection on males and females by bats. Natural selection on the hearing of the males thus seems to occur although they fly in late autumn and early spring, when bat activity is much reduced...|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{exited the}} mass of {{aircraft}} and was immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 yards away. Maintaining a steep, tight, <b>spiralling</b> turn, he <b>dived</b> into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out of the cloud, Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it {{to be one of}} the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and shot it down. It was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month's tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the Wing. The much loathed Circus and Rhubarb raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|R

5000|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and skill}} on several occasions, notably the following: —On 21st September, 1915, when flying a machine with one machine gun, accompanied by Flight-SerjeantHargreaves, he sighted a large German biplane with two machine guns 2,000 feet below him. He <b>spiralled</b> down and <b>dived</b> at the enemy, who, having the faster machine, manoeuvred {{to get him}} broadside on and then opened heavy fire.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} of the Netherlands in May 1940, Smirnov and his wife lived in Napels, which since the outbreak of World War II had functioned as the terminal of the KLM route to the East Indies. He moved to Java and continued flying the route, until the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies in December 1941. Though returned to military flying as a (reserve) captain in the army aviation corps, he remained also active as a civilian pilot. He evacuated Dutch women, children, and VIPs to Australia, at times taking off just minutes before the invaders arrived. Eventually, on 3 March 1942, his luck ran out. He was flying PK-AFV, a DC-3 Dakota again dubbed Pelikaan, when he was attacked by three Japanese Zeroes. Although wounded five times in the arm, the ex-fighter pilot threw his transport into a <b>diving</b> <b>spiral</b> away from the attacking fighters to make his escape. He crashlanded the DC-3 on a sandy beach, four of his passengers dying in the event. The survivors and cargo were rescued five days later, though a packet of diamonds went missing.
