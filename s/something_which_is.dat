5|$|The first talkies {{shown in}} the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man (both 1929), came from the United States and were {{screened}} in late 1929. This encouraged Krugers to make Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor), an adaptation of the book by Yuhana, in 1930. The comedy, made with a single system camera that Krugers had obtained {{with the help of}} his Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers membership, is generally thought the first locally produced talkie released in the country, but had poor technical quality. It was a critical failure, as the majority Sundanese audience felt that they were being insulted; contemporary director Joshua Wong suggested that this poor reception was partly owing to the main character eating a frog, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> forbidden for Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscription}} {{created a}} sensation as it mentions four distant countries {{that were the}} targets of adventurous Scandinavian expeditions during the Viking Age, but it also stirred some doubts as to its authenticity. However, thorough geological and runological analyses dispelled any doubts as to its genuine nature. The stone had the same patina as other Viking Age stones on all its surfaces and carvings, and in addition it has the normal r-rune with an open side stroke, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> usually overlooked by forgerers. Moreover, v Friesen commented {{that there could be}} no expert on Old Swedish that made a forgery while he correctly wrote krikiaʀ as all reference books of the time incorrectly told that the form was grikir.|$|E

25|$|The Keep {{was built}} around 1350 by Sir Robert Boyd’s son Sir Thomas Boyd. It was built mainly for defence, {{the walls are}} 2–3 metres thick, it has few windows, and the {{original}} entrance is high above ground level. There are no arrowslits in the walls of Dean Castle <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> very rare for a Scottish castle of this time period, all of the shooting was done from the battlements at the top.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of a Hausdorff space says that points can be separated by neighborhoods. It turns out that this implies <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> seemingly stronger: in a Hausdorff space every pair of disjoint compact sets can also be separated by neighborhoods, in other words there is a neighborhood of one set and a neighborhood of the other, such that the two neighborhoods are disjoint. This {{is an example of}} the general rule that compact sets often behave like points.|$|E

25|$|The {{flat bottom}} and narrow tires of the 962 Le Mans would hinder the {{performance}} of the car over the long laps at Le Mans even with the increased power from the GT-class air restrictor. However Porsche believed that the larger fuel tank they were allowed in the GT-class would allow them to overcome this lack of speed by spending less time in the pits than the Group C cars, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> key for an endurance race.|$|E
25|$|Because Thessaloniki {{remained}} under Ottoman {{rule for}} about 100 years more than southern Greece, it has retained {{a lot of}} its Eastern character, including its culinary tastes. Spices in particular {{play an important role in}} the cuisine of Thessaloniki, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> not true to the same degree about Greece's southern regions. Thessaloniki's Ladadika borough is a particularly busy area in regards to Thessalonian cuisine, with most tavernas serving traditional meze and other such culinary delights.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 2008, five Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata, Indore and Pondicherry) celebrated {{gay pride}} parades. About 2,000 people {{turned out in}} these {{nationwide}} parades. Mumbai held its pride march on 16 August 2008, with Bollywood actress Celina Jaitley flagged off the festivities. On 4 July 2008, the Delhi High Court, while hearing the case to decriminalise homosexuality, opined {{that there was nothing}} unusual in holding a gay rally, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> common outside India.|$|E

25|$|Such a test as {{described}} by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe {{and not for the}} single parallel branches. Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a degree of freedom of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> proven by Welcher Weg detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).|$|E
25|$|Proton's then Senior Director Operations, Dr. Wolfgang Karl Epple {{revealed}} that the Prevé was developed by an international consortium consisting of experts from Malaysia, Italy, France, Germany and South Korea. Additionally, several components of the car are also sourced from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Europe. “If you put global ingredients in the components, people, processes, styling and packaging, you get <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> global.”, Epple commented. Nonetheless, Proton later claimed that 94% of the Prevé's components are locally sourced {{in an effort to}} reduce capital outflow.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} its organisation, the electoral roll {{is one of the}} main points in contention, since this is managed by the National Institute of Statistics, an {{autonomous}} organisation placed under the jurisdiction of the government of Spain. To access its data, polls must have been authorised by the Spanish Congress, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> out of the question in this case. Without an undisputed access to the electoral roll, the results may be deemed unreliable. Similar difficulties could be met when it comes to the electoral commission to be formed for monitoring the polling and results.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} types of social category, in Judaism the mamzer status is {{hereditary}} - a child of a mamzer (whether mother or father) is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> only maternally inheritable, {{the child of a}} male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, the child of a female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both parents must be Jews in order for mamzer status to accrue to the child, but the child does inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} on his Ethics is scanty. He tried {{to supplement the}} Platonic doctrine at various points, {{and at the same}} time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> neither good nor bad. Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this. Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|Only Holinshed {{contains}} {{information about}} the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which Shakespeare used for the scenes of Cade's rebellion throughout Act 4 (for example, details such as having people killed because they could read, and promises of setting up a state with no money). The presentation of Henry's reaction to the rebellion also differs in Hall and Holinshed. In Hall, Henry pardons everyone who surrenders and lets them all return home unpunished, {{and this is how}} Shakespeare presents it in the play. In Holinshed, by contrast, Henry convenes a court and has several of the leaders executed (as he did in reality). Another historical parallel found in Holinshed is that Henry is presented as unstable, constantly on the brink of madness, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> not in Hall, who presents a gentle but ineffective King (again, Shakespeare follows Hall here).|$|E

25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} type of {{substance}} that is smoked is tobacco. There {{are many different}} tobacco cultivars which are made into {{a wide variety of}} mixtures and brands. Tobacco is often sold flavored, often with various fruit aromas, <b>something</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> especially popular for use with water pipes, such as hookahs. The second most common substance that is smoked is cannabis, made from the flowers or leaves of Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica. The substance is considered illegal in most countries in the world and in those countries that tolerate public consumption, it is usually only pseudo-legal. Despite this, a considerable percentage of the adult population in many countries have tried it with smaller minorities doing it on a regular basis. Since cannabis is illegal or only tolerated in most jurisdictions, there is no industrial mass-production of cigarettes, meaning that {{the most common form of}} smoking is with hand-rolled cigarettes (often called joints) or with pipes. Water pipes are also fairly common, and when used for cannabis are called bongs.|$|E
