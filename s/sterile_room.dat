40|$|Background. According to {{immunological}} deficit {{the period}} after {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) can be divided in three phases: aplastic phase, phase of acute GVHD, and phase of chronic GVHD. Fungal infections are predomi-nant in first, aplastic phase. Deep neutropenia and implantation of central venous catheter are two major risk factors contributing to infection. Aim. To retrospectively analyze fungal infections, fungal isolates and to compare success of different antifungal strategies during the first 30 days after HSCT. Material and methods. During a 7 year period (2000 - 2007), we have performed 128 HSCT in 120 patients with different hematological diseases. Male: 62 Female: 58. Median age: 34 years.

40|$|Background. Decellularized {{human skin}} {{has been used}} in a variety of medical applications, {{primarily}} involving soft tissue reconstruction, wound healing, and tendon augmentation. Theoretically, decellularization removes potentially immunogenic material and provides a clean scaffold for cellular and vascular in growth. The use of acellular dermal matrix in two-stage postmastectomy breast reconstruction is described. Methods. Ten consecutive breast cancer patients were treated with mastectomies and immediate reconstruction from August to November 2011. There were 8 bilateral and 1 unilateral mastectomies for a total of 17 breasts, with one exclusion for chronic tobacco use. Reconstruction included the use of a new 6 × 16 [*]cm <b>sterile,</b> <b>room</b> temperature acellular dermal matrix patch (DermACELL) soaked in a cefazolin bath. Results.

Infection-related mortality is mainly due to severe bacterial sepsis, pneumonia and fungal infections. Case Report: We report a 60 years old patient with AML. In the complete remission he is received high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The patient was treated in <b>sterile</b> <b>room,</b> conditioned with HEPA filters. Antibiotic prophylaxis regimen consisted Ciprofloxacin 1. 0 gr/day, Itraconazol 400 mg/day, Acyclovir 1500 mg/day, and Immunoglobulins IV 0. 1 mg/kg once per week. From day + 5 patient became febrile (Ne< 0. 5 x 103 /mL). First line antibiotic regimen consisted third-generation anti-pseudomonal cephalosporine and amynoglicoside during a 72 h, but with no response. As a second line antibiotic therapy was introduced Vancomicyn 2. 0 gr/day. On day + 10 from blood culture and urine culture was isolated Stenotrophomonas maltophillia with in vitro succeptibilities only to Ciprofloxacin (+ 3).

40|$|Background and Objective. The main {{objective}} of this pilot study {{was to assess the}} possibility of achieving engraftment of HLA-matched sibling donor mobilized hematopoietic stem cells after immunosuppressive non-myeloablative therapy. The second objective was to verify whether high-dose therapy with autologous stem cells rescuefollowed by allografting conditioned by only an immunosuppressive regimen, can be combined in order to achieve the reduction of tumor burden after autografting and the control of residual disease with immune-mediated effects after allografting. Design and Methods. To enter the pilot study the patients had to fulﬁl the following criteria: advanced resistant disease, presence of an HLA matched sibling donor, no general contraindications to stem cell transplantation. Our data refers to 9 patients: Hodgkin’s disease (n= 4), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n= 2), advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia (n= 2) (one patient with accelerated phase Ph-negative but p 190 BCR-ABL gene positive by RT-PCR and one with Ph-positive blastic phase), refractory anemia with excess of blasts t(1; 3) (p 36;q 21) (n= 1). All patients but one received the combined approach. At a median of 40 days (range 30 - 96), after high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell engraftment, the patients were treated with immunosuppressive therapy consisting of ﬂudarabine and cyclophosphamide (Flu-Cy protocol) and then HLA matched donor mobilized stem cells were infused into the patients. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin and methotrexate. Results. To date, with a median observation period of 4 months (range, 2 - 10), complete chimerism (100 % donor cells) has been achieved in 6 patients. Three patients did not achieve complete chimerism: one patient died of progressive Hodgkin’s disease when he reached 55 % of donor cells, another patient is now in increasing phase of donor cell engraftment and the last patient (blastic phase-CML) was the only case who appears to have had autologous recovery. Two of the Hodgkin’s disease patients, who were in partial remission after autografting, achieved complete remission after allografting and both are disease free 2 and 6 months after. Another Hodgkin’s disease patient is alive at 10 months but she has progressive disease. One of the two patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, who achieved partial remission after auto- grafting, obtained complete remission and he is disease free 2 months after allografting. The other patient maintains partial remission obtained after autografting. The accelerated phase-CML patient obtained hematologic and molecular remission; the RAEB patient achieved hematologic and cytogenetic remission. In two patients severe aGVHD (grade II-III) was the single major complication but neither patient died of it. Mild aGVHD was seen in another patient. in only one patient did the ANC decrease to below 1 x 109 /L and in no case did platelets decrease below 20 x 109 /L. No patients required a <b>sterile</b> <b>room</b> or any red cell or platelet transfusions. Interpretation and Conclusions. Immunosuppressive therapy with a Flu-Cy protocol allowed engraftment of HLA-matched sibling donor stem cells without procedure-related deaths; moreover, we have demonstrated that this combined procedure can be pursued in safety in a serious ill population and some of these patients achieved a complete remission. This procedure {{is not likely to be}} curative, but a fascinating step along the path to curing these diseases. Of course, the follow-up is too short to document the incidence of cGvHD...|$|E
30|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} a new modality for bedside chest DTS. In the presented simulations of ICU patients, portable DTS improved {{the detection of}} abnormalities in the bedside CXR. Whereas the clinical use of chest DTS for patients in the radiology department can be evaluated against CT, MRI and other modalities, far fewer alternatives exist for bedside chest examination of patients in the ICU, for whom transport to a radiology department is often complicated and expensive. The cost of performing bedside ultrasound as a daily follow-up is relatively high, since this exam takes longer to perform and requires {{a high level of}} expertise. Mobile CT scanners exist but are not widespread and they are mainly limited to dedicated applications such as imaging of the head [23 – 25]. Portable chest DTS could be implemented on a mobile X-ray device, which is already widely accepted as a mobile examination device. Portable DTS might also hold potential to improve bedside exams in the emergency <b>room,</b> <b>sterile</b> <b>rooms</b> in haematology wards or transplantation units, burn units, surgical departments, etc. In future work, a more elaborate prospective clinical study of potential applications will be conducted, in combination with an optimisation of the acquisition technique.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the microbial efficacy against highly resistant bacterial spores on different substrates using the lowest effective concentration of a market liquid sporicide based on peracetic acid. The validation was carried out following modified European regulatory agencies procedures or test methods and USP guidelines, employing carriers of materials usually treated with the sporicidal solution and present in grade A cleanrooms and spores of four different microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium sporogenes, both from the ATCC collection, and Bacillus cereus and Bacillus sphaericus as environmental isolates. A statistical evaluation of data was made to estimate the variance for different study conditions. The experiments highlighted that 70 % suitable dilution of the ready-to-use peracetic acid solution was effective in both clean and dirty conditions, showing at least 2 log spore reduction after treatment. To obtain effective sporicidal action on the surfaces in cleanrooms it is sufficient to use a sporicidal solution with a ready-to-use concentration of 70 % while ensuring a contact time of 10 min. In any case, the reduction of sporicide concentration ensures {{a high degree of}} disinfection and provides a consumption savings. LAY ABSTRACT: Wide-spectrum disinfectants are used in the pharmaceutical industry for the decontamination of work surfaces and equipment, but these products have some degree of toxicity for operators. This work arises from the needs of pharmaceutical companies to find the lowest effective concentration of sanitizers in order to reduce toxicity to personnel. The sanitizer used in the study was a market liquid sporicide based on peracetic acid. When we started our work no similar studies were reported in the literature, so we took European regulatory agencies and USP guidelines as a starting point, employing carriers of hard, non-porous materials usually treated with the sporicidal solution and present in <b>sterile</b> <b>rooms</b> and spores of four different microorganisms.

Barely ten years after being constructed, Letchworth's buildings were already overpopulated, cramming 70 beds into the tiny dormitories. Nearly 1,200 patients were present during 1921.

30|$|The {{upstream}} {{stages of}} the Pan Bauletto bread chain (i.e. imports of soft wheat, and other primary inputs) occur at continental level while the following stages occur at the national level. Fuel supply, machinery and energy represent the most global inputs throughout the chain, although not as specific as wheat. Barilla company both sources soft wheat for internal milling (30  %) and buys flour directly from other milling companies (70  %). Soft wheat supplies are based on production contracts with farmers according to specific quality specifications (or specific varieties that have the desired characteristics). The price is set {{on the basis of}} the commodity board of exchange or bargained at the beginning of the season: it may vary according to the amount purchased, and a premium price is granted when the farmers comply with Barilla’s specification on wheat growing and storage and/or the wheat displays some specific quality characteristics. The requirements are strict because the industrial baking process cannot be adjusted “manually” (as the handcraft baker would do). Hence, there is the need for highly standardized raw material suitable for specific dough rising times and strength of flour. For flour, Barilla refers to three main millers with whom it makes contracts from 3 to 6  months. In this case it is not possible to know the exact origin of the grain. The main suppliers of flour are Italian, because flour is highly perishable during transportation. The production process occurs in two plants based in the North and South of Italy (i.e. Cremona and Melfi, respectively). Secondary processes include mixing of raw ingredients (flour, water, salt and yeast) to form a dough; bulk fermentation, division of dough into individual loaf-sized pieces, molding, proofing; baking of pieces in gas oven; cooling and packaging; production of packaging material; delivery of products to distribution platforms. Distribution channels of packaged soft bread entail large scale distribution for most part (75  %) then there are individual traders and retailers, all over Italy. The price list is national, there are discounts and promotions depending on the local market. Production processes allow a long shelf life (over 45  days) without the use of preservatives: at the end of the process the loaves are kept in <b>sterile</b> <b>rooms,</b> without any contamination and with addition of a splash of ethanol (a mild antibacterial). The longer shelf life of the product allows very low levels of waste at the distribution and consumption levels. Differently from what happens to industrial bread production in other countries, this long shelf-life is due to the peculiarity of the Italian bread market: indeed, the Italian consumers normally use industrial bread in the absence of freshly baked bread.|$|R

Autopilot opinions suggesting that the author has donated far too much of her time to media book-gabble and the smokefree backrooms of power." ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} implanting microstimulators to deliver programmed nerve stimulation for sequenced muscle activation to recover arm-hand functions. Design: By using a minimally invasive procedure and local anesthesia, 5 to 7 microstimulators can be safely and comfortably implanted adjacent to targeted radial nerve branches in the arm and forearm of 7 subjects with poststroke paresis. The microstimulators' position should remain stable with no tissue infection and can be programmed to produce effective personalized functional muscle activity with no discomfort for a preliminary 12 -week study. Clinical testing, {{before and after the}} study, is reported in the accompanying study. Setting: Microstimulator implantations in a <b>sterile</b> operating <b>room.</b> Participants: Seven adults, with poststroke hemiparesis of 12 months or more. Intervention: Under local anesthesia, a stimulating probe was inserted to identify radial nerve branches. Microstimulators were inserted by using an introducer and were retrievable for 6 days by attached suture. Each device was powered via a radiofrequency link from 2 external cuff coils connected to a control unit. Main Outcome Measures: To achieve low threshold values at the target sites with minimal implant discomfort. Microstimulators and external equipment were monitored over 12 weeks of exercise. Results: Seven subjects were implanted with 41 microstimulators, 5 to 7 per subject, taking 3. 5 to 6 hours. Implantation pain levels were 20 % more than anticipated. No infections or microstimulator failures occurred. Mean nerve thresholds ranged between 4. 0 to 7. 7 ?coulomb/cm 2 /phase over 90 days, indicating that cathodes were within 2 to 4 mm of target sites. In 1 subject, 2 additional microstimulators were inserted. Conclusions: Microstimulators were safely implanted with no infection or failure. The system was reliable and programmed effectively to perform exercises at home for functional restoration...|$|R
40|$|Aneuploidies are {{the most}} {{frequent}} chromosomal abnormalities in humans. Most of these abnormalities result from meiotic errors during the gametogenic process in the parents. In human males, these errors {{can lead to the}} production of spermatozoa with numerical chromosome abnormalities which represent an increased risk of transmitting these anomalies to the offspring. For this reason, the technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on sperm nuclei has become a protocol widely incorporated in the context of clinical diagnosis. This practice provides an estimate of the frequencies of numerical chromosome abnormalities in the gametes of the patients that seek for genetic reproductive advice. To date, the chromosomes most frequently included in sperm FISH analysis are chromosomes X, Y, 13, 18 and 21. This video-article describes, step by step, how to process and fix a human semen sample, how to decondense and denature the sperm chromatin, how to proceed to obtain sperm FISH preparations, and how to visualize the results at the microscope. Special remarks of the most relevant steps are given to achieve the best results. Protocol I. Sample processing and cell fixation 1. Leave the semen sample in <b>sterile</b> containers at <b>room</b> temperature for 20 minutes until liquefaction. 2. Transfer the sample to a centrifuge tube and spin it at 1000 g for 5 minutes...|$|R
