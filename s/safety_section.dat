The introduction of the Fire Services Act 1947 gave the fire brigade its first responsibilities for fire <b>safety.</b> <b>Section</b> 1 of the Fire Services Act defined the duties of a fire brigade and further went to say under section 1, sub-section 1 paragraph F, commonly referred to as 11(F), that a fire brigade must give advice and assistance on matters of fire prevention if so requested by any person.

In his preface, Bradley, a key member of the Radiological <b>Safety</b> <b>Section</b> at Bikini known as the [...] "Geiger men", asserted that [...] "the accounts of the actual explosions, however well intended, were liberally seasoned with fantasy and superstition, and the results of the tests have remained buried in the vaults of military security."

500|$|The {{detonation}} {{of the two}} {{atomic bombs}} in Japan [...] "raised as many military and medicomilitary questions as they answered". A series of nuclear tests was planned, codenamed Operation Crossroads. Some 42,000 personnel were deployed to Bikini Atoll as part of Admiral William H. P. Blandy's Joint Task Force 1 to conduct the test. Their health and safety was Lyons's responsibility, but the specialised job of radiological safety was handled by the Manhattan Project. Warren, as Chief of the Radiological <b>Safety</b> <b>Section</b> (RADSAFE), planned and implemented measures to assess, limit and control the impact of radiation. Teams were given special training at Oak Ridge {{in the operation of}} instrumentation to measure radioactivity, and the interpretation of their readings. Training was also conducted aboard [...] en route to Bikini Atoll, where it arrived on 12 June 1946. In all, some 3,500 personnel were assigned to RADSAFE. Warren was appalled by the effects of radioactive contamination on the environment. [...] "The deadly range of radioactive products from the atomic bomb has been clearly demonstrated under controlled conditions..." [...] he wrote, [...] "the only defense against atomic bombs still lies outside the scope of science. It is the prevention of atomic war." ...|$|E
