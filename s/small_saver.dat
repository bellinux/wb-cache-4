40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the impact of regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs) on the operations of these institutions in Senegal. The findings suggest that the regulation of MFIs in Senegal brought many benefits, such as improved customers confidence in MFIs and hence increased the mobilization of savings from <b>small</b> <b>savers</b> to MFIs. This reduced the dependence of MFIs on donor agencies for loanable funds as well as it increased the outreach, i. e. the number of families served by MFIs in Senegal. With the increasing credit expansion, however, MFIs also began to report higher loan default rates which required them to charge higher interest rates to compensate for their loan losses. According to the regulations however, the interest rate ceiling on loans does not allow MFIs to adjust their rates to the levels that will give them enough earnings to cover their losses. Furthermore, as the average loan size of MFIs increased, a collateral requirement became essential to borrow from MFIs in Senegal. Extensive disclosure and reporting requirements also created inefficiencies in the operations of MFIs, especially those that were credit and savings associations...|$|R

40|$|Manila If governments tax or {{otherwise}} distort their domestic capital markets, {{the economy is}} said to be financially “repressed. ” 2 Usury restrictions on interest rates, heavy reserve requirements on bank deposits, and compulsory credit allocations interact with ongoing price inflation to reduce the attractiveness of holding claims on the domestic banking system. In such a repressed financial system, real deposit rates of interest on monetary assets are often negative, and are difficult to predict when inflation is high and unstable. Foreign exchange rates also become highly uncertain. Thus, the demand for domestic money [...] broadly defined to include savings and term deposits as well as checking accounts and currency [...] falls as a proportion of GNP. But these monetary assets naturally dominate the financial portfolios of <b>small</b> <b>savers</b> in less developed countries. Thus, back in 1973, Edward Shaw and I hypothesized that repressing the monetary system fragments the domestic capital market with highly adverse consequences for {{the quality and quantity of}} real capital accumulation: (a) The flow of loanable funds through the organized banking system is reduced, forcing potential borrowers to rely more on self finance; (b) Interest rates on the truncated flow of bank lending vary arbitrarily from one class of favored or disfavored borrower to another...|$|R
40|$|Current {{issues in}} banking policy {{range from the}} need to {{construct}} basic institutions and incentive structures in transition economies, to the challenges posed by the increasingly complex interactions involved in contemporary banking. The authors of this report outline the basic regulatory framework needed to reduce bank failures, as shown by recent experience. Theoreticians note that banking increasingly displays network characteristics that may call for corrective action but make policy intervention ineffective or counterproductive. Networks are susceptible to externalities, redundancy, (ensuring that flows cannot be obstructed by blocking just one path), and a tendency to adapt to disturbances in a complex manner. Regulation is justified, but {{the complexity of the}} network makes successful interventions hard to design. Supervision has a role, and the authors outline the basic regulatory measures needed, but the blurring of boundaries between banking {{and the rest of the}} financial network has placed an upper bound on the effectiveness of supervision.

Many of these interest rate ceilings already have been removed. Some economists have suggested that the payment of higher interest rates to depositors has contributed to the high rates of interest in this country over the last fewyears. According to Arenson (1983) in the New York limes, “Economists estimate that the higher cost of bank funds probably has raised the genet-al level of interest rates by about 1 percentage points. ” Bacon (1983), in the Wall Street Journal, quotes Lat~’ence Chimerine of Chase Econometrics as estimating the same effect on long-term real rates of interest. The basic argument is that the phase-out of Regulation Q has raised the interest expense of depository institutions; in response, these institutions have raised the interest rates they chat-ge borrowers.

40|$|An {{important}} decision facing retirement savers {{is how to}} allocate their savings across different assets. The decision includes the choice of how to divide investments between domestic and foreign holdings. This study uses return data for 1927 - 2005 to determine whether cross-border investing in the past would have been advantageous to retirement savers in eight large industrialized countries. By assumption investors can buy mutual fund shares in index funds for stocks and bonds in their home country and in any of seven foreign countries. The mutual funds’ foreign holdings are not hedged to protect investors against currency fluctuations. The paper’s goal is to determine whether workers in the eight countries would have obtained higher expected retirement incomes, with smaller risk of catastrophic investment shortfalls, if they invested part of their retirement savings in foreign stocks and bonds. Consistent with past theoretical and empirical findings, {{the results show that}} workers could have improved expected financial performance by investing in foreign as well as domestic equities. Remarkably, retirement savers in nearly all countries would have obtained higher average pensions with a 100 % foreign allocation than with a 100 % domestic allocation, even if they followed extremely naïve strategies in allocating equity investments across different foreign markets. For retirement savers in most countries, though not the United States, naïve overseas investment strategies would also have reduced the risk of catastrophically poor investment performance. In all countries, retirement savers who selected a global portfolio allocation along the efficient frontier could obtain better average pensions with lower risk of very <b>small</b> pensions than <b>savers</b> who restrict their investments to the domestic stock and bond funds. cross-border investing, foreign stocks, bonds, domestic allocation, equities, investments, foriegn...|$|R
40|$|New {{technologies}} {{create a}} network of complementary producers and consumers around themselves. Researchers have been investigating the effects of such networks on end-users and called them “Network Externalities”. These network externalities are either direct or indirect. There have been no prior researches on negative and indirect consequences of these networks. The aim {{of this paper is}} to observe negative effects of the network on the market from both macro and micro level. Therefore, our main research question is: “Does expansion of network lead to Negative Indirect Network Effects?” The objectives of the present research were to investigate the nature of the network and to acquire more insight into the causes of Negative Indirect Network Effects (NINE) and their impact on network growth, to develop an empirical model for it, and simulate this model in order to have a better understanding of underlying network dynamics. The focus of the present research was on the laptop operation system network. To start with, we reviewed different aspects of this particular network in order to reform a new conceptual model about consumers’ behaviour. Then, we studied three major operating systems (OS) existing in the market today (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux). First, we reconstructed the history of these technologies, their life cycle, network characteristics, network size, and then, we continued with a short history of unwanted complementary products like bugs, viruses, worms, and malware. We surveyed user attitudes for the two main operating systems, Windows vs. Mac OS, and used those insights to make an agent-based simulation derived from our empirical model and mathematical equation. This simulation was applied to different scenarios. Specifically, we found that a network becomes more attractive for unwanted complementary goods when it expands in size. Also, we discovered that an increase in problems for the dominant design will lead to NINE. Importantly, security measures play an important role in the satisfaction of end-users. When users distrust security measures of the dominant technology, they may decide to switch to a <b>smaller</b> and <b>saver</b> network, and create herd behaviour in NINE, leading other end-users or even new consumers to choose for the secondary technology. However, expansion of the secondary design could also attract unwanted actors in its network and same procedure would emerge for the secondary technology as well. Our model is able to explain this recursive S-curve mechanism. Therefore, the present research provides additional understanding for industries to implement dynamic strategies in order concern to NINE. That is, security is important and industries have to be conscious about it and maintain safety measures with the intention of preventing NINE to happen. But also, industries must be aware that end-users should be involved in the feedback process. Management of TechnologyTechnology, Strategy, and EntrepreneurshipTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
