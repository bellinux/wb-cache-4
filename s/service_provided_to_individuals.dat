40|$|Background: Meniere's {{syndrome}} has {{a significant}} impact on the health, wellbeing and quality of life of those individuals diagnosed with this disorder. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the types of health care <b>services</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>individuals</b> with Meniere's syndrome and the roles of the patient, medical specialists and audiologists in its management. Method: 20 patients diagnosed with Meniere's syndrome and 7 health professionals directly involved in diagnosis and management were recruited. Their perspectives were obtained using either semi-structured interviews (for health professionals) or questionnaires (for patients). An assessment of how patients' needs are being met by current practices was undertaken by comparing with 'best practice' chronic illness management practices. Results: Results show that patients with Meniere's syndrome need greater support to achieve high quality of life outcomes. Current care practices do not fully address the patients' needs for support and the key elements of chronic illness management were not evident. Finally, the role of audiologists was not clear across all stakeholders. 12 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|This civic {{republican or}} deliberative {{democratic}} {{conception of the}} good provides both procedural and substantive insights for developing a just allocation of health care resources. Procedurally, it suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be socially guaranteed. Substantively, it suggests services that promote {{the continuation of the}} polity-those that ensure healthy future generations, ensure development of practical reasoning skills, and ensure full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations-are to be socially guaranteed as basic. Conversely, <b>services</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>individuals</b> who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia. A less obvious example is guaranteeing neuropsychological services to ensure children with learning disabilities can read and learn to reason. Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} to elucidate what specific health care services are basic; however, the overlap between liberalism and communitarianism points to a way of introducing the good back into medical ethics and devising a principled way of distinguishing basic from discretionary health care services ...|$|R

ACTIVE COMMUNITIES RESULT from the interaction of many environmental, cultural, political and sociological factors. The design of a transportation system is but one of them. A balanced transportation system—with appropriate levels of investment in bicycle and pedestrian facilities and transit in addition to automobile-oriented facilities—is an indispensable requirement and a catalyst for active communities.

To assess the quality of <b>services</b> <b>provided</b> in hospitals, indicators and performance standards are needed to be identified, because these indicators are the structure of the hospital evaluation. This study aimed to determine the performance indicators in general- public hospitals in area of quality and effectiveness and prioritization of these indicators. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-qualitative and practical research was done through a systematic review of literature and data were obtained from the hospital authorities. In order to prioritize public hospital performance indicators, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used and the results were analyzed by the Expert Choice software. Results: In the field of quality and effectiveness, 73 performance indicators were considering at various texts. Indicators such as the rate of hospital infections (100 %), the incidence of hospital events (72 %), Net hospital mortality(63 %), Percentage of patients' satisfaction(53 %) selected as key performance indicators. Conclusion: Performance indicators in the field of quality and effectiveness has important place in health system and hospital organization.
