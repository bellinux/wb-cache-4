25|$|By {{this time}} the fort was {{virtually}} won, and Menéndez {{turned his attention to}} the vessels anchored in the neighborhood. A number of women and children had been spared and his thoughts turned to how he could rid himself of them. His decision was promptly reached. A trumpeter with a flag of truce was sent to summon <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> ashore from the ships to treat of conditions of surrender. Receiving no response, he sent Jean Francois to the Pearl with the proposal that the French should have a safe-conduct to return to France with the women and children in any one vessel they should select, provided they would surrender their remaining ships and all of their armament.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home to, and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Augusta National {{originated}} with Bobby Jones, {{who wanted to}} build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: [...] "Perfect! [...] And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along and lay a golf course upon it." ...|$|E

Smith believed that there was a special opportunity for game developers, [...] "for <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and tell the stories that people want to know [...] Right now you have four bridges between developer and reader: Developer to PR, to journalist to reader. [...] could get rid of those middle two bridges." ...|$|E
500|$|Vanderbilt {{was drawn}} to the notion that Graysmith went from a {{cartoonist}} {{to one of the most}} significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: [...] "What if Garry Trudeau woke up one morning and tried to solve the Son of Sam"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers were able to get the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward with a crucial bit of information that might help solve this decades-old cold case.|$|E

[...] What they really need is for <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And {{when it comes to}} Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E

500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back into my life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast.

500|$|... "The Other Woman" [...] {{contains}} Jack and Juliet's second kiss. [...] Juliet {{was conceived}} by the writers {{as the next}} possible love interest for Jack {{after the death of}} the second season character Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez). [...] Fans hated Ana Lucia so the writers did not pursue the romantic story arc. [...] Mitchell guesses that her character was created because [...] "they needed a bridge between Ben and everyone else, and they needed <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and be a little salt in the oyster of Jack and Kate." [...] She believes that Juliet did genuinely fall in love with Jack, but not knowing whether [...] "her attraction to Jack or her willingness to do anything to get off the island" [...] is more important to her. [...] Juliet forms something of a [...] "love rectangle" [...] with Jack, Kate and Sawyer. [...] Mitchell [...] "feel like [...] a very grown-up relationship. [...] They seem to really respect and like each other", whereas Sawyer and Kate are like [...] "rambunctious teenagers". [...] The couple has gained an Internet fandom and been given the portmanteau nickname [...] "Jacket".|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Hans is a little Dutch boy, {{the son of a}} poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed {{with the fact that the}} safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he sticks his tiny finger in the hole, and waits for <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lambert {{oversaw the}} first two seasons of the programme, {{eventually}} leaving in 1965. [...] "There {{comes a time when}} a series needs new input," [...] she told Doctor Who Magazine thirty years later. [...] "It's not that I wasn't fond of Doctor Who, I simply felt that the time had come. It had been eighteen very concentrated months, something like seventy shows. I know people do soaps forever now, but I felt Doctor Who needed <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in with a different view." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in to {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going}} to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
