2500|$|Roach was {{not content}} with the {{existing}} plant however. Like his early mentor James P. Allaire, Roach envisaged a vertically integrated shipbuilding empire stretching from control of the raw materials to the finished ships. Accordingly, he established his own iron mill, the Chester Rolling Mill, {{for the production of}} iron plates, beams and other parts for his ships. The Mill, located on a [...] lot upriver from the shipyard, began production in July 1875, and had an annual output of 700 tons of pig iron and 300 tons of <b>ship</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Later printed works {{attributed}} to Henry Michelot were published {{until the early}} 19th century. These publications include1- A volume of sailing directions for the Mediterranean sea:"The Mediterranean Pilot, being an exact account of the Coasts of Spain. Provence, Italy, and the Islands of Majorca, Minorca, Corsica, Sicily &c..." [...] (1705)2- A small sea atlas with 37 charts of key Mediterranean harbors:"Recüeil de Plusieurs Plans des Ports et Rades de la Mer Mediterranée"3- A large format sea atlas of the Mediterranean with 17 charts and typically one or more <b>ship</b> <b>plate</b> engravings including a French oared galley: [...] "Recueil de plans et ports de la Méditerranée." ...|$|E
50|$|The Chester Rolling Mill was {{established}} {{on the site}} of an old bridge and steel works at the foot of Wilson and Hayes Sts., Chester, incorporating the area between Townsend to Highland Ave., and from Front St. to the Delaware River. Construction of the main rolling mill, a building with dimensions of 160 x 185 feet, began in 1875. In 1879, the building was doubled in size, from 160 to 320 feet. Initial output was 700 tons of pig iron and 300 tons of iron <b>ship</b> <b>plate.</b> Pig iron, beams, and hull and boiler plates were produced both for Roach's main shipyard in Chester and for his other shipbuilding facility, the Morgan Iron Works in New York City.|$|E

50|$|As {{many of the}} <b>ship's</b> <b>plates</b> {{and ribs}} remain intact, lobster and conger eel {{can be found at}} the wreck, whilst large shoals of Bib and Pollack can also be found at the site. It also holds a large {{population}} of Tom Pot Blennies and both edible and spider crabs. Apart from being a popular diving site, local fishermen are also fond of the spot, and the wreck holds a collection of discarded pots and fishing tackle.|$|R
50|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Mill, Roach was able to introduce a number of innovations into the industry which reduced time and cut costs. To begin with, he rejected the standard <b>ship</b> <b>plate</b> size of 12 x 4 feet (48 squ. ft) and rolled larger plates of 14 x 5 ft (70 squ. ft). This simple innovation reduced the time spent in planing, punching and chipping plates by 40%, reduced handling times, and had the added advantage of producing a stronger ship with fewer butts to strain. Roach also endeavoured as far as possible to roll plates to their finished dimensions, saving time which other companies spent on reworking plates at the shipyard.|$|E
50|$|In 1880, Roach {{embarked}} on a substantial upgrade of the mill's facilities. A second blast furnace was constructed above the original rolling mill, along with new buildings covering about 1¼ acres, including a new 90 x 140 ft steelworks. The new furnace commenced production on November 1, 1881. In order {{to pay for the}} expansion, the firm was recapitalized at $600,000. By this time, the Mill included two puddling mills with 11 furnaces and a total output of 50 tons per day, a mill for boiler and <b>ship</b> <b>plate</b> with a capacity of 45 tons per day, and a mill for angle, beam and skelp iron with a daily capacity of 35 tons. Included in the above were two large gas-operated furnaces and a mill which could produce plates from ⅛ to 6 inch thickness and 27 feet wide. Roach's milling machines incorporated both vertical and horizontal rollers which allowed plates to be finished with parallel edges, eliminating the necessity of shearing ragged edges to size. Some of the new machinery was capable of rolling steel as well as iron ingots.|$|E
50|$|Before about 1860 steel was an {{expensive}} product, made in small quantities and used mostly for swords, tools and cutlery; all large metal structures {{were made of}} wrought or cast iron. Steelmaking was centered in Sheffield, Britain, which supplied the European and the American markets. The introduction of cheap steel {{was due to the}} Bessemer and the open hearth processes, two technological advances made in England. In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron is converted to steel by blowing air through it after it was removed from the furnace. The air blast burned the carbon and silicon out of the pig iron, releasing heat and causing the temperature of the molten metal to rise. Henry Bessemer demonstrated the process in 1856 and had a successful operation going by 1864. By 1870 Bessemer steel was widely used for <b>ship</b> <b>plate.</b> By the 1850s, the speed, weight, and quantity of railway traffic was limited by the strength of the wrought iron rails in use. The solution was to turn to steel rails, which the Bessemer process made competitive in price. Experience quickly proved steel had much greater strength and durability and could handle the increasingly heavy and faster engines and cars.|$|E
50|$|High tensile steel {{was used}} for the <b>ship's</b> <b>plating,</b> as opposed to the more {{conventional}} mild steel. This allowed a reduction in plate thickness, reducing weight but still providing 26 per cent greater strength than otherwise. Plates were held together by triple rows of rivets. The ship was heated and cooled throughout by a thermo-tank ventilation system, which used steam driven heat exchangers to warm air to a constant 65 F, while steam was injected into the airflow to maintain steady humidity.|$|R

50|$|Finally on 13 December the Master and Drummond {{inspected}} the Number One hold.

With the motion of the <b>ship,</b> <b>plates</b> and frames were moving past each other and friction was heating the metal.

40|$|Today in {{maritime}} industry, it is {{a mandatory}} task {{to compute the}} ultimate strength of structural components and their system for structural design and strength assessment based on ultimate limit states. Increasing the number of ship failure because of structural incapable to support the load have gain the motivation and interest to study the ultimate strength of the ship’s structure. One of the reason of ship structural failure mainly because of ship’s plate corrosion. Through this thesis, the study have found out that decreasing thickness of the plate due to ship’s plate corrosion will decrease the critical load of the ship’s plate itself. The study concern about compressive uni-axial loading on the ship’s plate which resulting linear and nonlinear buckling effect. The critical load of the ship’s plate structure is study using method eigenvalue linear buckling analysis by ABAQUS Finite Element Software packaged.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} work, a three-dimensional Cellular Automata Finite Element (CAFE) multi-scale model was developed to simulate, ductile fracture, cleavage and the ductile-brittle transition in a structural steel. For the simulation of the ductile-brittle fracture, at least two Cellular Automata arrays are needed, one to represent the ductile material properties {{and the other one}} to account for the brittle fracture process. The cell sizes in both arrays are independent of each other and of the finite element size. The cell sizes in each Cellular Automata array are related to the microstructural process of each fracture mechanism. The finite elements size is chosen to represent the macro strain gradients accurately. The model was implemented through the user define material behavior subroutine VUMAT in the finite element program ABAQUS Explicit Version 5. 6. In the CAFE model, the material information is moved from the structural response of finite elements and stored in the appropriated number of Cellular Automata (CA) arrays. In the present CAFE model, the Rousselier ductile damage model was applied to each ductile cell. The critical value of the maximum principal stress was used to assess the failure of each brittle cell. In the brittle CA arrays, four different cleavage fracture nucleation micromechanisms, found experimentally at te. st temperatures down to - 196 øC in a ferritic-pearlitic Grade A <b>ship</b> <b>plate</b> steel were included in the model. This was done in order to simulate the real microfeatures nucleating cleavage in ferritic steels. In this model, the physical damage parameters of the ductile and brittle parts were calibrated separately. After calibration the CAFE model simulated the experimentally measured distribution of brittle microcracks generated in the notch region of blunt four point double-notch bend tests performed at test temperatures from 25 øC to - 196 øC. The ductile part of the CAFE model was calibrated with the simulation of tensile and impact Charpy tests performed at room temperature. Subsequently the model was applied to simulate the ductile-brittle transition of Grade A <b>ship</b> <b>plate</b> steel. When numerical against experimental data was obtained, the parameters were considered true material model parameters of the steel under analysis.
