50|$|The galaxy has a counterrotating {{extended}} gas disk, {{which was}} possibly formed by a galaxy merger of accretion of gas with oppositely directed angular momentum. The disk has low velocity dispersion throughout, which suggests it has settled into equilibrium. The gas is found primarily in two rings. The inner appears almost circular in HI imaging, which may {{mean it is}} inclined ∼20° or more {{with respect to the}} stellar disk, whereas the outer ring has approximately the same ellipticity with the stellar disk. The stellar disk is symmetric and there are evidence of weak spiral arms outside the primary bar. In the infrared Ks-band, the bar has ansae-type morphology and in the inner elliptical there is an inner disc showing two-armed spirals.

40|$|Under certain conditions, sub-kpc nuclear bars form inside {{large-scale}} stellar bars of disk galaxies. These <b>secondary</b> <b>bars</b> spend {{a fraction}} of their lifetime in a dynamically-decoupled state, tumbling in the gravitational field of the outer bars. We analyze the flow pattern in such nested bar systems and find that <b>secondary</b> <b>bars</b> differ fundamentally from their large-scale counterparts. In particular the gas flow across the bar-bar interface in these systems can be more chaotic or more regular in nature, and, contrary to predictions, has no difficulty in penetrating the <b>secondary</b> <b>bars.</b> The outer parts of both short and long nuclear bars (with respect to their corotation) appear to be depopulated of gas, while deep inside them the flow exhibits low Mach numbers and follows ovally-shaped orbits with little dissipation. We find that gas-dominated and star-dominated nuclear bars avoid the bar-bar interface, making both types of bars short relative to their corotation. Furthermore, our earlier work has shown that dynamically-coupled <b>secondary</b> <b>bars</b> exhibit a similarly relaxed low-dissipation flow as well. Therefore, no large-scale shocks form in the nuclear bars, and consequently, no offset dust lanes are expected there.

40|$|Double-barred galaxies {{account for}} almost {{one third of}} all barred galaxies, {{suggesting}} that secondary stellar bars, which are embedded in large-scale primary bars, are long-lived structures. However, up to now it has been hard to self-consistently simulate a disc galaxy that sustains two nested stellar bars for longer than a few rotation periods. N-body/hydrodynamical simulations including star formation recipes have been performed. Their properties have been compared with the most recent observational data {{in order to prove}} that they are representative of double-barred galaxies, even SB 0. Overlaps in dynamical resonances and bar modes have been looked for using Fourier spectrograms. Double-barred galaxies have been successfully simulated with lifetimes as long as 7 Gyr. The stellar population of the <b>secondary</b> <b>bar</b> is younger on average than for the primary large-scale bar. An important feature of these simulations is the absence of any resonance overlap for several Gyr. In particular, there is no overlap between the primary bar ILR and the <b>secondary</b> <b>bar</b> corotation. Therefore, mode coupling cannot sustain the <b>secondary</b> <b>bar</b> mode. Star formation is identified here as possibly being responsible for bringing energy to the nuclear mode. Star formation is also responsible for limiting the amount of gas in the central region which prevents the orbits sustaining the <b>secondary</b> <b>bar</b> from being destroyed. Therefore, the <b>secondary</b> <b>bar</b> can dissolve but reappear after approx. 1 Gyr. When star formation is switched off the dynamical perturbation associated with the <b>secondary</b> <b>bar</b> needs several Gyr to fully vanish. Double-bars can be long-lived in numerical simulations with a gaseous component, {{even in the absence of}} overlap of resonances or mode coupling, provided that star formation remains active in the central region where the nuclear bar lies.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{analysis}} of morphological and photometric properties of a sample of isolated spirals with (18) and without (11) an active nucleus, based on near-infrared imaging in the J and K' bands. The aim of this analysis {{is to find the}} differential properties that could be directly connected with the phenomenon of nuclear activity. We stress the importance of using isolated objects for that purpose. Our study shows that both sets of galaxies are similar in their global properties: they define the same Kormendy relation, their disk components share the same properties, the bulge and disk scale lengths are correlated in a similar way, bar strengths and lengths are similar for primary bars. Hosts of isolated Seyfert galaxies have bulge and disk properties comparable to those of isolated non active spirals. Central colors (the innermost 200 pc) of active galaxies are redder than the centers of non active spirals, most probably due to AGN light being re-emitted by the hot dust and/or due to circumnuclear star formation, through the contribution of giants/supergiants. Only one of the Seyfert galaxies in our sample does not present a primary bar,but both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>bars</b> are equally present in active and control objects.

40|$|Abstract. Inner {{regions of}} barred disk galaxies often include asymmetrical, {{small-scale}} central features, {{some of which}} are best described as secondary bars. Because orbital timescales in the galaxy center are short, secondary bars are likely to be dynamically decoupled from the main kiloparsec-scale bars.

Stars trapped around these orbits could form the building blocks for a long-lived, doubly-barred galaxy.
