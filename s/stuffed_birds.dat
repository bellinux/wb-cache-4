The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Birding in North America {{was focused}} {{in the early}} and mid-20th century in the eastern seaboard region, and was {{influenced}} by the works of Ludlow Griscom and later Roger Tory Peterson. Bird Neighbors (1897) by Neltje Blanchan was an early birding book which sold over 250,000 copies. It was illustrated with color photographs of <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|E
25|$|John Enoch Powell {{was born}} in Stechford, Birmingham, on 16 June 1912. He lived there {{for the first six}} years of his life before his parents moved to Kings Norton in 1918, where he lived until 1930. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell (1872–1956), a primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary (1886–1953). Ellen was the {{daughter}} of Henry Breese, a Liverpool policeman and his wife Eliza, who had given up her own teaching career after marrying. His mother did not like his name, and as a child he was known as 'Jack'. At the age of three, Powell was nicknamed 'the Professor' because he used to stand on a chair and describe the <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> his grandfather had shot, which were displayed in his parents' home.|$|E

25|$|The Crow wore {{clothing}} {{distinguished by}} gender. Women wore dresses made of deer and buffalo hide, decorated with elk teeth or shells. They covered their legs with leggings during winter and their feet with moccasins. Crow women wore their hair in two braids. Male clothing usually {{consisted of a}} shirt, trimmed leggings with a belt, a long breechcloth, and moccasins. Robes made from the furred hide of a bison were often worn in winter. Leggings were either made of animal hide which the Crow made for themselves or made of wool which were highly valued trade items made specifically for Indians in Europe. Their hair was worn long, in some cases reaching the ground. The Crow are famous for often wearing their hair in a pompadour which was often coloured white with paint. Crow men were notable for wearing two hair pipes made from beads {{on both sides of}} their hair. Men often wore their hair in two braids wrapped in the fur of beavers or otters. Bear grease was used to give shine to hair. <b>Stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> were often worn in the hair of warriors and medicine men. Like other plains Indians the Crow wore feathers from eagles, crows, owls, and other birds in their hair for symbolic reasons. The Crow wore a variety of headdresses including the famous eagle feather headdress, bison scalp headdress with horns and beaded rim, and split horn headdress. The split horn headdress is made from a single bison horn split in half and polished into two nearly identical horns which were attached to a leather cap and decorated with feathers and beadwork. Traditional clothing worn by the Crow is still worn today with varying degrees of regularity.|$|E
500|$|Marion is {{deprived}} of [...] "the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among Psychos secondary characters {{a lack of}} [...] "familial warmth and stability", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an [...] "increasingly connubial" [...] relationship, a development that Marion is denied. Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has [...] "an infantile and divided personality" [...] and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> that are [...] "frozen in time" [...] and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions {{to move from the}} past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put ...|$|E
2500|$|Huge, broad-brimmed hats {{were worn}} in mid-decade, trimmed with masses of {{feathers}} and occasionally complete <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> (male hummingbirds {{for those who}} could afford them), or decorated with ribbons and artificial flowers.

2500|$|In New York City, however, Chase {{became known}} for his flamboyance, {{especially}} in his dress, his manners, {{and most of all}} in his studio. At Tenth Street, Chase had moved into Albert Bierstadt's old studio and had decorated it as an extension of his own art. [...] Chase filled the studio with lavish furniture, decorative objects, <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds,</b> oriental carpets, and exotic musical instruments. The studio served as a focal point for the sophisticated and fashionable members of the New York City art world of the late 19th century. By 1895 the cost of maintaining the studio, in addition to his other residences, forced Chase to close it and auction the contents.|$|E

60|$|This, and Mr. Rivers's civil answer, made Norman so hot, {{that he did}} {{not notice}} much in passing through a hall full of {{beautiful}} vases, <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds,</b> busts, etc., tastefully arranged, and he did not look up till they were entering a handsome dining-room, where a small square table was laid out for luncheon near a noble fire.|$|E
5|$|A study, using <b>stuffed</b> <b>bird</b> models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|R

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} they were again on the road, the farmer making no attempt to follow them, but {{determined}} in his mind to drive over {{the next morning to}} Deal to take out a summons against them for trespass and assault.

He determined upon his return to carry some of his cases of <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> down to a shop in the town, and he felt sure that he could get enough for these to pay for any damage which could have been inflicted, with a fine for trespassing, for he had seen <b>stuffed</b> <b>birds</b> exposed in the windows for sale, which were, he was sure, very inferior to his own both in execution and lifelike interest.|$|E
