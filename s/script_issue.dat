40|$|The {{advent of}} {{technology}} has facilitated {{the development of}} networked systems of extremely small, low power devices that combine programmable general purpose computing with multiple sensing and wireless communication capability. This networked system of programmable sensor nodes, together form a sensor network, poses unique challenges on how information collected by and stored within the sensor network could be queried and accessed, and how concurrent sensing tasks could be executed internally and programmed by external users. In this paper, we describe a sensor information networking architecture, called SINA, that facilitates querying, monitoring, and tasking of sensor networks. We model a sensor network {{as a collection of}} massively distributed objects, and SINA plays the role of a middleware that facilitates adaptive organization of sensor information. The SINA kernel provides a set of configuration and communication primitives that enable scalable, robust, and energy-efficient organization of and interactions among sensor objects. On top the SINA kernel is a programmable substrate that follows the spreadsheet paradigm and provides mechanisms to create associations among sensor nodes. Users then access information within a sensor network using declarative queries and perform tasks using programmable <b>scripts.</b> <b>Issues</b> concerning interworking between stationary sensor networks and mobile nodes will also be addressed...|$|R
