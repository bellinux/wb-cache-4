40|$|ABSTRACT: Soil {{grouting}} {{has become}} a popular method for soil improvement in recent years. Grouting is generally intended to increase a soil’s strength, increase its liquefaction resistance, or reduce its hydraulic conductivity. Soil grouting involves the injection, permeation, or me-chanical mixing of cementitious, silica, or clay grout into a soil deposit. With the increase in popularity of these methods comes the issue of testing grouted soils to verify the expected soil improvement. While some of the methods and materials mentioned result in soils that are sufficiently cemented to produce trimmable specimens that can stand under their own weight, other methods produce softer materials that {{are very difficult to}} sample or even to recreate and test in the lab. Preparing such soft samples in the laboratory poses two challenges: 1) if the specimen is prepared in the triaxial cell directly, the grouting process might not be feasible because of the porous stones and small diameter tubing in the triaxial cell; and 2) if the specimens are prepared outside the triaxial cell, soft specimens {{might not be able to}} stand under their own weight without significant strains and damage to the soil structure. This paper will thoroughly describe a three-way <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> specifically designed to accommodate the per-meation and testing of soils that are too soft or too weak to be easily sampled or tested in the lab. A simple procedure outlining the use of this three-way <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> will also be described. Finally, the results from a series of consolidated undrained, monotonically loaded triaxial tests will be presented as an example of the <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> application. These tests utilized the new three-way <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> for sample preparation of loose Ottawa sand permeated with a thixotropic bentonite suspension...|$|R
30|$|Soil {{specimens}} used in {{this study}} were of 71  mm in diameter and 142  mm in height. In moist tamping method the soil structure is homogenous. So the specimens were formed by using moist tamping method in a <b>split</b> <b>mold.</b> Firstly, desire amount of dry sample was taken and 10 % of water (percent of dry weight of soil) was mixed. Afterwards, the moist soil was divided (by weight) into target number of layers. Then each weighted moist soil sample was poured into the <b>split</b> <b>mold</b> and compacted. Number of layers and blows per layer were determined by trial to achieve target relative density. The weight of hammer was 1  kg and had a drop height of 150  mm. In order to obtain a uniform density throughout the specimen, the compaction method of specimen preparation suggested by Ladd [34] was followed.|$|R
