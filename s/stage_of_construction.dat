5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:42a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot high stack, {{consisting of}} about 5000logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58students and former students {{working on the}} stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{has been}} {{expanding}} its highway system since 1985, when voters passed Proposition 300, which established a half-cent general sales tax to fund new urban freeways that were {{currently in the}} Regional Transportation Plan. At the time, this included the unbuilt or partially unbuilt: Sky Harbor Expressway, I-10, Route 51, Route 143, Loop 101, and Loop 202. Most of these were completed by 2005, with Loop 202 being in the final <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} of the Patriarchal Cathedral is considered by scholars to have been built in two stages. The first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{was carried out in}} the late 11th century or the 12th century. The cathedral was initially built as a monastery church {{in the middle of a}} monastery compound, though in the early 12th century it was already the seat of the Bulgarian patriarch. The compound suffered large-scale damage caused by a fire, which necessitated the church's reconstruction in middle of the 14th century, perhaps during the rule of Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria (r. 1331–71). Besides repair and reinforcement efforts, work on the church in the 14th century also included the construction of the exonarthex and the bell tower.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{is being}} {{undertaken}} {{as part of}} the NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern section will be grade separated, and a dual carriageway will be constructed from the Northern end of Tonkin Highway near Reid Highway, past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a new part of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both the state and federal governments. Construction began in June 2017, and is scheduled to finish mid 2019.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1944, another typhus {{epidemic}} occurred {{amongst the}} prisoners. Because {{the front line of}} the war was approaching, evacuation of the camps began in February1945, however in a few places work might have been conducted even at the end of April. Some prisoners were left behind, mostly badly ill, until the Red Army arrived in the area in May1945. Project Riese was abandoned at the initial <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> and only 9km (25,000m2, 100,000m3) of tunnels were dug out.|$|E

25|$|The French began {{building}} their line quickly, and finished construction in 1895, while the British worked slowly. At {{the time of}} the Beirut–Damascus line's inception, Pilling's company only managed to build a special port in Haifa to aid in the line's construction. Eight kilometers of standard gauge railroad were laid, between Haifa and Yagur, and a 20km dike was created for the next <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> Due to the competition from the French railway in Beirut, the port of Haifa became less attractive to international traders and that, coupled with strife within the Syria Ottoman Railway Company, caused Pilling to go bankrupt and lose the permit for the railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} centers {{were always}} built to be visible. The pyramids {{were meant to}} {{stand out from the}} rest of the city, to represent its gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All of the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters. Stelae were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.|$|E
25|$|The Church of St Nicholas is {{generally}} dated {{to the late}} 12th century, a time when Melnik was ruled by both Byzantium and the Second Bulgarian Empire. There is a single opinion which links {{the building of the}} church with the rule of Prince Boris I of Bulgaria (r. 852–889) and the period shortly after the Christianization of Bulgaria, though the evidence for this is not accepted by most scholars. A second <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> followed {{in the first half of}} the 13th century, when the Church of St Nicholas was elevated to the seat of a bishop. In order for the church to better fulfil that purpose, a fence and additional buildings were constructed around it to form a compound.|$|E

25|$|The {{lower level}} of the Cave 6 likely was the {{earliest}} excavation in the second <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b> This stage marked the Mahayana theme and Vakataka renaissance period of Ajanta reconstruction that started about four centuries after the earlier Hinayana theme construction. The upper storey was not envisioned in the beginning, it was added as an after thought, likely around {{the time when the}} architects and artists abandoned further work on the geologically-flawed rock of Cave 5 immediately next to it. Both lower and upper Cave 6 show crude experimentation and construction errors. The cave work was most likely in progress between 460 and 470 CE, and it is the first that shows attendant Bodhisattvas. The upper cave construction probably began in 465, progressed swiftly, and much deeper into the rock than the lower level.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{began in}} 1906 and took {{four years to}} complete. This {{included}} the chancel, sanctuary and ambulatory, the quire and its aisles, the transepts and crossing, the Lady Chapel to the liturgical north of the quire, the double aisles and the first bay of the nave. This stage was consecrated in October 1910, but consecration of the full building (like construction) has been achieved in stages. After the Second World War money {{was raised in the}} hope of completing the cathedral as a war memorial. In 1947, Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein laid a foundation stone for a further two bays of the nave, but construction ceased after the laying of the foundations until 1965 when the second stage was commenced. Work on the second stage proceeded for a further four years and consisted of the laying of foundations for the extensions, a two bay extension to the nave and demolition and removal of the temporary west wall.|$|E

500|$|The 3-inch plating on {{the main}} deck was added at a very late <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> and the four aftermost 5.5-inch guns and their {{ammunition}} hoists were removed in partial compensation. Live firing trials with the new 15-inch APC (armour-piercing, capped) shell against a mock-up of Hood showed that this shell could penetrate the ship's vitals via the 7-inch middle belt and the 2-inch slope of the main deck. A proposal was made to increase the armour over the forward magazines to 5inches and 6inches over the rear magazines in July 1919 {{in response to these}} trials.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of any land {{transportation}} route to the dam site, the first <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> would have involved the building of a temporary road from Eureka, about [...] away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site. A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, powerhouse, and other structures. Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the cofferdams needed to clear the Yukon River streambed for construction. Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.|$|E
500|$|The second <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries, {{when the}} tower {{was under the}} charge of the Vatican librarian, {{involved}} Mgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii, a clergyman of St. Peter's Basilica. Earlier in 1797, Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription Specula Vaticana {{at the entrance to}} the upper part of the tower, which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower's observatory. The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI. Its instrumentation, apart from many normal devices (such as meteorological and magnetic equipment, with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock,) was noted for the Dolland Telescope. The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse, appearance of comets, Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury’s transit. As an addition, under the patronage of Pope Pius X, four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the [...] long fortification walls, more than a thousand years old.|$|E
