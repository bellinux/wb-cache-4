The baths contain zinc sulfate and chloride to the maximum solubility level. Boric acid {{may be used as}} a pH buffer and to reduce the burning effect at high current densities.

40|$|Fast {{disintegrating}} tablets of Verapamil Hydrochloride {{were designed}} to achieve increased absorption as well as quick onset of pharmacological action of the active ingredient {{with a view to}} enhance patient compliance by effervescent method. Different combinations and ratios of sodium bicarbonate, anhydrous citric acid, sodium starch glycolate, Micro-crystalline cellulose (MCC) and lactose were used in order to get optimum result. The prepared formulations were evaluated for hardness, friability, thickness, diameter, taste of the solution to be administered and in-vitro dispersion time. The acceptable dispersion time was achieved by using a combination of citric acid and sodium bi carbonate in the same amount along with sodium starch glycolate, micro-crystalline cellulose (MCC) & lactose. Acceptable taste of the solution to be administered was obtained with a combination of sucrose, aspartame and <b>sodium</b> <b>saccharine...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of 2 high {{intensity}} <b>sodium</b> <b>saccharine</b> based sweeteners on individual feed intake characteristics and performance of group-housed weaned pigs, 198 26 -d-old weanling pigs were given ad libitum access to 3 dietary treatments: containing no additional sweetener (Control), 150 mg sweetener (C- 150; SUCRAM C- 150) /kg, or 150 mg sweetener (3 D; SUCRAM 3 D) /kg. At weaning, piglets were allocated to 18 pens (11 pigs/pen) based on BW, gender, and ancestry, and pens {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 treatments with 6 pens per treatment. The pens were equipped with computerized feeding stations. During the first 12 d, pigs were offered pelleted prestarter diets that were replaced at once by pelleted starter diets for the last 7 d of the 19 -d experimental period. The individual feed intake characteristics consisting of latency time (interval between weaning and first feed intake), initial feed intake (intake during the first 24 h following the first feed intake), the number of total visits per d, and the number of visits, in which feed was consumed, together with the time and the feed intake per visit were determined for all piglets. Performance traits and fecal consistency were determined per pen for d 0 to 5, d 5 to 12, and d 12 to 19, {{as well as for the}} total period (d 0 to 19). The initiation of feed intake was not affected by the addition of high intensity sweeteners to the diet. From 12 d post-weaning, dietary sweeteners caused the piglets to focus more on feed intake and less on exploratory behavior, as shown by the increased percentage of visits with feed intake in pigs fed the 3 D diet compared with those fed the Control diet (P = 0. 002). The overall daily feed intake increased with time, but was not affected by the addition of sweeteners. Nevertheless, dietary sweeteners prevented the depression of feed intake on d 8 and 10 post-weaning (d 8, P = 0. 013; d 10, P = 0. 014), which seemed to coincide with an improved fecal consistency score (d 5 to 12, P = 0. 11; d 12 to 19, P < 0. 001). However, the changes in feed intake characteristics and fecal consistency only resulted in numerical effects on post-weaning pig performance (ADFI, P = 0. 126; ADG, P = 0. 140). The results of the present study indicate that weanling pigs need a certain period of time before clear effects of dietary sweeteners on individual feed intake characteristics and pig performance can be observed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{undertaken}} {{project was}} to formulate crosslink polyacrilic resin based, technologically optimised, melt-in-mouth tablet (MIMT) containing 5 mg of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride that was intended todisintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity so as to form a stabilised dispersion and possessing adequate physicochemical stability. Different grades of crosslink polyacrilic resin were utilised to prepare MIMTs; employing complexation technique; and using additives like Mannitol DC, Ac-di-sol, Avicel-pH 112, Tusil pinapple, <b>Saccharine</b> <b>sodium,</b> Aerosil and Magnesium stearate. MIMTs were evaluated for compliance to pharmacopoeial specifications. From in-vitro dissolution profile plot, values for the kinetic constant and the regression coefficient of model-dependent approaches were determined {{to find the best}} fit release kinetic model while from in-vitro dissolution profile data the difference factor, the similarity factor and the indices of rescigno of model-independent approaches were determined for comparing pair of in-vitro dissolution profiles. MIMTs of levocetirizine was successfully developed complying pharmacopoeial specifications, with adequate stabilityat room temperature...|$|R
40|$|We {{focussed}} here {{on cultural}} habits and taste perception. In particular, we studied {{the impact of}} food habits on taste perception, identification, and appreciation. Previous work suggested that human populations leaving in extreme condition, poor in basic nutriments present a higher sensitivity for sweet and nutritive molecules. We are interested in evaluating whether such an influence of environment on gustatory sensitivity can be generalized to other situations. In this study we have compared sensitivity, identification and hedonic appreciation to <b>saccharine,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride, quinine chlorhydrate and tartaric acid in a North (Hanoi) and a South (Ho Chi Minh) Vietnamese population. A survey {{carried out by the}} Centre for International Economics indicates that North Vietnamese population consumes less sugar and sweet food products than South Vietnamese population. This difference in food habit might have an impact on gustatory sensitivity and food preferences. Seventy North and seventy South Vietnamese participants were invited to taste twelve taste strips impregnated with three increasing solution of <b>saccharine,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride, quinine chlorhydrate and tartaric acid. For each taste strips participants had to evaluate 1) whether they perceived something, and if they did, 2) to indicate the perceived intensity, 3) to give their hedonic appreciation and 4) to identify the taste sensation. Results on saccharine revealed that North Vietnamese participants tended to perceived a sensation with the lowest concentrations more often than South Vietnamese participants. Concerning the salty taste strips, North Vietnamese participants perceived the two higher concentrations as significantly less intense than South Vietnamese participants and tended to give a higher hedonic score to the intermediate one. Concerning the bitter taste strips, North Vietnamese participants gave a significantly higher hedonic score for the two lower concentrations than South Vietnamese participants and tended to prefer also the higher one, without clear trend on perceived intensity. Finally, it appeared that North Vietnamese participants tended to prefer the lower and the higher concentrated sour taste strips than South Vietnamese participants. These results confirm that participants coming from the same country but with specific food habits could differ on their taste perception. It appears also that the difference on sweet food consumption seems not correlated with the sugar perception but perhaps more with the bitter sensation rejection...|$|R
