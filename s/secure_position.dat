Although Priestley was reluctant to sacrifice his ministry, he accepted the position, resigning from Mill Hill Chapel on 20 December 1772, and preaching his last sermon on 16 May 1773.|$|E

Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E

A devout Buddhist, she donated money to temples in Suruga Province, where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu, first in Hamamatsu Castle and later in Sunpu Castle. As she was quite near-sighted, she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support. Lady Saigō died at a fairly young age, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Although murder was suspected, no culprit was identified.|$|E

His team dropped the next two games, both scoreless losses to Penn and Yale, but finished the month with a win. The {{second half of the}} season went much better, with Wurtenburg leading his squad to a 3–1 record, including a 42–0 total score against conference opponents. The team ended the season with a 5–2–1 record and a second consecutive conference championship. Wurtenburg retained his coaching position the next season, beginning the year with a blowout of Phillips Exeter, which was followed by three consecutive shutout losses. The team turned the season around in November, defeating Amherst and Williams by a combined score of 106–0 for a third consecutive championship. He ended the season with a 4–3 record and a <b>secure</b> <b>position</b> as the coach for the next year.|$|E
5|$|Second, Frederick's {{most egregious}} mistake was {{his refusal to}} {{consider}} the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not move across the river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon's cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, {{they did not have}} enough water, and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his <b>secure</b> <b>position,</b> though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick's much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against entrenched positions.|$|E

Specifically, our system is composed of a <b>secure</b> <b>positioning</b> infrastructure to obtain reliable location information of an entity and a location verification architecture that allows others to be convinced of certain location properties of such an entity. The proposed system enables the verification of location claims in a privacy-preserving manner, thus enhancing existing security solutions and supporting future location-based applications. I...|$|R

5|$|The Spanish and Dutch armies spent 16 {{more days}} observing {{each other from}} their encampments, but no action of {{importance}} ensued. Maurice of Nassau laid a bridge over the Rhine and tried to take Meurs by surprise, but the enterprise was discovered. He also committed Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg to intercept five Spanish companies sent by Mondragón to lodge in Twente, but the Spaniards managed to reach Enschede, leaving only a few chariots with supplies in Dutch hands. On 11 October, lacking of forage, Mondragón retired back to Brabant. Maurice aimed to cut off his retreat, but the Spaniard succeeded in bringing his troops to a <b>secure</b> <b>position.</b> Mondragón re-crossed the Meuse in November and distributed his troops in different towns. Before crossing the river the Swiss mercenaries were paid and liscended. On 4 January 1596, the elderly general died in the citadel of Antwerp.

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{enable a}} wealth of new applications {{in areas such as}} military, medical, environmental, transportation, smart city, and so on. In many of these scenarios, we need to measure in a <b>secure</b> way the <b>positions</b> of the sensors. Existing range-based techniques for <b>secure</b> <b>positioning</b> require a burdensome infrastructure, with many fixed anchors. Reducing the infrastructure would reduce deployment cost and foster the adoption of <b>secure</b> <b>positioning</b> solutions in wireless sensor networks. In this article, we propose SPEM, a <b>secure</b> <b>positioning</b> system based on multilateration and ultra-wideband (UWB) distance bounding protocols. The key idea behind SPEM is to leverage the low probability that an adversary has of controlling enlargement attacks against UWB. We estimate such a probability by a thorough study and signal-level simulations of the UWB physical layer. We test SPEM both in a simulated environment and in a real indoor environment using real UWB transceivers. We show that SPEM needs far less infrastructure than state-of-the-art solutions (- 22 % to - 93 %, depending on the anchor deployment method), while achieving high levels of security against smart and determined adversaries...|$|R

25|$|Suda's {{first job}} at Human was as {{scenario}} writer for Super Fire Pro Wrestling III, which earned him praise {{from the company}} due {{to the quality of}} his work. Due to this, he was appointed as both writer and director for Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special, which gained long-term notoriety for the bleak tone of its story and ending. Following Super Fire Pro Wrestling III, Suda worked on the Twilight Syndrome series; he initially had to step in as producer and director for Twilight Syndrome, but he was able to have greater creative input in Moonlight Syndrome: one of his decisions was to shift Moonlight Syndrome away from supernatural into psychological horror. Suda, who had gathered a fan base from his work at Human, generated controversy by killing off the main character in Moonlight Syndrome. Moonlight Syndrome would be the last game worked on by Suda for Human Entertainment, as he left due to being unsatisfied with available money bonuses. He also sensed that Human Entertainment, which would declare bankruptcy the following year, was not a <b>secure</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|On both {{days of the}} Battle of Chickamauga, on his own initiative, Carson {{played a}} key role in {{rallying}} Union troops under heavy attack near the end of the Union line. These actions delayed further Confederate attacks long enough on the first day for the broken Union regiments to regroup and hold their ground. On the second day of the battle, the extra time gained by the troops rallied by Carson's actions allowed most of the Union Army to retreat to the defenses of Chattanooga, Tennessee without pursuit by the Confederate soldiers. Carson's actions rallied the troops and gave the impression that a large number of Union reinforcements were arriving. Renewed Confederate assaults were delayed so the Confederates could mass their forces against the supposed reinforced Union line. This delay allowed most of the Union Army on the field, including most of the XIV Corps to which the regulars were assigned, to retreat to a more <b>secure</b> <b>position</b> at Chattanooga. The small remaining rear guard force, including Carson, held the Union line for three additional critical hours until most of the remaining defenders ran out of ammunition and were taken prisoner.|$|E
