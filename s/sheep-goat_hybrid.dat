A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a <b>sheep-goat</b> <b>hybrid</b> (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E

50|$|A sheep-goat chimera (sometimes {{called a}} geep in popular media) is a chimera {{produced}} {{by combining the}} embryos of a goat and a sheep; the resulting animal has cells of both sheep and goat origin.

50|$|Supposedly, most <b>sheep-goat</b> <b>hybrids</b> die as embryos. Hybrid male mammals {{are often}} sterile, demonstrating a {{phenomenon}} known as Haldane's rule. The Haldane phenomenon may apply even when the parent species have {{the same number of}} chromosomes, as in most cat-species hybrids. It sometimes does not apply when the species chromosome number is different, as in wild horse (chromosome number = 66) with domestic horse (chromosome number = 64) hybrids. Hybrid female fertility tends to decrease with increasing divergence in chromosome similarity between parent species. Presumably, this is due to mismatch problems during meiosis and the resulting production of eggs with unbalanced genetic complements.|$|R
50|$|A male sheep {{impregnated}} {{a female}} goat in New Zealand {{resulting in a}} mixed litter of kids and a female <b>sheep-goat</b> <b>hybrid</b> with 57 chromosomes. The hybrid was subsequently shown to be fertile when mated with a ram. In France natural mating of a doe with a ram produced a female hybrid carrying 57 chromosomes. This animal backcrossed in the veterinary college of Nantes to a ram delivered a stillborn and a living male offspring with 54 chromosomes.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sheep-goat</b> <b>hybrid</b> (sometimes {{called a}} geep or shoat in popular media) is the hybrid {{offspring}} of a sheep and a goat. Although {{sheep and goats}} seem similar and can be mated, they belong to different genera in the subfamily Caprinae of the family Bovidae. Sheep belong to the genus Ovis and have 54 chromosomes, while goats belong to the genus Capra and have 60 chromosomes. The offspring of a sheep-goat pairing is generally stillborn. Despite widespread shared pasturing of goats and sheep, hybrids are very rare, indicating the genetic distance between the two species. Though sometimes called [...] "geep", they {{are not to be}} confused with sheep-goat chimera, which are artificially created.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports a}} 5 year old male <b>sheep–goat</b> {{interspecific}} <b>hybrid</b> born under natural conditions. The hybrid was castrated at 10 months of age.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{simultaneously}} integrate linkage and syntenic groups to the ovine chromosomal map, a sheep {{bacterial artificial chromosome}} (BAC) library was screened with previously assigned microsatellites using a sheep-hamster hybrid panel and genetic linkage. Thirty-three BACs were obtained, fluorescently labelled and hybridised on <b>sheep-goat</b> <b>hybrid</b> metaphases (2 n = 57). This study allowed us, (i), to anchor all linkage groups on sheep chromosomes, (ii), to give information on the probable position of the centromere on the linkage map for the centromeric chromosomes, (iii), to contradict the previous orientation of the ovine × linkage group by the mapping of BMS 1008 on OARXq 38. Concerning our somatic cell hybrid panel, this study resulted in the assignment of all the previously unassigned groups to ovine chromosomes and a complete characterisation of the hybrid panel. In addition, since hybridisations were performed on a <b>sheep-goat</b> <b>hybrid,</b> new marker/anchoring points {{were added to the}} caprine cytogenetic map. </p...|$|E
