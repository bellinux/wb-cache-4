40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the CFD {{analysis}} of the steam flow in the two-stage turbine with a drum rotor and balancing slots. The balancing slot {{is a part of}} every rotor blade and it can be used {{in the same way as}} balancing holes on the classical rotor disc. The main attention is focused on the explanation of the experimental knowledge about the impact of the slot covering and uncovering on the efficiency of the individual stages and the entire turbine. The pressure and temperature fields and the mass steam flows through the shaft seals, slots and blade cascades are calculated. The impact of the balancing slots covering or uncovering on the reaction and velocity conditions in the stages is evaluated according to the pressure and temperature fields. We have also concentrated on the analysis of the <b>seal</b> <b>steam</b> flow through the balancing slots. The optimized design of the balancing slots has been suggested...|$|E

40|$|Developments in turbine {{technologies}} lead {{to higher}} operating temperature and pressure conditions. Parasitic leakage flows around the turbine account for considerable efficiency losses that increase fuel cost dramatically. Brush seal has recently emerged as an improved sealing technology to provide better leakage performance and to replace classical labyrinth seals. In order to optimize efficiency, comprehensive study of the factors causing the leakage is required. The leakage performance of the brush seal is directly related with geometry, operating inlet and outlet boundary conditions, bristle pack configuration. Brush seal flow and pressure profiles with turbine operating conditions become complicated, and analytical formulations remain inadequate to correlate design parameters and leakage performance in operating conditions. Recently brush seals have found ever increasing applications in steam turbines. Literature review indicates that there is very limited studies of brush <b>seal</b> for <b>steam</b> environment. There is also no correlation available for brush seal porosity coefficients in the literature. In an attempt to meet this need, six brush seals have been tested in a rotary test rig up to 100 psi upstream pressure. Analytical correlations and CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations have been performed for test seals and results have been correlated with the test data. Axisymmetric CFD models {{have been designed to}} reach anisotropic resistance coefficients for the brush seals based on experiments. Porous Medium Approach has been applied for representing bristle pack. Leakage rate of brush <b>seals</b> (<b>steam</b> environment) has been optimized through CFD models. Moreover, velocity and pressure characteristics in the bristle pack have been illustrated for an optimum solutions. Consequently, empirical correlations for brush seal porosity coefficients have been correlated through a systematic methodology...|$|R

50|$|The {{basic form}} of a {{wallpaper}} steamer is a semi-sealed container, usually made of plastic, that contains a heating element. A quantity of water {{is added to the}} container and the water comes into contact with the heating element. Once electrical power is connected to the element, it heats up which then in turn heats the water. The water reaches its boiling point, evaporates and produces steam. As the container is <b>sealed,</b> the <b>steam</b> pressure builds up but is released via a small opening in the container to which is connected a length of pressure pipe. At the end of the pressure pipe is a flat plate about 30 cm square and 1 cm deep. The plate has a handle on its reverse side. This plate is then held up to the papered wall. The steam being released under pressure from the container travels along the pressure pipe and is released into the forward face of the steam plate. As the plate is held against the wall, a slight seal is maintained which holds steam long enough to force the moisture into the wallpaper, saturating it and rehydrating the wallpaper paste. Once the paste is rehydrated, it starts to lose its adhesive properties, allowing the wallpaper to be either pulled or scraped from the wall.|$|R

A second runway parallel to the east-northeast to west-southwest runway was also built; both were built to accommodate B-29s. By 7 July 1945, the first B-29 runway had been paved to 8,500 feet (2,591-meters) and placed in operation. During the day, 102 B-29s, returning from a raid on Japan, landed on the field. Several sub-grade failures occurred in the construction because of ground water and soft spots in the sub-grade. In some places the paving <b>sealed</b> off <b>steam</b> which had been generated below the surface and when the steam condensed, the sub-grade became saturated. By 12 July, the B-29 runway had been completed and paved for a length of 9,800-by-200-feet (2,987-by-61-meters). The parallel runway was eventually lengthened to 9,400-feet (2,865-meters), both with a width of 200-feet (61-meters). The east-west runway built by the Japanese was developed into a fueling strip, 6,000-by-570-feet (1,829-by-174-meters), with 60 fueling outlets. For normal operations, this field could accommodate 120 P-51s and 30 B-24s and 20 B-29s.|$|R

50|$|Piston seals were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the piston seal increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the rope seal moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good <b>seal.</b> As the <b>steam</b> spring cylinders were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs.

40|$|Systematic {{parametric}} {{studies were}} performed to better understand seal-inlet rotordynamics. A CFD-perturbation model was employed to compute the seal-inlet flow disturbance quantities. Seal inlet disturbance boundary condition correlations were proposed from the computed seal-inlet quantities using the important parameters. It {{was found that the}} cosine component of the seal-inlet swirl velocity disturbance W 1 C has a substantial impact on the cross-coupled stiffness, and that the correlations for W 1 C and W 1 S should be used to replace the historical guess that seal inlet W 1 C = 0 and W 1 S = 0. Also, an extremely precise relationship was found between the swirl disturbance W 1 C and the seal-inlet swirl velocity (????Rsh ?????? ????W 0). Thus, the number of experiments or computer runs needed to determine the effect of spin speed, shaft radius and/or inlet swirl velocity on the cross-coupled stiffness is greatly reduced by plotting the simplified relationship of the cross-coupled stiffness against the swirl slip velocity. The benefits of using the new seal-inlet boundary condition correlations were assessed by implementing them into a CFD-perturbation model. Consistently improved agreement with measurements was obtained for both liquid annular seals and gas labyrinth seals. Further, the well-established CFD-perturbation model with new boundary condition correlations was employed to investigate the rotordynamics of two off-design situations. The first case considered the influence of labyrinth seal teeth damage on the performance and the rotordynamic characteristics of impeller eye seals in centrifugal compressors. The second case considered the influence of rotor-axial-shifting on rotordynamic forces for high-low labyrinth <b>seals</b> in <b>steam</b> turbines during the start-up and shut-down process. The results should provide useful information for labyrinth seal design and fault diagnosis of stability problems in turbines and compressors...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 64 Many of the {{mechanical}} drive steam turbines in service {{in the world today}} were designed without the demands for optimum efficiency. In order to meet the changing economic requirements that plants face, technological solutions have been developed to improve turbine performance that can be sustained during extended run times. This is in contrast to making conventional component replacements with short-lived or limited gains in performance. Another important consideration is that performance upgrades must be made without adversely impacting the turbine?s operating characteristics, especially those during startup. Turbine efficiency is significantly affected by the performance of shaft and tip <b>seals</b> that control <b>steam</b> leakage within the machine. Conventional seals {{have a long history of}} sacrificing operational characteristics by rubbing during unit startup and producing vibration problems that can result in aborted startups. Extended startups are the short-term loss, yet the loss of installed seal clearances has a cumulative financial impact over the operational run cycle. With the application of retractable packing to prevent rubbing during startups, tip seals not included in the OEM design may be successfully added to provide sustained thermal and operational performance improvements. These features have been successfully implemented on two mechanical drive steam turbines in an ethylene plant in Orange, Texas.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{eccentricity}} on brush seal leakage at low rotational speeds were investigated. Included are the leakage results for ambient temperature air and nearly saturated streams at three different rotor eccentricities at both 0 and 400 rpm. A brush seal with a {{nominal bore diameter}} of 13. 647 cm. (5. 3730 in.) was used. It had a radial concentric interference of 0. 071 cm (0. 0028 in.) and a fence height of 0. 0927 cm (0. 0365 in.). There were 1060 bristles per centimeter of circumference (2690 bristles per inch of circumference). Rotor eccentricities of 0. 003, 0. 010, 0. 038, and 0. 043 cm (0. 001, 0. 004, 0. 015, and 0. 017 in.) were achieved by using bushings with different offsets.

Large eccentricities did not damage the brush seals or their Haynes 25 bristles. However, the 304 stainless steel rotor did not show wear, indicating a harder surface is needed.
