25|$|In {{order to}} create a typing reagent, blood from animals or humans would be taken, the blood cells allowed to {{separate}} from the serum, and the serum diluted to its optimal sensitivity and used to type cells from other individuals or animals. Thus, <b>serotyping</b> became a way of crudely identifying HLA receptors and receptor isoforms. Over the years, <b>serotyping</b> antibodies became more refined as techniques for increasing sensitivity improved and new <b>serotyping</b> antibodies continue to appear. One of the goals of serotype analysis is to fill gaps in the analysis. It is possible to predict based on 'square root','maximum-likelihood' method, or analysis of familial haplotypes to account for adequately typed alleles. These studies using <b>serotyping</b> techniques frequently revealed, in particular for non-European or north East Asian populations a large number of null or blank serotypes. This was particularly problematic for the Cw locus until recently, and almost half of the Cw serotypes went untyped in the 1991 survey of the human population.|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} available 7 -valent {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}} (PCV 7) elicits good immune response to and is effective against vaccine <b>serotypes.</b> However, its effectiveness against vaccine-related <b>serotypes</b> is variable. Serum samples were obtained 1 month after the last vaccination from 31 infants immunized with PCV 7 at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The sera {{were used to determine}} immunoglobulin G antibody levels to eight <b>serotypes</b> (seven vaccine <b>serotypes</b> and <b>serotype</b> 19 A) with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and opsonic capacity against 11 <b>serotypes</b> (seven vaccine <b>serotypes,</b> <b>serotypes</b> 19 A and 6 A, and nonvaccine <b>serotypes</b> 5 and 7 F) using a multiplexed opsonization assay. ELISA results showed antibody concentrations varied between 1. 84 and 10. 49 μg/ml, and all subjects had antibody concentrations of ≥ 0. 35 μg/ml for all <b>serotypes,</b> including <b>serotype</b> 19 A. In contrast, the opsonic index was detectable (i. e., opsonic index ≥ 8) in all children for the seven vaccine <b>serotypes,</b> 81 % for <b>serotype</b> 6 A, and merely 19 % for <b>serotype</b> 19 A. PCV 7 shows good immunogenicity for vaccine <b>serotypes</b> in infants after a primary series. PCV 7 does not elicit opsonic antibodies to <b>serotype</b> 19 A.

People with certain HLA antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR <b>serotyping.</b> Current <b>serotyping</b> can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis.

Among <b>serotype</b> 1 isolates, the prevalence of provisional <b>serotype</b> S. flexneri 1 c increased from 0 to 56 % from 1978 to 2001 in Bangladesh.

Twenty percent of the <b>serotype</b> 1 c and all the <b>serotype</b> 1 a strains fermented maltose and 53 % of the <b>serotype</b> 1 c strains and 60 % of the <b>serotype</b> 1 a strains fermented arabinose, whereas all <b>serotype</b> 1 b strains were negative for fermentation of these sugars. Only 18 % of <b>serotype</b> 1 b strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, and most of the <b>serotype</b> 1 c and 1 b strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All the strains of <b>serotypes</b> 1 a and 1 b and about 88 % of the <b>serotype</b> 1 c strains were found to be invasive by the Sereny test, had a 140 -MDa plasmid, and had Congo red absorption ability.

Most of the <b>serotype</b> 1 c strains (72 %) had the 1. 6 -MDa plasmid, which was not found in either <b>serotype</b> 1 a or 1 b strains. A self-transmissible middle-range plasmid (35 to 80 MDa) was found in some strains carrying the multiple-antibiotic-resistance gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis yielded three types (types A, B, and C) with numerous subtypes among the <b>serotype</b> 1 c strains, whereas <b>serotypes</b> 1 b and 1 a yielded only one type for each <b>serotype,</b> and those types were related to the types for <b>serotype</b> 1 c strains.

Of the 33 described <b>serotypes,</b> S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 accounts {{for the majority of}} infections worldwide. In several European countries S. suis <b>serotype</b> 9 is emerging, whereas the prevalence of S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 in field isolates of diseased pigs decreases. The cause of this replacement of <b>serotype</b> 2 by <b>serotype</b> 9 is unknown. In this research project the interaction of these <b>serotypes</b> is investigated in caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) -pigs. The clinical and pathological findings shown by pigs inoculated with or contact exposed to S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 & 9 were surveyed and compared to inoculation with or contact exposure to S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 or 9 alone. The proposed hypothesis was that after combined infection via inoculation or contact exposure to S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 & 9, S. suis <b>serotype</b> 9 suppresses S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 and thereby reduces disease severity and increases survival of the pigs. This hypothesis can partially be proven. The co-infection did not alter the seriousness of clinical signs and the survival of the pigs inoculated with both <b>serotypes.</b> The survival of the pigs contact exposed to S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 & 9, however, was increased after co-infection when compared to mono-infection with S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2. It can be concluded that S. suis <b>serotype</b> 9, partially, suppresses S. suis <b>serotype</b> 2 in inducing lethal infection...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella enterica <b>serotypes</b> Derby, Mbandaka, Montevideo, Livingstone, and Senftenberg {{were among}} the 10 most {{prevalent}} <b>serotypes</b> isolated from farm animals in England and Wales in 1999. These <b>serotypes</b> are of potential zoonotic relevance; however, there is currently no "gold standard" fingerprinting method for them. A collection of isolates representing the former <b>serotypes</b> and <b>serotype</b> Gold Coast were analyzed using plasmid profiling, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and ribotyping. The success of the molecular methods in identifying DNA polymorphisms was different for each <b>serotype.</b> Plasmid profiling was particularly useful for <b>serotype</b> Derby isolates, and it also provided a good level of discrimination for <b>serotype</b> Senftenberg. For most <b>serotypes,</b> we observed a number of nontypeable plasmid-free strains, which represents a limitation of this technique. Fingerprinting of genomic DNA by ribotyping and PFGE produced a significant variation in results, depending on the <b>serotype</b> of the strain. Both PstI/SphI ribotyping and XbaI-PFGE provided a similar degree of strain differentiation for <b>serotype</b> Derby and <b>serotype</b> Senftenberg, only marginally lower than that achieved by plasmid profiling. Ribotyping was less sensitive than PFGE when applied to <b>serotype</b> Mbandaka or <b>serotype</b> Montevideo. <b>Serotype</b> Gold Coast isolates {{were found to be}} nontypeable by XbaI-PFGE, and a significant proportion of them were found to be plasmid free. A similar situation applies to a number of <b>serotype</b> Livingstone isolates which were nontypeable by plasmid profiling and/or PFGE. In summary, the <b>serotype</b> of the isolates has a considerable influence in deciding the best typing strategy; a single method cannot be relied upon for discriminating between strains, and a combination of typing methods allows further discrimination...|$|R
