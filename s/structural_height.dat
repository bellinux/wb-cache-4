40|$|We {{report a}} facile {{fabrication}} method for the fabrication of functional large area nanostructured polymer films using a drop casting technique. Reusable and tapered silicon molds were utilized {{in the production}} of functional polymers providing rapid fabrication of the paraboloid nanostructures at the desired <b>structural</b> <b>heights</b> without the requirement of any complex production conditions, such as high temperature or pressure. The fabricated polymer films demonstrate promising qualities in terms of antireflective, hydrophobic and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) features. We achieved up to 92 % transmission from the single-side nanostructured polymer films by implementing optimized nanostructure parameters which were determined using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method prior to production. Large-area nanostructured films were observed to enhance the Raman signal with an enhancement factor of 4. 9 × 106 compared to bare film, making them potentially suitable as free-standing SERS substrates.

40|$|Extensions of the German LIGA process {{have brought}} about {{fabrication}} capability suitable for cost effective production of precision engineered components. The process attributes allow fabrication of mechanical components {{which are not}} capable of being made via conventional subtractive machining methods.

Application of low-stress x-ray photoresist has been achieved using room temperature solvent bonding of a preformed photoresist sheet. Precision diamond lapping and polishing has provided a flexible process for the planarization {{of a wide variety of}} electroplated metals in the presence of photoresist.

40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{construction}} of the most precise possible probabilistic model for the estimation of seismic demand in steel moment-resisting frames, with different heights, using the Bayesian Statistic, is attempted. In this study, after proving that the best form for defining the model is a linear combination of the logarithm of Intensity Measure (IM) parameter, the best IM was selected based on the practicality, efficiency and sufficiency of models. Some particular {{results show that the}} precision of models with one single IM depends on the number of stories in the structure, so no model including the current one, i. e. the one with spectral acceleration in the first period as IM can be introduced as the best model of all frames with whatever height. Since making use of a combined IM including two spectral values as a solution is not practical due to the extreme difficulty of producing a multiple parameter seismic hazard curve, in this study it was shown that the best possible method for {{construction of}} the model is the use of two single IMs, i. e. the best model to cover all <b>structural</b> <b>heights</b> is the one with a linear combination of the logarithm of spectral acceleration at the first and second periods...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of metallic microstructures by electroforming is {{an important}} step within the LIGA process. In the electroforming step, small gaps as well as large structures on one substrate have to be filled with metal up to the same height. These gaps, electrochemically characterized as recessed microelectrodes, may have <b>structural</b> <b>heights</b> of up to several hundred micrometers and lateral dimensions down to only a few micrometers. Microstructured LIGA substrates consist of arrays of recessed microelectrodes with different lateral dimensions. Mass transport is of critical importance during electroforming of microstructured substrates, since different concentration profiles result in gaps of different lateral sizes. Consequently, the convective diffusion during the electroforming of recessed microelectrodes influences metal distribution and deposit properties. Therefore it is necessary to determine the influence of convective diffusion on electroforming of recessed microelectrodes, especially LIGA microstructures. Investigations were performed by electrochemical means with newly developed microelectrodes. The convective diffusive mass transport situation during the electroforming of recessed microelectrodes could be described satisfactorily. The results are not only applicable to the electroforming process within the LIGA technology, but also to other electrochemical research activities like electrochemical etching of fine patterns or pitting and crevice corrosion.

This process concept which originated in Germany as LIGA may be further extended by adding surface micromachining. This extension permits the fabrication of precision metal and plastic parts which may be assembled into three-dimensional micromechanical components and systems. The processing tool {{may be used to}} fabricate devices from ferromagnetic material such as nickel and nickel-iron alloys. These materials when properly heat treated exhibit acceptable magnetic behavior for current to flux conversion and marginal behavior for permanent magnet applications. The tool and materials have been tested via planar, magnetic, rotational micromotor fabrication. Three phase reluctance machines of the 6 : 4 configuration with 280 micron diameter rotors have been tested and analyzed. Stable rotational speeds to 34, 000 rpm with output torques above 10 x 10 (exp - 9) N-m have been obtained. The behavior is monitored with integrated shaft encoders which are photodiodes which measure the rotor response. Magnetic levitation of the rotor via reluctance forces has been achieved and has reduced frictional torque losses to less than 1 percent of the available torque. The results indicate that high speed limits of these actuators are related to torque ripple. Hysteresis motors with magnetic bearings are under consideration and will produce high speed rotational machines with excellent sensor application potential...|$|R

40|$|The LIGA process allows to {{fabricate}} microstructures of any lateral shape with <b>structural</b> <b>heights</b> {{of several hundred}} micrometers, lateral dimensions down to one micrometer, and submicron accuracy over the total height of the structure. These characteristics enable the production of microoptical units when using suitable polymer material. The field of interest was development of a microspectrometer system which enables to cover a spectral region from 400 nm up to 1100 nm. The developed system consists of a miniature light source, a grating unit and a diode line. The grating unit which is intended for the use in combination with fibre sensors is produced {{with the help of}} LIGA technique by structuring a planar polymer waveguide in one step with a self-focusing reflection grating, fibre guiding tracks for a adjustment fibre as well as the focus line for coupling to the diode line. Thus no adjustment is necessary. For this reason on the one hand the production of the grating element is considerably simplified {{and on the other hand}} the production costs are reduced as well. The efficiency of the system was shown for instance with the spectral analysis of a range of substances. The example of the oxygen measurement of vein and artery blood furnishes the proof of the high sensitivity of the system also when analysing high absorbing substances. The measurement of NH_ 3 with the aid of optochemical sensors shows that also low absorbing substances can be checked with a sufficient sensitivity. (orig.)

40|$|The LIGA {{technique}} {{offers a}} means of manufacturing passive, refractive optical components such as lenses or prisms having characteristic dimensions in the submillimeter range. It further allows components of any two-dimensional geometry, <b>structural</b> <b>heights</b> of several hundred micrometers and with vertical sidewalls to be manufactured with ultra-high precision. Besides, manufacture of side walls inclined towards the substrate surface opens up a way of deflecting the light imaged in the LIGA plane in a direction normal to the plane, e. g. by total internal reflection at a sidewall inclined by 45 " 0. In this way, a three-dimensional optical setup can be assembled and decoupling of light into electrooptical elements is achieved in an easy way. Besides the accuracy of patterning and the relative capability of positioning of several components on one substrate, {{the quality of the}} optical interfaces, in the case considered here of the sidewalls produced, will be crucial as regards the applications of LIGA structures in microoptics. The analysis of the surface roughness of the sidewalls made with an Linnick-type interferometer has made evident that the mean surface roughness of both the vertical and the inclined sidewalls is in the range of 30 nm to 50 nm. This good quality meets the prerequisite of applications of these components in many microoptical setups. The measurements of the imaging characteristics of individual components provides evidence of the good performance of the elements. A fiber coupling element is studied as a concrete example of application of microoptical LIGA components. (orig. /SR) Dissertation submitted by J.
