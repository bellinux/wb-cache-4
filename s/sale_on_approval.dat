50|$|Innovations {{with some}} or all of these factors {{are more likely to be}} adopted quickly. Accordingly, {{marketing}} communications may stress the innovation's relative benefits over other solutions to the consumer's problem. Marketing messages may also focus on compatibility and observability. Marketers can also facilitate adoption by offering limited scale trial (e.g. samples, test drives, <b>sale</b> <b>on</b> <b>approval),</b> enabling consumers to develop and understanding of the innovation and how it is used prior to purchase.|$|E
40|$|The {{foundations}} of change. Integration and diversification in the Antwerp book trade {{during the second}} half of the seventeenth century War, ruthless international competition, high import and export duties on books, and unforeseeable changes in the taste of readers all posed a serious threat to the survival of the book trade in the Southern Netherlands during the late seventeenth century. Nevertheless, some Brabantine printers not only survived the crisis they even managed to prosper. This article provides additional insights into the survival strategies adopted at the time based on material from the archives of Balthazar II Moretus’ Officina Plantiniana and the medium-sized publishing house of Hieronymus III Verdussen. Although both entrepreneurs reacted to the crisis by imposing harsh reforms, restructuring, and implementing innovative techniques such as <b>sale</b> <b>on</b> <b>approval,</b> their actual management choices differed greatly. The Officina Plantiniana focused more on the industrial component by opting for large-scale printing. Moretus cut back deliveries to smaller markets and dealers and concentrated on the major booksellers instead as they were able to order in bulk and resell the books to their smaller colleagues which meant that he no longer had to pay for transport and marketing. Moretus also abandoned the inefficient barter system and insisted upon cash payments so that he no longer had to take on books with a limited market value. Verdussen on the other hand followed a completely different path and seemed to renounce printing. He outsourced more and more printing work to jobbing printers in Germany or the United Provinces, thereby externalizing the risk of overstocking or losing out due to a drop in demand. By cultivating a number of advantageous alliances, Verdussen was also able to drastically reduce his custom and transport costs. As the registers of their guild reveals, in order to survive the crisis the majority of publishers in Antwerp chose Verdussen’s course of commercial capitalism as opposed to the industrial approach followed by Moretus. </p...|$|E

5000|$|On August 29, 2012, Crawford Broadcasting, a Denver based firm, {{announced}} {{its intention to}} buy the then-WNED for $875,000. A spokeswoman for WNED said a closing date for the <b>sale</b> depended <b>on</b> <b>approval</b> by regulators. Donald B. Crawford, the Crawford Broadcasting president said that he expected his company {{to take over the}} station and begin programming it around January 1, 2013. [...] The WBFO simulcast continued until midnight November 30, 2012. The owner at that time had announced at 10 pm that it would cease operations at midnight. The station was silent for an entire month which gave those who enjoy trying to receive distant stations an opportunity to receive distant signals at or near that frequency that they would not otherwise have. The station returned to the air as WDCZ on January 1, 2013 as a simulcast of WDCX-FM (99.5). This is a second station for Crawford in the Buffalo market as it is the long time owner of WDCX, whose programming it planned to simulcast in order to further its reach into southern Ontario (this despite WDCX already having one of the strongest signals in the entire country and one that easily covers Southern Ontario), further perpetuating the same type of duplicity that had prompted the previous owners to sell the station in the first place. The finalization of the sale took place at midnight November 30, 2012, through licensee Kimtron, Inc; the station's call sign was changed the same day to WDCZ.|$|R
