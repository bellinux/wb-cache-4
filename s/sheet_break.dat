40|$|In {{the present}} study, a novel air-assisted {{impinging}} jet atomization is demonstrated. A configuration {{in which a}} gas jet is directed on to the impinging point of two liquid jets is used to improve the atomization. The effect of liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension, angle between liquid jets and gas injection orifice diameter on spray characteristics has been experimentally studied. Backlit imaging and particle/droplet imaging and analysis techniques are utilized to characterize the sprays. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} effect of liquid viscosity is significant on the liquid <b>sheet</b> <b>break</b> up formed by the impinging jets. However, surface tension does not affect the spray structure significantly in this mode of atomization. At low liquid jet velocity, the prompt mode of atomization is observed where as atomization occurs in classical mode at higher liquid jet velocity. Results showed that variation in the angle between liquid jets do not affect the breakup phenomenon significantly. The spray angle is computed by finding the angle between the lines joining the impinging point and spray edge at an axial distance of 15 mm downstream of the impinging point from the ensemble-averaged data over 100 spray images. It was observed that effect of liquid jets impinging angle on the spray angle is higher at higher liquid velocity. Higher viscosity liquids exhibit lower spray angles. Droplet size measurements indicate a radial variation in the spray. An overall Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) value is obtained by combining the droplet statistics at all radial locations at a fixed axial location. A very interesting trend is that the SMD is constant beyond a critical Gas to Liquid Ratio (GLR) and momentum ratio for a large variation in liquid viscosity and surface tension. This observation has important ramifications for fuel flexible systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Linear and {{nonlinear}} stability {{analyses are}} used to study the growth of disturbances on an annular liquid sheet under various conditions in this thesis. ^ Stability of an inviscid swirling annular liquid sheet, {{in the presence of}} gas phases inside and outside the sheet and moving with unequal gas velocities, is investigated using linear stability analysis. It is found that for a given flow situation, not all non-axisymmetric modes are evanescent as previous researchers found. In addition, an increase in axial Weber number causes an increase, both in the number of circumferential modes that are unstable and their corresponding growth rates. Also, an increase in Weber number increases the axial wavenumber at which maximum disturbance growth takes place. However, in the absence of swirl, the circumferential mode with the maximum growth rate, remains at n = 0. ^ Swirl in the liquid phase causes the mode with the maximum growth rate to occur at circumferential mode, n 3 ÃÜe 0. At low swirl Weber number, it stabilizes the annular sheet by causing the most destructive axial wavenumber and the corresponding growth rate to decrease. At high swirl Weber number, it causes the circumferential instability modes to dominate and under critical conditions where the action of the swirl and axial destabilizing forces are equal, the annular sheet is unstable to three-dimensional waves. ^ The nonlinear behavior of the annular liquid sheet is studied using approximate one-dimensional equations derived by a thin sheet approximation. The model is validated by comparing the predictions against the exact linear analysis. Model predictions demonstrate that the disturbance amplitude {{is an important factor in}} the stability behavior. An increase in the sheet thickness causes the growth rate to increase. It is also observed that if the annular liquid sheet is nonstationary, disturbances that are linearly stable could become unstable and cause the <b>sheet</b> <b>break</b> up, if the amplitude of disturbances is not infinitesimal. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{explosion}} {{yielding a}} blast wave can cause catastrophic damage {{to people and}} property. To mitigate damage from such an event, a number of investigators have proposed the use of water in various configurations. In this investigation, an unconfined free-flowing water-sheet, with an approximate thickness of 0. 3 cm, is experimentally examined using an explosively driven shock tube at three different standoff distances. The {{results show that the}} water-sheet mitigates the initial peak overpressure and impulse of the blast. Further insights into the underlying physics are revealed by a numerical simulation using Sandia's CTH hydrocode. In simulations and experiments, the air behind the water sheet experiences two distinct pressure peaks. An initial pressure rise results from the passage of a low pressure shock wave (M ‚âà 1) through the intact sheet and into the air downstream of the water sheet. Following this, the water <b>sheet</b> <b>breaks</b> apart due to an increase in pressure on the forward surface caused by the buildup of the subsonic detonation products.

We present here some promising results {{on the use of}} essential oil compounds to control these biofilms. Biofilms were grown on stainless-steel coupons with a microbial white water consortium sampled from an industrial paper mill. Five essential oil compounds were screened initially in the laboratory in terms of their antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells and biofilms. The three most active compounds were selected and then tested in different combinations. The combination finally selected was tested at the pilot scale to confirm its efficiency under realistic conditions. All the compounds tested were as active against biofilms as they were against planktonic cells. The most active compounds were thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol, and the most efficient combination was thymol-carvacrol. At a pilot scale, with six injections a day, 10 mM carvacrol alone prevented biocontamination for at least 10 days, and a 1 mM thymol-carvacrol combination enabled a 67 % reduction in biofilm dry matter after 11 days. The use of green antimicrobials could constitute a very promising alternative or supplement to the treatments currently applied to limit biofilm formation in the environment of paper mill machines...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from}} Elsevier at [URL] PLIF measurements of CH 2 O and OH were performed in a swirl-stabilized n-heptane spray flame at conditions close to extinction. Simulations of laminar counterflow heptane flames at different strain rates showed that the heat release could be approximately represented by the product CH 2 OxOH, but also that this product cannot visualise the heat release at the lean side of stoichiometry. The simulations suggest that the outline of CH 2 O regions in PLIF images could be an approximate indicator of the stoichiometric mixture fraction iso-line. Due to the intense turbulence and local extinction, individual PLIF images show a very variable behaviour. They indicate rich zones, reaction <b>sheet</b> <b>breaks,</b> lift-off, and they suggest that this flame is mostly of non-premixed character. The mean heat release rate as represented here is consistent with inverse Abel-transformed OH* chemiluminescence imaging. The usefulness of this technique for spray flames is discussed. R.

40|$|In this paper, we use {{morphological}} and numerical {{methods to}} test the hypothesis that seasonally formed fracture patterns in the Martian polar regions result from the brittle failure of seasonal CO 2 slab ice. The observations by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) of polar regions of Mars show very narrow dark elongated linear patterns that are observed during some periods of time in spring, disappear in summer and re-appear again in the following spring. They are repeatedly formed in the same areas but they do not repeat the exact pattern from year to year. This leads to the conclusion that they are cracks formed in the seasonal ice layer. Some of models of seasonal surface processes rely on the existence of a transparent form of CO 2 ice, so-called slab ice. For the creation of the observed cracks the ice is required to be a continuous media, not an agglomeration of relatively separate particles like a firn. The best explanation for our observations is a slab ice with relatively high transparency in the visible wavelength range. This transparency allows a solid state green-house effect to act underneath the ice sheet raising the pressure by sublimation from below. The trapped gas creates overpressure and the ice <b>sheet</b> <b>breaks</b> at some point creating the observed cracks. We show that the times when the cracks appear are in agreement with the model calculation, providing one more piece of evidence that CO 2 slab ice covers polar areas in spring...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a free-surface slender two-dimensional stream (liquid sheet) issuing from a nozzle in the gravitational field in still air, under {{the effect of}} surface-active agents, are analysed experimentally. The particular test section geometry (the liquid is forced to assume a bidimensional form between two vertical guides and a horizontal plate placed at a certain variable distance from the nozzle exit section) employed in this study gives rise to various flow regimes depending on the governing parameters: liquid flow rate, sheet height, surface pressure, gravity. Two basic phenomena are observed: thinning of the sheet (with recirculating motion inside it) and sheet-threadlines transition. For a certain surfactant (bulk) concentration, there exists a minimum critical flow rate value for which the sheet is seen to thin starting at both of the sheet bottom corners. A ridge, usually {{referred to as a}} Reynolds ridge in the literature, separates the sheet from the thin-film regions. The thin films exhibit recirculating flows (caused by the onset of surfactant-induced surface-pressure-driven convection in the gravitational field) and extend to the entire rectangular interface as the flow rate is reduced. At zero flow rate the thinned sheet resembles a plane vertical soap him showing a recirculating cellular structure. These phenomena are linked to the presence of surface-active material adsorbed at the liquid-air interface and occur when the sheet height exceeds a critical value.

40|$|Rapidly {{rotating}} {{neutron stars}} blow a relativistic, magnetized wind mainly composed of electron-positron pairs. The free {{expansion of the}} wind terminates far from the neutron star where a weakly magnetized pulsar wind nebula forms, implying efficient magnetic dissipation somewhere upstream. The wind current sheet that separates the two magnetic polarities is usually considered as the most natural place for magnetic dissipation via relativistic reconnection, but its efficiency remains an open question. Here, {{the goal of this}} work is to revisit this issue in light of the most recent progress in the understanding of reconnection and pulsar electrodynamics. We perform large two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the oblique rotator to capture the multi-scale evolution of the wind. We find that the current <b>sheet</b> <b>breaks</b> up into a dynamical chain of magnetic islands separated by secondary thin current sheets. The sheet thickness increases linearly with radius while the Poynting flux decreases monotonically as reconnection proceeds. The radius of complete annihilation of the stripes is given by the plasma multiplicity parameter at the light cylinder. Current starvation within the sheets does not occur before complete dissipation {{as long as there is}} enough charges where the sheets form. Particles are efficiently heated up to a characteristic energy set by the magnetization parameter at the light cylinder. Energetic pulsed synchrotron emission peaks close to the light cylinder, and presents sub-pulse variability associated with the formation of plasmoids in the sheet. This study suggests that the striped component of the wind dissipates far before reaching the termination shock in isolated pulsars, even in very-high-multiplicity systems such as the Crab pulsar. Pulsars in binary systems may provide the best environments to study magnetic dissipation in the wind. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysic...|$|R
