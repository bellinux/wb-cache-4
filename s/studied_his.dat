5|$|Born {{in rural}} Prince George's County, Maryland, Williams spent his {{childhood}} on Springfield Farm near present-day Williamsport. He was orphaned at age thirteen and {{was put in}} the care of his father's brother-in-law, Mr. Ross. Williams took an apprenticeship under Mr. Ross and <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> profession in the Clerk's office of Frederick, eventually taking charge of the office. At age eighteen, Williams moved to Baltimore and undertook a similar trade. Williams returned to Frederick in 1774 and entered into a commercial life.|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E

He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.|$|E
25|$|Huxley's {{method of}} argumentation (his {{strategy}} and tactics of persuasion in speech and print) is itself much <b>studied.</b> <b>His</b> career included controversial debates with scientists, clerics and politicians; persuasive discussions with Royal Commissions {{and other public}} bodies; lectures and articles for the general public, and a mass of detailed letter-writing to friends and other correspondents. A large number of textbooks have excerpted his prose for anthologies.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about his family or early life. He came to Paris {{at an early age}} and studied drawing with François Boucher. He met the rich {{financier}} and collector Pierre Crozat and <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> collection of 1,400 classical engraved gemstones. He decided to study the art of fine stone engraving. His first efforts were successful, but he needed formal training.|$|E

25|$|Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona {{runs the}} gamut from {{friendly}} charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. His charm can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually reads as plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures across the globe.|$|E
25|$|Lagrange was a {{favourite}} of the king, {{who used}} frequently to discourse {{to him on}} the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson went home, and thenceforth Lagrange <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> mind and body as though they were machines, and found by experiment the exact amount of work which he was able to do without breaking down. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction.|$|E
25|$|Smith was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant on 12 January 1923. He {{became interested in the}} scientific study of oceanography and the movement of icebergs during his assignment aboard Seneca, and remained assigned as an Ice Patrol hydrographer until August 1924 when he was directed by Coast Guard Headquarters to work with Vilhelm Bjerknes at the Bergen School of Meteorology. Bjerknes was internationally known for his studies of how wind currents interact with ocean currents to produce weather patterns and Smith <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> methods of measuring ocean currents. In August 1925, Smith spent three months at the British Meteorological Institute collecting data for use with the Ice Patrol before returning the United States and Ice Patrol duties. He received permission to study at Harvard University when Seneca wasn't on Ice Patrol duties. In 1925, Smith published A Practical Means for Determining Ocean Currents, which was utilized as a work bulletin throughout the Coast Guard.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, he {{graduated}} with distinction in philosophy and history securing several University prizes. Soon thereafter, {{he won a}} Government of India scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge in England. He joined St. John's College at Cambridge in 1902, the college where the great English poet William Wordsworth had <b>studied.</b> <b>His</b> career at St Johns College, Cambridge, was no less distinguished {{than it had been}} at Madras Christian College. Apart from being a brilliant student, he made his mark as an outstanding speaker and debater. He was elected Secretary of the Liberal Club and later Vice-President of the Union Society. He was the first Indian student to be chosen for that office in the Union Society. When he was the Vice-President of the Union Society, John Maynard Keynes (destined to be a world-famous economist later) was the Secretary of the Union Society. On 31 October 1905, Reddy invited Gopal Krishna Gokhale to address the Union Society. When Gokhale met John Maynard Keynes, he instantaneously recognised the genius of Keynes and commented that: 'You are eminently fitted to be a Finance Member in the Viceroy's Executive Council in India'.|$|E
500|$|Trotter, in a {{deliberate}} move, transferred the Guardian offices in 1907 {{to the same}} building that had once housed William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator. Trotter idolized Garrison, a leading abolitionist agitator before the Civil War, and had <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> methods. [...] He was a regular correspondent with Garrison's sons William, Jr. and Francis Garrison.|$|E
500|$|Marcel Proust {{similarly}} {{learned from}} the Realist example; he adored Balzac and <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> works carefully, although he criticised what he perceived as Balzac's [...] "vulgarity". Balzac's story Une Heure de ma Vie (An Hour of my Life, 1822), in which minute details are followed by deep personal reflections, is a clear forebear of the style which Proust used in À la recherche du temps perdu. However, Proust wrote later in life that the contemporary fashion of ranking Balzac higher than Tolstoy was [...] "madness." ...|$|E

500|$|Thomas Alan Stephenson, {{a marine}} biologist, {{was born in}} the town in 1898, and it was also the birthplace of John Pople, a {{theoretical}} chemist, in 1925. The novelist Isobel English was sent to La Retraite, a Burnham-on-Sea convent school, in 1920. The town was also the home of Walter [...] "Wally" [...] Postings and Beatrice [...] "Pete" [...] Postings. The couple were married for 80 years, the longest marriage in Britain. Arthur Gilbert, confirmed as the world's oldest triathlete in 2011, lives and competes in the town. George Shelley of X Factor boy band Union J lived in Burnham-on-Sea and attended The King Alfred School, Highbridge, where he <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> GCSEs. Also resident is world champion Scottish Darts player Gary Anderson.|$|E
500|$|Zyos <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> opponent's {{style of}} play {{in order to find}} weaknesses. He also practiced four to five hours to day, and the week before a tournament for ten. He stated that most of the stress of {{competing}} is mental, though physical fitness helps in tournaments that can last 16 hours per day. Talents he has suggested players need include quick reflexes, concentration, and the ability to play under pressure. The transition from Halo to Halo 2 was a mixed bag for Zyos, since he called it an [...] "easier game", but tournaments started being more focused on two-on-two. Once Halo 2 was released, Leto began to focus almost exclusively on it and did not play the original at all.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} watched by over 900,000 people in total; the MCC took home a larger profit than on any {{previous}} tour. Allen was treated sympathetically by press and public. The Wisden {{review of the}} tour suggested: [...] "It would be churlish to criticise Allen's captaincy. During the first two Tests, {{almost every one of}} his moves succeeded instantly... No doubt, Allen had <b>studied</b> <b>his</b> opponents carefully and knew their weaknesses, and if his tactics were not always dictated by accepted principles they certainly proved very successful. Those who attributed so much of the England captain's success to good luck were inclined to overlook the many stratagems exploited by him". In the Test series, he scored 150 runs at 18.75 and took 17 wickets at 30.94. During the tour, Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and encouraged his team to fraternise with the Australian team. He clashed over tactics with one of his team, Joe Hardstaff; the pair never got along thereafter.|$|E
