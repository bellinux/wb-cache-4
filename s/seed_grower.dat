This will be greatly facilitated by tools that help segregate and concentrate seed production destined for various markets. This can be accomplished by a number of means, including: 1) NAFA Best Management Practices for Roundup Ready Alfalfa Seed Production (NAFA GE BMP), which mandates minimum isolation from conventional seed for new RRA seed production plantings. 2) NAFA Best Management Practices for APS Alfalfa Seed Production (NAFA APS BMP), adopted by NAFA for the production of APS seed production. 3) California Crop Improvement Association (CCIA) pinning map, which helps seed companies identify regions where GE and APS/Alfalfa Seed Stewardship Program (ASSP) plantings are being concentrated. 4) Grower Opportunity Zone (GOZ), grower driven zones concentrating either GE or APS production, excluding the other.

40|$|Meadowfoam, an oilseed crop {{grown in}} the Willamette Valley of Oregon, was {{developed}} from Limnanthes alba (Benth.), an herbaceous winter annual native {{to the west coast}} of North America. Meadowfoam oil is valued for unique properties attributed to the predominance of very long-chain fatty acids and desaturation at the Δ 5 position. Seed meal remaining after commercial oil extraction contains intact glucosinolates and has potential pesticidal properties owing to isothiocyanate and nitrile glucosinolate derivatives. We identified and quantitated seed glucosinolates in four species of Section Inflexae of Limnanthes to assess variation for this trait in primary and secondary gene pools of cultivated meadowfoam. Glucosinolate content in seeds ranged from 30 to 204 μmol/g dry weight. Only glucolimnanthin (3 -methoxybenzyl glucosinolate) was detected in L. alba, L. montana and L. gracilis, but L. floccosa contained glucolepigramin (3 -hydroxybenzyl glucosinolate) as well as glucolimnanthin. Two QTL affecting seed glucosinolate content were identified in an inter-subspecific BC 1 population derived from a cross between L. alba subsp. alba and L. alba subsp. versicolor.

40|$|Improving the {{introduction}} of new potato varieties requires aligning the preferences of all supply chain actors. In Ethiopia, the majority of ware potato <b>growers</b> source their <b>seed</b> from the informal supply system. Using a case study on specialised <b>seed</b> <b>growers</b> and a survey among ware potato growers and downstream chain actors, we explore the quality attributes that could influence the variety choices of farmers and downstream actors. Especially, we analysed the link between the seed and ware potato supply chains, farmers’ evaluation of local and improved potato varieties, and quality differences between the local and improved varieties. We found that farmers’ variety choices are well-aligned with traders’ preferences but varieties supplied by the specialised <b>seed</b> potato <b>growers</b> are not well accepted by ware potato growers. As a result, ware potato farmers continue to grow local varieties, which are inferior in terms of production-related quality attributes, but superior regarding market-related quality attributes. The results imply that enhancing production-related quality attributes is not enough to induce farmers to accept new potato varieties. We recommend breeding institutes and <b>seed</b> potato <b>growers</b> to put more emphasis on market-related quality attributes to enhance choice alignment in the full potato chain...|$|R
