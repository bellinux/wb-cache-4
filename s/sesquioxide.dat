50|$|Podsolisation is {{an extreme}} form of {{leaching}} which causes the eluviation of iron and aluminium <b>sesquioxides.</b>|$|R
50|$|In podsolisation, {{chelating}} agents break down clay and release minerals such as iron and aluminium. When iron and aluminium are hydrated they become <b>sesquioxides.</b> The <b>sesquioxides</b> are translocated from the A Horizon, {{a zone of}} out-washing, to the B Horizon, a zone of illuviation. Many bases such as Calcium and Potassium are also leached from the zone along with organic matter and silica. Often minerals like quartz and silica are {{left behind in the}} A horizon. What is significantly different about podsols in comparison to other soils is that the bottom of A horizon is known as the AE horizon, which is an eluviated area which has lost <b>sesquioxides.</b> It tends to be an ash gray colour.|$|R
5|$|Samarium (and its <b>sesquioxide)</b> are {{paramagnetic}} at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2µB, are the 3rd lowest {{among the}} lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They {{can also be}} doped between the C60 molecules in the fullerene solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56K, which is the highest value achieved so far in this series.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the <b>sesquioxide</b> Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E

50|$|Ferrallitisation is {{the process}} in which rock is changed into a soil {{consisting}} of clay (kaolinite) and <b>sesquioxides,</b> {{in the form of}} hydrated oxides of iron and aluminium. In humid tropical areas, with consistently high temperatures and rainfall for all or most of the year, chemical weathering rapidly breaks down the rock. This at first produces clays which later also break down to form silica. The silica is removed by leaching and the <b>sesquioxides</b> of iron and aluminium remain, giving the characteristic red colour of many tropical soils. Ferrallitisation is the reverse of podsolisation, where silica remains and the iron and aluminum are removed. In tropical rain forests with rain throughout the year, ferrallitic soils develop.

40|$|High-dielectric {{constant}} oxides are {{the focus}} of intense current research. As a contribution to the rationalization of the search for candidate materials, we compare the dielectric properties obtained from first-principles linear-response calculations for two phases-the ground state bixbyite and the competing hexagonal structures-of the crystalline oxide Lu 2 O 3. The dielectric constants of bixbyite is about 12 and that of hexagonal is about 19 (the electronic constant being about 4. 5 in both cases). This difference is due almost exclusively to the vibrational properties, with minor or no influence of charge anomaly differences; as these are related mainly to oxygen vibrations, we argue that the dielectric properties of <b>sesquioxides</b> will be determined mostly by their preferred structure, i. e. they will be poorer for bixbyite (e. g.

In rare-earth oxides the frequency of cation-localized modes shows a weak dependence on cation type; oxygen modes, instead, increase their energy as the cation radius decreases from La to Lu. In the case of the smaller Sc, frequencies increase for all modes and the smaller cation/oxygen mass ratio allows for a significant mixing of oxygen and cation displacements at intermediate frequencies.
