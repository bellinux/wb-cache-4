40|$|Antibiotics and {{antiseptics}} {{have the}} potential to influence carriage and transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), although effects are likely to be complex, particularly in a setting where multiple agents are used. Here admission and weekly MRSA screens and daily antibiotic and antiseptic prescribing data from 544 MRSA carriers on an intensive care unit (ICU) are used to determine the effect of these agents on short-term within-host MRSA carriage dynamics. Longitudinal data were analysed using Markov models allowing patients to move between two states: MRSA positive (detectable MRSA carriage) and MRSA negative (no detectable carriage). The effect of concurrent systemic antibiotic and topical chlorhexidine (CHX) on movement between these states was assessed. CHX targeted to MRSA <b>screen</b> <b>carriage</b> sites increased transition from culture positive to negative and there was also weaker evidence that it decreased subsequent transition from negative back to positive. In contrast, there was only weak and inconsistent evidence that any antibiotic influenced transition in either direction. For example, whereas univariate analysis found quinolones to be strongly associated with both increased risk of losing and then reacquiring MRSA carriage over time intervals of one day, no effect was seen with weekly models. Similar studies are required to determine the generalisability of these findings...|$|E

Therefore, we aimed to estimate the rate of spread (R(0)) of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary care center with 5 intensive care units.; In this observational cohort study performed from June 1999 through April 2011, all patients at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, who were hospitalized in the same room as a patient colonized or infected with an ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae for at least 24 hours (index case) were <b>screened</b> for ESBL <b>carriage</b> by testing of rectal swab samples, swab samples from open wounds or drainages, and urine samples from patients with foley catheters.

The hospital also implemented an automated computer system that updated patient charts when new cases were reported, if patients were carriers, and what precautions to take when dealing with such patients.

We report a prospective clinical trial undertaken to test all of these methods concurrently. Patients at high risk for MRSA <b>carriage</b> were <b>screened</b> with eight consecutive nasal swabs (four standard rayon, four charcoal-coated rayon), which were processed by primary plating on MSA, MSAOx, MHAOx, and MSALOx; Stuart's preincubation for 72 h followed by plating on the solid media; overnight enrichment in salt-containing TSB followed by plating; and Stuart's preincubation for 72 h followed by overnight enrichment in TSB and plating. All of the above methods were repeated with charcoal swabs. Each patient was screened by 32 culture methods. Forty-three (42 %) of 102 patients studied were positive for MRSA by one or more methods. Among the four media evaluated with direct plating, MSALOx was 11 to 25 % more sensitive for detecting MRSA (MSALOx versus MSAOx or MHAOx or MSA, each P < 0. 01). Preincubation in Stuart's medium for 72 h did not enhance recovery of MRSA. Enrichment in salt-containing TSB further increased yield 9 %. MSALOx also showed the best specificity, 93 %.

Methods: This was a 12 -month, prospective, cohort study of all patients admitted to a single ICU of a tertiary hospital. Screening samples were collected at ICU admission to identify imported carriers, and weekly during hospitalization to identify acquisition.

We studied the performances of four different GBS detection assays in the context of antenatal screening. Between May and August 2004, the 605 vaginorectal swab specimens received at our bacteriology laboratory for GBS antenatal detection were tested by the four assays. The standard culture method was done according to the CDC recommendations. The three experimental assays performed with the growth from the selective enrichment (LIM) broth (Todd-Hewitt broth with 15 μg/ml nalidixic acid and 10 μg/ml colistin) after overnight incubation were a GBS antigen detection assay (PathoDx) and two PCR assays (for cfb and scpB). The most accurate assay was the scpB PCR (sensitivity, 99. 6 %; specificity, 100 %), followed by the cfb PCR (sensitivity, 75. 3 %; specificity, 100 %), GBS antigen detection (sensitivity, 57. 3 %; specificity, 99. 5 %), and standard culture (sensitivity, 42. 3 %; specificity, 100 %).

Characteristics of nursing homes and residents were collected by a questionnaire survey and were analysed by multilevel logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 2791 screened residents in 60 participating nursing home, the weighted prevalence of ESBLE and MRSA carriage were 6. 2 % (range: 0 to 20 %) and 12. 2 % (range: 0 to 36 %), respectively.

Isolation and identification of the isolate as S. aureus was done using Gram stain, coagulase test and catalase test. S. aureus isolates were confirmed as MRSA using cefoxitin (30 μg) disc and oxacillin (30 μg) disc by Kirby- Bauer disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. From 100 nasal swabs, 76 were coagulase negative Staphylococci and 20 were coagulase positive Staphylococci. Results From 100 nasal swabs, 76 were coagulase negative Staphylococci and 20 were coagulase positive Staphylococci. From these, 60 % and 40 % were oxacillin- and cefoxitin-resistant isolates, respectively. The data obtained from this study revealed that there were carriers of MRSA among the medical students...|$|R
40|$|Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is {{a problem}} within healthcare organizations and in the community. The aim {{of the study was}} to <b>screen</b> for MRSA <b>carriage</b> among healthcare workers. The study involved 150 healthcare workers, which included 83 doctors, 51 nurses and 16 laboratory technicians. 300 swabs (150 each for nasal and web spaces of both hands) were collected and processed. Identification of the isolate as Staph. aureus was done using Gram stain, coagulase test and Catalase test. Staph. aureus isolates were confirmed as MRSA using cefoxitin (30 µg) disc by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method on Muller Hinton agar. From 150 nasal swabs, 113 coagulase negative Staphylococci, 14 methicillin sensitive Staph. aureus and 3 Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. From 150 web space swabs, 37 coagulase negative Staphylococci and 1 methicillin sensitive Staph. aureus were isolated. All strains of MRSA were isolated from doctors. Overall rate of isolation of MRSA among healthcare workers was found to be 2. 00 %...|$|R
40|$|Nosocomial {{infection}} rates due to antibiotic-resistant bacteriae, e. g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remain high in most countries. <b>Screening</b> for MRSA <b>carriage</b> followed by barrier precautions for documented carriers (so-called screen and isolate (S&I)) {{has been successful}} in some, but not all settings. Moreover, different strategies have been proposed, but comparative studies determining their relative effects and costs are not available. We, therefore, used a mathematical model to evaluate the effect and costs of different S&I strategies and to identify the critical parameters for this outcome. The dynamic stochastic simulation model consists of 3 hospitals with general wards and intensive care units (ICUs) and incorporates readmission of carriers of MRSA. Patient flow between ICUs and wards was based on real observations. Baseline prevalence of MRSA was set at 20 % in ICUs and hospital-wide at 5 %; ranges of costs and {{infection rates}} were based on published data. Four S&I strategies were compared to a do-nothing scenario: S&I of previously documented carrier...|$|R
