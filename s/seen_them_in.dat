5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen a new website opening on the internet, with the site videos appearing in people's dreams. The videos would have gone worldwide and end up trapping little kids in their own 'dream-world'. These 'dream-worlds' would have created a 'fantasy' beyond the universe for infant children. Sarah Jane, Clyde, Rani and Luke would have been also trapped in dream-world, and would be faced with an 'internet creature' who has <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> their former adventures. This story was cancelled for various reasons, one of them being that the plot being similar to The Nightmare Man.|$|E
25|$|The Victory Tests {{were greeted}} by packed English grounds, and {{raised a lot of}} money for war charities. Against expectations, the Australians managed to draw the series 22 against an England team filled with Test cricketers. As a result, the Australian government, cricket administrators and {{military}} officials ordered the team to travel home via India to play more fundraising matches, before finishing their campaign against the Australian state teams. By the time the team arrived in Australia they were extremely tired and their performances deteriorated, leading analysts who had not <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> England to regard them as a weak team.|$|E
25|$|The novel tells {{myths of}} Autolycus, {{the son of}} Hermes and Chione, and Sisyphus. Autolycus steals the cattle of his {{neighbor}} Sisyphus; Sisyphus gains revenge by raping Autolycus' daughter Anticleia. Autolycus sends Anticleia to Ithaca to marry Laertes, who raises Odysseus, the son of Sisyphus and Anticleia, as his own. Sisyphus spies Zeus ravishing {{the daughter of the}} river god Asopus and tells Asopus where he had <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> return for a gift of an eternal spring. He tricks death by trapping Hades in his own manacles. Hades is freed by Ares, but Sisyphus escapes death a second time by deceiving Persephone. At last Hermes takes Sisyphus to Tartarus, to be condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity.|$|E

60|$|You {{would have}} veal. Thought you never {{of the price}} man pays for Veal? The {{servants}} of the Golden Calf! I <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> stretched before my eyes, a weary, endless throng. I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> toiling <b>in</b> the mines, the black sweat on their faces. I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> sunless cities, silent, and grimy, and bent. I <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> ague-twisted, <b>in</b> the rain-soaked fields. I <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> panting by the furnace doors. I <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> loin-cloth and necklace, the load upon their head. I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> blue coats and red coats, marching to pour their blood as an offering {{on the altar of}} the Calf. I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> homespun and broadcloth, I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> smock and gaiters, I <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> cap and apron, the servants of the Calf. They swarm on the land and they dot the sea. They are chained to the anvil and counter; they are chained to the bench and the desk. They make ready the soil, they till the fields where the Golden Calf is born. They build the ship, and they sail the ship that carries the Golden Calf. They fashion the pots, they mould the pans, they carve the tables, they turn the chairs, they dream of the sauces, they dig for the salt, they weave the damask, they mould the dish to serve the Golden Calf.|$|R
25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
25|$|One {{summer night}} in 1916, near Ploegsteert, Eden had {{to lead a}} small raid into an enemy trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers, so as to {{identify}} the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in No Man’s Land under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, then he and three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later {{put it in his}} memoirs, a “chilly feeling down our spines”, unsure whether the Germans had not <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention that he had been awarded the Military Cross for the incident, something of which he had made little mention in his political career. On 18 September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme), he wrote to his mother “I have seen things lately that I am not likely to forget”. On 3 October, he was appointed an adjutant, with the rank of temporary lieutenant for the duration of that appointment. At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.|$|E
500|$|All {{species are}} listed either as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] or [...] "Endangered" [...] by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Populations are rapidly declining, and their {{distribution}} is becoming patchy because of local extinctions throughout their range. Although all species {{are protected by}} law in every country in which they occur, conservation efforts are hindered {{by a lack of}} public awareness, since many local villagers and remoter buyers of captive specimens are unaware of their endangered status. Recognition and awareness of slow lorises is even low among national park staff. In places like Vietnam, where these nocturnal primates have commonly been found, most local villagers were not familiar with them when shown photos. Only a few older hunters recognized them, but pointed out that they had not <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> more than 10 or 15years.|$|E

2500|$|What {{men they}} were, these Boers! I {{thought of them}} as I had <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the morning riding forward through the rain—thousands of {{independent}} riflemen, thinking for themselves, possessed of beautiful weapons, led with skill, living as they rode without commissariat or transport or ammunition column, moving like the wind, and supported by iron [...] constitutions and a stern, hard Old Testament God.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Lou Williams, who mentored Monk and his contemporaries, {{spoke of}} Monk's rich {{inventiveness}} in this period, and how such invention was vital for musicians, since {{at the time}} it was common for fellow musicians to incorporate overheard musical ideas into their own works without giving due credit. [...] "So, the boppers worked out a music that was hard to steal. I'll say this for the 'leeches,' though: they tried. I've <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Minton's busily writing on their shirt cuffs or scribbling on the tablecloth. And even our own guys, I'm afraid, did not give Monk the credit he had coming. Why, they even stole his idea of the beret and bop glasses." ...|$|E

2500|$|The hoard was {{discovered}} while ploughing in January 1942 by Gordon Butcher, who removed {{it from the}} ground with help from Sydney Ford, for whom he {{was working at the}} time. Many details of the discovery remained uncertain, not least because it took place in wartime. Apparently they did not at first recognise the objects for what they were, though Ford collected ancient objects. Ford cleaned the pieces and displayed them in his house, using some of them as daily utensils and some, such as the Great Dish, on special occasions with the family. Ford declared the hoard to the authorities in 1946 after a knowledgeable friend had <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> his home. An inquest was held in the summer of that year, when the find was legally declared [...] "treasure trove" [...] and acquired by the British Museum in London. Academic opinion at the time was generally reluctant to believe that such fine-quality Roman silver could possibly have been used in Roman Britain, and so there were many imaginative rumours and even doubts that this was a genuine British find at all. The numerous well documented discoveries of high-quality Roman material in recent decades, including the Hoxne Hoard, have set all such doubts to rest.|$|E
2500|$|Also citing McFly as {{influences}} are British pop {{rock band}} The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 [...] Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated [...] "McFly is a band {{we love to}} be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation... We find ourselves going to the same minor guitar chords like McFly would." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and criticism, Steamtown NHS {{established}} itself in 1995, and by November {{of that year}} The New York Times had printed a favorable review written by Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse, who had visited the site {{with her husband and}} daughter that year. Greenhouse said of Steamtown, [...] "The pleasure of the park is to see trains not only as one might <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a museum but to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> motion. Steamtown is a dynamic museum, with locomotives moving regularly from the yard into the park's architectural centerpiece, the roundhouse".|$|R
