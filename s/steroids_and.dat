40|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{estrogen}} sulfotransferase gene has been cloned and compared to three other cloned <b>steroid</b> <b>and</b> phenol sulfotransferase genes (human estrogen sulfotransferase, human phenol sulfotransferase, and guinea pig 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase). The four sulfotransferase genes demonstrate a common outstanding feature: the splice sites for their 3 '-terminal exons are identically located. That is, the 3 '-terminal exon splice sites involve a glycine that constitutes the N-terminal glycine of an invariably conserved GXXGXXK motif {{present in all}} <b>steroid</b> <b>and</b> phenol sulfotransferases for which primary structures are known. This consistency strongly suggests that all <b>steroid</b> <b>and</b> phenol sulfotransferase genes will be similarly spliced. The GXXGXXK motif forms the active binding site for the universal sulfonate donor 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phosphosulfate. Amino acid sequence alignment of 19 cloned <b>steroid</b> <b>and</b> phenol sulfotransferases starting with the GXXGXXK motif indicates that the 3 '-terminal exon for each <b>steroid</b> <b>and</b> phenol sulfotransferase gene encodes a similarly sized C-terminal fragment of the protein. Interestingly, on further analysis of the alignment, three distinct amino acid sequence patterns emerge. The presence of the conserved functional GXXGXXK motif suggests that the protein domains encoded by <b>steroid</b> <b>and</b> phenol sulfotransferase 3 '-terminal exons have evolved from a common ancestor. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that {{during the course of}} evolution, the 3 '-terminal exon further diverged into at least three sulfotransferase subdivisions: a phenol or aryl group, an estrogen or phenolic <b>steroid</b> group, <b>and</b> a neutral <b>steroid</b> group...|$|R

5|$|On March 13, 1995, Adams {{was arrested}} {{at his home in}} Kona, Hawaii, after {{narcotics}} officers searched his home and discovered 500 units of anabolic <b>steroids</b> <b>and</b> several unregistered semi-automatic guns. He was released on $10,275 bail. On October 28, 1995, he was sentenced to five years probation after pleading no-contest to 11 counts of drug and weapons charges.|$|E

5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, <b>steroids,</b> <b>and</b> fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant <b>steroids</b> <b>and</b> sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal <b>steroids</b> <b>and</b> reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century all of {{the major}} {{pathways}} of drug metabolism had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In {{the early decades of the}} 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the vitamins, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as chromatography and electrophoresis led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as biochemistry—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by Hans Krebs and Carl and Gerty Cori—began to work out many of the central metabolic pathways of life: the citric acid cycle, glycogenesis and glycolysis, and the synthesis of <b>steroids</b> <b>and</b> porphyrins. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Fritz Lipmann and others established the role of ATP as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.|$|E

5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While <b>steroids</b> <b>and</b> NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
