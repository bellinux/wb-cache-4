40|$|Trans-boundary biomass burning smoke episodes have {{increased}} dramatically {{during the past}} 20 - 30 years and have become an annual phenomenon in the SouthEastAsia region. On 15 th October 2010, elevated levels of fire activity were detected by remote sensing satellites (e. g. MODIS). On the same date, measurements of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) at Singapore and Malaysia found high levels of fine mode particles in the local environment. All these observations were indicative of the initial onset of a <b>smoke</b> <b>episode</b> that lasted for several days. In this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of this <b>smoke</b> <b>episode</b> by analyzing the physical and optical properties of smoke particles {{with the aid of}} an AERONET Sun photometer, an MPLNet micropulse lidar, and surface PM 2. 5 measurements. Elevated levels of fire activity coupled with high aerosol optical depth and PM 2. 5 were observed over a period of nine days. Increased variability of parameters such as aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent number and its fine mode equivalents all indicated high levels of fine particulate presence in the atmosphere. Smoke particle growth due to aging, coagulation and condensation mechanisms was detected during the afternoons and over several days. Retrieved lidar ratios were compatible with the presence of fine particulate within the boundary/aerosol layer. Moreover, retrieved particle size distribution as well as single scattering albedo indicated the prevalence of the fine mode particulate regime as well as particles showing enhanced levels of absorption respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn 1997 / 98 {{a severe}} <b>smoke</b> <b>episode</b> due to {{extensive}} biomass burning, especially of peat, was observed over Indonesia. September 1997 was the month {{with the highest}} aerosol burden. This month was simulated using the limited area model REMOTE driven at its lateral boundaries by ERA 40 reanalysis data. REMOTE was extended by a new convective cloud parameterization mimicking individual clouds competing for instability energy. This allows for the interaction of aerosols and convective clouds and precipitation. Results show that convective precipitation is diminished at all places with high aerosol loading, but at some areas with high background humidity precipitation from large-scale clouds may over-compensate the loss in convective rainfall. At individual time steps, very few cases were found when polluted convective clouds produced intensified rainfall via mixed phase microphysics. However, these cases are not unequivocal and opposite results were also simulated, indicating that other than aerosol-microphysics effects have important impact on the results.

40|$|Finland {{experienced}} extraordinary <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes</b> in 2006. The {{smoke was}} {{measured at the}} three SMEAR measurement network stations in Finland after it had been transported several hundreds of kilometers from burning areas in Eastern Europe. A trajectory method combining MODIS fire detections and HYSPLIT trajectories enabled us to separate the effect of biomass burning smoke from the measured concentrations and also study {{the changes in the}} smoke during its transport. The long-range transported smoke included at least NO x, SO 2, CO 2, CO, black carbon and fine aerosol particles, peaking at 100 to 200 nm size. The most reliable smoke markers were CO and SO 2, especially when combined with particle data, for which black carbon or the condensation sink are very effective parameters separating the <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes</b> from no-smoke episodes. Signs of fresh secondary particles was observed based on the particle number size distribution data.

To identify the atmospheric behavior of these pollutants during the smoke haze period, the data generated from the measurement campaign were divided into three distinct periods: prehaze, during haze, and posthaze periods. The 24 [*]hr average data indicated that ambient SO 2, HONO, and HNO 3 during the <b>smoke</b> haze <b>episodes</b> increased by a factor ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 6 compared to those during the prehaze and posthaze periods. Similarly, {{in the case of}} particulates SO 42 - and NO 3 -, the factor ranged from 2. 3 to 4. 2. Backward air trajectories were constructed and used to find the sources of biomass burning to the recurring smoke haze in this region.

40|$|Objectives To {{assess the}} health effects of {{exposure}} to smoke fromthe fifth largest US wildfire of 1999 and to evaluate whether participation ininterventions to reduce smoke exposure prevented adverse lower respiratorytract health effects among residents of the Hoopa Valley National IndianReservation in northwestern California. Design Observational study:epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionretrospectively reviewed medical records at the local medical center andconducted survey interviews of reservation residents. Setting HumboldtCounty, California. Participants Interviews were completed with 289 of 385 residents, representing 26 % of the households on the reservation. Of the 289 participants, 92 (31. 8 %) had preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions. Results During the weeks of the forest fire, medical visits forrespiratory illnesses increased by 217 visits (from 417 to 634 visits, or by 52 %) over the previous year. Survey results indicated that although 181 (62. 6 %) of 289 participants reported worsening lower respiratory tractsymptoms, those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions reported moresymptoms before, during, and after the <b>smoke</b> <b>episode.</b> An increased duration ofthe use of high-efficiency particulate air cleaners and the recollection ofpublic service announcements were associated with a reduced odds of reportingadverse health effects of the lower respiratory tract.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the acute {{impact of the}} wildfire <b>smoke</b> <b>episode</b> in 2008 on the ocular surface of subjects living in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (MABA). Methods: A total of 86 subjects were evaluated: Group 1 comprised patients from a public ophthalmology hospital (N= 35) and Group 2 comprised healthy volunteers (N= 51). All subjects answered a questionnaire on ocular symptoms and underwent ophthalmologic examination [bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, corneal fluorescein staining, rose bengal vital staining, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I test, tear lysozyme, and impression cytology] {{during and after the}} acute episode. Concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and particulate matter (PM) were measured before, during, and after the acute episode. Results: Both groups showed a statically significant increase in ocular symptoms and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and a statically significant decrease in tear break-up time during the acute episode. Group 1 showed more severe symptoms and a statistically significant increase in fluorescein and rose bengal staining intensities during the acute episode. We found a significant negative correlation between ocular symptoms and tear break-up time. During the episode, the levels of CO, NO 2, and particulate matter in MABA were four times higher than the usual average levels for the same period in 2007 and 2009. Conclusions: Increased air pollution from the burning of biomass is associated with a decrease in the stability of the tear film (TBUT), generating areas of ocular surface exposure that may be the cause of the increased feeling of irritation. Group 1 was more affected by not having a healthy ocular surface, and thus consulted an ophthalmologist. Cytological changes in the conjunctiva were not observed, which could be due to the short duration of the episode...|$|E

The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) of these events ranged from 10 up to 6000 MW at 1 km resolution, {{and many of these}} fire episodes resulted in long-range transport of smoke over distances up to several hundred kilometers. Three different <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes</b> over Greece are analyzed here using real time hot-spot observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) satellite instrument as well as from MODIS hot-spots.

The modeled smoke plumes are compared with smoke stereo-heights from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument and the sensitivities to atmospheric and modeling parameters are examined. Driving the simulations with high resolution meteorology (4 4 km) and using geostationary satellite data to identify the hot spots allows the description of local scale features that govern smoke dispersion.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{generated by}} vegetation fire smoke (VFS) {{is a phenomenon}} that has influenced the global environment in prehistoric and historic time scales. Although historic evidence of the impacts of VFS on societies is scarce, {{there are indications that}} VFS has been a factor that influenced society significantly since the Middle Ages. In recent decades, increasing application of fire as a tool for land-use change has resulted in more frequent occurrence of extended fire and <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes</b> with consequences on human health and security. Some of these events have been associated with droughts that are attributed to inter-annual climate variability or possible consequences of regional climate change. In metropolitan or industrial areas, the impacts of VFS may be coupled with the emission burden from fossil fuel burning and other technogenic sources, resulting in increasing adverse affects on the human population. We review the character, magnitude, and role of pyrogenic gaseous and particle emissions on the composition and functioning of the global atmosphere, human health, and security. Special emphasis is given on radioactive emissions generated by fires burning in peatlands and on terrain contaminated by radionuclides. The transboundary effects of VFS pollution are a driving argument for developing international policies to address the underlying causes for avoiding excessive fire application, and to establish sound fire and smoke management practices and protocols of cooperation in wildland fire management at an international level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{network of}} five {{automated}} and two handheld solar radiometers was operated during the 1994 - 1996 Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) in northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada, {{in order to}} characterize the atmospheric aerosol properties. Direct solar measurements were used to measure atmospheric transmission and infer aerosol optical thickness and water vapor column abundance. Near-Sun sky radiance measurements (solar aureole) were used to estimate the aerosol size distribution. Aerosol conditions were heavily influenced by {{the presence or absence}} of forest fires. In 1996, when few fires occurred, conditions were uniform across the region with median aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 500 nm of 0. 12 and 90 th percentlie values of 0. 27 for the May-October period. During the 1994 and 1995 seasons, numerous fires occurred in the vicinity of the sites. The median AOT values were comparable with the 1996 values, though the 90 th percentile values were larger, in general measuring 0. 85 (southern 1994 season was 0. 43). Median column water vapor measurements for the same 7 month period were in the range from 1. 32 to 1. 58 cm at both sites, with 1995 being the driest year of observation. Winter median values of AOT and water vapor were typically 0. 09 and 0. 34 cm, respectively.

This allows for the interaction of aerosols, convective clouds and precipitation. Results show that in the monthly mean convective precipitation is diminished at nearly all places with high aerosol loading, but at some areas with high background humidity precipitation from large-scale clouds may over-compensate the loss in convective rainfall. The simulations revealed that both large-scale and convective clouds' microphysics are in-fluenced by aerosols. Since aerosols are washed and rained out by rainfall, high aerosol concentrations can only persist at low rainfall rates. Hence, aerosol concentrations are not independent of the rainfall amount and in the mean the maximum absolute effects on rainfall from large scale clouds are found at intermediate aerosol concentrations. The reason for this behavior is that at high aerosol concentrations rainfall rates are small and consequently also the anomalies are small. For large-scale {{as well as for}} convective rain negative and positive anomalies are found for all aerosol concentrations. Negative anomalies dominate and are highly statistically significant especially for convective rainfall since part of the precipitation loss from large-scale clouds is compensated by moisture detrained from the convective clouds. The mean precipitation from large-scale clouds is less reduced (however still statistically significant) than rain from convective clouds. This effect is due to detrainment of cloud water from the less strongly raining convective clouds and because of the generally lower absolute amounts of rainfall from large-scale clouds. With increasing aerosol load both, convective and large scale clouds produce less rain. At very few individual time steps cases were found when polluted convective clouds produced intensified rainfall via mixed phase microphysics. However, these cases are not unequivocal and opposite results were also simulated, indicating that other than aerosol-microphysics effects have important impact on the results. Overall, the introduction of the new cumulus parameterization and aerosol-cloud interaction reduced some of the original REMOTE biases of precipitation patterns and total amount...|$|E
40|$|The {{most intense}} {{wildfire}} experienced in Eastern Spain since 2004 happened in Valencia during summer 2012. Although {{the fire was}} mostly active during days 29 – 30 June, a longer temporal period (from 24 June to 4 July) was selected for this analysis. Column-integrated, vertical resolved and surface aerosol observations were performed continuously at the Burjassot station throughout the studied period. The aerosol optical depth at 500 nm shows values larger than 2 for the most intense part of the wildfire and an extremely high maximum of 8 was detected on 29 June. The simultaneous increase of the Ångström exponent was also observed, indicating the important contribution of small particles in the smoke plume. An extraordinary increase in the particle concentration near the ground was observed and hence the measured scattering coefficient was drastically enhanced. The scattering coefficient and the PM 2. 5 level maxima reached the unusually high values of 2100 Mm − 1 and 160 μg m − 3, respectively. These records represent an enhancement factor of 26 and 7 {{with respect to the}} climatological averages found in this station during June and July. The surface maxima were observed with 1 -day lag from the maximum AOD, and this fact is linked with the mixing layer amplitude and the sedimentation of smoke particles. The aerosol microphysical parameters and optical properties were determined for the whole period by combination of an inversion procedure and the Mie Theory. The smoke particles enhanced drastically the volume concentration of the fine mode with a maximum of 0. 4 μm 3 μm − 2, which is 10 times higher than the climatological summer background in this site. The simultaneous presence of dust and smoke particles at different altitudes was observed and hence the coarse mode was also significant during the most intense period of the wildfire episode. Therefore the aerosol single scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter obtained during the smoke cases display high variability which is partially modulated by the volume of coarse particles. The <b>smoke</b> <b>episode</b> highly contributed to increase the load of particles remaining in the atmosphere after the event, especially in the fine mode, although similar aerosol microphysical and optical properties were observed before and after the event. In addition, the particle concentration observed at surface level due to the wildfire episode largely contributes to exceed the EU annual limits for the particulate matter in the studied region...|$|E

40|$|Bushfires (wildfires) are {{becoming}} more frequent and widespread due to the warming climate. The rate of prescribed (fuel reduction) burning has also increased to reduce the intensity of future bushfires. Smoke from bushfires can disperse widely and substantially diminish air quality and is therefore of public health concern. The most important risk related measure of smoke is fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5 aerodynamic diameter < 2. 5 µm). These particulates are significantly elevated during bushfire <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes</b> and could affect large populations away from the fire source. While there has been substantial research into the impacts of ambient particulate pollution on health outcomes, there has been limited research into the impacts of bushfire smoke, despite the higher exposure levels involved. This thesis aimed to examine the health impacts of bushfire smoke exposure. In particular the thesis investigated the impact of bushfire fine particulate matter exposure (PM 2. 5) on cardiovascular and respiratory health effects during the Victorian 2006 - 2007 bushfires. Furthermore, the thesis explored the impact of smoke from prescribed burning on air quality and the potential effects on health. A systematic review was conducted to identify and evaluate studies examining the impact of bushfire particulate matter (PM) on cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. The review indicated consistent and positive associations of PM from bushfire smoke with respiratory morbidity and all-cause mortality, and inconsistent associations with cardiovascular morbidity and cause specific mortality. The coarser particulate matter (PM 10 aerodynamic diameter < 10 µm) was most commonly measured, with few studies investigating the effects of bushfire PM 2. 5. Ground based air quality monitors were a common form of PM measurement in a majority of studies. However, monitored data only provides information from areas surrounding the monitors and therefore cannot adequately represent the bushfire smoke impacts in areas that lack monitoring facilities such as rural/regional areas. This lack of spatially resolved air quality data was a limitation in most studies and an important reason for uncertainties in the health outcomes during bushfire <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes.</b> In order to address the knowledge gaps highlighted in the systematic review, the thesis investigated the association between bushfire PM 2. 5 exposure and cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes using modelled air quality data covering a large geographical area. A time stratified case cross-over study investigated associations between daily average PM 2. 5 concentrations and cardiovascular and respiratory health endpoints during the 2006 - 2007 Victorian bushfires. The study utilised fine spatially resolved modelled estimates of bushfire PM 2. 5 data from a blended model (CSIRO’s air pollution model coupled with a chemical transport model). The highly sophisticated modelling technique enabled projections of air quality data from wider geographical areas including areas heavily impacted by bushfire smoke (rural/regional areas). Health data were obtained from comprehensive health based administrative registries. The cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes examined were out of hospital cardiac arrest, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction, angina, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conditional logistic regression analysis was conducted controlling for temperature and relative humidity A significant positive association was observed between bushfire PM 2. 5 exposure and cardiovascular and respiratory health endpoints. An increase in risk was observed for out of hospital cardiac arrests, IHD related hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits, and asthma related ED visits. In addition, older adults showed a strong association with cardiorespiratory health outcomes. Men showed a positive association for out of hospital cardiac arrests and women a positive association with hospitalisation for IHD and ED presentations for asthma during the bushfire period. The thesis also explored key issues relating to pollution events during prescribed burning and the potential impacts on human health. The findings from the studies that investigated the impact of smoke from prescribed burning on air quality showed increased PM 2. 5 concentrations during burning episodes. The annual occurrence of prescribed burning and poor air quality observed during these events need to be investigated {{in the context of}} growing evidence of adverse health effects due to bushfire PM exposure. The thesis contributes to this important area of debate. The knowledge and evidence from this thesis will inform policy and practice and help build capacity in the understanding and management of adverse health effects during bushfire smoke events...|$|R

[...] The Amazon rain forest plays an important role by sequestering carbon under stable climatic conditions. [...] Forest fires are often not assigned a net emission of carbon as they are viewed as a bi-product of forest conversion for agriculture use, however accidental spread of fires beyond agriculture areas may contribute to increased carbon emissions. [...] If the carbon emissions from forest fires are due to a natural cycle of burning and regrowth, the net carbon balance is nearly zero. [...] However current forest-fire models suggest that forest fragmentation and climate change could shift the Amazon forest from a carbon sink to a source of atmospheric [...] [...] Recurrent fires increase pyrophytic vegetation, such as bamboos and grasses which also increase forest flammability thus increasing potential emissions. [...] In 1997 and 1998 forest fires during the El Niño drought affected at least 20,000 km2 in the Amazon leading to large <b>smoke</b> <b>episodes</b> which halted air traffic in the area and caused ships to collide at sea. The short-term effects on human health effects were irritations of the respiratory tract, skin and eyes, bronchitis, conjuctivitis as well as increased asthma attacks. [...] The major drivers of deforestation and degradation in the Amazon are, forest conversions for shifting cultivation, croplands, pastures as well as industrial and fuel wood harvest. [...] When forests are converted to croplands all initial vegetation is replaced by crops causing a change in the carbon density. [...] Cropland conversion also causes a 25-30% soil carbon reduction. [...] Forest conversion to pastures for cattle is a major cause of deforestation in the Amazon, and although it does not cause the reduced soil carbon seen with croplands, it is still significant primarily due to its sheer magnitude. [...] The harvest of both industrial wood and fuel wood causes increased carbon emissions due to burning and decay of wood products as well as reduced carbon density of forests. [...] Tree plantations result in a carbon sink reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide in participating areas. However within tropical forests worldwide tree plantations have only accounted for an approximately 4% decrease in net carbon emissions.|$|R

Contemporary {{observers}} attributed {{the rise and fall of}} the London fog to variation in emissions of coal smoke, arguing that up to the late 1880 s, Londoners burned excessive amounts of soft coal, while in the years following, legal, demographic, and technological changes mitigated the production of coal <b>smoke.</b> Severe <b>episodes</b> continued to occur for some time after the start of these changes, most notably in 1892, when a five week period of fog caused a very large number of excess deaths. After that, there would be six more weeks with large numbers of excess deaths from fog over the period 1893 - 1900. From 1901 to 1910, the last year of our study, there was a sharp decline in the number of foggy days, and there were no weeks with excess deaths. London had succeeded in mitigating coal pollution. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} of fire-related <b>smoke</b> haze <b>episodes</b> in Southeast Asia {{is important}} for both prediction and assessment of atmospheric impacts, especially when observational data are fragmentary, {{as is the case}} in Indonesia. This work describes the atmospheric fate of smoke particles emitted during the 1997 Indonesian fires modelled with a regional atmospheric chemistry model. We established a new fire emission inventory and calculate that 55 teragram (Tg) of particulate matter and 1098 Tg of carbon were released during this fire episode. Our emission estimate is an intermediate value compared with other studies. Utilising different scenarios, we demonstrate the variable atmospheric impacts of surface vegetation fires and peat soil fires separately and also investigate the sensitivity of smoke dispersion to the differing meteorological conditions of an El Niño and a normal year. When peat fires are included in the emission inventory, modelled ambient particle concentrations exceed the ambient air quality standard across transboundary scales. In a scenario including only surface vegetation fires, ambient air quality standards are exceeded only in areas close to the main fires. This scenario demonstrates the prominent role of fires in peat areas in causing regional air pollution episodes. In years with normal meteorological conditions, intermittent precipitation and associated wet deposition during the dry season are predicted to remove most of the particulate emissions close to the sources. Strongly reduced rainfall and generally stronger southeasterly winds during El Niño years provide favourable conditions for larger scale smoke haze pollution...|$|R
40|$|Background: Air {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} threat to children health. Given that children spend over 80 % of their time indoors, understanding transport of pollutants from outdoor to indoor environments is important for assessing the impact of exposure to outdoor pollution on children health. The most common advice given during a <b>smoke</b> pollution <b>episode</b> is to stay indoors. How well this works depends on how clean the indoor air is and how pollutants from outdoor air contribute to pollutants load in indoor air. Objective: To assess the amount of outdoor air pollution coming indoors threatening children health. Methods: A Medline/EMBASE search of scientific articles was performed to evaluate the indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) concentration ratios of two main pollutants: ultrafine particles (UFP) and ozone (O 3). Result: Under infiltration condition, the highest I/O ratios (0. 6 - 0. 9) were usually observed for larger UFP (70 - 100 nm), while the lowest I/O ratios (0. 1 - 0. 4) occurred typically around 10 - 20 nm. O 3 I/O ratios vary according to air exchange and may be 0. 6 - 0. 8 for interiors having a large volume exchange with outdoor air (i. e. open windows) and 0. 3 - 0. 4 with conventional air conditioning systems. Conclusions: In the absence of indoor sources or activities, indoor UFP particles originate from outdoors. O 3 concentration indoors may reach concentration similar to outdoors. Environmental and energy policies must also explicitly account for all the impacts of fossil fuel combustion on child health and development...|$|R
40|$|An {{intensive}} {{field study}} was conducted in the urban atmosphere of Singapore to investigate the composition of organic compounds in both gaseous and particulate phases during the period of August to early November 2006. 17 atmospheric samples were collected. These samples were subjected to accelerated solvent extraction with a mixture of dichloromethane and acetone and separated into functional group fractions for analyses by GC/MS. Over 180 organic compounds belonging to three major fractions (n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons – PAHs, and polar organic compounds – POCs) were identified and quantified. The characteristics and abundance of the n-alkanes, PAHs, mono and dicarboxylic acids, methoxylated phenols and other POCs were determined. The composition of these organic compounds fluctuated temporally with most of them being relatively higher in October than those in other months of the sampling period. 3 -D backward air mass trajectory analyses together with the carbon preference index (CPI), molecular diagnostic ratios and molecular markers were used to investigate the origin of organic species measured in this study. Based on these diagnostic tools, the increased abundance of atmospheric organic species during October could be attributed to the occurrence of regional <b>smoke</b> haze <b>episodes</b> due to biomass burning in Indonesia. Among the POCs investigated, phthalic acid and cis-pinonic acid were abundant during October 2006. These two acids showed strong linear relationships with maximum daily ozone concentrations throughout the entire sampling period. This correlation with ozone suggested that the secondary aerosol constituents such as phthalic and cis-pinonic acids were probably formed through O 3 -induced photochemical transformation...|$|R
40|$|Background Reliance on biomass fuels {{for cooking}} and heating exposes many women and young {{children}} in developing countries {{to high levels of}} air pollution indoors. Exposure to biomass smoke has been linked to reduced birth weight, acute respiratory infections, and childhood mortality. This study examines the association between household use of biofuels (wood, dung, and crop residues) for cooking and heating and prevalence of anaemia and stunting in children. Methods Data are from a 1998 – 99 national family health survey in India, which measured height, weight, and blood haemoglobin of 29 768 children aged 0 – 35 months in 92 486 households. Multinomial logistic regression is used to estimate the effects of biofuel use on prevalence of anaemia and stunting, controlling for exposure to tobacco <b>smoke,</b> recent <b>episodes</b> of illness, maternal education and nutrition, and other potentially confounding factors. Results Analysis shows that prevalence of moderate-to-severe anaemia was significantly higher among children in households using biofuels than among children in households using cleaner fuels (RRR 5 1. 58; 95 % CI: 1. 28, 1. 94), independent of other factors. Prevalence of severe stunting was also significantly higher among children in biofuel-using households (RRR 5 1. 84; 95 % CI: 1. 44, 2. 36). Thirty-one per cent of moderate-to-severe anaemia and 37 % of severe stunting among children aged 6 – 35 months in India may be attributable to exposure to biofuel smoke. Effects on mild anaemia and moderate stunting were smaller, but positive and statistically significant. Effects of exposure to tobacco smoke on anaemia and stunting were small and not significant. Conclusions The study provides a first evidence of the strong association between biofuel use and risks of anaemia and stunting in children, suggesting that exposure to biofuel smoke may contribute to chronic nutritional deficiencies in young children...|$|R
30|$|We {{propose to}} study the medium- and {{long-term}} 2 effects of air pollution on labor supply, using data from Indonesia and {{taking advantage of a}} natural experiment that offers the unique opportunity of having a truly randomly assigned pollution shock. In the fall of 1997, large parts of Indonesia were engulfed in forest fires that originated with slash-and-burn practices commonly used by farmers as a cheap way of clearing land but were aggravated by the especially dry and windy season caused by El Niño. The fires burned out of control between August and November 1997, destroying over 12 million acres of land and covering much of Indonesia in <b>smoke</b> 3. This <b>episode</b> has been widely used in the literature to study a variety of issues surrounding air pollution. Frankenberg et al. (2004) find older individuals exposed to the smoke are less able to perform daily activities. Jayachandran (2009) finds reduced fertility in the areas most exposed to pollution. Kunii et al. (2002) find elevated levels of respiratory illnesses during the fires, which might have indirect effects on hours worked. The pollution was so severe that even neighboring countries suffered from it. Emmanuel (2000) and Heil (2000), for instance, find an increase in respiratory illnesses and other acute health issues in Singapore, while Sastry (2002) finds increased mortality among the elderly in Malaysia. All these documented health issues could have direct effects on labor markets, and these effects could persist over time. Our paper tries to fill-in this gap of the literature and study these longer-term effects of pollution on labor supply.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} air pollution transport into the Arctic. The major transport processes will be highlighted, {{as well as their}} seasonal, interannual, and spatial variability. The source regions of Arctic air pollution will be discussed, with a focus on black carbon (BC) sources, as BC can produce significant radiative forcing in the Arctic. It is found that Europe is the main source region for BC in winter, whereas boreal forest fires are the strongest source in summer, especially in years of strong burning. Two case studies of recent extreme Arctic air pollution events will be presented. In summer 2004, boreal forest fires in Alaska and Canada caused pan-Arctic enhancements of black carbon. The BC concentrations measured at Barrow (Alaska), Alert (Canada), Summit (Greenland) and Zeppelin (Spitsbergen) were all episodically elevated, {{as a result of the}} long-range transport of the biomass burning emissions. Aerosol optical depth was also episodically elevated at these stations, with an almost continuous elevation over more than a month at Summit. During the second episode in spring 2006, new records were set for all measured air pollutant species at the Zeppelin station (Spitsbergen) as well as for ozone in Iceland. At Zeppelin, BC, AOD, aerosol mass, ozone, carbon monoxide and other compounds all reached new record levels, compared to the long-term monitoring record. The episode was caused by transport of polluted air masses from Eastern Europe deep into the Arctic, a consequence of the unusual warmth in the European Arctic during the episode. While fossil fuel combustion sources certainly contributed to this <b>episode,</b> <b>smoke</b> from agricultural fires in Eastern Europe was the dominant pollution component. We also suggest a new revolatilization mechanism for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) stored in soils and vegetation by fires, as POPs were strongly elevated during both episodes. All this suggests a considerable influence of biomass burning on the pollutant concentrations in the Arctic in spring and summer, even for species that are produced exclusively by humans, such as POPs...|$|R
