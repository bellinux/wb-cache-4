5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E
25|$|The <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> {{is fully}} customizable. Users can right click the <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> and add or remove {{what they want}} the <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> to display.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Status</b> <b>bars,</b> and <b>status</b> lines before them, {{have been}} used for years to display {{advisory}} messages in a predefined area, predating dialog boxes which can block the view of related information behind the pop-up messages. The use of <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> (or <b>status</b> lines) involves both advantages and disadvantages: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Status</b> <b>bars</b> might {{restrict}} {{information to}} a one-line display (although a variable multi-line status bar/region could be used); ...|$|R
50|$|The player's overall {{status is}} {{measured}} by seven <b>status</b> <b>bars.</b> All stats save for food will replenish through time and resting.|$|R
25|$|Word count {{listed by}} default in the <b>status</b> <b>bar.</b> The word count {{dynamically}} updates as you type.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} limit {{scripting}} functions, {{such as those}} that modify the <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> or adjust the size or position of the browser window was introduced with IE7.|$|E
25|$|The {{address bar}} and <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> appear in all windows {{including}} popups which helps to block malicious sites from disguising them as trusted sites. Also the address bar features a color code to visually indicate the trustworthiness of the page. The address bar turns red when a page, with invalid security certificate, is accessed. In case of sites not using any encryption, the address bar is white. And if the page uses high security certificate, the bar turns green.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple and per screen <b>status</b> <b>bars,</b> {{including}} {{a variety of}} widgets (text and icon boxes, graphs, progress bars, and so on).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Status</b> <b>bars</b> {{typically}} cannot pop to {{the surface}} for critical messages when its parent window is layered below others (but are always visible in the parent window, which can be raised).|$|R
50|$|Contrary to the {{previous}} three Anchor types, ScreenAnchors do not describe a location in the 3-dimensional virtual scene. Instead, they define an area on the device screen, allowing for <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> and the like.|$|R
25|$|When {{the cursor}} hovers over a link, {{depending}} on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the <b>status</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} graphics {{were created}} {{with a special}} graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of all the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's code uses to access, and are combined to form complete images on the screen in real time. The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo's custom MMC3 (memory management controller) ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. [...] The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield {{on the top and}} a <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> on the bottom, allowing the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, HTC began {{rolling out}} an upgrade to Android 4.2.2 in {{selected}} regions; alongside internal changes, it added a quick settings panel to the notification area, Instagram support for BlinkFeed, auto focus/auto exposure lock to the camera, additional Highlights themes, and optimized how Zoes are saved (producing a static JPG and a MP4 video file, instead of saving each frame {{as a separate}} image file). The upgrade also added the ability to show the current battery percentage on the <b>status</b> <b>bar,</b> more consistent behavior for the home key, allows the removal of icons from the home screen’s dock, allows the Home key {{to serve as the}} deprecated [...] "Menu" [...] key in certain apps by long-pressing (in lieu of displaying it on a black bar on-screen), allows Google Now to be accessed by swiping up from the home button, and adds support for displaying widgets on the lock screen (however, unlike stock Android, only one widget can be placed on the lock screen at a time).|$|E
5000|$|Themes: Formerly {{known as}} [...] "Personas". Strictly modify certain {{elements}} of the user interface. Their most prominently featured change is the background image that they add to toolbars, menu <b>bars</b> and <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> of the main application window. They may change the text and background color as well.|$|R
25|$|Common Control Library: Gives {{applications}} {{access to}} some advanced controls provided by the operating system. These include things like <b>status</b> <b>bars,</b> progress bars, toolbars and tabs. The library resides in a dynamic-link library (DLL) file called commctrl.dll on 16-bit Windows, and comctl32.dll on 32-bit Windows. It is grouped under the User Interface category of the API.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{items include}} magical potions, scrolls, and wands (which {{can help to}} {{replenish}} the <b>status</b> <b>bars,</b> increase the bars' lengths, or aid in fighting monsters) as well as useless items {{which can only be}} eliminated by depositing them in recycling bins. Miscellaneous items such as checkers can be bought, although they serve no purpose other than gifts.|$|R
500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when the phone is held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When the phone is off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E
2500|$|Security zone {{information}} and Protected Mode status, progress bar, and other <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> elements {{except for the}} Zoom button ...|$|E
2500|$|Along {{the top of}} {{the screen}} is a <b>status</b> <b>bar,</b> showing {{information}} about the device and its connectivity. This <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> can be [...] "pulled" [...] down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates. Notifications are [...] "short, timely, and relevant information about your app when it’s not in use", and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification. Beginning with Android 4.1 [...] "Jelly Bean", [...] "expandable notifications" [...] allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification.|$|E

50|$|Monsters {{have two}} <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> in each game, health and stamina. Like the {{standard}} fighting game formula, {{every time a}} monster takes damage, their overall Health bar drops until it is completely depleted, resulting in player defeat. Stamina determines how much energy a monster can attack with. The bar drops if a monster picks up another foe or performs a ranged attack. If the bar is full, a monster can perform special attacks, whereas if the bar is completely drained, they become temporarily immobilized.|$|R
50|$|NVDA uses {{objects to}} {{represent}} elements in an application such as menu <b>bars,</b> <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> and various foreground windows. Various information about an object {{such as its}} name, value and screen coordinates are gathered by NVDA through accessibility API's exposed by an object, such as through UIA (User Interface Automation). The gathered information is passed through various subsystems, such as speech handler and presented to the user in speech, braille and via on-screen window. NvDA also provides facilities to handle events such as key presses, name changes and when an application gains or loses focus.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> {{no longer}} allows custom text to be entered (e.g.: [...] "Formatting C:\ 10% Complete |||||||") {{and will always}} show the URL of any link hovered over, for security. It now also shows the target URL of form buttons to help {{identify}} forms which submit their data to suspicious sites.|$|E
2500|$|... iTunes 11 {{removes the}} Cover Flow option, {{previously}} the default viewing method for a user's music collection. It also disables the sidebar by default, focusing on spreading content across {{the width of}} the window. The <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> is also disabled by default. Both of these may be reactivated by the user. The sidebar design has been slightly altered, reinstating the colored icons removed in iTunes 10. When the sidebar is not activated, users can move between media libraries using a drop down menu below the control buttons.|$|E
2500|$|The Settings app {{received}} multiple {{changes in}} iOS 6. The icon was revised {{to match the}} System Preferences icon used in the then-named OS X computer operating system developed by Apple; and a [...] "Do Not Disturb" [...] mode was added, which allows users to disable phone sounds. Additional options for Do Not Disturb mode include being able to allow phone calls from a specific group of contacts, and allowing sound on the second call if someone calls repeatedly. A crescent moon icon {{will appear in the}} <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> when Do Not Disturb mode is enabled.|$|E
5000|$|... eComStation 1.1 {{included}} several major new features compared to version 1.0. The largest {{change to the}} operating system as installed was a package of wide-ranging functional enhancements to the desktop environment (Workplace Shell), based on the open source XWorkplace project from NetLabs.org. These included desktop folder enhancements such as <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> and improved sorting options, a new virtual desktop feature, a customizable desktop toolbar with support for programmable [...] "widgets", and expanded configuration options. Various other enhancements such as built-in support for PPPoE and PPtP Internet connections were also provided.|$|R
50|$|Sound in the Interface domain expresses what is {{happening}} in the game. In many video games this is sound related to activity in the HUD, such as sounds synced to health and <b>status</b> <b>bars,</b> pop-up menus and the score display. Although sound in this domain often follows ICT interface sound design conventions (abstract iconic and non-iconic signs), there are many games that intentionally try to blur the boundaries of Interface and Effect by mimicking the diegetic concept. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Interface sound instances consist of the skidding, grinding and sliding sounds of skateboards.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} possible to remedy screen burn-in {{through the use}} of remedial software and remedial devices. This displays random colors on every pixel of the panel to fix the burn-in, but in severe cases (like physical damage) this may not resolve the problem. In the case of OLED screens on Android phones, burn-in reduction apps can display an inverted image of the navigation and <b>status</b> <b>bars</b> (which are constantly displayed and therefore the most likely elements to be burned in) to burn in opposite pattern, resulting in a screen that is entirely burned in (i.e. the entire display is dimmer than it was from the factory, but there are now no visibly burned in patterns).|$|R
2500|$|... iOS 9 {{comes with}} two {{important}} battery-saving updates. When a phone {{has been placed}} face-down, the screen will not light up upon receiving notifications. Apple has also added Low Power Mode, which modifies {{the amount of energy}} dedicated to background services and animations. For example, background app refresh and push email are paused during Low Power Mode. When a phone reaches 20% battery level, users are automatically prompted to turn on Low Power Mode, which changes the color of the battery icon in the top row <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> on the screen. When the battery goes higher than the 80% level, Low Power Mode automatically turns back off.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{interface}} of KitKat further downplays the [...] "Holo" [...] interface appearance introduced on 4.0, replacing remaining {{instances of}} blue accenting with greys and white (such as the <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> icons). Apps may trigger a translucent status and navigation bar appearance, or trigger a {{full screen mode}} ("Immersive mode") to hide them entirely. The launcher also received a refreshed appearance, {{with the implementation of}} the translucent navigation bars, and the replacement of the black backdrop in the application drawer with a translucent backdrop. Additionally, action overflow menu buttons in apps are always visible, even on devices with the deprecated [...] "Menu" [...] navigation key. In the Settings menu, users can now specify a default Home (launcher) and text messaging app.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} an instant hit, and a second series {{twice as long as}} the first was {{commissioned}} the next year, closely followed by a third the year after that. By the time this third series finished, Child felt the dungeon format was getting too restrictive, and he needed something new. Because of this, the fourth series saw the introduction of many 'outdoor' scenes, filmed around places such as medieval castles across the UK, and composited into the blue room using the usual chromakey technique. This series also saw the introduction of the [...] "Eye Shield", which acted as an 'eye' for the dungeoneer. Using pre-recorded footage filmed on location, it followed the progress of the dungeoneers as they explored the dungeon. A new onscreen <b>status</b> <b>bar</b> was also introduced, generated by a Commodore Amiga 2000 computer.|$|E
50|$|Themes, {{originally}} called Personas, allow {{users to}} quickly change {{the look of}} their applications. Although support for Personas was initially available as an extension, the feature was built into Firefox 3.6, and later other applications. These background themes differ from traditional themes available before, which were implemented as Mozilla extensions. Mozilla themes are more basic, easier to create, and easier to install, but are limited to changing the background image, background color and text color of toolbars, menu <b>bars</b> and <b>status</b> <b>bars.</b> They cannot alter the shape or appearance of toolbar items or tabs {{in the way that}} extensions can. In regards to installation, they can be installed and activated with exactly one click.|$|R
50|$|Some {{platforms}} (such as the Commodore 64, Amiga, Sega Master System, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Super NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS) {{provide a}} horizontal blank interrupt for automatically setting the registers {{independently of the}} rest of the program. Others, such as the NES, require the use of cycle-timed code, which is specially written to take exactly as long to execute as the video chip takes to draw one scanline, or timers inside game cartridges that generate interrupts after a given number of scanlines have been drawn. Many NES games use this technique to draw their <b>status</b> <b>bars,</b> and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game and Vice: Project Doom for NES use it to scroll background layers at different rates.|$|R
50|$|Sergio Covarrubias Garcia (born March 1, 1977) is a California {{attorney}} {{specializing in}} personal injury. On February 1, 2014, Garcia, then 36, {{became the first}} illegal immigrant {{to be admitted to}} the State Bar of California since 2008, when applicants were first required to list citizenship <b>status</b> on <b>bar</b> applications.|$|R
