5|$|As the {{lifeboats}} {{were brought}} alongside Carpathia, the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in <b>slings,</b> {{and the children were}} hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|E

Athletic games include running and jumping, throwing and wrestling. Circus games are described, with chariot racing, horse racing and vaulting. In the theatre, comedy, tragedy, mime and dance are covered. In the amphitheatre, Isidore covers those who fight with nets, nooses and other weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Sling: a [...] "Ching" [...] or [...] "CW" [...] <b>sling.</b> Against common practice, Cooper {{advocated}} {{the use of}} a <b>sling</b> as a shooting aid. The Ching <b>sling</b> offers the convenience of a carrying strap and the steadiness of a target shooter's <b>sling</b> with the speed of a biathlete's <b>sling.</b> (The CW <b>sling</b> is a simpler version of a Ching <b>sling,</b> consisting of a single strap.) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> with a new Vicryl mesh rectus fascia (VMRF) <b>sling</b> in the {{surgical}} treatment of low urethral pressure genuine stress incontinence. Fifty-one consecutive women who had a VMRF (n = 27) or a pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (n = 24) procedure between March 1995 and December 1997 were evaluated. The patient-determined subjective success rate of the VMRF <b>sling</b> (85 %) was significantly higher than that of the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (58 %) in women with low urethral pressure stress incontinence (P= 0. 03). The objective success rates following the VMRF and the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> were 52 % and 50 %, respectively. The prevalence of postoperative symptomatic voiding dysfunction and de novo detrusor instability was 7 % after the VMRF <b>sling</b> and 25 % following the pubovaginal <b>sling</b> (P= 0. 08). The VMRF <b>sling</b> had a higher patient-determined success rate and a lower complication rate than the pubovaginal <b>sling,</b> and should be considered in the surgical management of women with low urethral pressure stress incontinence...|$|R
50|$|A whoopie <b>sling</b> is {{an easily}} {{adjustable}} rope <b>sling</b> designed for tree pruning or tree removal. The whoopie <b>sling</b> works by wrapping the <b>sling</b> around {{the trunk of}} a tree or a heavy load bearing limb and pulling the end of the rope within the <b>sling</b> through a spliced choker. By adjusting the size of the eye in the rope through the choker the user is able to adjust the length of the <b>sling</b> constricting around the tree without needing knots. It is also becoming more common (usually in smaller diameter) for suspending hammocks during hiking or camping.|$|R
5|$|Many Indonesian batik {{patterns}} are symbolic. Infants are carried in batik <b>slings</b> decorated with symbols {{designed to bring}} the child luck, and certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, {{as well as their}} families. Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore. Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs.|$|E
5|$|Rome's forces used typical Roman {{equipment}} including pila (heavy javelins) and hastae (thrusting spears) {{as weapons}} {{as well as}} traditional helmets, shields and body armor. On the other hand, the Carthaginian army {{used a variety of}} equipment. The Iberians fought with swords suited for cutting and thrusting, as well as javelins and various types of spears. For defense, Iberian warriors carried large oval shields and the falcata. The Gauls were likely wearing no armor, and the typical Gallic weapon was usually a long, slashing sword. The heavy Carthaginian cavalry carried two javelins and a curved slashing sword, with a heavy shield for protection. The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and used no armor but carried small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or longer blade. Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either <b>slings</b> or spears. The Balearic slingers, who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long <b>slings</b> used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself was wearing musculata armor and carried a falcata as well.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{artillery}} guns were deployed, including heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example <b>slings</b> and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain how far the guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges of artillery suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of the Ching Sling {{maintain}} that the <b>sling</b> allows faster and quieter acquisition of shooting support. The <b>sling</b> requires no shifting of <b>sling</b> loops when converting from carrying mode to shooting mode {{and can be used}} on any rifle with existing <b>sling</b> loops in the normal locations {{with the addition of a}} middle <b>sling</b> loop and is flexible enough to be used with the rear loop located anywhere between the pistol grip cap and the end of the buttstock.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} of the single point <b>sling</b> is used in precision target rifle shooting from the prone position. The <b>sling</b> is not intended as a carrying aid, but is used to steady the rifle. For a right-handed shooter, the <b>sling</b> attaches {{to the top of}} the left arm, and clips onto the forend of the rifle. The left arm is wrapped under the <b>sling.</b> The <b>sling</b> with upper and lower arm form three sides of a triangle that provide a steady support for the rifle.|$|R
5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, <b>slings,</b> throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean armies were {{initially}} based on heavy infantry, equipped with spears, large shields {{and in some}} occasion armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a secondary role in combat. Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, <b>slings</b> and javelins. The precise role and contribution of chariots on the battlefield {{is a matter of}} dispute {{due to the lack of}} sufficient evidence. It appears that chariots {{were initially}} used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.|$|E
5|$|New {{material}} was teased in early in October 2014 on NZ radio and Fat Freddy's Drop released <b>Slings</b> and Arrows 17 October 2014. Starting with an 8-bit intro the song blossomed in {{to what they}} said was their most reggae track thus far. The subsequent album Bays was released the following year on 23 October 2015, reaching the number 1 in New Zealand and 12 In Australia. The album title is derived from their home base in Wellington where the majority of the album was written. Widening the sphere of influence which colours their music the new album features more electronic flavour in Wheels and Cortina Motors, which seems like a true evolution, and more soulful moments in Makkan where Dallas already resides.|$|E
50|$|The {{load on the}} <b>sling</b> is {{the same}} in each example. For the V arrangement, the anchor force {{is equal to the}} tension in the <b>sling,</b> but for the {{triangle}} the anchor force is greater than the <b>sling</b> tension.|$|R
50|$|Like the CW Sling, the Ching <b>sling</b> uses three <b>sling</b> sockets. Unlike the CW Sling, the Ching <b>sling</b> {{consists}} of a main strap, which {{is attached to the}} forearm and buttstock sockets like a normal carry <b>sling,</b> and a short strap. A clockwise half twist in the <b>sling</b> at the fore-end socket allows the strap to lie flat against the arm when shooting. A stop button screws onto the main strap about two-thirds back from the front loop. The short strap attaches to the middle socket and to an oval ring that slides freely along the main strap between the forearm <b>sling</b> loop and the button. The unfinished side faces the muzzle.|$|R
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{gastroesophageal}} junction {{of the human}} with the pig, M 2 and M 3 receptor densities and the potencies of M 2 and M 3 muscarinic receptor subtype selective antagonists were determined in gastric clasp and <b>sling</b> smooth muscle fibers. Total muscarinic and M 2 receptors are higher in pig than human clasp and <b>sling</b> fibers. M 3 receptors are higher in human compared with pig <b>sling</b> fibers but lower in human compared with pig clasp fibers. Clasp fibers have fewer M 3 receptors than <b>sling</b> fibers in both humans and pigs. Similar to human clasp fibers, pig clasp fibers contract significantly less than pig <b>sling</b> fibers. Analysis of the methoctramine Schild plot suggests that M 2 receptors are involved in mediating contraction in pig clasp and <b>sling</b> fibers. Darifenacin potency suggests that M 3 receptors mediate contraction in pig <b>sling</b> fibers and that M 2 and M 3 receptors mediate contraction in pig clasp fibers. Taken together, the data suggest that both M 2 and M 3 muscarinic receptors mediate the contraction in both pig clasp and <b>sling</b> fibers similar to human clasp and <b>sling</b> fibers...|$|R

5|$|There {{are around}} 31hill forts in Dorset; {{archaeologist}} Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts {{were used to}} control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with <b>slings.</b> Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.|$|E
5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The second class were armed similarly to the first class, but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with <b>slings</b> and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} little evidence available to guide sur-geons on {{the management of}} a patient with a failed midurethral <b>sling.</b> 1 The reported results by Walsh and colleagues suggest a pubovaginal <b>sling</b> is effective at treat-ing stress incontinence after a failed midurethral <b>sling.</b> 2 In our cohort of patients, 3 16 / 33 had a previous midurethral <b>sling,</b> and half of these had experienced a vaginal or urethral erosion.

One hundred women with the main complaint of stress urinary incontinence were randomized to be treated with either mini <b>sling</b> (Ophira) or autologous rectus facia pubovaginal <b>sling.</b> Preoperative evaluation consisted of: physical examination, blood biochemistry urine analysis and culture, urinary tract ultrasound scan, conventional multi-channel urodynamic study, cystourethroscopy, cough induced stress test and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ). The patients were objectively and subjectively re-evaluated at 1, 3, 6 and 12 postoperative months and the last visit and the collected data of more than one year follow-up were compared with preoperative assessments. Seventy two out of one hundred patients were followed for a mean time of 13. 8 ± 4. 4 months (12 - 20 months range). Objective cure rate, according to cough-induced stress test was recorded in 88. 6 % and 89. 2 % of the mini <b>sling</b> (Ophira) and the rectus facia <b>sling</b> group respectively (P= 1. 0).

5|$|Manco Inca had {{gathered}} more than 30,000troops at Ollantaytambo, among them, {{a large number}} of recruits from tribes of the Amazon Rainforest. Manco Inca's forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training. This was the regular fare in the Inca Empire, where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old. In combat, these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders, called kurakas. They used melee weapons such as maces, clubs and spears as well as ranged weapons such as arrows, javelins, and slings; protective gear included helmets, shields, and quilted cloth armor. Against the conquistadors, wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate Spanish armor; <b>slings</b> and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and the large size of their projectiles. Even so, Inca soldiers were no match for the Spanish cavalry in open terrain so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain and digging pits in open fields to hinder the mobility of horses.|$|E
