40|$|The R package micromap is used {{to create}} linked micromaps, which display <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> {{associated}} with areal units, or polygons. Linked micromaps provide a means to simultaneously summarize and display both statistical and geographic distributions by linking <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> {{to a series of}} small maps. The package contains functions dependent on the ggplot 2 package to produce a row-oriented graph composed of different panels, or columns, of information. These panels at a minimum typically contain maps, a legend, and <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> with the color-coded legend linking the maps and <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries.</b> We first describe the layout of linked micromaps and then the structure required for both the spatial and statistical datasets. The function create_map_table in the micromap package converts the input of an sp SpatialPolygonsDataFrame into a data frame that can be linked with the statistical dataset. Highly detailed polygons are not appropriate for display in linked micromaps so we describe how polygon boundaries can be simplified, decreasing the time required to draw the graphs, while retaining adequate detail for detection of spatial patterns. Our worked examples of linked micromaps use public health data as well as environmental data collected from spatially balanced probabilistic surveys...|$|R

Consequently, many parallel performance tools [2, 4, 7, 9, 11] include one or more utilities, such as Gantt charts [3] or <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> to measure and display processor utilization information. <b>Statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> provide integrated totals of processor use [5].

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} case study to {{demonstrate}} a process for grouping massive multivariate time series based on nonparametric <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> aided by information visualization. We want a method {{that allows us to}} quickly find approximate groups in time series, both to identify typical aggregate behaviors and to find aberrant outliers. We use simple <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> to capture the temporal nature and variability of the time series, as well as the interaction between the various multivariate components. Each individual time series is mapped to a fixed-length vector of summaries. The summary vectors are then clustered using any fast clustering algorithm like  -means. Appropriate information visualization techniques are used at every stage to guide the analyst. Because the method is nonparametric, it is customizable and flexible, and it generalizes easily. When choosing the <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries,</b> we can incorporate domain knowledge that may enhance the clustering. We demonstrate with a massive real life telecommunications application.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} (often valuable) {{information}} {{are stored in}} web-accessible text databases. "Metasearchers" provide unified interfaces to query multiple such databases at once. For efficiency, metasearchers rely on succinct <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> of the database contents to select the best databases for each query. So far, database selection research has largely assumed that databases are static, so the associated <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> {{do not need to}} change over time. However, databases are rarely static and the <b>statistical</b> <b>summaries</b> that describe their contents need to be updated periodically to reflect content changes. In this paper, we first report the results of a study showing how the content summaries of 152 real web databases evolved over a period of 52 weeks. Then, we show how to use "survival analysis" techniques in general, and Cox's proportional hazards regression in particular, to model database changes over time and predict when we should update each content summary. Finally, we exploit our change model to devise update schedules that keep the summaries up to date by contacting databases only when needed, and then we evaluate the quality of our schedules experimentally over real web databases...|$|R
