5|$|In 1938 for a dance {{composition}} titled Bacchanale, John Cage {{invented the}} prepared piano, producing both transformed pitches and colorful unpitched <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> the piano. Many variations, such as prepared guitar, have followed. In 1952, Cage wrote 4′33″, {{in which there}} is no deliberate sound at all, but only whatever background noise occurs during the performance.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Les Chants Magnétiques was {{released}} on 20 May 1981, Oxygène and Équinoxe had achieved global sales of about 6million units. In its first two months the new album sold a reported 200,000units in France alone. The album uses <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> the Fairlight CMI, a new instrument of which Jarre was an early pioneer. Its digital technology allowed him to continue his earlier sonic experimentation in new ways.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> the video games.|$|E
5|$|Like other corvids, ravens can mimic <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by}} the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.|$|E
5|$|Steve Selby {{served as}} the lead {{broadcaster}} for the <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> 1996 to 1999, after which he left to call games for the Memphis Redbirds. Chuck Valenches, a former assistant broadcaster, was promoted {{to the role of}} lead broadcaster from 2000 to 2009. Stu Paul was the Sounds' play-by-play man for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. Jeff Hem has been the team's lead broadcaster since 2012. All Sounds home and road games are broadcast on ALT 97.5FM. Live audio broadcasts are also available online through the team's website and iHeartRadio.|$|E

5|$|For {{the album}} session, Steve Albini was engineer, Josephine Wiggs {{replaced}} Halliday on bass, Britt Walford played drums, and both Deal and Donelly played guitar. Following {{two weeks of}} practicing in England, the Breeders recorded Pod at the Palladium studio in Scotland. Albini recorded the group quickly, and focused more on getting good <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> the musical equipment than on trying to improve the musicians' performances. Critics have discussed similarities between Pod and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Kerry Packer {{established}} the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced {{many of the}} now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> {{the players on the}} pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England {{and other parts of the}} world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Managed by Mike Guerrero, the 2012 Sounds {{finished}} {{the season in}} second place with a losing 67–77 record, sixteen games behind first-place Omaha. Nashville set a franchise record low win–loss record in 2013. The 57–87season eclipsed the previous franchise record set in 2008. Despite the team's performance, pitcher Johnny Hellweg won the PCL Pitcher of the Year Award, and Guerrero was selected for the Mike Coolbaugh Award in recognition for his contributions to the game. Tim Dillard, who pitched for the <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> 2007 to 2014, set three career franchise records during his Sounds career: wins (39), innings pitched (556⅔), and runs allowed (302).|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would help make the music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{companies}} that he recorded for at this stage in his career reduced Hope's dignity, in the view of musician and critic Robert Palmer. One album was entitled High Hope! (1961), and another, released as <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> Rikers Island (1963) in reference to a New York City jail complex, featured performances exclusively by musicians who had at some point been imprisoned for drug-related crimes. Between these two sessions as leader, Hope was briefly in prison again for drug offenses. These and other album releases in the early 1960s did little to develop a wider awareness of Hope.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they decided whether to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpecker species {{live up to}} their name and feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall the family is characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic. The diet includes ants, termites, beetles and their larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other arthropods, bird eggs, nestlings, small rodents, lizards, fruit, nuts and sap. Many insects and their grubs are taken from living and dead trees by excavation. The bird may hear <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> inside the timber indicating where it will be productive to create a hole.|$|E
5|$|Three former Sounds {{players have}} also managed the Sounds. Seven games into the 1985 season, Leon Roberts, {{who started the}} season as a Nashville outfielder, became the acting manager for seven games due to manager Lee Walls coming down with an illness. Roberts was {{replaced}} by Gordon Mackenzie and returned to playing for the Sounds. After later retiring from playing, Roberts was hired to manage the 1986 team. Wayne Garland, who pitched for the Sounds in 1982, managed the team briefly during the 1988 managerial shuffle. Marty Brown managed the <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> 2001 to 2002 after having played for Nashville in 1988 and 1989.|$|E

5|$|To {{mark the}} album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in {{high-resolution}} SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc {{one of the}} album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly {{identical to the original}} version; track anomalies such as <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.|$|E
5|$|Age of Empires (under {{the working}} title Dawn of Man) {{was the first}} game {{developed}} by Ensemble Studios. Its historical setting was chosen to be more plausible and accessible, particularly to casual gamers, than existing games. At the time, other real-time strategy games had science fiction and fantasy settings, so the historical setting of Age of Empires enabled it to stand out. The designers received much of their inspiration from the game Civilization, with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive. Age of Empires was designed by Bruce Shelley, Tony Goodman (in charge of the game's artwork), and Dave Pottinger (in charge of the game's artificial intelligence). Stephen Rippy was the music director (a role he kept through the series), with occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in Age of Empires using <b>sounds</b> <b>from</b> actual instruments from the periods in the game, {{as well as their}} digital samples. The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.|$|E
5|$|Nashville {{ended the}} 2000 {{season with a}} 63–79 record, {{resulting}} in a last-place finish in the divisional standings. Richie Hebner, the Sounds' pitching coach, replaced Trent Jewett as manager when he became the Pirates' third base coach on June 6. Former All-Star Sounds infielder Marty Brown returned to the club to serve as its 25th manager in 2001, becoming the third former Nashville player {{to serve as the}} team's skipper. The Sounds compiled a 64–77 record, leaving them in third-place. On June 30, Tike Redman became the first Sounds player to hit for the cycle. Redman also holds the Sounds franchise record for the most triples (30) during his career with the team. Despite finishing the 2002 season with a 72–71 record under Brown, it was only good enough for a third-place finish, two-and-a-half games out of first place. Chad Hermansen, who played for the <b>Sounds</b> <b>from</b> 1998 to 2002, holds three career franchise records: runs (303), home runs (92), and runs batted in (286).|$|E
