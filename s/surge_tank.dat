2500|$|The dam {{was built}} under the {{direction}} of Thomas Aldwell. Aldwell previously bought up tracts of land around the river, {{and with the help of}} Canadian financier George Glines, began construction of the Elwha Dam in 1910. Aldwell and his contractors cut corners on constructing the dam, including not building fish passages and did not secure it to the bedrock. Thus, in 1912, as the reservoir filled behind the nearly completed dam, the lower sections of the dam gave way and a torrent of water headed downstream, taking out a bridge. Aldwell was able to get funding for reconstructing the dam and it was completed in 1913. The reservoir that filled the valley behind was known as Lake Aldwell. The Elwha River Hydroelectric Power Plant historic district, a [...] area comprising the dam, the powerhouse, five penstocks and the <b>surge</b> <b>tank,</b> was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.|$|E

A powerplant at the toe of the dam was planned to house three 70 MW generating units, fed by an intake tower and equipped with a <b>surge</b> <b>tank.</b> The chosen site {{was to be a}}t river mile 176.5. Alternate sites at Fool Hen Hill (river mile 167) and Bad Rock Canyon (river mile 150) were rejected. The Fool Hen Hill site was found to have a permeable alluvial channel in the right abutment. The Bad Rock Canyon site would have been on the main stem of the Flathead and was also determined to have poor abutment rock, as well as alluvial deposits on the valley floor reaching up to [...] deep. It would have flooded the Hungry Horse damsite, which was under construction, as well as Lake McDonald in the park.|$|E

50|$|The Wave Method {{is based}} on the {{physically}} accurate concept that transient pipe flow occurs as a result of pressure waves generated and propagated from a disturbance in the pipe system (valve closure, pump trip, etc.) This method was developed and first described by Don J.

A pressure wave, which represents a rapid pressure and associated flow change, travels at sonic velocity for the liquid pipe medium, and the wave is partially transmitted and reflected at all discontinuities in the pipe system (pipe junctions, pumps, open or closed ends, <b>surge</b> <b>tanks,</b> etc.) A pressure wave can also be modified by pipe wall resistance. This description is one that closely represents the actual mechanism of transient pipe flow.|$|R
