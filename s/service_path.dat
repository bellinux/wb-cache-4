40|$|This {{dissertation}} introduces, implements, and {{evaluates the}} novel concept of "Service Paths", which are system-level abstractions that capture {{and describe the}} dynamic dependencies between the different components of a distributed enterprise application. <b>Service</b> <b>paths</b> are dynamic because they capture the natural interactions between application services dynamically composed to offer some desired end user functionality. <b>Service</b> <b>paths</b> are distributed because such sets of services run on networked machines in distributed enterprise data centers. <b>Service</b> <b>paths</b> cross multiple levels of abstraction because they link end user application components like web browsers with system services like http providing communications with embedded services like hardware-supported data encryption. <b>Service</b> <b>paths</b> are system-level abstractions that are created without end user, application, or middleware input, but despite these facts, {{they are able to}} capture application-relevant performance metrics, including end-to-end latencies for client requests and the contributions to these latencies from application-level processes and from software/hardware resources like protocol stacks or network devices. Beyond conceiving of <b>service</b> <b>paths</b> and demonstrating their utility, this thesis makes three concrete technical contributions. First, we propose a set of signal analysis techniques called ``E 2 Eprof' that identify the <b>service</b> <b>paths</b> taken by different request classes across a distributed IT infrastructure and the time spent in each such path. It uses a novel algorithm called ``pathmap' that computes the correlation between the message arrival and departure timestamps at each participating node and detect dependencies among them. A second contribution is a system-level monitoring toolkit called ``SysProf', which captures monitoring information at different levels of granularity, ranging from tracking the system-level activities triggered by a single system call, to capturing the client-server interactions associated with a <b>service</b> <b>paths,</b> to characterizing the server resources consumed by sets of clients or client behaviors. The third contribution of the thesis is a publish-subscribe based monitoring data delivery framework called ``QMON'. QMON offers high levels of predictability for service delivery and supports utility-aware monitoring while also able to differentiate between different levels of service for monitoring, corresponding to the different classes of SLAs maintained for applications.

Related to such a scenario {{is the problem of}} finding efficient service paths that meet end-to-end requirements. Work has been done in discovering unicast service paths. However, considering that resources are limited, for distributed {{multimedia application}}s that may have a single sender but multiple heterogeneous end-users, it is demanding to build service trees to minimize resource usages by means of sharing.

40|$|Abstract — Service Composition is a {{promising}} technology for providing on-demand composed services in dynamic and loosely coupled peer-to-peer (P 2 P) networks. Because of system dynamics, {{such as the}} peer leaving from the system, end users may perceive interference from service disruptions. How to minimize the userperceived interference and provide Quality of Service guarantees to the composite services thus becomes important and challenging. In this paper, we take a novel approach to study the problem of minimum interference service composition with QoS guarantees. First, we propose a general analytic framework to model the interference and its intensity to the end users due to system dynamics. Based on this framework, the minimum interference routing problem is formulated. Then, we present an optimal {{solution to the problem}} through dynamic programming and investigate some optimization simplifications in special cases. We further propose a heuristic measure for fast interference calculation and design efficient routing algorithms by exploiting the local path recovery and reliable <b>service</b> <b>paths.</b> Our analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that our model and algorithms can achieve much better performance than the traditional methods in finding <b>service</b> <b>paths,</b> with respect to decreasing the interference to end users, especially in the scenarios of stringent QoS requirement, highly dynamic networks, or the type of impatient users.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} service routing (or dynamic service composition) has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} consequence of the distributed composable services model residing in middleware layer(s). However, existing solutions are mostly suitable for small- or medium-scale service overlay networks, as service routing is performed over flat overlay topologies such as a mesh. Due to their increasing routing information maintenance costs, these flat (single-level) topology solutions cannot cope with largescale service overlay networking. For better scalability, in this paper, we provide a hierarchical service routing framework, which comprises three parts. In the first part, we organize the overlay network nodes into clusters based on their Internet distances. We then construct a hierarchically fully connected (HFC) topology based on the clustering result. In such a topology, nodes within a cluster are considered fully connected, and the clusters themselves are also fully connected by their border nodes. In the second part, a hierarchical state information distribution protocol will be provided so that each node in the system maintains full state of the nodes in its own cluster and aggregate state of other clusters in the system. In the third part, we present how <b>service</b> <b>paths</b> can be computed hierarchically in a divide-and-conquer fashion. Through simulation tests, we demonstrate that while achieving much better scalability, our framework provides also as good and efficient <b>service</b> <b>paths</b> as single-level mesh solutions...|$|R
