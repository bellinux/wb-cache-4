When emptied while at low temperatures, liquid condensation can form and the tank lining can reach a critically low temperature, causing fracture to the tank wall. In this study, the emptying of methane in cold weather conditions from a non-metallic tank was modelled using Aspen Tech Software. A full tank of methane, at 250 bar and 288 K, was cooled to the following starting temperatures: 263, 253, 243, 233, and 223 K.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{performance}} of several molecular simulation techniques aimed at evaluation of the surface tension through its thermodynamic definition. For all methods explored, the surface tension is calculated by approximating the change in Helmholtz free energy associated with a change in interfacial area through simulation of a liquid slab at constant particle number, volume, and temperature. The methods explored fall within three general classes: free-energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance-ratio scheme, and the expanded ensemble technique. Calculations are performed for both the truncated Lennard-Jones and square-well fluids at select temperatures spaced along their respective liquid-vapor <b>saturation</b> <b>lines.</b> Overall, we find that Bennett and expanded ensemble approaches provide the best combination of accuracy and precision. All of the methods, when applied using sufficiently small area perturbation, generate equivalent results for the Lennard-Jones fluid. However, single-stage free-energy-perturbation methods and the closely related test-area technique recently introduced by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134703 (2005) ], generate surface tension values for the square-well fluid that are not consistent with those obtained from the more robust expanded ensemble and Bennett approaches, regardless {{of the size of}} the area perturbation. Single-stage perturbation methods fail also for the Lennard-Jones system when applied using large area perturbations. Here an analysis of phase-space overlap produces a quantitative explanation of the observed inaccuracy, and shows that the satisfactory results obtained in these cases from the test-area method arise from a cancellation of errors that cannot be expected in general.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} covers the microwave spectroscopy of the weakly bound complexes HI-HF, H₂S-SO₂, Ar-H₂S, and N₂O-HF. These molecules were investigated using a Flygare-Balle type pulsed-beam Fabry-Perot Fourier-transform microwave spectrometer. The spectrometer and its construction are described. The HI-HF complex was found to be hydrogen bonded through the hydrogen of the HF. The hydrogen bond length was found to be 2. 720 A with a structure such that the monomer bonds form an acute angle of 70 °. For H₂S-SO₂ a structure with a S-S distance of 3. 67 A and H-O distances of 3. 1 A was obtained. It was established that the hydrogens of H₂S are equivalent is this species. A new set of transitions for Ar-HDS were observed indicating that the hydrogens in this molecule are not equivalent. Several new transitions were also observed for Ar-H₂³⁴S, Ar-H₂S and Ar-D₂S. New insight into the structure of the Ar-H₂S molecule was obtained. Several new transitions for the bent isomer of N₂O-HF were measured and a fit of the ground state constants for this species was performed including quartic distortion constants. The resulting fit improves calculated line centers by two orders of magnitude over previous results. The second part of this dissertation covers the infrared spectroscopy of the ν₆ and ν₈ bands of formic acid. Fourier transform data for these bands were obtained at 0. 01 cm⁻¹ resolution using the spectrometer at the Kitt Peak National solar observatory. Diode laser data at 0. 001 cm⁻¹ was obtained for the ν₈ band. A two state a-type Coriolis coupled Hamiltonian was used to perform a global fit on all the available data.

If the observed craters were ancient craters formed in the trans-Neptunian region, a large number of impacts with trans-Neptunian objects may be expected (e.g., Stern, 1996), and the R value for T 1 would be around the empirical <b>saturation</b> <b>line</b> with R ∼ 0.2. 81 P/Wild 2 is an example showing that the most of crater population follow the empirical <b>saturation</b> <b>line</b> (Basilevsky and Keller, 2006). It has been suggested that the surface of 81 P/Wild 2 nuclei remains very old ancient terrain, presumably dating back to the comet’s residence in the trans-Neptunian region (e.g., Brownlee et al., 2004). Furthermore, while 81 P/Wild 2 has many large craters with Dcr > 400 m, there are no large craters with Dcr > 400 m, suggesting that the T 1 surface is not old enough to accumulate such large craters.
