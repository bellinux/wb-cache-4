25|$|By early 1791, around February, Prussian {{diplomacy}} {{managed to}} secure {{an agreement with}} Austria. Although Austria refused to switch sides, it also agreed to remain neutral {{in case of a}} war between Russia and Prussia. This convinced Pitt to assure Frederic that Britain would send a fleet to the Baltic, and to craft an ultimatum to Russia, requiring it to retreat from its war with the Ottomans or face an Anglo-Prussian intervention; by late March this position got royal approval and the debate in British parliament was to take place soon. In the meantime, in early March, Frederic Wilhelm II assured an Ottoman representative of his desire to attack Russia as soon as the Royal Navy appeared in the Baltic Sea, and encouraged him, in a handwritten letter, to continue the ongoing war with Russia and undertake a new offensive in the Balkans. Prussia's military preparations were very advanced, with about 90,000 troops massing on the border, and plans for three corps to advance on Riga. Russia itself was gearing itself to defend the Baltic <b>sea</b> <b>border</b> against the expected invasion.|$|E
500|$|The inner German border {{system also}} {{extended}} along the Baltic coast, dubbed the [...] "blue border" [...] or <b>sea</b> <b>border</b> of the GDR. The coastline was partly fortified {{along the east}} side mouth of the river Trave opposite the West German port of Travemünde. Watchtowers, walls and fences stood along the marshy shoreline to deter escape attempts and the water was patrolled by high-speed East German boats. The continuous line of the inner German border ended at the peninsula of Priwall, still belonging to Travemünde, but already {{on the east side}} of the Trave. From there to Boltenhagen, along some 15km of the eastern shore of the Bay of Mecklenburg, the GDR shoreline was part of the restricted-access [...] "protective strip" [...] or Schutzgebiet. Security controls were imposed on the rest of the coast from Boltenhagen to Altwarp on the Polish border, including the whole of the islands of Poel, Rügen, Hiddensee, Usedom and the peninsulas of Darß and Wustrow.|$|E
