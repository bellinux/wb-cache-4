This exact transcript, and the resulting protein, was found specifically in endometrial tissue. While often found in endometrial cancers, these transcripts are expressed in normal tissue as well. Originally thought {{to be the result of}} chromosomal fusions, one group investigated whether this was accurate. Using Southern blotting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the genome, the researchers found no evidence of DNA rearrangement. They decided to investigate further by combining human endometrial cells with rhesus fibroblasts and found chimeric products containing sequences from both species. These data suggested that chimeric RNA is generated by <b>splicing</b> <b>parts</b> of genes together rather than chromosomal re-arrangements. They also performed mass spectrometry on the translated protein to verify that the chimeric RNA is translated into protein.|$|R

Current techniques allow {{an artist to}} fabricate such an image by digitally <b>splicing</b> <b>parts</b> of stock photographs.

Predominant among these is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A 2, a trans-acting factor for cytoplasmic trafficking of RNAs bearing A 2 RE-like sequences. We have now identified the other A 2 RE-binding proteins as hnRNP A 1 /A 1 (B), hnRNP B 1, and four isoforms of hnRNP A 3. The rat and human hnRNP A 3 cDNAs have been sequenced, revealing the existence of alternatively spliced mRNAs. In Western blotting, 38 -, 39 -, 41 -, and 41. 5 -kDa components were all recognized by antibodies against a peptide in the glycine-rich region of hnRNP A 3, but only the 41 - and 41. 5 -kDa bands bound antibodies to a 15 -residue N-terminal peptide encoded by an alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>part</b> of exon 1.

Remarkably, the splicing pattern in pluripotent stem cells resembles that in testes, and the regulatory regions have specific characteristics in length and sequence. Furthermore, our siRNA screen has identified RNA-binding proteins that regulate splicing events in iPSCs.

Wild type cells show a nucleosomal deprived region around the transcriptional start site at methylated Hox genes and mediate gene silencing via Pol II stalling. Hypomethylation in Lsh 2 / 2 cells is associated with efficient transcriptional elongation and <b>splicing,</b> in <b>part</b> mediated by the chromodomain protein Chd 1. Dynamic modulation of DNA methylation in Lsh 2 / 2 and wild type cells demonstrates that catalytically active DNA methyltransferase activity is required for Pol II stalling.

Discriminating the different statistical characteristics of the two parts of the image is the basis for detecting a spliced image.

An unc- 55 reporter gene revealed a sexually dimorphic pattern: early in post-embryonic motor neurons in both sexes; and later in a subset of male-specific cells that included an interneuron and eight muscle cells. A behavioral analysis coupled with RNA interference (RNAi) revealed that males require UNC- 55 to execute copulatory motor programs. Two mRNA isoforms (unc- 55 a and unc- 55 b) were detected throughout post-embryonic development in males, whereas only one, unc- 55 a, was detected in hermaphrodites. In unc- 55 mutant males isoform a rescued the locomotion and mating defect, whereas isoform b rescued the mating defect only. Isoform b represents the first report of male-specific splicing in C. elegans.

The rope was strung across the entrance to Willoughby Bay, from Folly Point {{to the head of the}} bay, a reported length of 1420 ft, 340 ft above the waters below.

As has been before stated, the rope is stretched across the harbour at a great altitude, the width apparently being three hundred yards. At the western end it is higher than at the eastern, and as the weight of the rope causes a dip in the centre, the western end is at a considerable incline. Starting off amidst the cheers of the spectators, L'Estrange walked fearlessly at the rate of eighty steps to a minute across the rope, until he reached a <b>spliced</b> <b>part</b> near the centre, some twenty feet in length, which he passed more deliberately.

Raising the balancing pole, he lifted one foot onto the rope, then the other, and continued his walk. He took a few steps backward and then proceeded up the inclined part of the rope steadily to the western shore, at the slower speed of about sixty steps a minute, the rope swaying considerably as he went.

Angiogenesis – the growth of new vessels from preexisting vasculature – is an absolute requirement for tumour survival and progression beyond a few hundred microns in diameter. We previously described a class of anti-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF, VEGFxxxb, that inhibit tumour growth in animal models, and are downregulated in some cancers, but have not been investigated in melanoma. To determine whether VEGFxxxb expression was altered in melanoma, PCR and immunohistochemistry of archived human tumour samples were used. In normal epidermis and in a proportion of melanoma samples, VEGFxxxb staining was seen. Some melanomas had much weaker staining. Subsequent examination revealed that expression was significantly reduced in primary melanoma samples (both horizontal and vertical growth phases) from patients who subsequently developed tumour metastasis compared with those who did not (analysis of variance (ANOVA) P< 0. 001 metastatic vs nonmetastatic), irrespective of tumour thickness, while the surrounding epidermis showed no difference in expression. Staining for total VEGF expression showed staining in metastatic and nonmetastatic melanomas, and normal epidermis. An absence of VEGFxxxb expression appears to predict metastatic spread in patients with primary melanoma.

The splice variants mGluR 7 a and mGluR 7 b {{are defined by}} different intracellular C-termini, and simultaneous or exclusive binding of interacting proteins to these domains modulates mGluR 7 -mediated signalling. However, molecular determinants defining binding regions for associated proteins within mGluR 7 C-termini are mostly unknown. In the present study, we have mapped the binding domains of four proteins [filamin A, protein phosphatase (PP) 1 C, protein interacting with protein kinase C (PICK) 1 and syntenin] interacting with the mGluR 7 b variant, and show that the alternatively <b>spliced</b> distal <b>part</b> of the mGluR 7 b C-terminus was sufficient for the interactions.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{large family}} of viruses that infect bacteria, called phages, is {{characterized}} by long tails used to inject DNA into their victims' cells. The tape measure protein got its name because {{the length of the}} corresponding gene is proportional to the length of the phage's tail: a fact shown by actually copying or <b>splicing</b> out <b>parts</b> of DNA in exemplar species. A natural question is whether there exist units for these tape measures, and if different tape measures have different units and lengths. Such units would allow us to retrace the evolution of tape measure proteins using their duplication/loss history. The vast number of sequenced phages genomes allows us to attack this problem with a comparative genomics approach. Results Here we describe a subset of phages whose tape measure proteins contain variable numbers of an 11 amino acids sequence repeat, aligned with sequence similarity, structural properties, and simple arithmetics. This subset provides a unique opportunity for the combinatorial study of phage evolution, without the added uncertainties of multiple alignments, which are trivial in this case, or of protein functions, that are well established. We give a heuristic that reconstructs the duplication history of these sequences, using divergent strains to discriminate between mutations that occurred before and after speciation, or lineage divergence. The heuristic is based on an efficient algorithm that gives an exhaustive enumeration of all possible parsimonious reconstructions of the duplication/speciation history of a single nucleotide. Finally, we present a method that allows, when possible, to discriminate between duplication and loss events. Conclusions Establishing the evolutionary history of viruses is difficult, in part due to extensive recombinations and gene transfers, and high mutation rates that often erase detectable similarity between homologous genes. In this paper, we introduce new tools to address this problem. </p...|$|R
