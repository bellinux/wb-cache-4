40|$|Introduction: Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} is {{a severe}} soft tissue infection. In our environment, patients presenting with this infection are usually financially incapacitated and, therefore, their management can be challenging. This paper aimed {{to document the}} pattern and challenges encountered in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> cervicofacial necrotizing fasciitis (CNF) in the University College Hospital, Ibadan. Materials and Methods: Information such as biodata, site of infection, systemic conditions, widest <b>span</b> <b>of</b> defect, <b>management</b> provided, hospital stay, and outcome <b>of</b> <b>management</b> was prospectively collected on all patients with CNF who presented at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between January 2007 and December 2013. The patients were managed according to a devised protocol of antibiotic therapy, serial debridement and honey dressings. Results: Twenty-four cases of CNF were seen. There were 9 males and 15 females while 70. 9 % of the patients belonged to the low socioeconomic class. The mean <b>span</b> <b>of</b> wound defect was 12. 2 (± 8. 844) cm. The mean hospital stay was 27. 8 (± 23. 1) days, and scar formation {{was the most common}} complication encountered. Conclusion: Our study represents the largest series of CNF from a Nigerian health facility presently. The <b>management</b> <b>of</b> necrotizing fascitis in the maxillofacial region poses a significant challenge to both the surgeon and the patient.

40|$|Hammond and {{anonymous}} reviewers for this journal for {{comments on an earlier}} draft of this manuscript. Early management scholars such as Henri Fayol, Lydal Urwick, and Luther Gulick argued that principles such as specialization of labor and hierarchical leadership structures among others would result in optimal organizational performance. This perspective was attacked by Herbert Simon (1946), who argued that the principles <b>of</b> administrative <b>management</b> were vague and contradictory. Simon=s devastating critique was widely accepted, and scholars soon turned their attention away from studying the principles <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> Ironically, little systematic research existed on many of the principles <b>of</b> <b>management</b> at the time Simon leveled his critique. In this study, our goal is to refocus attention on a particular principle <b>of</b> <b>management,</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control, most closely associated with Luther Gulick. After discussing the importance <b>of</b> <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control to our understanding of organizational behavior, we present a theory that links <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control to organizational performance.

We nd that when people/ncan choose between wage work and managerial work, the worldwide labor market raises output by more in {{the rich and the poor}} countries, and by less in the middle-income countries. This is because the middle-income countries experience the smallest change in the factor-price ratio, and where the option to choose between wage work and managerial work has the least value in the integrated/neconomy. Our theory also establishes that after economic integration, the high skill countries see a disproportionate increase in managerial occupations. Using aggregate data on GDP, openness and occupations from 115 countries, we find evidence for these patterns of occupational choice...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this exploratory study was {{to add to the}} almost non-existent Thai literature on women in management. Three key themes were pursued throughout the study, i. e., the representation of Thai women in management, their work versus family responsibilities, and the barriers they encounter in ascending the managerial hierarchy. The study was conducted in three distinct phases. First, a survey questionnaire was distributed to 536 male and female middle-level managers across diverse organizations in Bangkok. Second, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 67 women managers. It was likely that those in public sector organizations differed in their background and work experiences from their counterparts in private firms, hence data was collected from women managers in the two sectors and comparisons made. Lastly, structured interviews were held with 25 Human Resource/Line managers from a crosssection of firms in which the women managers worked. The study found that the women who have succeeded in these organizations are the ones who have very similar backgrounds and attitudes to the men. They work the same long hours, and have the same interest in furthering their careers as men. Therefore we cannot explain women's career barriers in terms of individual characteristics, such as their motivation or commitment to work. The results suggest that organizational structures and processes are central {{to an understanding of the}} ways Thai women are marginalized and excluded from managerial positions. For instance, women were clustered in relatively few occupations, received less in terms of earnings and training, had smaller <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>management,</b> and less authority for final decisions than men. During interviews, women managers mentioned that the negative attitudes of male managers and gender biases in organizational practices, were barriers they had frequently encountered. The data also revealed that the contradictory and ambiguous values that underlie women's role as wife-mother at home and manager at work, necessitated a constant struggle for balance and remarkable personal sacrifices on the part of Thai women managers. By way of conclusion this dissertation submits that there is not a single cause that constrains women's advancement but rather a pattern of cultural, social and legal factors that characterizes the general situation of women managers in Thailand. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for women in management are discussed and future directions for research in this area are suggested...|$|R

Many of these narratives are rich with information about fire behavior, local vegetation, and fuel conditions. They often contain detailed descriptions of weather conditions, fire progression, scouting reports, and management actions. All fire reports for lightning-caused fires were read and those with detailed narratives were identified. This subset was evaluated for use as case studies. To insure that the sample fires <b>spanned</b> the range <b>of</b> <b>management</b> policies, at least one fire per decade from the 1940 s to the 1980 s with a duration greater than 4.5 days was selected. Fire reporting and management changes (e.g., narratives with little or no description of the vegetation; indirect fire line construction) in the 1980 s made it difficult to discern fire behavior characteristics useful for case studies from this decade.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{substantial}} {{generation and}} demand fluctuations in standalone green microgrids, energy management strategies are becoming {{essential for the}} power sharing and voltage regulation purposes. The classical energy management strategies employ the {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) algorithms and rely on batteries in case of possible excess or deficit of energy.

In this paper, a coordinated and multivariable energy management strategy is proposed that employs a wind turbine and a photovoltaic array of a standalone DC microgrid as controllable generators by adjusting the pitch angle and the switching duty cycles. The proposed strategy is developed as an online nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm. Applying to a sample standalone dc microgrid, the developed controller realizes the IU regime for charging the battery bank. The variable load demands are also shared accurately between generators in proportion to their ratings. Moreover, the DC bus voltage is regulated within a predefined range, as a design parameter...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to research the subject of "span of control" as it applies to the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> work, to assess factors impacting supervisory ratios, to assess Indian Health Service (IHS) staffing data to determine supervisory ratios, to identify relevant industry <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control supervisory ratios, and to make findings and recommendations. The purpose {{of this study was to}} assess whether or not the IHS's <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control is consistent with industry standards. The analysis required research on managerial <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control standards and ratios from variety of sources, including health care organization literature, Office <b>of</b> Personnel <b>Management</b> (OPM) documentary material, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards and manuals, and health care industry staffing data. The analysis also involved obtaining, processing, tabulating, and summarizing IHS agency-wide staffing data by occupational series, location, and function to determine <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control supervisory ratios, and similar data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) on staffing patterns. Corporate responsibilities are organized functionally, but direct health care operations are performed on a "team" basis. In the field of health care delivery, the literature does not specify recommended <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control. The statutory mandates do not speak to <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control. Rather, they support a mission, which is critical and complex. There was no data found on supervisory ratios for the private sector. The IHS staffing patterns at hospitals and health centers are consistent with the unique IHS mission. The authors recommend conducting a management review/case study to obtain a realistic view of the supervisory ratios for IHS hospitals and health centers. Case studies of the total staffing profile, (including non-IHS employees), the organizational structure, "team" responsibilities, and <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control at three IHS hospitals would be a useful starting point. Also, a roundtable conference on organization issues for health care delivery facilities may prove beneficial. This study suggests the need for an IHS health facility profile database.
