5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the <b>share</b> <b>issue,</b> McKenna became chairman of the club.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Dey {{retired after}} selling his {{ownership}} interest to Gorman and new investor Frank Ahearn. Ahearn and Gorman had an uneasy partnership {{and at one}} point Gorman was going to buy out Ahearn. By January 1925, the deal was nearly finalized when Gorman backed out of the deal. Instead, Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and a share of the Connaught Park Racetrack and Gorman moved on to New York to manage the New York Americans. In 1929, Ahearn sold the club to the Ottawa Auditorium corporation for $150,000, financed by a <b>share</b> <b>issue.</b> William Foran, the Stanley Cup trustee, became president of the Club. As the Auditorium did not meet its payments, Ahearn resumed a share of the club in 1931.|$|E

Legally membership interests in an LLC are a form of hybrid between traditional share capital and partnership interests in the capital of a partnership.|$|R

5|$|In June 2012, {{after several}} months with no further {{developments}} on the Singapore front, several sources reported that the club was considering moving its <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> to the United States, and in July 2012, an application was made for the club to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with a target of raising $100million (£64million). More details of the sale were released {{at the end of}} July, with the club announcing that they intended to sell 16.7million shares (approximately 10% of the club) at between $16 and $20 each, raising up to $330million (£210million). Shares in the club would be divided into two groups, with Class A shares sold to the public and Class B shares retained by the Glazer family.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath F.C. {{became a}} limited company in 1888; its first <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> {{was to the}} value of £650. The board was made up of local {{businessmen}} and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall F.C. chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for £700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15million new shares, raising £7.5million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of £4.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008.|$|E
5|$|Docherty rebuilt {{confidence}} in the team and Villa {{went on to win}} five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In the short time that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12,000 against Charlton Athletic in December. In the summer of 1969 the first <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> since 1896 raised £200,000 for the club, £140,000 of which was spent on new players. In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were {{at the bottom of the}} Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, Vic Crowe, was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the 196970 season. Despite finishing fourth in the Third Division in the 197071 season, Villa reached the League Cup final after beating Manchester United in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by Tottenham Hotspur 20. The 197172 season saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points. They were invited to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield but lost 1–0 to Manchester City. In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an EGM, who also voted to replace the existing directors. Their first season back in the Second Division in 197273 saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with Ron Saunders.|$|E

5|$|Smith left to {{take over}} at Sunderland in May 1987, and former Blackburn Rovers manager Bobby Saxton was {{appointed}} in June. Only two players were under contract {{at the time of}} Saxton's arrival; his hastily arranged squad struggled from the start of 1987–88, and only won their first match in late October 1987. York were bottom of the table for most of the season, and were relegated after finishing in 23rd place. The season was statistically the club's worst in the Football League, with the fewest wins (eight), most defeats (29) and the fewest points since the three points for a win system was introduced (33). York made a poor start to 1988–89, and Saxton resigned with the club bottom of the Fourth Division in mid September 1988. Swallow took over on a caretaker basis before the former Hartlepool United manager John Bird was appointed in October 1988. York's away form improved {{in the second half of}} the season, and in the last week they had a slim chance of reaching the play-offs. They missed out on a play-off place and finished the season in 11th place. A record loss of £190,000 was posted for the season, but the club carried no overdraft because of interest-free loans from directors and a £100,000 <b>share</b> <b>issue.</b> York started 1989–90 strongly and were in third place by mid December 1989. Successive home defeats in late December 1989 marked the start of a decline that saw them finish the season 13th in the table.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1994, McCann bought Celtic for £9million, finally wresting {{control from}} the family dynasties that had run the club for almost 100 years. When he bought the club it was {{reported}} to be within 24 hours of entering receivership due to exceeding a £5million overdraft with the Bank of Scotland. He turned Celtic into a public limited company through a <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> which raised over £14million, the most successful <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> in British football history. He also oversaw the building of a new stadium, the 60,000 seater Celtic Park, which cost £40million and at the time was Britain's largest capacity football club stadium. This allowed Celtic to progress as a club because over £20million was being raised each year from season ticket sales.|$|E

The British Railways Llanberis–Caernarvon line closed to passengers in 1962. In 1983, the summit buildings were transferred to the ownership of Gwynedd County Council. A <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> was made in 1985, primarily {{to raise money to}} purchase the first two diesel locomotives. Between 1986 and 1992 the railway company was involved with the airfield and aviation museum in Caernarvon.|$|E
25|$|Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{stated that}} UK taxpayers {{would benefit from}} the government's rescue plan, as it will have some control over RBS in {{exchange}} for £5 billion in preference shares and underwriting the issuance of a further £15 billion in ordinary shares. If shareholder take-up of the <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> was 0%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 58%; and, if shareholder take-up was 100%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 0%.

25|$|On 19 July 1982, the Government {{formally}} {{announced its}} intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by {{the passing of the}} Telecommunications Act 1984, which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> in the world.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Country Park halt, Kidderminster is, by far, {{the youngest of the}} SVR stations. Bridgnorth to Bewdley passenger services started in 1974, and it was decided to extend the line to Kidderminster to attract more custom from what was (and still is) a bustling town close to the West Midlands conurbation. After Kidderminster goods yard became disused in 1982, the SVR purchased the line to the east of Foley Park. Sharing the British Rail station of Kidderminster was impractical, so SVR claimed a site {{to the west of the}} BR station. Initially, the site was leased from BR until privatisation when BR looked to sell off the site, leading to the 1994 SVR <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> to raise capital to buy it outright.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Celtic {{issued a}} share offer {{designed}} to raise £15million for the club, 50 million new shares were made available priced at 30p each. It was {{also revealed that}} majority sharholder Desmond would buy around £10million worth of the shares. £10million of the money raised was for building a new state-of-the-art training facility and youth academy, expanding the club's global scouting network and investing in coaching and player development programmes. The {{rest of the money}} was to be used to reduce debt. Building a youth academy was important for Celtic to surpass both Hearts and Rangers who had superior youth facilities at the time. The <b>share</b> <b>issue</b> was a success and Celtic had more applicants than shares available, Celtic's new Lennoxtown training centre was opened in October 2007.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Bracken became {{close to}} Lord Camrose, the {{proprietor}} since 1919 of the Financial Times. The two privately agreed {{to raise their}} advertising rates to protect their finances, and eventually agreed that the other would have first refusal if one wanted to sell. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Camrose decided to sell the Financial Times, and arrangements for a merger were put in place. The financial deal was a complex one: the Financial News raised the cost of buying a controlling interest in the Financial Times by selling its own offices and investments, and by a <b>share</b> <b>issue,</b> but could only make up the full amount by simultaneously selling to the Financial Times the copyright and goodwill of the Financial News. Camrose himself bought some Financial News shares to help the deal along.|$|E

A call option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is below the market value of the underlying asset, while a put option would normally be exercised only when the strike price is above the market value. When an option is exercised, the cost to the buyer of the asset acquired is the strike price plus the premium, if any. When the option expiration date passes without the option being exercised, then the option expires and the buyer would forfeit the premium to the seller. In any case, the premium is income to the seller, and normally a capital loss to the buyer.|$|E
