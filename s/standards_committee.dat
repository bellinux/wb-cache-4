5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ <b>standards</b> <b>committee</b> in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues were raised. In particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, {{which led to the}} creation of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} at Altec, Hilliard joined the Hollywood {{section of the}} Sapphire Group, a regular social gathering of sound recordists and a precursor to the Audio Engineering Society. In 1948, Hilliard was elected to chair the Sapphire Group Recording <b>Standards</b> <b>Committee.</b> He made certain, along with the Motion Picture Research Council, that proposed industry standards were forwarded to members of National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), Acoustical Society of America (ASA) and Royal Musical Association (RMA). Hilliard helped form the Los Angeles section of the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in 1951. At the beginning of 1963, IRE merged with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)—Hilliard retained his Fellowship.|$|E
5|$|While Stepanov had {{originally}} intended allocators to completely encapsulate the memory model, the <b>standards</b> <b>committee</b> {{realized that this}} approach would lead to unacceptable efficiency degradations. To remedy this, additional wording {{was added to the}} allocator requirements. In particular, container implementations may assume that the allocator's type definitions for pointers and related integral types are equivalent to those provided by the default allocator, and that all instances of a given allocator type always compare equal, effectively contradicting the original design goals for allocators and limiting the usefulness of allocators that carry state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education <b>Standards</b> <b>Committee</b> was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} scandals to hit the new Scottish Parliament {{occurred}} when allegations that the lobbying arm of public relations company Beattie Media had privileged access to ministers were published, prompting Dewar to ask the <b>standards</b> <b>committee</b> to investigate the reports.

25|$|To give {{compiler}} vendors greater freedom, the C++ <b>standards</b> <b>committee</b> {{decided not}} to dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features.

There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems (for example C++ ABI), though they seem to be largely abandoned now.|$|E

[...] Jean Sammet and Jerome Garfunkel also noted that changes introduced in one revision of the standard would be reverted in the next, due as much to changes in who was in the standard committee as to objective evidence.|$|E

500|$|... decltype is {{included}} in the C++ Language Standard since C++11. It is provided by a number of compilers as an extension. Microsoft's Visual C++ 2010 and later compilers provide a decltype type specifier that closely mimics the semantics as described in the <b>standards</b> <b>committee</b> proposal. It can be used with both managed and native code. The documentation states that it is [...] "useful primarily to developers who write template libraries." [...] decltype was added to the mainline of the GCC C++ compiler in version 4.3, released on March 5, 2008. decltype is also present in Codegear's C++ Builder 2009, the Intel C++ Compiler, and Clang.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Bjarne Stroustrup {{suggested}} {{extending the}} C++ language with mechanisms for querying {{the type of}} an expression, and initializing objects without specifying the type. Stroustrup observed that the reference-dropping semantics offered by the typeof operator provided by the GCC and EDG compilers could be problematic. Conversely, an operator returning a reference type based on the lvalue-ness of the expression was deemed too confusing. The initial proposal to the C++ <b>standards</b> <b>committee</b> outlined {{a combination of the}} two variants; the operator would return a reference type only if the declared type of the expression included a reference. To emphasize that the deduced type would reflect the [...] "declared type" [...] of the expression, the operator was proposed to be named decltype.|$|E
500|$|Bill Clinton {{returned}} to the governor's office two years later after winning the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name [...] "Hillary Clinton", or sometimes [...] "Mrs. Bill Clinton", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took {{a leave of absence}} from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time. As First Lady of Arkansas again, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name. She was named chair of the Arkansas Education <b>Standards</b> <b>Committee</b> in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system. In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size. It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort. In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy. She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.|$|E
