5|$|Land {{reclamation}} schemes, {{especially those}} by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access. Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 and 1875, Alexander was {{assigned}} to a board examining the problem of keeping the Mississippi River Delta from <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> and becoming an impediment to ship traffic. During {{the course of his}} tenure on the board, he traveled to Europe in order to examine European solutions to the problem. At the end of 1875, Alexander was asked by the state government of California to examine a proposed irrigation project in the San Joaquin Valley. Busy with other projects, Alexander appointed an associate, William Hammond Hall, to head the project.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouth of}} the River Brue had an {{extensive}} harbour in Roman and Saxon times, before <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> in the medieval period. It was used again as a small harbour in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in 1833 the port of Highbridge was formally opened on the river. A new wharf, known as Clyce Wharf, {{was built on the}} Huntspill side of the river mouth by 1904, and was used for the import of coal and the export of bricks and tiles and agricultural products. The port closed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were <b>silting</b> <b>up,</b> the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.|$|E
5|$|The South Downs {{dominate}} Eastbourne and the Eastbourne Downland Estate can be {{seen from}} most of the town. These were originally chalk deposits laid down under the sea during the Late Cretaceous, and were later lifted by the same tectonic plate movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period. The chalk can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline {{to the west of the}} town, in the area known as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters, where continuous erosion keeps the cliff edge vertical and white. The chalk contains many fossils such as ammonites and nautilus. The town area is built on geologically recent alluvial drift, the result of the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of a bay. This changes to Weald clay around the Langney estate.|$|E

5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
5|$|The name Sulis {{continued}} to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to the town's Roman name of Aquae Sulis ("the waters of Sulis"). The temple was constructed in 60–70 AD and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years. During the Roman occupation of Britain, and possibly on the instructions of Emperor Claudius, engineers drove oak piles to provide a stable foundation into the mud and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted building, and included the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (lukewarm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath). After the Roman withdrawal from Britain {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to <b>silting</b> <b>up,</b> and flooding. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests the original Roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century.|$|E

5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} <b>silting</b> <b>up.</b> Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river silting had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay and straw from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a small}} port at Minehead by 1380, but it was {{not until}} 1420 that money given by Lady Margaret Luttrell enabled {{improvements}} to be made and a jetty built. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the town had its own Port Officer similar to the position at Bristol. Vessels in the 15th century included the Trinite which traded between Ireland and Bristol, and others carrying salt and other cargo from La Rochelle in France. Other products included local wool and cloth which were traded for coal from South Wales. In 1559 a Charter of Incorporation, established a free Borough and Parliamentary representation, but was made conditional on improvements being made to the port. The harbour silted up and fell into disrepair so that in 1604 James I withdrew the town's charter. Control reverted to the Luttrells and a new harbour was built, at a cost of £5,000, further out to sea than the original, which had been at the mouth of the Bratton Stream. It incorporated a pier, dating from 1616, and was built to replace that at Dunster which was <b>silting</b> <b>up.</b> Trade was primarily with Wales for cattle, sheep, wool, butter, fish and coal. These are commemorated in the town arms which include a woolpack and sailing ship. Privateers based at Minehead were involved in the war with Spain and France during 1625–1630 and again during the War of the Spanish Succession from 1702–1713. The first cranes were installed after further improvements to the port in 1714.|$|E
25|$|Chalan Beel is fast <b>silting</b> <b>up.</b> In {{the past}} it covered {{an area of}} about 1,085km² but was reduced to 368km² in 1909, of which only 85km² {{remained}} underwater throughout the year. It has since shrunk to only 26km².|$|E

25|$|During the Norman period, {{important}} towns {{existed at}} Bannow and Clonmines. However, these declined in importance over time. The Norman town of Bannow (erroneously thought {{by some to}} have been reclaimed by the sea) was gradually abandoned due to the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of Bannow Bay and an early Norman Church can still be seen there today.|$|E
25|$|Documents {{indicate}} that Teignmouth {{was a significant}} port by the early 14th century, second in Devon only to Dartmouth. It was attacked by the French in 1340 and sent seven ships and 120 men to the expedition against Calais in 1347. Its relative importance waned during the 15th century, {{and it did not}} figure in an official record of 1577. This may have been due to <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of the harbour caused by tin mining on Dartmoor.|$|E
25|$|The site of its {{original}} settlement lies in {{the valley of the}} River Dour, making it an ideal place for a port, sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly winds. This led to the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of the river mouth by the action of longshore drift; the town was then forced into making artificial breakwaters to keep the port in being. These breakwaters have been extended and adapted so that the port lies almost entirely on reclaimed land.|$|E

25|$|At seaside locations, such {{as those}} at Saurashtra, Gujarat, India, the CaCl2 {{solution}} may be discharged directly into the sea, apparently without substantial environmental harm, the major concern is discharge location falls within the Marine National Park of Gulf of Kutch which serves as habitat for coral reefs, seagrass and seaweed community. At Osborne, South Australia, a settling pond is now used to remove 99% of the CaCl2 as the former discharge was <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> the shipping channel.|$|E
25|$|After the {{marriage}} {{around the middle}} of the 3rd century BC of Ptolemy III to Berenice, daughter of the Cyrenean Governor Magas, many Cyrenaican cities were renamed to mark the occasion. Euesperides became Berenice and the change of name also involved a relocation. Its desertion was probably due to the <b>silting</b> <b>up</b> of the lagoons; Berenice, the place they moved to, lies underneath Benghazi's modern city centre. The Greek colony had lasted from the 6th to the mid-3rd centuries BC.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{the line to}} Norden clay works had been {{extended}} over the main line railway to serve clay pits on its western side. This line was extended across the Wareham to Corfe Castle road by a level crossing to serve further clay pits to the north east. However, {{by this time the}} plateway's days were numbered. The channel at Middlebere was <b>silting</b> <b>up,</b> limiting the size of vessel that could approach the quay. The company already had a deeper-water quay at Goathorn on the southern shore of Poole Harbour, used for the export of clay from pits at nearby Newton.|$|E

50|$|Broad Water, or Broadwater (Welsh: Aber Dysynni) is a {{salt water}} lagoon near Tywyn, Wales formed from the <b>silted</b> <b>up</b> estuary of the River Dysynni. In {{the eighteenth and}} nineteenth centuries, the estuary was used by the {{shipbuilding}} industry, as small sailing ships were launched to carry peat from the local peat bogs. This industry was abandoned in the nineteenth century when the estuary became too <b>silted</b> <b>up,</b> forming the lagoon. The outflow of the lagoon flows beneath a railway bridge before entering Cardigan Bay.|$|R
