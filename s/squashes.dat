5|$|By 6000 BC, {{the early}} {{inhabitants}} of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, {{a process that}} {{eventually led to the}} establishment of sedentary agricultural societies. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and <b>squashes.</b> All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and <b>squashes.</b> These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E

However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and <b>squashes</b> Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, <b>squashes,</b> pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E

Sugar beets are known to be the main host for this virus but it also affect many plants including beans, celery, spinach, melons, peppers, <b>squashes,</b> cucumbers, and tomatoes.

It has been shown that the BCTV tend to infect more dicotyledonous hosts while no monocotyledonous plants have been recognized as a host for this virus.|$|E
25|$|Biologist Arturo Massol and radiochemist Elba Díaz {{conducted}} an unpublished study in January 2001 that showed vegetables and plants {{growing in the}} civilian area of Vieques were highly contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and copper. Furthermore, they discovered that metal concentrations in edible crops were both substantially above the maximum levels set by the European Union Council and much higher than plants tested in mainland Puerto Rico. Chiles, pasture grasses, and <b>squashes</b> were more effected than plants with deeper root systems such as trees. This {{is consistent with the}} theory that heavy metals travel by air to civilian areas via the steady easterly trade winds that blow directly from the bombing zone.|$|E

25|$|The {{region of}} this early {{agriculture}} {{is in the}} middle Mississippi valley, from Memphis north to St. Louis and extending about 300 miles east and west of the river, mostly in Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The oldest archaeological site known in the United States in which Indians were growing, rather than gathering, food is Phillips Spring in Missouri. At Phillips Spring, dating from 3,000 BCE, archaeologists found abundant walnuts, hickory nuts, acorns, grapes, elderberries, ragweed, bottle gourd, and the seeds of Cucurbita pepo, a gourd with edible seeds that is the ancestor of pumpkins and most <b>squashes.</b> The seeds found at Phillips Spring were larger than those of wild C. pepo. The agency for this change was surely human manipulation. Humans were selecting, planting, and tending seeds from plants that produced larger and tastier seeds. Ultimately, they would manipulate C. pepo to produce edible flesh.|$|E

It is more common to eat substitutions for daily rice and beans in festivities such as Christmas and New Year's Eve (the tradition is lentils), as follow-up of churrasco (mainly potato salad/carrot salad, called maionese, due to {{the widespread use of}} both industrial and home-made mayonnaise, which can include egg whites, raw onion, green peas, sweetcorn or even chayote <b>squashes,</b> and pronounced almost exactly as in English and French) and in other special occasions.|$|E
