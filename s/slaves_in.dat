5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789 there were eight times as many <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> the colony as there were white and mixed-race people put together. In 1789 the French were importing 30,000 slaves a year and there were half a million <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> the French part of the island alone, compared to about 30,000 whites.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{a million}} <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> French West Africa {{responded to this}} by moving away from their masters and {{settling}} elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened {{with the passage of the}} 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway <b>slaves.</b> <b>In</b> 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E

5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence.

5|$|Crawford's statue was {{designed}} in the early 1850s. It was originally to be crowned with a pileus, the cap given to emancipated <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> ancient Rome. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America, was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol. He ordered that it be changed to a helmet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century {{production}} shifted from south Wales to mid and north Wales. The Shrewsbury Drapers Company in England took a dominant role in distributing Welsh cloth.

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century, a number of ex-slaves of Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian descent and emigrants from Sierra Leone {{established}} communities in Lagos and other regions of Nigeria. Many ex-slaves came to Nigeria following the emancipation of <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> the Americas. Many of the immigrants, sometimes called Saros (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from Brazil) later became prominent merchants and missionaries in these cities.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{proceedings}} {{began when}} the insurers refused to compensate the owners of Zong. The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury. Mansfield was previously the judge in Somersett's Case in 1772, which concerned the legality of keeping <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> Britain. He had ruled that slavery had never been established by statute in Britain and was not supported by common law.|$|E

5|$|<b>Slaves</b> <b>in</b> Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans {{decided to}} become slaves when they {{incurred}} a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime punishable by death.|$|E
5|$|The Emancipation Proclamation, {{issued on}} September 22, 1862, {{and put into}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} free the <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing {{the army and the}} nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.|$|E
5|$|The Meermin slave mutiny {{took place}} in February 1766 and lasted for three weeks. Meermin {{was one of the}} Dutch East India Company's fleet of slave ships.

5|$|The dish {{has created}} {{a large number of}} {{spin-off}} recipes which are commonly used around the world. For example, Korean fried chicken, a dish which is commonly served as fast food in Korea and is known for being crispier than normal fried chicken. There is also a racial stereotype surrounding fried chicken and African-American people, mostly because it was popular among <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Though secular {{scholars}} {{consider the}} story to be literary and not historical, circumcision features prominently in the Hebrew Bible.

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of <b>slaves</b> <b>in</b> the antebellum South.|$|E
