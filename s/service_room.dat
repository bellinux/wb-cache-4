5|$|One of {{the most}} popular Coleridge Cottage is a cottage {{situated}} in Nether Stowey. It was constructed in the 17th century as a building containing a parlour, kitchen and <b>service</b> <b>room</b> on the ground floor and three corresponding bed chambers above. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The cottage was {{constructed}} in the 17th century as two attached buildings. One contained a parlour, kitchen and <b>service</b> <b>room</b> {{on the ground floor}} and three corresponding bed chambers above, and an adjoining byre or barn.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} done on the {{property}} in the early 18th century, providing an additional <b>service</b> <b>room</b> and bedrooms. The Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 impacted on the hall, which {{was close to the}} Scottish border. In 1715, William Wybergh, the owner, was abducted by Scottish soldiers, and in 1745, shortly before the Clifton Moor Skirmish, it was occupied and looted by the rebel forces.|$|E
50|$|A {{library is}} located at the {{northern}} end of the ground floor, a classroom {{is located at}} the southern end, and offices and <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> open off the corridor. The first floor contains classrooms, offices and <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> opening off the central corridor.|$|R

50|$|The {{other rooms}} of the ground floor, {{which may not be}} visited, house the dispensary of the Castle, <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> {{for the use of the}} kitchen (including a small goods store), the prisoner, the room {{reserved}} for the use of pilgrims, and rooms for the falconer, the guards, as well as other <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} the Jewelry Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule <b>service</b> <b>room</b> in the front, and a larger, main room in the rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{beneath the}} lantern room {{is usually a}} Watch Room or <b>Service</b> <b>Room</b> where fuel and other {{supplies}} were kept and where the keeper prepared the lanterns for the night and often stood watch. The clockworks (for rotating the lenses) were also located there. On a lighthouse tower, an open platform called the gallery is often located outside the watch room (called the Main Gallery) or Lantern Room (Lantern Gallery). This was mainly used for cleaning {{the outside of the}} windows of the Lantern Room.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and <b>service</b> <b>room</b> for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing to the ticket windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the ground floor includes several former offices between the chamber and the stair, {{and a series of}} small <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> to the rear. Projecting from the north-western corner of the building is a single-storey wing, with three small former <b>services</b> <b>rooms</b> opening onto a common verandah. This wing has details consistent with the two-storey part of the building.|$|R

25|$|This {{sanctuary}} {{consisted of}} a rectangular enclosure (60 x 50 metres), which was entered {{on the east side}} through a rectangular propylaea in antis (built in the fifth century BC) fronted by a short staircase and a circular structure. Outside of the enclosure, the propylaea is flanked by the remains of a long portico (stoa) with seats for the pilgrims, who left evidence of themselves in the form of various altars and votives. Inside the enclosure, there was the large altar (16.3 metres long x 3.15 metres wide) in the centre, on top of a pile of ashes from the bones {{and other parts of the}} sacrifices. It had an extension to the southwest, while the remains of an earlier archaic altar are visible near the northwest extremity and there is a square pit on the temple side of the altar. Between the altar and the temple there is a canal carved in the rock which, comes from the north, through the whole area, carrying water to the sanctuary from a nearby spring. Just past the canal is the Temple of Demeter istself in the form of a megaron (20.4 x 9.52 metres), lacking a crepidoma or columns, but equipped with a pronaos, naos and adyton with a niche in the back. A rectangular <b>service</b> <b>room</b> is attached to the north side of the pronaos. The megaron had an earlier phase recognisable only at the foundation level. South of the temple there is a square structure and a rectangular structure of unclear function. North of the temple, another structure from a later period with two rooms opening onto the inside and outside of the temenos forms a secondary entrance to the enclosure. The south wall of the enclosure was periodically reinforced to fight the subsidence of the hillside.|$|E
25|$|The building's {{lower level}} has been {{historically}} used for commercial purposes. As a corner lot, {{the first floor}} L-elevation has one square-shaped volume facing west towards Paseo Atocha, while the other two commercial spaces occupy the longitudinal axis that runs east-to-west along Castillo Street. The commercial spaces are of different sizes. In all three sections, the original floors were replaced with native tiles, product of an early 20th century intervention. The 12-foot high ceiling in the square-shaped section is covered with pressed tin panels, a decorative addition very frequently used during the 1920s among the upper class' residences and social/civic buildings in different cities in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the 17-foot high ceiling {{in the other two}} commercial areas have kept the original exposed ausubo (manilkara bidentata tree) beams, sustaining the pichipen rafters, which support three layers of thin bricks that make-up the foundation for the upper level floor. Throughout the entire first floor's interior, the stucco has been removed, leaving the brick walls completely exposed. Each commercial section has its own <b>service</b> <b>room.</b> The 110 feet 5 inches long longitudinal elevation that faces Castillo Street has a very public exposure with four large clear glass windows and an equal number of clear-glass-metal-framed doors. The axis that faces Paseo Atocha has an additional glass door and two large glass windows. All three spaces at the first floor have access to a narrow backyard limited by a seven-foot high brick and masonry wall, which runs east-to-west, and separates the commercial space, physically and visually, from a large open garden-like interior patio only accessible to the upper-level residents. The Castillo Street axis has, on its eastern end, an arched wooden gate, that provide access to the cochera (carport), which by the time Casa Vives was built in the 1860s, served to properly house the family's horse stagecoach, and later, during the early twentieth century, housed the Ford's model T's and Model A's.|$|E

50|$|The interior, on {{the ground}} floor, which was {{modified}} during the renovation of 1967, included a larger semi-circular foyer (formerly the dining room), living <b>room,</b> kitchen, and <b>service</b> <b>rooms</b> and staff quarters. The tower housed the library. On the first floor, which is served by an elevator, are seven bedrooms and four bathrooms as well as <b>service</b> <b>rooms,</b> laundry and linen room. A staircase leads to the terrace.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has been recently refitted, and has rendered masonry walls and suspended ceilings. The building contains two court rooms, {{the first of which}} fronts the entrance portico and the second, where the original court room was located, is accessed via the enclosed side verandahs. The side wings contain offices and <b>service</b> <b>rooms,</b> and the rear section has interview and <b>service</b> <b>rooms.</b> Much of the original detailing survives, including architraves, skirtings and window sills.|$|R

2500|$|Another wartime {{personality}} of Valenciennes was Louise de Bettignies (born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux), a pupil of the Ursulines in Valenciennes from 1890 to 1896. Fluent in four languages (including German), in 1915 she created {{and directed the}} main British intelligence network behind enemy lines, nearly [...] from the front around Lille. Arrested {{at the end of}} September 1915, and imprisoned in Germany, she died of mistreatment in September 1918 two months before the Armistice. It is estimated that she saved the lives of nearly a thousand British soldiers by the remarkably precise information she obtained. For example, it enabled the British to conduct the first aerial bombing of a train (that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who came to visit the front at Lille), though both aircraft were not equipped with suitable viewfinders and so the raid narrowly missed its target. The German High Command, based in Brussels, then put all its efforts into neutralising the accursed network that allowed the British to see everything and know everything about this part of the front. Louise's arrest was associated with the escape of Szeck Alexandre, a young Austrian radio operator got out of Brussels in August 1915, allowing the British {{to get their hands on}} the secret German diplomatic code. This code was exploited by Secret <b>Service</b> <b>Room</b> 40 ("Room 40"), under the supervision of Sir Reginald Hall, and in January 1917 allowed the decipherment of the famous Zimmermann Telegram, which triggered the United States' entry into the war in April 1917.|$|E

60|$|We {{all heard}} it,--the {{sound of a}} shot in the corridor. I kept Felicia back for the moment, but the others were already outside. The waiter and the valet had rushed out of the <b>service</b> <b>room.</b> A chambermaid, with her apron over her head, ran {{screaming}} along the corridor. There in the middle Delora lay, flat on his back, with his hands thrown out and a smoking revolver by his side!...|$|E
6000|$|Louis {{bowed and}} hurried off. I saw him {{disappear}} {{for a moment}} into the <b>service</b> <b>room.</b> When he came out into the restaurant he was once more discharging his duties, moving about amongst his clients, supervising, suggesting, bidding farewell to departing guests, and welcoming new arrivals. A very busy man, Louis, for the cafe was crowded that day. I wondered, as I saw him pass backwards and forwards, with that eternal and yet not displeasing smile upon his lips, what lay {{at the back of}} his head concerning me! ...|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding its {{somewhat}} subdued air, {{there was}} all the time going on around us a cheerful murmur of conversation, the popping of corks, the laughter of women, the hurrying to and fro of waiters,--all the pleasant disturbance of an ordinary restaurant at the most festive hour of the night. But there came, just at this moment, a curious interruption, an interruption curious not only on its own account, but {{on account of the}} effect which it produced. From somewhere in the centre of the room there commenced ringing, softly at first, and afterwards with a greater volume, a gong, something like the siren of a motor-car, but much softer and more musical. Instantly a dead silence seemed to fall upon the place. Conversation was broken off, laughter was checked, even the waiters stood still in their places. The eyes of every one seemed turned towards the door. One or two of the men rose, and in the faces of these was manifest a sudden expression in which was present more or less of absolute terror. Bartot for a moment shrank back in his chair as though he had been struck, only to recover himself the next second; and the lady with the turquoises bent over and whispered in his ear. One person only left his place,--a young man who had been sitting at a table {{at the other end of}} the room with one of the gayest parties. At the very first note of alarm he had sprung to his feet. A few seconds later, with swift, silent movements and face as pale as a ghost, he had vanished into the little <b>service</b> <b>room</b> from which the waiters issued and returned. With his disappearance the curious spell which seemed to have fallen upon these other people passed away. The waiters resumed their tasks. The room was once more hilariously gay. Upon the threshold a newcomer was standing, a tall man in correct morning dress, with a short gray beard and a tiny red ribbon in his button-hole. He stood there smiling slightly--an unobtrusive entrance, such as might have befitted any habitue of the place. Yet all the time his eyes were travelling restlessly up and down the room. As he stood there, one could fancy there was not a face into which he did not look during those few minutes.|$|E
