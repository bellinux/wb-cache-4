40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{gene therapy}} methods have limited control over where a {{therapeutic}} viral <b>vector</b> <b>inserts</b> into the host genome. Vector integration can activate local gene expression, {{which can cause}} cancer if the <b>vector</b> <b>inserts</b> near an oncogene. Viral integration hot-spots or 'common insertion sites' (CIS) are scrutinized to evaluate and predict patient safety. CIS are typically defined by a minimum density of insertions (such as 2 - 4 within a 30 - 100 kb region), which unfortunately depends on {{the total number of}} observed VIS. This is problematic for comparing hot-spot distributions across data sets and patients, where the VIS numbers may vary. Results We develop two new methods for defining hot-spots that are relatively independent of data set size. Both methods operate on distributions of VIS across consecutive 1 Mb 'bins' of the genome. The first method 'z-threshold' tallies the number of VIS per bin, converts these counts to z-scores, and applies a threshold to define high density bins. The second method 'BCP' applies a Bayesian change-point model to the z-scores to define hot-spots. The novel hot-spot methods are compared with a conventional CIS method using simulated data sets and data sets from five published human studies, including the X-linked ALD (adrenoleukodystrophy), CGD (chronic granulomatous disease) and SCID-X 1 (X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency) trials. The BCP analysis of the human X-linked ALD data for two patients separately (774 and 1627 VIS) and combined (2401 VIS) resulted in 5 - 6 hot-spots covering 0. 17 - 0. 251 % of the genome and containing 5. 56 - 7. 74 % of the total VIS. In comparison, the CIS analysis resulted in 12 - 110 hot-spots covering 0. 018 - 0. 246 % of the genome and containing 5. 81 - 22. 7 % of the VIS, corresponding to a greater number of hot-spots as the data set size increased. Our hot-spot methods enable one to evaluate the extent of VIS clustering, and formally compare data sets in terms of hot-spot overlap. Finally, we show that the BCP hot-spots from the repopulating samples coincide with greater gene and CpG island density than the median genome density. Conclusions The z-threshold and BCP methods are useful for comparing hot-spot patterns across data sets of disparate sizes. The methodology and software provided here should enable one to study hot-spot conservation across a variety of VIS data sets and evaluate vector safety for gene therapy trials. </p...|$|R

Test vector ordering is an effective method to reduce switching activity in combinational circuits and scan chain reordering has been often cited as an effective technique for reducing power dissipation in the scan chain during testing. This paper describes a technique for re-ordering of test vectors and scan cells to minimize power dissipation in full scan combinational circuits during test application. The reduction is achieved by decreasing the switching activity and spurious transitions between consequent test vectors and scan cells. We formulate the test vector and scan reordering problem as a travel salesman problem (TSP) using hamming distance between test vectors and scan cells. One of the successful approaches to solve TSP is using genetic algorithm (GA) and we use standard genetic algorithm to solve this problem.

A Potato virus X (PVX) vector carrying the SPMV capsid protein (CP) gene was successfully stabilized through three serial passages in Nicotiana benthamiana from the upper non-inoculated leaves following rub inoculation. The presence of SPMV CP expression from the PVX vector was confirmed by necrotic lesions that occur only when SPMV CP is present and by western blot and reversetranscription PCR analyses. In addition, PVX-SPCP was co-inoculated onto N. benthamiana with a Tomato bushy stunt virus vector carrying a green fluorescent protein gene, which normally does not yield GFP expression in upper tissue due to loss of the insert. However, upon co-inoculation with PVX-SPCP, upper non-inoculated leaves exhibited GFP accumulation based on green fluorescence by UV illumination at 488 nm and western blot analysis.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cDNA was ligated {{to either side of}} an internal ribosomal re-entry site (IRES) to produce inline production of both the VEGF and EGFP proteins. After in vitro insertion and quantification of integrating units (IUs), engineered cells produce a bioluminescent marker and a chemotactic growth factor.
