25|$|In 1915, Talmadge got her big break, {{starring}} in Vitagraph’s prestigious feature film The Battle Cry of Peace, an anti-German propagandist drama, but ambitious Peg <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> daughter's potential could carry them further, {{and got a}} two-year contract with National Pictures Company for eight features at $400 per week. Talmadge's last film for Vitagraph was The Crown Prince's Double. In the summer of 1915, she left Vitagraph. In the five years she had been with Vitagraph, she made over 250 films.|$|E
25|$|Dolores Huerta {{grew up in}} Stockton, California, {{which was}} in the San Joaquin Valley, an area filled with farms. In the early 1950s, she {{completed}} a degree at Delta Community College, part of the University of the Pacific. She briefly worked as an elementary school teacher. Huerta <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> students, many of them children of farm workers, were living in poverty without enough food to eat or other basic necessities. To help, she became {{one of the founders of}} the Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO). The CSO worked to improve social and economic conditions for farm workers and to fight discrimination.|$|E
25|$|As her {{children}} became adults, Victoria began to seek suitors for them. In 1878, Charlotte married her paternal second cousin Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, which delighted the Berlin court. Three years later, Victoria began negotiations to marry William to Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, provoking outrage in conservative German circles. Chancellor Bismarck criticised the project because the princess {{belonged to the}} family who was dethroned by Prussia with the annexation of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in 1864. As for the Hohenzollerns, they considered Augusta Victoria unworthy to marry the heir apparent to the German Empire because her family lacked sufficient rank. After several months of negotiations, Victoria got what she wanted, but soon became disappointed when she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> daughter-in-law {{did not have the}} liberal personality that she expected.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her return}} to South Africa she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> mission was to assist in healing the wounds inflicted by the war and to support efforts aimed at {{rehabilitation}} and reconciliation. [...] With this object in view, she visited South Africa again in 1903. She decided to set up Boer home industries and to teach young women spinning and weaving when she returned once more in 1905. Ill health, from which she never recovered, forced her to return to England in 1908. She traveled to South Africa again in 1913 for the inauguration of the National Women's Monument in Bloemfontein but had to stop at Beaufort West due to her failing health.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat." [...] His sister replied, [...] "You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?" [...] She then took grain from her personal stores {{and gave it to}} Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.|$|E

60|$|Tavernake was embarrassed. He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Beatrice {{was anxious}} {{to talk to her}} father; he <b>saw,</b> also, <b>that</b> <b>her</b> father was {{determined}} not to talk to her. With a little sigh, however, she resigned herself to the inevitable.|$|R
2500|$|When Zhao Ang {{was serving}} as the Prefect (令) of Qiangdao County (羌道縣; around present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu), he left his family in Xi (西), a {{district}} in the county. Around the time, Liang Shuang (梁雙) started a revolt in the county and he conquered Xi District. Wang Yi's two sons {{were killed in the}} conflict, leaving behind Wang Yi and her six-year-old daughter, Zhao Ying (趙英). When Wang Yi <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> two sons had died, she feared that Liang Shuang would violate her, so she attempted to slit her throat with a sword. However, she gave up when she saw her daughter and she said, [...] "If I killed myself and abandoned you, who will take care of you? I heard that people will cover their noses if someone wore unclean clothing – even if the person was Xi Shi. Besides, my looks aren't even comparable to Xi Shi's." [...] She then rubbed dirt and excrement on her clothes and fasted to make herself become thin. This lasted for about a year.|$|E
2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and locked the door, then later went on to his experimental work." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{what you}} say," [...] sneered Belllounds. [...] "You were {{making love to}} Columbine. I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> in <b>her</b> face. You know it--and she knows it--and I know it.... You're a liar!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Kate seriously breathed. But she {{had turned}} pale, and he <b>saw</b> <b>that,</b> {{whatever}} <b>her</b> degree of ignorance of these connexions, it wasn't put on. [...] "Mrs. Stringham hasn't said that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For that I feel accountable,' said Robert, sadly. 'I cannot forget <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{determination}} {{coincided with}} the evening I made her aware of my position.

60|$|Helen {{raised her}} head, and Philippa <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{were filled with}} tears.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him, and he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> face was unusually pale.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she looked}} up, and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> face was torn with passion.|$|E
60|$|She {{flashed a}} {{grateful}} {{look up at}} him, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> he knew <b>her</b> secret.|$|R
60|$|Again I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{contraction}} of <b>her</b> eyes, {{but she never}} winced or changed her tone.|$|R
60|$|Edgar <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{she meant}} <b>her</b> {{instructions}} {{to be carried}} out; but he forced a smile.|$|R

60|$|Lady Barbara {{held up her}} head, stiffly, but she {{was very}} near tears, of pain and wounded pride; {{but she would not}} defend herself; and she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> even <b>her</b> {{faithful}} Jane did not feel with her.|$|R
6000|$|I grieve to {{say that}} Mr. Staples did not look as pleased at the {{celestial}} vision as he might have, and poor Mrs. Fraser probably <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> in <b>her</b> child's face which drove other things from her mind. Yet Mr. Staples persisted:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She only answered: [...] "It's all right, dear," [...] but he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> {{she kept}} <b>her</b> eyes--those blue, too true eyes--averted, {{even when she}} kissed him.|$|R
60|$|Irene {{lifted her}} head, and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> fine eyes {{were filled with}} tears.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{when she}} <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> child was gone, Nandie {{spoke for the}} first time.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will see}} what it is!" [...] he cried. And then he was glad he had not abdicated, for as he turned away he glanced again at Mary and <b>saw</b> <b>that,</b> though <b>her</b> eyes were full of trouble, they were not hard and accusing, but charged with {{appealing}} friendship.|$|R
6000|$|Some trivial {{questions}} were asked her about St. Michael's dress and appearance. She answered them with dignity, but one <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> they gave <b>her</b> pain. After a little she said: ...|$|R
