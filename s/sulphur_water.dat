25|$|In 1885, the Nashville Americans {{minor league}} {{baseball}} team became charter members of the newly formed Southern League. Athletic Park, which had hitherto been little more that solely a baseball field, required improvements to make it suitable for professional teams. A 150-foot (46 m) wooden grandstand was built {{at the corner of}} modern-day Fourth Avenue North and Jackson Street. The main Jackson Street entrance led past the ticket booth and into the grandstand's reserved seats behind home plate and a screen backstop. Rooms for players, directors, scorers, and reporters were built under the grandstand. Two of them had views of the field, which were protected by wire screens. Restrooms and water fountains, which pumped up <b>sulphur</b> <b>water</b> from the springs below, were also built. The distance to the outfield fence was 362feet (110m) to left and right fields and 485feet (148m) to center.|$|E

For an individual it would cost 1 shilling to drink <b>sulphur</b> <b>water</b> at the Pump Room for a week.

5000|$|Clifty Creek crosses U.S. Highway 62 and the P & L {{railroad}} {{several miles}} to the southwest of Big Clifty. It is said that travelers named the town due to the limestone cliffs that arose {{on the sides of}} Clifty Creek. Accounts of residents from the past report that Big Clifty was a [...] "boom town" [...] that at one time had a post office, bank, feed mill, several dry goods stores and restaurants.

Big Clifty benefited from the traffic going to Clarkson. Spurrier Mill was a grist mill on the Nolin River, several miles from Big Clifty which was a benefit to the economy.

40|$|Carried out complex {{research}} {{indicated that}} {{in the course of}} weathering of terrigenouscarbonate rocks of basic diamondiferous regions of the Siberian Platform a dissolution of carbonates and decomposition of trioctahedral laminated silicates took place first. Because of such process and sequential washing out the individual elements from various levels of thick eluvial layers, sufficient alteration of physical-mechanical properties and structural-textural specific features of primary rocks can be observed. Fast destruction of carbonates and trioctahedral minerals leads to development of cavities and large pores with high permeability, providing leaching of potassium, abundance of silica and other unstable in the zone of hypergenesis elements. Redistribution of elements provides a local decrease of medium pH and subsequent relative accumulation of aluminum, which is the most important element necessary for new formation of kaolinite. Some intermediate phases (gypsum, aluminite, basaluminite, jarosite and others) may crystallize in the formed caverns and fractures. A very intensive process of superimposed secondary formation of sulphate minerals due to infiltration of rich in <b>sulphur</b> <b>waters</b> is an important feature of hypergene alteration of terrigenous-carbonate rocks in the basic diamondiferous regions of the Siberian Platform. It allows referring such crust of weathering to sulfuric type, apart from the Pre-Early Jurassic crust of alkaline type...|$|R
