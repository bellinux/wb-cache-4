50|$|The archaeological {{integrity}} and potential for <b>site</b> <b>preservation</b> of the First Brisbane Burial Ground is high. Excavations {{at the nearby}} North Brisbane Burial Ground (1843-1875) in the early 2000s demonstrate that burials and their associated material culture survive in the Brisbane clays close to the river. The First Brisbane Burial Ground has not been subjected to the extreme levels of post-depositional contamination that occurred at the North Brisbane Burial Ground.|$|E
50|$|Threats to Tyre's ancient {{cultural}} heritage include development pressures and the illegal antiquities trade. A highway, planned for 2011, {{is expected to}} be built in areas that are deemed archaeologically sensitive. A small-scale geophysical survey indicated the presence of archaeological remains at proposed construction sites. The sites have not been investigated. Despite the relocation of a proposed traffic interchange, the lack of precise site boundaries confuses the issue of <b>site</b> <b>preservation.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of plant macroremains from Poças de São Bento, a shell-midden in the Sado Valley (Portugal), has provided interesting {{insights into the}} shell-midden formation processes {{and the presence of}} resources which are often invisible^ in this kind of <b>sites.</b> <b>Preservation</b> and representationissues are discussed in a bidirectional way. Potential complementary explanations for the presence of such plant remains in hunter-gatherer open-air sites are offered. The understanding of plant exploitation patterns by these last huntergatherers in Portugal is crucial for the comprehension of the multifaceted phenomena of Neolithisations, in this case, characterised by a long availability phase and ultimate adoption of domesticates. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Donny George who was an employee at the Iraq National Museum was appointed to Director of Museums in 2004, and by summer 2006, a force of 1400 guards were at sites around the country.|$|E
50|$|Broster {{served as}} the Middle Tennessee {{regional}} archaeologist for the Tennessee Division of Archaeology and was the prehistoric archaeological supervisor for many years, {{until his retirement in}} 2013. It was Broster’s job, and the responsibility of the division to survey, excavate, and preserve prehistoric and historic sites in Tennessee, as well as research and publish on their findings in popular and scientific formats. Most importantly, it is the goal of the division to maintain public interest in Archaeology in order to encourage public cooperation with <b>site</b> <b>preservation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Physical {{evidence}} of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement is now rare. Human remains and associated material culture, including personal items, have potential to survive subsurface at the First Brisbane Burial Ground. Development on the site beginning in the 1870s (construction of Skew Street and subdivision has been low impact and unlikely {{to have had a}} major detrimental impact on the preservation of human remains and material culture or their potential for survival. The capping of the site by road construction from the 1870s and residential and commercial development (single storey cottages and the Helidon Spa Water Company) in the 1880s is likely to have had a positive effect on <b>site</b> <b>preservation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The farm {{remained}} in the ownership of the Kelley family until 1901. The National Grange bought the farm in 1935 and donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society in 1961. Today, the farm offers tours by guides in period costume, who invite visitors to help out with farm chores such as picking vegetables, churning butter, and making soap. In 2003, state budget shortfalls threatened closure for the historical site. In response, the group Friends of the Kelley Farm was organized to help raise money to close the funding gap.

[...] Brigadier General Ernest Alexander Cruikshank, a noted authority on the War of 1812 {{and the history of}} Ontario, was chosen as the Board's first chairman, a post he held for twenty years.

In 1992 the government funded a renovation of the temple, which restored the original building but did not touch the new ones. Since 2007, the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Centre (CHP) also established its headquarters in one of the buildings. In Autumn of the same year, a public mill (a stone slab used by the community in ancient times to grind cereals) in front of the temple has been destroyed, as the road was levelled for easier traffic.|$|E
5000|$|Visitors hold a large {{responsibility}} {{in regards to}} archaeological <b>site</b> <b>preservation.</b> This goes beyond just vandalism. Even just their presence can be harmful for a site. An example of this happened at Recapture Canyon in Utah. In 2007, the United State's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had to close access to the canyon to off-road vehicles due to the damage it was causing local archaeological sites. [...] However, several visitors did not listen to this and actually created a wider trail through the canyon. Also, in May 2014 a large protest was held. This protest consisted of hundreds of protesters riding off-road vehicles through the canyon itself. [...] Due to {{the large amount of}} people going through in such a short amount of time, it is very possible that the protest itself caused further damage.|$|E
