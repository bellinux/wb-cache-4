25|$|Besides these routes, {{there are}} tractor routes along the {{climbing}} routes. These tractor routes {{are used to}} bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain.

This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.|$|E

25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester.

The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really doing its job. The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout.
