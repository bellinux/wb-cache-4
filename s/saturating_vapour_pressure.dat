40|$|We {{study the}} effects of nuclear {{polarization}} M on the liquid-gas equilibrium phase diagram of 3 He, in situations where the <b>saturating</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> increases or decreases as a function of M, and where a metamagnetic instability may occur in the liquid phase. Numerical predictions are given within the frame of a phenomenological model with parameters fitted to reproduce accurately the <b>saturating</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of the unpolarized liquid as well as its magnetic susceptibility. At temperatures of the order of 0. 5 K situations are found where interesting phenomena such as liquid overpolarization and metamagnetic plateaus occur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA simple {{physical}} model describing the temperature-gradient metamorphism of snow is presented. This model, based on Kelvin's equation and Fick's law, {{takes into account}} the local variation of the <b>saturating</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> with temperature. It can determine locally whether the ice is condensing or subliming, depending on both the pressure and temperature fields in the snow structure. This model can also explain the formation of facets that occurs during the metamorphism. Using X-ray microtomographic images of snow samples obtained under low to moderate temperature-gradient conditions, this model has been tested and compared to the reaction-limited model proposed in a previous work...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDecomposition of CpCuPEt 3 (Cp=NNN(η 5 -C 5 H 5)) and MOCVD of Cu {{films from}} CpCuPEt 3 have been {{investigated}} {{in the frame of}} an ongoing project on the processing of Cu-containing coatings. The behaviour of CpCuPEt 3 vapours under heating conditions was studied by in situ mass spectrometry. It was established that this compound is monomeric in gas phase. Its decomposition mechanism on hot surface was proposed. From mass spectroscopy experiments, it was established that decomposition in vacuum begins at 150 °C with evolution of PEt 3. Beyond 270 °C, formation of cyclopentadiene is observed, indicating that a change in decomposition mechanism occurs. The <b>saturating</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of CpCuPEt 3 was estimated through static method, in order to optimize transport conditions and to control the molar fraction of the precursor in the gas phase. Finally, growth rate and microstructure of MOCVD processed Cu films from CpCuPEt 3 {{have been investigated}}...|$|E

40|$|Chemical vapour {{deposition}} and {{atomic layer deposition}} using precursors that are solids at ambient temperature and pressure present challenges due to the often low <b>saturating</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of these compounds. Additional concerns arise from the difficulty to maintain a reproducible and stable precursor flow rate to the deposition chamber and from the possible particle contamination if suitable safeguards are not built into the precursor delivery line. In the present contribution, SUBLIBOX, a pilot industrial scale sublimator is presented. SUBLIBOX {{is based on a}} new sublimation process involving gas-solid fluidization technology. Aluminum acetyl–acetonate [Al(acac) 3], a promising precursor for the processing of alumina films despite its low saturated vapour pressure, is used as a model, though technologically interesting system. Mass balance measurements, involving trapping of the sublimed precursor at the exit of the sublimation chamber, reveal that SUBLIBOX ensures (a) stable, (b) efficient, (c) reproducible and (d) long term precursor vapour flow rates. The process is particularly well adapted for delivering vapours to CVD reactors for coatings on glass and stainless steel or for producing optical fibbers preforms by various techniques...|$|E

The apparent rise in <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of condensed hydrogen and its isotopes was attributed to the relase of phonons from the substrate by photons which traversed the condensate without absorption.

Experimental {{investigations}} of the <b>saturated</b> <b>vapour</b> <b>pressure</b> of liquid Na ^K, Na ^Cs, K ^Cs, Rb ^Cs, and Na ^K ^Cs alloys were carried out at temperatures up to 1500 K. The measurements were made by both the classical static method and the static manometric method. The alloys were prepared by the weighing method and the error in concentration of their components is 0 : 5 wt%. A statistical analysis {{of the results of}} the experiments was carried out. Their absolute error including systematic and random components did not exceed 1. 5 % at temperatures up to 1000 K and 1 % at temperatures more than 1000 K.
