Starting in April with the Santa Clara pea harvest, strikes erupted {{throughout}} the summer and fall as each crop ripened for harvest. The strike wave culminated with the San Joaquin Valley strike, the largest and most important strike in the history of American agriculture. All told, more than 47, 500 farmworkers participated in the 1933 strikes.
