50|$|Both Rectigraph and Photostat {{machines}} {{consisted of}} a large camera that photographed documents or papers and exposed an image directly onto rolls of <b>sensitized</b> photographic <b>paper</b> that were about 350 ft long. A prism was {{placed in front of}} the lens to reverse the image. After a 10-second exposure, the paper was directed to developing and fixing baths, then either air- or machine-dried. The result was a negative print, which took about two minutes in total to produce, which could in turn be photographed to make any number of positive prints.|$|R
50|$|One or more negatives {{are placed}} in {{intimate}} contact with a sheet of <b>sensitized</b> photographic <b>paper.</b> The negative and the photographic paper are then placed, negative side down, onto the top transparent glass plate of the exposure box. Within the box and below the top plate is a translucent light diffuser made from frosted glass. Below the diffuser is a switch-controlled electric light source. A hinged top-cover keeps the materials in close contact and reduces or eliminates the amount of stray light allowed into the darkroom. Ansel Adams describes procedures for making contact prints using ordinary lighting in his book, The Print.|$|R
5000|$|The {{different}} names blue-line copier, whiteprint copier or [...] diazo copier, were given, {{due to the}} nature of the process, which consists in exposing to an ultraviolet light a previously <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper</b> with a component called diazo, and finally developing it in a bath (a solution of ammonia in water) which converts the parts not exposed to light, to a dark blue colour (blue-line) over an almost white background.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} earlier reprographic processes, a {{translucent}} original drawing was placed over {{a sheet of}} the <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper</b> and exposed to light. However, the next step exposed the paper to an ammonia gas. This alkaline gas catalyzed a reaction between the diazo salts and the coupling agent to produce an image that fixed in the paper over several days. Typically these prints have blue or dark purple lines on a mottled cream-colored background, although line and ground colors can vary.|$|E
5000|$|Photographic {{printing}} is {{the process}} of producing a final image on paper for viewing, using chemically <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper.</b> The paper is exposed to a photographic negative, a positive transparency (or slide), or a digital image file projected using an enlarger or digital exposure unit such as a LightJet printer. Alternatively, the negative or transparency may be placed atop the paper and directly exposed, creating a contact print. Photographs are more commonly printed on plain paper, for example by a color printer, but this is not considered [...] "photographic printing".|$|E
5000|$|The {{image from}} the {{negative}} or transparency is projected through a lens fitted with an adjustable iris aperture, onto to a flat surface bearing the <b>sensitized</b> photographic <b>paper.</b> By adjusting the ratio of distance from film to lens to the distance from lens to paper, various degrees of enlargement may be obtained, with the physical enlargement ratio limited only by {{the structure of the}} enlarger {{and the size of the}} paper. As the image size is changed it is also necessary to change the focus of the lens. Some enlargers, such as Leica's [...] "Autofocus" [...] enlargers, perform this automatically.|$|R

Since the battlefields of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville were Union defeats and remained in enemy hands, Northern photographers were unable to reach the fields.|$|R
50|$|Gelatin silver print {{paper was}} made {{as early as}} 1874 on a {{commercial}} basis, but it was poor quality because the dry-plate emulsion was coated onto the paper only as an afterthought. Coating machines {{for the production of}} continuous rolls of <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper</b> were in use by the mid-1880s, though widespread adoption of gelatin silver print materials did not occur until the 1890s. The earliest papers had no baryta layer, and {{it was not until the}} 1890s that baryta coating became a commercial operation, first in Germany, in 1894, and then taken up by Kodak by 1900.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of {{whiteprint}} copying , [...] (essentially a diazotype process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.).

The <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper,</b> has a photosensitive coating -an impregnation of diazo - covering {{the surface of the}} paper.

5000|$|By {{varying the}} amount of {{platinum}} versus palladium {{and the addition of}} oxidizing chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium dichromate or potassium chlorate, the contrast and [...] "color" [...] of the final image can be modified. Because of the non-uniformity of the coating and mixing phases of the process, no two prints are exactly the same. The inherent low sensitivity of the process occurs because the ferric oxalate is sensitive to ultra-violet light only, thus specialized light sources must be used and exposure times are many times greater than those used in silver-based photographic processes. Due to the unavailability of pre-coated <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper,</b> all platinum/palladium printing is done on paper coated by the printer. The light sensitive chemicals are mixed from powdered basic chemicals, or some commercially available solutions, then hand applied with a brush or a cylindrical [...] "pusher". Many artists achieve varying effects by choosing different papers for different surface characteristics, including vellum, rag, silk, and rice, among others. On the collecting market, platinum prints often sell for many times what a similar silver-gelatin print would bring.|$|E
40|$|As {{most of the}} {{information}} about the environment in which the human organism functions is perceived through the eyes, photographic images satisfy a quite fundamental, and therefore universal, human need. Ever since the production of such images was demonstrated to be feasible at a combined Paris meeting of the French Academies of Science and Fine Arts in 1839, the practice of photography has become widely diffused, encountering and subduing initial resistance in a variety of cultures along the way. Over time and as economic development permitted, the photographic image has come into such widespread use {{that it is difficult to}} imagine the contemporary world without it. During its first five decades, the practice of photography was marked by a number of technological and economic fits and starts. The materials used in capturing images changed from silvered metal plates to glass plates to celluloid; the carrying agents for the chemicals used to <b>sensitize</b> printing <b>papers</b> changed from egg whites to collodion to gelatin.

50|$|After Niépce's {{death in}} 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre {{continued}} to experiment and by 1837 {{had created the}} first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839. Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor {{to give it a}} coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the <b>sensitized</b> plate or <b>paper</b> and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.|$|R
40|$|The use of photo/collage {{dates back}} to the Dadaist at the {{beginning}} of this century. Cutting up and pasting together photographs to form a new reality is not a new idea. Photo/collage or montage originally dealt with ideas of illusion and reality. Photo/collage as I have explored it is still an exploration of this premise; however, the difference between what I am concerned with and how it was historically used is that for me the photograph and its place in history and its modern implication is the most important reference. Photographs are an integral part of our modern world. We are subjected to hundreds of photographs a day. We seldom really look at them, they are seen and disregarded. Our conceptualization of the world is often arrived at by viewing a photograph. Where are these people captured in this tiny world, are they still alive, why were they gathered together for this group portrait, whose home is this, where is it, what happened to the people who lived in it? All these questions and more come into my mind when I look at a photograph. These people, places, objects, are caught and trapped in whatever reality we as a viewer care to put them. By using photo/collage I can arrange my own reality or situation, compose my interpretation of the fate of those captured on the film. Each piece in Tableaux has a repetition of shape; the background reflecting the torn edges of a photograph; the dried bit of rose reflecting the photograph of a rose; the rice paper overlapping an edge of a building with the same texture. This repetition of shape was meant to bring the eye back and forth from real object to photograph of a real object; reality to copy of reality; dream to nondream. Repetition has a tendency to soothe and calm the mind and sometimes to lull into a false sense of security. The intention of the pieces in Tableaux was to transmit that sense of security through the use of repetition and then to present clues of a more sinister event about to occur or one that has just occurred. Photographs are stored flat, whole, put into albums, wallets, displayed on mantles, plastered on billboards, but always shown edge to edge, complete, framed. Photographs are "taken care of" because you cannot recapture the moment caught of the film. The photograph is protected. The photo/collages in Tableaux are deliberately torn, vandalized, applied with color, printed to show the edge of the negative, fuzzy, printed with an obstruction on the <b>sensitized</b> <b>paper</b> to create an unclear image. The picture space may be almost totally blank with only fragments of the negative printed. In altering the traditionally printed photograph in these various manners the importance of the photograph is negated. The photograph itself has no inherent value, the photograph is not precious. The value lies in the illusion produced for the viewer. Photographic collage has a potential for creating a hyperreal, visual dramatization of traditional black and white photography by altering these literal images. (See more in text...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{refers to}} a current {{discussion}} on the effectiveness and efficiency of Bielefeld University Library and concentrates on requirements and conditions of implementing customer intelligence in academic libraries. Moreover, a conceptual framework for a library management information system based on a data warehouse that links external and internal data to support strategic planning processes is introduced. Design/methodology/approach: Content-related and technical aspects of customer intelligence in academic libraries are outlined and analogies are drawn to commercial enterprises to motivate the conceptual reflections. The paper closes with two examples that demonstrate how multifaceted the data pool for customer intelligence can be in librarianship. Findings: The <b>paper</b> <b>sensitizes</b> to the advantages of systematically generating customer knowledge in academic libraries for strategic planning and customer orientation.

40|$|Symbolic {{execution}} is {{a program}} testing technique which evaluates statements with symbolic input data along a selected path of the control flow graph. The process involves the computation of path conditions that tend to be simplified or solved in order either to get test data that sensitize the selected path or to demonstrate infeasibility of the path. In the presence of floating-point computations, the current strategy consists in using a constraint solver based on rationals or reals. Unfortunately, even when the computations conform ANSI/IEEE- 754 floating-point arithmetic, this leads not only to approximative results but also to incorrect ones. For example, a path can be labeled as infeasible by using a constraint solver on the rationals although there exist floating-point input data that <b>sensitize</b> it. This <b>paper</b> shows how to evaluate symbolically the expressions when floating-point variables {{are involved in the}} computations. The focus is on the design and the implementation of projection functions required to solve path conditions over the floats. The proposed approach handles not only the numeric values of floating-point variables but also the symbolic values, such as infinities and NaNs. A symbolic execution environment of C floating-point computations is currently under development. Some very first experimental results are reported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{ethical and}} {{economic}} burden associated with animal testing for assessment of skin sensitization has triggered intensive research effort towards development and validation of alternative methods. In addition, new legislation on the registration {{and use of}} cosmetics and chemicals promote the use of suitable alternatives for hazard assessment. Our previous studies demonstrated that human CD 34 + progenitor-derived dendritic cells from cord blood express specific gene profiles upon exposure to low molecular weight <b>sensitizing</b> chemicals. This <b>paper</b> presents a classification model based on this cell type which is successful in discriminating sensitizing chemicals from non-sensitizing chemicals based on transcriptome analysis of 13 genes. Expression profiles {{of a set of}} 10 sensitizers and 11 non-sensitizers were analyzed by RT-PCR using 9 different exposure conditions and a total of 73 donor samples. Based on these data a predictive dichotomous classifier for skin sensitizers has been constructed, which is referred to as VITOSENS®. In a first step the dimensionality of the input data was reduced by selectively rejecting a number of exposure conditions and genes. Next, the generalization of a linear classifier was evaluated by a cross-validation which resulted in a prediction performance with a concordance of 89 %, a specificity of 97 % and a sensitivity of 82 %. These results show that the present model may be a useful human in vitro alternative for further use in a test strategy towards the reduction of animal use for skin sensitization...|$|R
40|$|Non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is the main}} subtype of lung cancer (LC) and {{unfortunately}} it responds very poorly to conventional chemo- and radiotherapy (RT). Moreover, NSCLC is often diagnosed at a stage where metastases are found and only for {{a limited number of}} NSCLC tumors targeted therapies can be used as their oncogenic drivers remains elusive. Thus there is a need of finding novel targets in NSCLC and this thesis focus around these topics. In Paper I the aim was to find novel RT targets in NSCLC by global genomic profiling. It was previously shown that NSCLC cells could be sensitized to RT by addition of the staurosporine analogue PKC 412. By global gene expression analyses on this NSCLC system we identified the Eph growth factor receptor ligand Ephrin B 3 as a putative RT target as it was downregulated in the combined RT and PKC 412 treated NSCLC cells. Indeed, we demonstrated that Ephrin B 3 ablation of NSCLC cells in combination with RT increased cellular senescence, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis, inhibited the cell survival kinases Akt, MAPKERK, p 38 MAPK and decreased RT-induced G 2 -arrest. Thus we in Paper I identified Ephrin B 3 as a driver of RT resistance. In Paper II the aim was to investigate how Ephrin B 3 influences the proliferative “signalome” of NSCLC cells. The phosphoproteome of NSCLC cells with or without Ephrin B 3 expression was analyzed using a peptid-based approach in which SCX and TiO 2 -based fractionation was used prior to identification by mass spectrometry and Ingenuity pathway analyses. Among the differentially phosphorylated proteins one candidate was the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor tyrosine kinase class A 2 (EphA 2), previously shown to control tumor cell signaling. We demonstrated that when Ephrin B 3 expression was blocked in NSCLC cells EphA 2 lost its phosphorylation on Ser 897, a site previously reported to control migration in other tumor types. We also found that inhibition of Ephrin B 3 expression suppressed Akt 1 Ser 129 phosphorylation which was reported to control EphA 2 at Ser 897. Thus our findings supported a hypothetical mechanism in which NSCLC cell survival signaling was mediated by an Ephrin B 3 and EphA 2 signaling circuit. In Paper III the purpose was to analyze how Ephrin B 3 and its putative Ephs mediates their effects on migration and invasion of NSCLC of different histology in vitro as well as to reveal as to what extent these signaling components may be operative in NSCLC in vivo. Our study identified a novel function of Ephrin B 3 where it similar to EphA 2 controlled proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro. We showed {{for the first time that}} Ephrin B 3 binds EphA 2, EphA 4, EphA 5 and EphA 3 indicating a master function of signaling of Ephrin B 3 in NSCLC. Moreover, as EphA 2 Ser 897 and Akt Ser 129 both were found in complex with Ephrin B 3 in NSCLC cells and given that we observed p 38 MAPK and Src kinase in such complex our data further add onto how EphA 2 may drive NSCLC proliferation and migration. In analyses of NSCLC clinical specimen Ephrin B 3 was concomitantly expressed with EphA 2 and its known ligand Ephrin A 1 but did not correlate to poor survival. Several growth factor receptors, including EphA 5, have been shown to control DNA damage response (DDR) signaling and hence to constitute RT <b>sensitizing</b> targets. In <b>Paper</b> IV we analyzed if EphA 2, EphA 4 and Ephrin B 3 similarly influenced DDR components and hence could be used combat RT resistance. Our results showed that a combination of RT and ablation of EphA 2, EphA 4 or Ephrin B 3 reduced proliferation and colony forming potential. We also described a novel interaction of EphA 2, EphA 4 and Ephrin B 3 with the DDR proteins pATM (S 1981), pDNA-PKcs (S 2056) and γH 2 AX (S 139) suggesting that this Ephrin and corresponding Ephs may directly intervene with DDR. Thus this thesis suggests that Ephrin B 3 and its associated Ephs may be used as novel therapeutic targets in NSCLC alone or in combination with RT enabling further progress on precision cancer medicine...|$|R
