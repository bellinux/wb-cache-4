25|$|Less commonly, acro dancers may wear foot thongs, {{which are}} {{variously}} called Dance Paws and FootUndeez, {{depending on the}} manufacturer. Foot thongs—which are <b>slip-on,</b> partial foot covers that protect only the ball of the foot—are sometimes preferred over acro shoes for aesthetic reasons. In particular, flesh colored foot thongs endow the wearer {{with the appearance of}} having bare feet, while retaining some degree of the traction, cushioning, and abrasion protection provided by acro shoes.|$|E
25|$|Foot thongs are <b>slip-on,</b> partial foot covers {{that cover}} the ball of the dancer's foot so as to reduce {{friction}} while executing turns, thus {{making it easier to}} perform turns and also protecting the foot from skin abrasions. From a distance, flesh colored foot thongs give a dancer the appearance of having bare feet. They are known by various names depending on the manufacturer, including dance paws, foot undies, and foot paws.|$|E
25|$|By {{knowing what}} {{developmental}} stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can {{be tailored to}} helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully. If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using <b>slip-on</b> shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.|$|E

5000|$|The tables above {{describe}} the rank insignia worn {{on the service}} dress jacket. On DEU shirts, sweaters, and outerwear; and operational dress shirts and jackets, rank insignia are worn on <b>slip-ons</b> with the word [...] "CANADA" [...] or a regimental/branch title embroidered underneath. Flag/general officers' <b>slip-ons</b> include only the crown, crossed sabre and baton, and maple leaves worn on the shoulder straps; they {{do not include the}} braid worn on the sleeve. Army NCM <b>slip-ons</b> for DEU shirts, sweaters, and outerwear display only the word [...] "CANADA" [...] or a regimental/branch title, rank insignia being worn instead as enamelled metal pins on collar points or lapels.|$|R
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a <b>slip-on</b> collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Acro dancers {{most often}} wear jazz dance shoes, which are {{commonly}} referred to as acro shoes by acro dancers. Acro shoes are called jazz boots, jazz ankle boots, jazz booties and other names, by their various manufacturers. They are typically laceless, <b>slip-on</b> shoes, with tight-fitting leather uppers that are designed to prevent the dancer's feet from shifting inside the shoes. Because of their thin, pliable leather uppers and split soles, acro shoes have excellent flexibility, thus enabling dancers to attain both good dance form and acrobatic control. The sole is made of soft, composite rubber so as to provide both high traction and cushioning, and it provides excellent protection from skin abrasion as it covers the entire bottom of the foot.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, {{the colour}} of the RAAF winter uniform was {{determined}} by Williams {{on a visit to}} the Geelong Wool Mill. [...] He asked for one dye dip fewer than the RAN blue (three indigo dips rather than four). There was a change to a lighter blue when an all-seasons uniform was introduced in the 1970s. The original colour and style were re-adopted around 2005. <b>Slip-on</b> rank epaulettes, known as [...] "Soft Rank Insignia" [...] (SRI), displaying the word [...] "AUSTRALIA" [...] are worn on the shoulders of the service dress uniform. When not in the service dress or [...] "ceremonial" [...] uniform, RAAF personnel wear the Auscam DPCU as a working dress. Commencing in mid-2014 DPCU began to be replaced, only in the non-deployed environment, with the General Purpose Uniform (GPU) which is a blue version of the Australian Multicam Pattern.|$|E

5000|$|Officers {{displayed}} their rank on <b>slip-ons</b> on the epaulets of {{the shirt}} or jacket; NCMs wore small OD versions of their rank insignia stitched in {{the centre of}} the upper sleeve, although for a period in the 1980s these were stitched onto <b>slip-ons,</b> ostensibly to save wear-and-tear on the uniforms, but also providing the ability to remove rank for security purposes. The national identifier consisted of a [...] "CANADA" [...] flash stitched on the upper shoulder just below the sleeve seam, and unit or trade identifiers were worn on <b>slip-ons</b> on the shirt's epaulets; however, personnel belonging to Canadian Forces Europe and other overseas missions wore full-colour Canadian flag patches on the upper sleeve. In the 1990s, the [...] "CANADA" [...] flash was replaced with a subdued olive-drab Canadian flag, worn on the upper left sleeve below the epaulet. Interestingly, these flag badges showed up in full-colour red-and-white when illuminated by a blue light.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2008, GayNZ.com drew {{attention}} {{to a number of}} disparaging remarks about gays and lesbians made by ex-boyband singer Brian McFadden while he co-hosted the morning breakfast show on More FM in Auckland, New Zealand. He stated, [...] "Saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male... In the old days {{there was no such thing}} as gay. It was frowned upon. The church would burn you at the stake. Modern day, if you are not gay, a man should not be wearing pink. Unless of course you're in the Americas Cup and you're one of these pansies who walk around with Gant t-shirts with your collars up, and you wear pink and you wear white trousers with those dirty brown <b>slip-on</b> shoes. Then you're just an idiot." ...|$|E
2500|$|The clothes worn on Miami Vice had a {{significant}} influence on men's fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the [...] "T-shirt under Armani jacket"–style, and popularized Italian men's fashion in the United States. Don Johnson's typical attire of Italian sport coat, T-shirt, white linen pants, and <b>slip-on</b> sockless loafers became a hit. Even fine timepiece manufacturers got in on the action. Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date [...] "President" [...] model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show's other [...] "approved" [...] colors. Designers such as Vittorio Ricci, Gianni Versace, and Hugo Boss were consulted in keeping the male leads looking trendy. Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, [...] "The concept of the show is to be on top of all the latest fashion trends in Europe." [...] Jodi Tillen, the costume designer for the first season, along with Michael Mann, set the style. The abundance of pastel colors on the show reflected Miami's Art-deco architecture.|$|E

50|$|The {{ranks of}} {{inspector}} and higher are commissioned ranks and are {{appointed by the}} Governor-in-Council. Depending on the dress, badges are worn on the shoulder as <b>slip-ons,</b> on shoulder boards, or directly on the epaulettes. The lower ranks are non-commissioned officers and the insignia continues {{to be based on}} British army patterns. Since 1990, the non-commissioned officers' rank insignia has been embroidered on the epaulette <b>slip-ons.</b> Non-commissioned rank badges are worn on the right sleeve of the scarlet/blue tunic and blue jacket. The constables wear no rank insignia. There are also Special Constables, Reserve Constables, Auxiliary Constables, and Students who wear identifying insignia.|$|R

In British English these would be high-top plimsolls again either in lace up or <b>slip-on.</b> Various manufacturers and models exist, including Keds, Pro-Keds, and Converse. These exist for both genders and all age ranges. The shoes have recently come back in style in 2014, espically white ones.|$|E
