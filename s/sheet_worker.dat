50|$|In July 1959, {{the union}} {{merged with the}} rival National Union of <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> and Braziers to form the National Union of <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> and Coppersmiths.|$|R
5000|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1836 as a split from the [...] "Dublin Tinsmiths and <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> Society". It {{remained}} very small for many years, with only forty members in 1896. It affiliated to the National Amalgamated Society of <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers,</b> but when in 1920 that federation became the National Union of <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> and Braziers, it became independent again, adopting the name National Union of <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> and Gas Meter Makers. In 1967, it adopted its final name, and by 1970 it had 943 members.|$|R

50|$|The union became {{embroiled in}} a {{bruising}} battle with the plumbers' and carpenters' unions in 1919. The <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> had organized thousands of railway locomotive fabricators nationwide, but now the plumbers' union was arguing that it had jurisdiction over the piping work that went into building these engines. Railroad shop workers from the machinists, blacksmiths and plumbers met in St. Louis, Missouri in 1920 {{after a number of}} local plumbers' railroad unions defected to the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers.</b> Although the workers could not agree on which union should have jurisdiction over the work, the workers did agree to form the Federated Railroad Shopmen's Union to protect their work from being taken over by non-railroad workers. In 1921, the federated union disbanded, but the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> won substantial jurisdictional concessions from the plumbers. The conflict would continue into the 1950s, substantially weakening the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers.</b> Finally, on April 26, 1955, the National Mediation Board reaffirmed Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Worker</b> jurisdiction over plumbing and pipefitting work in the railroad industry.|$|R

50|$|The {{introduction}} of metal moldings in buildings {{also created a}} problem for the union. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America claimed jurisdiction over trim and moldings, which had previously been made of wood. The carpenters' union had won a jurisdictional award from an arbitrator in New York City in the spring of 1909. But the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> demanded that the Building Trades Department (BTD) of the AFL issue a ruling. By a 3-to-1 majority, delegates to the Building Trades convention voted in favor of the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers.</b> The carpenters, then the second-largest union in the AFL, withdrew from the Building Trades and initiated a series of jurisdictional strikes against the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> at job sites nationwide. The BTD retaliated by asking AFL president Samuel Gompers to revoke the carpenter's union charter. Instead, Gompers led the AFL executive council in demanding that the BTD reinstate the carpenters' union. The Building Trades did so in 1910, but continued to vote in favor of the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' claims on work. The carpenters' union disaffiliated again. The carpenters' union continued to conduct strikes against the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers,</b> and increasingly won the support of building contractors and local building trades councils. The National Board of Jurisdictional Awards also voted in favor of the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers.</b> But the pressure by the much larger carpenters' union proved too great, and the Amalgamated <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> conceded jurisdiction over interior work in 1926.|$|R

25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American <b>sheet</b> metal <b>worker,</b> Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of <b>Sheet</b> Metal <b>Workers</b> Local 65, 14 white <b>sheet</b> metal <b>workers</b> walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited <b>sheet</b> metal <b>worker,</b> and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened to picket if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|R
