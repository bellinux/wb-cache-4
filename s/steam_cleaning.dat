25|$|The Chifley Cave, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Left Imperial Cave, was renamed in 1952 in honour of Ben Chifley, the recently-retired Federal local member of parliament and former Prime Minister. This cave {{was the first of}} the caves to be lit with electric light, as early as 1880. In 1968, the Orient Cave became the first in the world to be cleaned, due to contamination by mud from the previous access route and a nearby coal boiler. The soot from the boiler was entering the cave via a new tunnel blasted 400 feet through to the Orient cave in 1954 to allow easier access (entering at Bat End). <b>Steam</b> <b>cleaning</b> was found to be damaging to the crystal formations, due to the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the heat from the steam, and these days water from the caves' own underground rivers is used if cave cleaning becomes necessary.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the century, the various {{national}} prototypes of the kilogram were recalibrated against the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) and therefore against each other. The initial 1889 starting-value offsets of the national prototypes relative to the IPK were nulled, [...] with any subsequent mass changes being relative to the IPK. A technique for <b>steam</b> <b>cleaning</b> the prototypes to remove any contaminants was developed in 1946 as part of the second recalibration.|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{the simple}} wear that check {{standards}} can experience, {{the mass of}} even the carefully stored national prototypes can drift relative to the IPK {{for a variety of}} reasons, some known and some unknown. Since the IPK and its replicas are stored in air (albeit under two or more nested bell jars), they gain mass through adsorption of atmospheric contamination onto their surfaces. Accordingly, they are cleaned in a process the BIPM developed between 1939 and 1946 known as [...] "the BIPM cleaning method" [...] that comprises firmly rubbing with a chamois soaked in equal parts ether and ethanol, followed by <b>steam</b> <b>cleaning</b> with bi-distilled water, and allowing the prototypes to settle for [...] days before verification. Before the BIPM's published report in 1994 detailing the relative change in mass of the prototypes, different standard bodies used different techniques to clean their prototypes. The NIST's practice before then was to soak and rinse its two prototypes first in benzene, then in ethanol, and to then clean them with a jet of bi-distilled water <b>steam.</b> <b>Cleaning</b> the prototypes removes between 5 and 60µg of contamination depending largely on the time elapsed since the last cleaning. Further, a second cleaning can remove up to 10µg more. After cleaning—even when they are stored under their bell jars—the IPK and its replicas immediately begin gaining mass again. The BIPM even developed a model of this gain and concluded that it averaged 1.11µg per month for the first 3 months after cleaning and then decreased to an average of about 1µg per year thereafter. Since check standards like K4 are not cleaned for routine calibrations of other mass standards—a precaution to minimize the potential for wear and handling damage—the BIPM's model of time-dependent mass gain has been used as an [...] "after cleaning" [...] correction factor.|$|E

500|$|The {{lighthouse}} was extinguished in 1877 {{when the}} offshore Southwest Ledge Light replaced it for navigation. The keeper, Elizur Thompson, went {{to be the}} Southwest Ledge Light's keeper for five years before returning {{to live in the}} Five Mile Point Light keeper's quarters and fly storm signal flags for the United States Weather Bureau. In 1896, the lighthouse was transferred to the United States Department of War and was improved by a leasee named Albert Widmann. In 1922, the property was split up, with the land given to the state of Connecticut and the buildings to the city of New Haven. Two years later, New Haven purchased the land from the state for $11,180. The tower was renovated in 1986. The $86,000 restoration included repairing cracked mortar, <b>steam</b> <b>cleaning</b> the interior and exterior and removing [...] "guano [...] accumulated over the decades".|$|E
500|$|The area {{underneath}} the London Eye where the Doctor and Rose confront the Nestene Consciousness was filmed in an unused paper mill in Grangetown, Cardiff. It underwent <b>steam</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{because there were}} such high health and safety concerns. They were only permitted to film for three days, which required {{that some of the}} sequence be cut: originally, there was to be another Auton Mickey involved. Special effects producer Mike Tucker was reminded of the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun when reading the scene in which the Nestene's lair is blown up, and sought to display it as a major effect. The production team built a one-sixth scale model of the warehouse where the explosions were filmed. Tucker did a model explosion for the destruction of Henrik's as well, although that was only for the roof; the rest was done by CGI. The production team considered doing the explosion practically, but that would have been too expensive. In the original script, Rose's first experience of seeing the TARDIS interior was shared with the audience. Director Keith Boak, however, wanted her to exit and run around the TARDIS before entering again, at which point the interior would be revealed to the audience. This change was eventually embraced by the executive producers. Davies remarked that he originally wanted to take Rose and the audience inside the TARDIS in all one shot, but this was not a feasible with the budget. This effect would later be accomplished in the 2012 Christmas special, [...] "The Snowmen".|$|E

40|$|The use of {{pulsed laser}} {{radiation}} {{in order to}} remove extraneous materials from a solid substrate, i. e. the Laser Cleaning/Ablation (LC/LA) technique, {{in recent years has}} found an increasing interest in several fields ranging from microelectronics to cultural heritage. Within latter field the most common application is the removal of undesired surface layers (e. g. fungi, bacteria, pollution crusts, corrosion layers, surface treatments, etc.) from artifacts of both inorganic (stones, metals, glasses, etc.) and organic (wood, paper, parchment, textiles, etc.) materials. In order to achieve good results the operating parameters (i. e. laser beam wavelength, fluence, pulse repetition rate, etc.) must be set to avoid damaging the substrate to be preserved and to efficiently remove undesired material. Therefore a correct application of the LC/LA technique requires a good knowledge of the effects of laser radiation interaction with both the substance to be removed and the substrate. A lot of experimental work has been carried out and several papers have been written describing several more or less general techniques and some specific applications. The aim of the present work is to summarize and present in an organic manner the LC/LA techniques applied to cultural heritage from both a theoretical and an application point of view.

After that we present some models for the description of main LC/LA techniques.

40|$|The {{application}} of strippable coatings is an innovative technology for decontamination of nuclear plants and for any decontamination project aiming at removing surface contamination.

The coating traps the contaminants in the polymer matrix. Strippable coatings are non-toxic and do not contain volatile compounds or heavy metals. Since the coating constitutes a solid waste, disposal is easier than treating contaminated liquid wastes, produced by the baseline technology: <b>steam</b> vacuum <b>cleaning,</b> based upon superheated pressurized water in order to remove contaminants from floors and walls.

Using a frequency doubled, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (FWHM= 8 ns) we removed polystyrene (PS) particles with diameters from 110 - 2000 nm from industrial silicon wafers by the DLC process.

Besides the determining the cleaning thresholds in laser fluence for a large interval of particle sizes we could show that particle removal in DLC is due to a combination of at least three effects: thermal substrate expansion, local substrate ablation due to field enhancement at the particle and explosive evaporation of adsorbed humidity from the air. Which effect dominates the process is subject to the boundary conditions. For our laser parameters no damage free DLC was possible, i. e. whenever a particle was removed by DLC we damaged the substrate by local field enhancement. In our SLC experiments we determined the amount of superheating of a liquid layer adjacent to surfaces with controlled roughness that is necessary for bubble nucleation. On smooth surfaces high superheatings were necessary, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Rough surfaces exhibited only a much smaller superheating...|$|R
