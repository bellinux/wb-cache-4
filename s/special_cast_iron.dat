The man for <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> longevity are its wide range of mechanical and physical properties coupled with its competitive price. Ductile iron or popularly known as spherodized graphite iron (SGiron) is a <b>special</b> variety of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> having carbon content more than 3 % and has graphite present in compact, spherical shapes. These compact spheroid hamper {{the continuity of the}} matrix much less than graphite flakes which results in higher strength and toughness with a structure that resembles gray <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> thus imparting superior mechanical properties i. e. much higher than all other <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> and which can be compared to steel. This unique property enables ductile iron to be used for numerous industrial applications. The excellent combination of mechanical properties obtained in S. G. iron can further be improved by the heat treatment. The most recent development in this regard is the production of Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI). It provides an excellent combination of high tensile strength, wear resistance along with good corrosion resistance and quite significant amount of ductility. Due to these factors, S. G. or ductile iron is austempered when a very favouurable combination of various properties is required. But this type of treatment is bit tricky, since it require controlled heating and isothermal holding of the material. So it is necessary to find some attractive methods for property development in S.

Normalizing, Austenitization, Quenching & Tempering, Austempering methods are applied to study the hardness, tensile strength, and impact strength of the material.

Alloying element addition greatly affects the mechanical properties of SG iron with Mn, Cu, Si and Ni being more predominant. While copper helps increasing the hardness causing no embrittlement in the matrix, Ni helps enhancing the ultimate tensile strength without affecting the impact energy values. Therefore addition of Cu and Ni plays key role in determining the end properties of SG iron after heat treatment. The high ratio of performance to cost which it offers to the designer and end user makes it to be used extensively for industrial uses. However, to enhance the consistency & range of properties of SG iron beyond its properties while in as-cast condition, Heat treatment is a required operation. Tempering & Austempering are two most widely used heat treatment operations in Ductile iron. For example a ferritic iron containing 70 - 80 % ferrite has a yield strength of 350 Mpa while a similar material which is given a step quenching treatment shows a yield strength of 550 - 1250 Mpa.

The penetration areas were analysed in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Analysis (EDS).

It intends to improve the current understanding of theformation of porosity in <b>cast</b> materials with <b>special</b> interestin nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and the spray forming process. Twodifferent systems, a Fe-based alloy, <b>Cast</b> <b>iron,</b> and a Ni-basedalloy, Inconel 625, are examined. The effect on the heatevolution of the morphology and the processing parameters inspray forming are treated. An evaluation of the microstructural features, segregationbehavior and physical properties such as latent heat of fusionis performed byusing thermal analysis under cooling ratesranging from 0. 1 to 104 K/s. In order to achieve this amodified differential thermal analysis (DTA) equipment, amirror furnace and levitation casting are used. Results arepresented in terms of the fraction of solidified, the coolingrate and the microstructure observed. The measured latent heatof fusion is not constant throughout the solidificationprocess. Variations in morphology and cooling rate affect therelease of the latent heat. A thermodynamic model is used to describe the experimentalobservations and to explain the formation of pores in nodularcast iron by taking into consideration the formation of latticedefects during the liquid/solid transformation. In this casethe formation of porosity is regarded as a consequence ofchanges in the volume fraction ratio graphite/ during thesolidification process. A numerical model of the spray forming process is developedby means of CFD modelling and compared with experimentalmeasurements performed in an industrial facility. Stagnationpressure measurements provided information about the gas flowvelocity and an analysis of the overspray powder providedinformation about the particle thermal history. Evaluation ofthe deposit was also performed. It is observed that the processconditions in spray forming promote non-equilibriumsolidification even though solidification at the deposit occursat a lower rate. In this case the porosity formed near theinterface substrate/deposit depends largely on the substratetemperature. The presence of certain reactive elements, such astitanium, affects the porosity levels in the rest of thedeposit.
