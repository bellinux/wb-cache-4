Modern ones comprise of three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the shunting movement is required (known as a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal).</b> When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction.

50|$|A <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> (従属信号機, jūzoku shingōki) is an {{alerting}} {{signal for}} a main signal. A <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> {{does not have}} its own protected section. When a train driver sees a stop signal and applies the brakes, the train may overrun the signal due to a long braking distance. A <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> gives advance notice, prompting the driver to decelerate to the speed allowed by the signal.|$|E

50|$|The station entry signal, {{which was}} set to Stop, is {{superseded}} by a Zs-1 <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal,</b> which permits continuing travel at 40 km/h. This <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal,</b> because it is in relationship to a station entry signal, is valid only until the next main signal is reached, {{in this case the}} station exit signal. Therefore, the train should have traveled through Brühl station at40 km/h.|$|E
50|$|A <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> permits {{movements}} onto {{a portion}} of track that is already occupied. These are commonly used at terminal stations to permit two or more trains to enter a single platform.|$|E
50|$|Shunting <b>signals</b> and <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signals</b> {{also exist}} in {{semaphore}} form, with smaller arms and lights than are provided for main signals. These signals may also {{take the form}} of a disc with a horizontal stripe which is rotated 45 degrees to the clear position.|$|R
5000|$|Jones was {{the first}} {{musician}} signed to OBR Records, a subsidiary of Def Jam, and thus the very first R&B artist ever to sign to, much more record, for a record label oriented towards rap and/or hip hop {{at a time when}} rap and R&B were two so completely separate entities that it was then considered practically an insult to associate any rap artists with any genre remotely resembling R&B, whose [...] "soothing" [...] sounds clashed with hip hop's rebellious edge. Jones's signing with Def Jam's OBR <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signaled</b> a partnership between the two genres that continued as of early December 2016.|$|R
50|$|The trip arm {{is raised}} {{whenever}} the signal is not displaying a proceed aspect. If a train tries {{to pass the}} signal, the trip cock on the train strikes the raised trip arm and the train is brought to a halt. When the signal indicates {{it is safe to}} proceed (clear or caution), the trip arm is lowered, and a train is able to proceed without further hindrance. In some cases, the trip arm will not be lowered when the signal to which it applies is exhibiting a proceed indication, e.g. when <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signals</b> are cleared, forcing a train to trip before proceeding, thus ensuring that movements are conducted at safe speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Many German railway main {{signals are}} {{equipped}} with an additional <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> called [...] "Zs 1" [...] (shown as three white dots in a triangle shape). This <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> replaces a written order authorising a train driver to pass the signal while it is showing a stop aspect. The train dispatcher can activate it from the signal box. There are no safety controls in the signal box, other than special operating rules, for the dispatcher to activate a Zs 1 signal. When a Zs 1 <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> is shown to the train driver, he must press and hold the PZB button [...] "Befehl" [...] ("Order") in the cab while moving the train over an active 2000-Hz emergency stop inductor located at the main signal. A warning tone sounds in the cab to acknowledge to the driver that he is pressing the Written Order button. After the complete train has passed the stop signal (at a speed not exceeding 40 km/h) and any following points, the driver may continue with normal speed, unless the main signal also has a distant signal at the same location. The Zs 1 <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> {{is supposed to be}} used only in circumstances when a route for a train cannot be set. There are sections in the rulebook on how and when it may be activated safely, but according to the local prosecutor, these rules were not adhered to.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} a series of five mistakes caused the collision: (1) A switch malfunctioned and the traffic controller at Starzyny used a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal,</b> sending the southbound train (IR 13126 Matejko) on a wrong track instead of making the change manually, (2) the traffic controller failed to observe the moving train and informed his colleague at Sprowa post that the train proceeded on the correct track, (3) the driver of that train obeyed the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> even though it conflicted with other signalling. Almost simultaneously, (4) the traffic controller at Sprowa noticed that the signal showed busy track yet she presumed that the safety system had malfunctioned and permitted northbound TLK 31100 Brzechwa to continue. Finally, (5) the driver of TLK 31100 Brzechwa also failed to obey conflicting signalling and continued. The official report was issued on 15 February 2013.|$|E

50|$|The Deutsche Bundesbahn mainly {{kept the}} H/V signalling, with colour-lights {{directly}} replacing sempahore signals; nevertheless, the signals did change their design over the years. One very early change was {{the inclusion of}} shunting signals (Sh, Schutzsignale) into the main signal's head. This affected mainly exit signals. These signals show two red lights to disallow any train or shunting movements and a red-white-white combination to allow shunting movements only. Later the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> aspects (Zs 1, Zs 7, Zs 8), which had their own head, were also merged into the main head. Therefore, several signals, whether main, (certain types of both) subsidiary or shunting, can be merged into a common rectangular head.|$|E
5000|$|Even with an {{absolute}} block system, multiple trains may enter a block with authorization. This may be necessary, e.g., {{in order to}} split or join trains together, or to rescue failed trains. In giving authorization, the signalman also ensures that the driver knows precisely what to expect ahead. The driver must operate the train in a safe manner taking this information into account. Generally, the signal remains at danger, and the driver is given verbal authority, usually by a yellow flag, to pass a signal at danger, {{and the presence of}} the train in front is explained. Where trains regularly enter occupied blocks, such as stations where coupling takes place, a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal,</b> sometimes known as a [...] "calling on" [...] signal, is provided for these movements, otherwise they are accomplished through train orders.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{suggests}} the wide variation in platelet response within {{the population is}} genetically controlled. Unraveling the complex relationship between sequence variation and platelet phenotype requires accurate and reproducible measurement of platelet response. OBJECTIVE: To develop a methodology suitable for measuring signaling pathway-specific platelet phenotype, to use this to measure platelet response in a large cohort, and to demonstrate the effect size of sequence variation in a relevant model gene. METHODS: Three established platelet assays were evaluated: mobilization of [Ca(2 +) ](i), aggregometry and flow cytometry, each {{in response to a}}denosine 5 '-diphosphate (ADP) or the glycoprotein (GP) VI-specific crosslinked collagen-related peptide (CRP). Flow cytometric measurement of fibrinogen binding and P-selectin expression in response to a single, intermediate dose of each agonist gave the best combination of reproducibility and inter-individual variability and was used to measure the platelet response in 506 healthy volunteers. Pathway specificity was ensured by blocking the main <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways. RESULTS: Individuals were identified who were hypo- or hyper-responders for both pathways, or who had differential responses to the two agonists, or between outcomes. 89 individuals, retested three months later using the same methodology, showed high concordance between the two visits in all four assays (r(2) = 0. 872, 0. 868, 0. 766 and 0. 549); all subjects retaining their phenotype at recall. The effect of sequence variation at the GP 6 locus accounted for approximately 35...|$|R

5000|$|However, D 203 {{accelerated}} {{shortly after}} passing the <b>subsidiary</b> <b>signal</b> {{and passed the}} next switches at 120 km/h - {{in accordance with the}} speed advised in the printed [...] "slow speed directive" [...] (Langsamfahrstelle) for this spot, which each driver gets for each trip and which is located in the driver's cab, and in accordance with the signal given by the slow speed construction signal {{at the edge of the}} track. The automatic speed control done at all signals, normally done by the PZB 90 system, was not performed due to the construction in the immediate area. Once the construction works and speed restriction were passed, the driver accelerated. The train reached a set of points at a speed over 120 km/h (where it should have been traveling at 40 km/h), and derailed. The lomotive left the track and plowed toward houses at the side of the track, smashing into one. Several carriages tipped over, and some were wedged under the station roof. Nine people were killed, with an additional 149 persons injured, in some cases severely.|$|E
