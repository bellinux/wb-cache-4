5000|$|The term [...] "leading/trailing" [...] {{means that}} only one shoe is [...] "leading", moving into the {{rotation}} of the drum and thus exhibiting a self-servo (or self-applying) effect.

50|$|During {{the washing}} stage, the wash liquid {{can either be}} poured onto the drum or sprayed on the cake. Cake {{pressing}} is optional but its advantages are preventing cake cracking and removing more moisture. Cake discharge is when all the solids are removed {{from the surface of}} the cake by a scraper blade, leaving a clean <b>surface</b> as <b>drum</b> re-enters the slurry 6.

Pre coat filtration is an ideal method to produce a high clarity of filtrate. Basically, the <b>drum</b> <b>surface</b> is pre coated with a filter aid such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or perlite to improve filtration and increase cake permeability.

50|$|The {{brake drum}} is {{generally}} {{made of a}} special type of cast iron that is heat-conductive and wear-resistant. It rotates with the wheel and axle.

This friction generates substantial heat.|$|R

[...] Examples {{of this type of}} sound generator include the soundboard of a piano, the <b>surfaces</b> of <b>drums</b> and cymbals, the diaphragm of loudspeakers, etc. The forward movement of something through the atmosphere causes an immediate increase in air pressure (compression) or condensation in the air adjacent to the piston. A complete cycle, or one complete soundwave, consists of an increase of pressure in the air, a subsequent decrease of pressure so that the pressure is back to normal, and a following decrease in air pressure called rarefaction. One complete cycle is produced when a drum is hit once with force.|$|R

The 9975 design is based on detailed finite element (FE) analyses and extensive proof testing to meet the design requirements given in 10 CFR 71 [1]. However, the FE analyses use Celotex thermal properties that are based on published data and limited experiments. Celotex is an orthotropic material that is used in the home building industry. Its thermal properties are prone to variation due to manufacturing and fabrication processes, and due to long environmental exposure. This paper will evaluate the sensitivity of variations in thermal conductivity of the Celotex, convection coefficient at the <b>drum</b> <b>surface,</b> and <b>drum</b> emissivity (herein called Factors) on the thermal response of 9975 packaging under Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT). Application of this methodology will ascertain the robustness of the 9975 design and it can lead to more specific and useful understanding of the effects of various Factors on 9975 performance...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{separation}} of the cracked palm nut mixture is an important process in the downstream utilisation of the constituent palm kernel and shell in some existing and emerging agro-economy. Whilst, the conventional wet separators are sophisticated and energy inefficient, the dry systems are at experimental stages and are inadequate for separating kernel and shell of comparable sizes. However, {{the difference in the}} path variables of particles of same size, but different shapes, in circular motion, suggests the possibility of separating the dry mixture in a rotating trammel with a co-axial spout. Based on the theory, the study investigated the dispatch angles for palm kernel and shell from a friction lining on the inner curved <b>surface</b> of <b>drums</b> of different diameters and rotating speeds. A built experimental facility allowed estimation of the dispatch angle for particles placed on the lining. The results show that palm kernels oscillate and move axially with the dispatch angle increasing with the drum diameter, but consistently less than 90 o for the different diameters and speeds of the drum. The shells are dislodged at higher dispatch angles and in curvilinear trajectories away from the <b>drum</b> <b>surface,</b> causing a {{separation of}} the mixture. It is concluded that the experimental data are in good agreement with the theory and that the theory is sufficiently adequate for the determination of the design parameters of a proprietary separator...|$|R

40|$|Two devices a {{magnetic}} separator {{and a special}} filter denoted a self-regenerating separator (SRS) {{have been developed for}} separating sludge from the stream of wastewater from a bioreactor. These devices were originally intended for use in microgravity, but have also been demonstrated to function in normal Earth gravity. The magnetic separator (see Figure 1) includes a thin-walled nonmagnetic, stainless-steel cylindrical drum that rotates within a cylindrical housing. The wastewater enters the separator through a recirculation inlet, and about 80 percent of the wastewater flow leaves through a recirculation outlet. Inside the drum, a magnet holder positions strong permanent magnets stationary and, except near a recirculation outlet, close to the inner <b>drum</b> <b>surface.</b> To enable magnetic separation, magnetite (a ferromagnetic and magnetically soft iron oxide) powder is mixed into the bioreactor wastewater.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside a}} laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair. The drum {{in particular is}} a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light {{for more than a}} few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out. Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks. If the neutral wiper blade fails to remove residual toner from the <b>drum's</b> <b>surface,</b> that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution. If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the <b>surface</b> of the <b>drum,</b> allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.|$|R
