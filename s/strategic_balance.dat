5|$|Kourkouas {{belonged to}} a family of Armenian descent that {{produced}} several notable Byzantine generals. As commander of an imperial bodyguard regiment, Kourkouas was among the chief supporters of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (reigned 920–944) and facilitated the latter's rise to the throne. In 923, Kourkouas was appointed commander-in-chief of the Byzantine armies along the eastern frontier, facing the Abbasid Caliphate and the semi-autonomous Muslim border emirates. He kept this post {{for more than twenty}} years, overseeing decisive Byzantine military successes that altered the <b>strategic</b> <b>balance</b> in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{moved quickly}} to take {{advantage}} of their victory: a Byzantine army invaded Arab-held Armenia, and sometime in October or November, defeated and killed the emir Ali ibn Yahya. Thus, within a single campaigning season, the Byzantines had eliminated the three most dangerous opponents on their eastern border. In retrospect, these successes proved decisive, as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene. The Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the <b>strategic</b> <b>balance</b> in the region, and heralded the beginning of Byzantium's century-long offensive in the East.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, criticisms, {{that many of the}} {{management}} accounting techniques of the last decade lack integrated theories that provide a deeper explanation of the technical phenomena constructed, have been levelled by management accounting researchers. The implications of the conclusions drawn by Ittner and Larcker (2001) and Zimmerman (2001), that research relating to practitioner-oriented techniques has neglected the broader theoretical context, is challenged by reference to existing theoretical concepts that provide this underpinning and through this a more complete understanding of the technique. One recent technique developed has been Kaplan and Norton’s <b>strategic</b> <b>balanced</b> scorecard, to which this paper relates the theoretical concepts of cybernetics, specifically the work of Maruyama. Three fundamental characteristics of cybernetics theory are identified; causal relationships, communication and change. These are compared to the practical formulation of the <b>strategic</b> <b>balanced</b> scorecard. It is argued that these characteristics are common in the theory and in the practice and fit the contemporary description of theory as they explain and predict the reality of the <b>strategic</b> <b>balanced</b> scorecard, create meaning, are well constructed, and link the subjective and objective realms of experience...|$|R

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1980s, even as the FCC was {{publishing}} studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although {{the reasons for the}} eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing <b>strategic</b> <b>balance</b> {{with the end of the}} Cold War {{in the late}} 1980s likely had a major part to play. Another factor was the success of the US-KS early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{explained}} that SALT II {{would reduce the}} Soviet Union's strategic forces, bring enhanced predictability and stability to Soviet-U.S. nuclear relationships, {{reduce the cost of}} maintaining a <b>strategic</b> <b>balance,</b> help the United States to monitor Soviet forces, and reduce the risk of nuclear war. He rebutted charges by SALT II critics that the United States had underestimated the Soviet military buildup, that the treaty would weaken the Western alliance, that the Soviet Union could not be trusted to obey the treaty, and that its terms could not really be verified. Partly to placate Senate opponents of the treaty, the Carter administration agreed in the fall of 1979 to support higher increases in the defense budget. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 ensured that the Senate would not accept the treaty at that time, forcing the president to withdraw it from consideration. When his term ended in 1981, Brown said that failure to secure ratification of SALT II was his greatest regret.|$|E

The number of factions in the game, each with their own historically accurate units and territories, was commended, with IGN and Game Informer stating it [...] "gives the game huge replay value", with GameSpot adding [...] "the strategic portion now {{has a lot more}} options". Many reviewers gave praise to the fact the historical setting of the Middle Ages was said to be well integrated into the game; PC Zone acknowledging the [...] "brutality and instability" [...] of the era is well included in the game, with GameSpot praising the religion in the game, [...] "religion played an enormous role in shaping history, and so it is in the game". GameSpy stated that the different historical starting positions made the games attention to detail [...] "impressive and noteworthy"; the historical battle system was also highly received from Computer Gaming World, stating that they successfully [...] "provide an authentic glimpse of the past". However, GameSpot commented on a problem with a lack of information, [...] "you'll have a tough time keeping track of all the goings-on in your provinces", suggesting this could be solved through a more informative interface.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of nuclear factor in international politics has overwhelming transformed {{the essence of}} balance-of-power concept. This dynamic is an escalation of political dimension of balance-of-power and reduction of military aspect (hard power). However some realists argue that in world politics military and political both characteristics of balance-of-power indeed shape nation-states’ balancing approach against dominant players in a system. Therefore weak players get engaged with strong one stopping its opponent’s military threat and having deterrence capability. As a result, <b>strategic</b> <b>balancing</b> comes to light.   As {{the focus of the}} study is concerned, this entire scenario can be seen amid two major players of South Asia i. e. Pakistan and India. It has been analyzed that the balance-of-power politics has long been troubling due to hard power imbalance between Pakistan and India since independence. Besides the influential role of superpower(s) in the theatre of South Asian politics has also been a great disturbing factor for regional equilibrium and widening hard power unevenness where the U. S. or (USSR in past) is/were trying to maintain global balance in Asian-oriented global politics by making dyadic strategic partnerships with regional players. As the strategic triangle - Pakistan-China-India - seems quite significant wherein Pak-China strategic relationship has emerged owing to one of the very basic and common Indian factor and China being the most adjacent player of South Asian region has played a role by creating a balancing aptitude in its relations with both India and Pakistan whereas the U. S. (as a sole superpower) could not do this. While changing dynamics in India and U. S. partnership regarding <b>strategic</b> <b>balancing</b> after civil nuclear deal, Pakistan and China both have also strengthened their 60 -years old strategic relationship. As a result, the strategic quadrangle - the U. S. -India-China-Pakistan is getting eminent as a new dynamic of the South Asian balance-of-power politics. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} conceptualise and operationalise {{the concept of}} soft balancing in international relations by articulating a “theory of tripartite strategic balancing” which is applicable to both international and regional unipolar systems. It has a twofold purpose: one theoretical and the other empirical. First, it seeks to develop a theory of tripartite <b>strategic</b> <b>balancing</b> which encompasses three forms of strategic balancing: internal, external, and soft balancing. The second part seeks to test the theory’s utility in explaining international political outcomes in the post-Cold War international system. In particular, it seeks to ascertain whether and how “second-tier great powers” have strategically balanced against the United States on a global level {{since the end of}} the Cold War. The analyses will focus largely on the foreign policies of Russia and France – the chief soft balancers. However, this dissertation also seeks to extend the concept of soft balancing into the regional level of analysis by examining whether and how minor-regional powers soft balance against regional unipolar leaders. For instance, it will examine whether and how the Russian Federation has been soft balanced against by states in the “European Near Abroad. ” The analyses will focus primarily on the foreign policies of Poland – the chief soft balancer in the region. The dissertation will employ three in-depth case studies – the Kosovo Crisis (1999), the Iraqi wars (1991 - 2003), and the Georgia Crisis (2008) – to verify whether or not tripartite <b>strategic</b> <b>balancing</b> is actually occurring as the theory predicts. It will heavily rely on sources and interviews conducted during my time working at the United Nations Security Council and the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These findings seek to contribute a more nuanced strand of thinking to the realist paradigm in international relations, and they offer practical implications for both US and Russian foreign policymaking.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this qualitative study was to gain preliminary knowledge {{of the nature of}} youth workers’ dilemmas involving families and the underlying issues they entail. This study used grounded theory methods of analysis to explore the dilemmas youth workers face regarding families of participants in twelve high quality youth programs serving high school aged youth. The two questions explored were: What categories of dilemmas do youth workers face regarding families? What considerations do youth workers have when faced with such dilemmas? Four dilemma categories with distinct considerations were identified that specifically focused on the parents of participants. The dilemmas youth workers faced included being concerned about a participant with family problems, having the parent of a participant make demands on the program, having a parent not support their child’s participation, and needing to share information with parents. This study suggests that effective youth workers engage in a reflective process as well as a <b>strategic</b> <b>balancing</b> of interests to best serve youth when such dilemmas arose...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine whether the implementation of the High level (<b>Strategic)</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard at Mangosuthu Technikon could provide solutions to the following problems: Translating Vision and Strategy to operational tenus: The organisation's strategy must be executed {{at all levels of the}} organisation. The key to this transformation is putting strategy at the centre of the management process. Aligning the organisation around the strategy: For maximum effectiveness, the strategies and the scorecards of all business units should be aligned and linked with one another. Making strategy a continuous process: This is how the organisation get all its employees to make strategy part of their daily job. Strategy Evaluation and Selection: The organisation's strategy must fit within one of the following criteria: Consistency, Consonance, Advantage, and Feasibility. The Balanced Scorecard building process is designed to deliver the following: • Establishment/ Confirmation of the Vision • Establishment/Confirmation of the organization's strategy • Measurement perspective selection • Strategy development for each perspective • Identification of factors which are critical to the success of the strategy in each perspective • Definition of the measures which drive the critical success factors The Balanced Scorecard theory is such that by achieving each of the process outputs, clarity and focus for the organization's future is determined as well as how to achieve that future objective. This clarity and focus provides the basis to resolve the problems identified. A high level (<b>Strategic)</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard can be built in a relatively short period of time. However, adherence to the methodology is crucial for the resulting scorecard to be meaningful and, therefore, useful. Senior management, and especially the CEO, have to be fully committed to both the project and methodology compliance. Deviations reduce the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the initiative and can completely undermine the resulting scorecard. Kaplan & Norton first suggested the Balanced Scorecard in 1992. It is still being implemented in organizations today, to provide a solution to a variety of organizational issues. This continued usage and support is a confirmation of the quality, durability and adaptability of the tool, as well as its ability to deliver...|$|R
