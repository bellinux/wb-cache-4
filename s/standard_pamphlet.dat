40|$|The {{present study}} tested the {{prediction}} that counterfactual thinking (thoughts of if only 2 ̆ 6) provides a vivid means {{for women to}} imagine whatcould have been done differently in hypothetical breast cancer scenarios for the protagonist to avoid their predicament. This should then encourage themto adopt a more preventative approach to and take greater personal responsibility toward their own breast health. Women aged 50 and older (N= 181) read either a <b>standard</b> <b>pamphlet</b> on mammography rescreening or one containing counterfactually framed scenarios. The latter depicted fictitiouswomen whose failure to have routine mammograms contributed to their diagnosis with advance-stage breast cancer. The counterfactual group subsequently indicated greater feelings of personal responsibilityfor having mammograms at the recommended interval than the standard group, even when perceived effectiveness of early detection andtreatment were statistically controlled for. Our data suggest that messages utilising counterfactual thinking {{may be useful in}} augmenting themammography rescreening rate in Australia...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{developed}} and tested a culturally appropriate, church-based intervention to improve diabetes self-management. Research Design and Methods This was a randomized trial conducted at 24 African American churches in central North Carolina. Churches were randomized {{to receive the}} special intervention (SI; 13 churches, 117 participants) or the minimal intervention (MI; 11 churches, 84 participants). The SI included an 8 -month intensive phase, consisting of 1 individual counseling visit, 12 group sessions, monthly phone contacts, and 3 encouragement postcards, followed by a 4 -month reinforcement phase including monthly phone contacts. The MI received <b>standard</b> educational <b>pamphlets</b> by mail. Outcomes were assessed at 8 and 12 months; the primary outcome was comparison of 8 -month A 1 C levels. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean age was 59 years, A 1 C 7. 8 %, and body mass index 35. 0 kg/m(2); 64 % of participants were female. For the 174 (87 %) participants returning for 8 -month measures, mean A 1 C (adjusted for baseline and group randomization) was 7. 4 % for SI and 7. 8 % for MI, with a difference of 0. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 1 - 0. 6, P =. 009). In a larger model adjusting for additional variables, the difference was 0. 5 % (95 % CI, 0. 2 - 0. 7, P <. 001). At 12 months, the difference between groups was not significant. Diabetes knowledge and diabetes-related quality of life significantly improved in the SI group compared with the MI group. Among SI participants completing an acceptability questionnaire, intervention components and materials were rated as highly acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The church-based intervention was well received by participants and improved short-term metabolic control...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Barbershop-based {{hypertension}} (HTN) {{outreach programs}} for {{black men are}} becoming increasingly common, but whether they are an effective approach for improving HTN control remains uncertain. METHODS: To evaluate whether a continuous high blood pressure (BP) monitoring and referral program conducted by barbers motivates male patrons with elevated BP to pursue physician follow-up, leading to improved HTN control, a cluster randomized trial (BARBER- 1) of HTN control was conducted among black male patrons of 17 black-owned barbershops in Dallas County, Texas (March 2006 -December 2008). Participants underwent 10 -week baseline BP screening, and then study sites were randomized to a comparison group that received <b>standard</b> BP <b>pamphlets</b> (8 shops, 77 hypertensive patrons per shop) or an intervention group in which barbers continually offered BP checks with haircuts and promoted physician follow-up with sex-specific peer-based health messaging (9 shops, 75 hypertensive patrons per shop). After 10 months, follow-up data were obtained. The primary outcome measure was change in HTN control rate for each barbershop. RESULTS: The HTN control rate increased more in intervention barbershops than in comparison barbershops (absolute group difference, 8. 8 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 8 %- 16. 9 %]) (P =. 04); the intervention effect persisted after adjustment for covariates (P =. 03). A marginal intervention effect was found for systolic BP change (absolute group difference, - 2. 5 mm Hg [95 % CI, - 5. 3 to 0. 3 mm Hg]) (P =. 08). CONCLUSIONS: The effect of BP screening on HTN control among black male barbershop patrons was improved when barbers were enabled to become health educators, monitor BP, and promote physician follow-up. Further research is warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00325533...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A {{controlled}} {{trial to}} compare the effectiveness of verbal advice from a family physician (FP) combined with either standard or tailored written information on physical activity in increasing the levels of physical activity in sedentary patients. Design: Sedentary patients (n = 763) were recruited through ten family practices and allocated to a control group or one of two intervention groups, Brief advice on physical activity was given by the FP during the consultation and either a <b>standard</b> or tailored <b>pamphlet</b> was mailed to the home address of patients assigned to the intervention groups within two days of their visit to the FP. Results: The response to follow-up, via a postal survey at one, six, and twelve months after the index consultation was 70 %, 60 %, and 57 %, respectively. Treating all nonresponders as sedentary, the results revealed that although more tailored subjects reported some physical activity at each follow-up compared with the standard group, these differences were not significant, Furthermore, {{there was no significant}} difference in movement across the stages of readiness to exercise at follow-up between subjects in the tailored group who received material targeting their current stage (precontemplation or contemplation) and the standard group who received generic material that addressed both stages. Conclusion: These findings do not concur with the results from previous research in the areas of nutrition and smoking cessation where additional benefits were seen with a tailored intervention. Future research on the application of the principles of tailoring to the promotion of physical activity should focus on identifying which, if any, physical, social, psychological or environmental variables should be addressed to produce improved outcomes over and above the effects of well designed generic materials.

40|$|Universities are {{relied on}} for education, {{training}} and manpower development and research for socio-economic development of any nation. For Universities {{to meet up}} with the onerous responsibility, they need to provide strong literature support to the teaching, learning, research and community development activities. The unit of the university responsible for the provision, management and dissemination of information to support the effective and expeditious attainment of the objectives of the university is its library. It is pertinent to state that the increase in the volume of literature in the library collection has been occurring at an exponential rate in this information age century. Nevertheless, many University Libraries globally are beset with dearth of information resources especially in the professions and local content. This {{is due to the fact}} that in the field of librarianship and information science generally, there has been an out cry for literatures in quest of people utilitarian. While relief has come to some of the libraries through computerization and internet connectivity, there is still the pressing need to more effectively manage Grey Literature for higher education and research as they are often not accessible on the web. Grey literature(GL) is from a broader term ephemera which is defined as a collective name given to material which carries a verbal or illustrative processes, but not in the <b>standard</b> book, <b>pamphlet</b> or periodical format (Makepeace, 1985). Examples of ephamera are calendars, clippings, company reports, guides, information leaflets, menus, newsletters, newspapers, press release, and society ephemera. The acceptance of the collective term GL dates to the York Seminar of 1978 (Gibb G. M and Philip E. 1989), which was a milestone in its development. It was clearly recognized that GL was in fact, a primary information source, the seminar resulted in the creation of the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) database, which was initially supported by the European Economic Community (EEC) and is now managed by the European Association for Grey Literature. There are divergence of opinion regarding to the definition of GL. Moahi (1995) defined Grey Literature as 2 ̆ 2 material that is not commercially published and therefore not to be found in the normal channels associated with commercially published literature 2 ̆ 2. Grey Literature includes research reports, reports of meetings, conferences, seminars and workshops, students 2 ̆ 7 projects, theses and dissertations, in-house publications of associations and organizations and all forms of government publications including legislative materials, budgets and development plans. Augur (1989), citing Debachere defined Grey Literature as a term used variably by the intelligence community, librarians, and medical and research professionals to refer to a body of materials that cannot be found easily through conventional channels such as publishers, but which is frequently original and usually recent. Library of Congress subject Headings (LCSH) defined GL as 2 ̆ 2 reports, thesis, conference papers, translations of limited circulation and government documents. Wood (1984) cited in Kwafo-Akolo(1995) described GL as 2 ̆ 2 the material which is not available through the normal book selling. Sala(1995) describes GL as the documents that are not available through the conventional commercial distribution channels and therefore difficult to identify and obtain. The Russian National Public Library for science and technology views GL as a publications of limited circulation(under 1500 copies) issued by minor publishing houses that is hardly accessible. In summary GL can be referred to as unpopular but precious semi published information materials with very limited circulation which are not usually accessible through the normal commercial book channels such as publishers catalogue and book shops. Grey materials have a tremendous benefit not only to the users and authoritarian organizations, but also to the society at large. Auger,C. P (1994) noted that GL offer a number of advantages over other means of dissemination, including greater speed, greater flexibility and the opportunity to go into considerable detail if necessary. white papers (which is a type of GL) often contain useful findings based on surveys, interviews, and other forms of original research, and business white paper can be a valuable source of information to librarians and business practitioners (Juricek,John Eric 2009). GL also provides current information and facts on various topics. (Aina, 2004) Stated that 2 ̆ 2 Conventionally, grey literature in terms of its usage and function can be classified as reference sources that are considered occasionally for the provision of information and facts on a variety of topics, at users request. They provide background information on any topic, as well as current information. However because of the importance of these reference materials they are usually separated from the regular non-fiction books 2 ̆ 2. Evans(1995) is of the opinion that as the result and aspiration from library users who are anxious to make sense of the present, worried about future and hungry about information of the past, the only way to satisfy the hunger is to provide these patrons with information so that they can plan for the future,come to grip with the past and make positive changes here in the present, and this can only be achieved by adequately providing GL in the library. Another important reason for storage, preservation and dissemination of GL is the fact that users cannot rely solely on commercial avenues for vital information as most of the available information through books selling and distribution channels have been distorted and even some of these materials are quite expensive for average user to acquire. In a research conducted by Aina(1992) cited by kwafo-Akoto(1995) the result of the analysis of development of literature produced in Botswana over a 3 -year period showed that GL constituted 98...|$|R
