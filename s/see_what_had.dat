5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
25|$|The final {{confirmed}} murder {{occurred on}} May 7 in Raytown, Missouri. The victim was 37-year-old Sarah Blessing {{who was working}} in her gift shop, Store of Many Colors. The murder occurred during the day, {{and the owner of}} the video store next to the Kitzmiller's shop saw the killer enter the shop, heard a pop, and then saw him leave. He discovered Blessing's body after checking to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> occurred in the store. A clerk at a nearby grocery store also saw the suspect. He was climbing a hill towards I-70.|$|E

500|$|After {{stopping}} {{the beating of}} Czolgosz, McKinley's next concern was for his wife, urging Cortelyou to take care how she was told of the shooting. [...] The initial crowd reaction had been panic, and an attempt to flee the hall, which was frustrated by others surging inwards to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> occurred. [...] As McKinley was carried out on a stretcher to an electric-powered ambulance, there was a moan from {{the crowd at the}} sight of the President's ashen face. [...] Foster rode with him on the way to the fair's hospital. [...] On the way there, McKinley felt in his clothing and came out with a metal object. [...] "I believe that is a bullet." [...] McKinley had been shot twice; one bullet had deflected off a button and only grazed him; the other had penetrated his abdomen.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E

2500|$|On May 5, 1945, Reverend Archie Mitchell {{took his}} {{pregnant}} wife and five Sunday school children, from the Christian and Missionary Alliance church where he was minister, on a picnic and fishing trip. [...] The group found the logging road they followed blocked, so they stopped next to Leonard Creek, eight miles (13km) east of Bly near Gearhart Mountain. While Mitchell was unloading the food, he heard {{one of the children}} say, [...] "Look what I found!" [...] His wife and the children ran to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been found. [...] Moments later, there was an explosion. [...] Mrs. Mitchell and all five children were killed instantly.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant Carter, who {{was moving}} up and down the flanks of the column, told the inquest that he saw the bus coming and told the boys to move into the kerb as far as they could, {{assuming}} the bus would move around them. Samson told the inquest that he did not see the cadets at all and was only aware he had driven into something when the bus started to wobble as though it [...] "had run over a lot of loose stones or something", although it was also reported that he felt bumps and heard the high-pitched screams of the cadets. At that point he braked immediately. His conductress, Dorothy Dunster, called out [...] "What's happened?", and Samson got out to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened. Carter, who was knocked over and dazed but not injured, said the bus continued about fifty yards before braking and another witness said he thought about twenty-five yards.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{backers of}} races {{on the road}} were newspapers. Although Le Vélocipède Illustré, which was behind the world's first long-distance road race in November 1869, said its purpose was [...] "to further the good cause of the bicycle" [...] because [...] "it must be {{determined}} that the bicycle can be raced over considerable distances with incomparably less fatigue than running", it can't have escaped the circulation department that the race would do the newspaper's sales {{a lot of good}} as well. In an era before radio and television, newspapers could build the drama of a race for weeks, rely on customers buying a further copy on the day to prepare for the riders to pass and then another next day to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become of them. Few people had travelled 130km, at least not often, and the idea of doing it by bicycle and at as high a speed as possible when the roads were potholed and bicycles had wooden wheels and metal tyres was exciting. The result was that newspapers outdid each other in promotions. In 1891, came a race from Bordeaux to Paris. In the same year, Le Petit Journal went twice as far by running Paris–Brest–Paris over 1,200km.|$|E

2500|$|Robinson {{said that}} the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a {{reaction}} to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which w{{as a reaction to}} Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E
