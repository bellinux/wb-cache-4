40|$|The {{optimisation}} of <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> {{plays an}} important role in the management of urban traffic, and in the full usage of existing and planned road networks. In recent years, considerable advances have been made in techniques for the optimisation of <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> at isolated junctions operating under fixed-time control. This paper shows how these techniques can be applied in the optimisation of <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> in coordinated networks by using a decomposition approach. The <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> at a junction in a network can be specified fully by the sequence of stages, interstage structures, cycle time, stage durations and offset. Of these variables, the third, fourth and last are endogenous to network optimisation methods, the first and second being exogenous. Techniques have been developed recently to optimise all but the last variable (which is not there defined) at individual junctions, and these have been found to give considerable improvements in operational performance. The computational requirements of these methods is such that their direct extension to networks is not yet a practical proposition. This paper shows how the differences inherent between individual junction and network optimisation methods can be reconciled within a decomposition approach so that the latter can benefit from some of the advantages of the former. A simple example is used to illustrate the substantial benefits that can arise from this approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that {{the performance of a}} complete network can be represented graphically using only aggregated data for flow and density. The resulting graph is the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), which relates the average flow (performance) to the number of vehicles in the network (accumulation). The resulting shape is often concave, meaning that the performance can be maximised if a fixed number of vehicles is maintained in the network (optimal accumulation). One of the most promising methods to achieve this, is by adapting <b>signal</b> <b>timings.</b> The objective of this thesis is to investigate if (1) a relationship between the shape of the MFD and the structure of the underlying network exists and on which factors this depends and (2) if the shape of the MFD of a subnetwork (neighbourhood) and its perimeter (ring of higher level roads (with signalised intersections) around a subnetwork) are affected by different <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> and how this does affect the applicability of the MFD for control strategies. To assess the effect of the structure on the network, a tool has been developed to automatically generate fictitious networks with different structures, in which the amount of infrastructure and <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> are matched dynamically to a randomly generated OD-matrix. The resulting networks are used as a base for the simulations, which are done in the microscopic traffic simulator VISSIM. Using various <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> for <b>signals</b> located on the perimeter, the flow from the subnetwork to the perimeter is restricted and vice-versa, in order to assess how the MFD of both react to these changes. Regarding the relation between the shape of the MFD and the network structure, it is concluded that the structure of a network in itself does not have a strong influence on the shape of the MFD. Differences between MFDs are not caused by topological differences, but by the different characteristics of the roads (length, speed, capacity) and the amount and type of intersections in the underlying network. The different factors influencing the shape of the MFD could not be quantified – in order to construct MFDs based only on knowledge of the network and without the use of simulations - as the shape of the MFD is found to differ strongly, even for similar networks. As such it is concluded that the stochastic and dynamic nature of traffic has a strong influence on the shape of the MFD. Especially the accumulation is highly sensitive to differences in the distribution of traffic over the network, making the optimal accumulation particularly hard to predict. Regarding the effect of signal settings on the shape of the MFD of a subnetwork and its perimeter and its applicability for control strategies, it is concluded that a strong relation between the MFD of the subnetwork and its perimeter does exist, in which both react in the same way to changes in traffic demand and <b>signal</b> <b>timings.</b> The ratio between the performance of the subnetwork and perimeter is highly consistent and not strongly affected by changes in the signal settings, implying that <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> exist, which optimise the performance of both the subnetwork and its perimeter. The optimal accumulation of the perimeter is found to be highly sensitive to changes in the <b>signal</b> <b>timings.</b> As a consequence it is concluded that the MFD is difficult to use for control strategies aiming to adapt <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> to maintain the optimal accumulation {{in a part of the}} network, because these changed <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> result in a different optimal accumulation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the group-based optimisation of <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> for area traffic control. Using group-based control variables, the optimisation of <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> is formulated {{as a set}} of non-linear mathematical programs. A conventional performance index, which is a weighted combination of estimated delays and stops, is evaluated by the traffic model from the well-known stage-based procedure TRANSYT and is used as the optimand, but it is considered here as a function of group-based control variables, the common cycle time, the start time and duration of the period of right of way for each signal group. These programs are then solved by an integer programming method. The cases of specified and unspecified cycle time are both discussed. Together with a previous hill-climbing technique some optimisation heuristics for the optimisation of <b>signal</b> <b>timings</b> using group-based notation are developed. These heuristics consist of a mixture of network-wide steps, in which control variables for signal settings at all junctions are changed simultaneously, and junction-based steps, in which the variables at each junction are changed in turn as happens in TRANSYT. A trial network from Leicestershire, England is used in examples to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the optimisation heuristics. ...|$|R
