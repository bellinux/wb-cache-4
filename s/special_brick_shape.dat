50|$|Romanesque brick {{architecture}} remained {{closely connected}} with contemporary stone architecture and simply translated the latter's style and repertoire {{into the new}} material. In contrast, Brick Gothic developed its own typical style, characterised by the reduction in available materials: the buildings were often bulky and of monumental size, but rather simple as regards their external appearance, lacking the delicacy of areas further south. Nonetheless, they were strongly influenced by the cathedrals of France and by the gothique tournaisien or Schelde Gothic of the County of Flanders. Later, techniques {{that led to a}} more elaborate structuring of the churches became prevalent: recessed wall areas were often painted with lime plaster, creating a marked contrast to the darker brick-built areas. Furthermore, <b>special</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>bricks</b> were produced to facilitate the imitation of architectural sculpture.|$|R
