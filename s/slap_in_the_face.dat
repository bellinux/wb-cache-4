5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E
25|$|The term bitch slap {{is derived}} from American slang.

However, the term is now frequently used figuratively to describe a humiliating defeat or punishment.|$|E

500|$|Ald. Robert Shaw (9th) {{called the}} suit [...] "a <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{to the black}} community".

Rush specifically called the suit [...] "frivolous" [...] and [...] "impetuous", openly questioning whether the ACLU had filed the suit to enhance fundraising activities or for other political reasons.|$|E

500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of respect}} shown to one of England's leading artists led to some outcry, and attacks in the press upon the then very unpopular Albert; William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in 1845: [...] "Think of the greatest patronage in the world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundred—condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse, and paying for them below their value! Think of august powers and principalities ordering the works of such a great artist as Etty to be hacked out of the palace-wall!

500|$|Georgia Tech {{students}} hold a heated, {{long and}} ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.

Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it [...] "symbolized cowardice". After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color. Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial <b>slap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891. Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us".

[...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart.

The IRA statement continued:The British Government has spent the last 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle.

50|$|One {{school of}} fight {{choreographer}} thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, {{such as in}} a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really <b>slapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem {{to be out of}} control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted suspension of disbelief.|$|R
