Roxul Inc. Final Report [...] October 7, 1997 Page i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fire stops can introduce a physical connection between the two sides of a double-stud wall, hence providing structural flanking paths for transmission of vibration which worsens the sound insulation. This study primarily addressed the specific case of a load-bearing party wall with double wood <b>studs,</b> <b>supporting</b> a floor with wood joists perpendicular to the party wall and a floor deck or sub-floor of 15. 9 mm OSB. Even without structural transmission of vibration through a fire stop, the sound insulation in a real building is normally affected by flanking transmission. Addition of a fire stop provides yet another path for vibration transmission between the rooms, and hence tends to worsen the sound insulation further. This study examines how a fire stop at the floor/wall junction can degrade the apparent sound insulation of the party wall (the nominal separation) by increasing structural transmission of vibration around that wall via the connected floor system (the flanking path). Group 0 Constructions have no physical fire stop. Adding batt insulation to fill the wall's inter-stud cavities leaving a gap of 25 mm or less (Case 2) improves sound insulation provided by the party wall itself while adding negligible structural transmission. Strictly speaking, this is not a fire stop, but it does provide the necessary fire resistance (as shown in the companion study of fire spread) and meets the presc [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Tire studs, with pins {{typically}} {{made out}} of cemented carbide with cobalt (WC-Co), are used in several countries to improve the gripping power during winter. Throughout their use, the tire studs are worn. This leads to emissions of particles, of which some are nano-sized. Until now, WC-Co nanoparticles have seldom been included in environmental risk assessments of nanomaterials. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the magnitude of emissions of WC-Co (nano) particles from tire studs on a national level, compare WC-Co emissions to those of other nanomaterials, and conduct a screening risk assessment of the WC-Co emissions. The country in focus was Sweden, where 66 % of the passenger cars use studded tires during winter. Substance flow analysis (SFA) was used to quantify the mass flows related to tire studs from the raw material extraction phase to the waste management phase. Furthermore, particle flow analysis (PFA) was used to quantify particle number flows in the use phase, where emissions of W-containing nanoparticles have been observed. As part of these quantifications, use phase emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles were calculated using a leaching-type model based on the number of km driven by the Swedish car fleet and experimental measurements of W-emission rates. Two scenarios – a low-emission and a high-emission scenario – were employed. Preliminary results show annual WC-Co emissions of 10 - 10 ^ 3 kg/year and 10 ^ 15 - 10 ^ 20 particles/year. These estimated emissions were then compared to estimated emissions of some other nanomaterials in Sweden, including silver, titanium dioxide, cerium oxide, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This comparison indicated that the emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles from tire studs are in the same range as estimated emissions of some of these other nanomaterials. Our estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of WC-Co nanoparticles in road runoff was in the same order of magnitude as measured environmental concentrations (MEC) of W-containing particles. The limited existing ecotoxicity data indicate that much higher concentrations are required in order to reach toxic levels, but further studies are needed to confirm this. Overall, the notable emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles during the use of tire <b>studs</b> <b>support</b> the further study and inclusion of this material in risk-related studies of nanoparticles...|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding enjoyed a revival in France, while {{the consumption of}} horse meat dropped. In 1991, the Agricultural College in Semur-en-Auxois began the production of horse milk using Auxois mares in Bierre-lès-Semur. In 1994, the French Official Journal published a decree restoring the name of [...] "draft horse" [...] from the almost 20-year use of [...] "heavy horse". In 1996, another decree prohibited the docking of tails of all French horses. French farmers moved towards the production of animals for recreation or agricultural uses, and the National <b>Stud</b> began <b>supporting</b> this aim. In July 1998, a promotional center for the Auxois opened in Bierre-les-Semur, through regional and departmental grants and using the National Stud to promote the breed.

In 1999, a study was undertaken of Auxois breeders, which showed opposition to changes in the breed. The author recommended expanding the breed standard to open new markets and save the Auxois from extinction.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} identify, {{structures}} in human skin that bind collagenase, sections from frozen or paraffin-embedded skin were incubated with either procollagenase or activated collagenase. After washing, bound procollagenase or collagenase {{was detected by}} immunofluorescence microscopy. In normal skin, procollagenase bound only to isolated granular dermal cells that were identified as mast cells {{on the basis of}} staining with fluoresceinated avidin and pinacyanol erythrosinate. When mast cells were degranulated by exposure to the ionophore A 23187, extracellular granules bound procollagenase. Of various pathologic conditions examined, the highest binding of procollagenase occurred in specimens of urticaria pigmentosa. Procollagenase bound to granular cells and to abundant granules scattered throughout the dermis. Binding could be abolished by pre-treatment of tissue sections with heparinase or by pre-incubation of procollagenase with soluble heparin, suggesting that heparin is the binding agent in the granules. Activated collagenase also bound to dermal mast cells but in addition bound strongly to the dermal collagen. Enzymatic activity of activated collagenase was not inhibited by heparin in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL. There is evidence that mast cell tryptase can contribute to procollagenase activation This <b>stud</b> further <b>supports</b> a role for mast cells in collagenolysis by demonstrating that heparin from mast cells binds procollagenase and possibly serves as a reservoir for procollagenase, which may then subsequently be activated...|$|R

The method starts from a specified central field and aperture, and uses approximate formulae to design the dipole magnet cross sections. The required masses of superconductor, stabilizing copper, support stainless steel, and yoke are calculated, and the surface area of the cold mass determined. Costs per unit weight, or area/temperature, are assigned for each item and a linear cost added to cover the tunnel, <b>supports,</b> magnet ends, <b>correctors,</b> quadrupoles, survey etc. The unit costs were originally extracted from the SSC estimates, but have been inflated and modified since. They have no Intersection Point magnets, detectors, detector halls, EDIA, contingency, R and D or escalation. The assumed linear cost, including magnet ends, with the inflation factor, is 22 k$/m. If the aperture is small, as in the pipeatron, the magnets can be long, end costs reduced, and the packing factor improved. This expectation is confirmed by the recent Fermilab VLHC study.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensCold‐formed steel {{has become}} a {{preferred}} building material for wall framing in {{many different types of}} structures. One of its main uses has been as non‐structural members in curtain wall assemblies of structural steel framed buildings. In an exterior wall application, the main purpose of the curtain wall is to transfer out of plane loads to the steel frame while not supporting any superimposed gravity loads. Therefore, when the curtain wall is in the plane of the structural steel frame, the vertical deflection of the spandrel beam directly above the wall must be known to provide the appropriate deflection gap between the beam and the curtain wall so that gravity loads are not transferred to the wall. Common practice is to size the gap for the deflection from 100 % of the live load. In some cases, the deflection gap may be significant, and since this gap must also be provided in the exterior cladding of the wall, it creates a design issue for the architect. This report presents the results of an investigation into the feasibility of reducing the size of the deflection gap when the wall is located directly under the spandrel beam. In this study, analytical models were developed for common design situations of curtain walls constructed of cold‐formed steel studs in structural steel framed buildings. This study investigates two common stud heights combined with different floor live loads. Taking into account that wall studs have some available axial compressive strength, a procedure was developed to determine an appropriate reduction for the gap. Using an iterative process a relationship is made between the axial compressive strength of the stud and the amount of axial load the <b>stud</b> can <b>support</b> to establish a factor which gives the percentage the live load gap for 100 % live load can be safely reduced by...|$|R
40|$|Load-bearing {{capacity}} of studs of timber-frame houses can be greatly improved if {{the contribution of}} wall-covering material and insulation is also taken into account (scheme C in figure 1). This principle is use to design a new construction principle for industrially produced dwellings [Moonen 1998]. In this paper the results are presented from experiments to prove the validity of this scheme. In total 16 wall elements with slimline studs and a very thin skin glued to the stud and insulation are tested under compression. The experiments are intended to investigate the minimum thickness of the skin to force the stud to buckle perpendicular to the wall plane. Therefore the slenderness of the studs and also {{the thickness of the}} skin is varied in the test specimen. The composition of the tested wall elements is predetermined by commercial available elements (figure 2 and table 1) because the dimensions of these panels suited well in the scope of the research. And by using ready-made panels we were able to concentrate on the structural behavior of the panels instead of production issues of glued surfaces. These panels are in the Netherlands common used as roof boarding with integrated insulation. The experiments confirmed the chosen scheme and indicated that a 3 mm (1 / 8 inch) skin is amply sufficient to <b>support</b> <b>studs</b> with a slenderness-ratio of 1 : 6 (width : height), forcing the stud to buckle across the strongest axis. The thin skin is also able to transfer 10 - 50 % of the load to the adjacent stud. The test-results have good prospects to develop new elements for timber frame houses. The elements to be developed will lead up to a reduction of structural materials and an improvement of thermal insulation and are expressly tailored to industrial production with improved working conditions...|$|R
