The samples of animal blood, soils and feed were collected randomly in the region of Bujanovac, in 2003. Complete blood cells count was performed according to standard laboratory procedures. Concentration of red blood cells malondialdehyde (RBC MDA) and erythrocyte superoxid dismutase (SOD) activity were determined spectrophotometrically. The functional activity of leukocytes was investigated by NBT reduction and adhesion test. Activity of the radionuclides was determined by standard gamma spectrometry. The obtained results of complete red blood cells count indicate normocytic normochromic anaemia. Considerably increased RBC MDA concentration suggests a violent oxidative stress in cows bred in the exposed area although the activity of their RBC antioxidant enzyme SOD was in the range of values obtained in the control group. The total number of leukocytes and the differential leukocyte counts were within the physiological range. NBT reduction test revealed the absence of leukocyte oxidative burst, which pointed to the absence of inflammation. A significant decrease of granulocyte adhesiveness, pointed at partial impairment of granulocyte functional activity.

IMPF: 02. 52 RONO: 1330 2406 Recent control of atmospheric SO 2 pollution is leading to important <b>soil</b> sulphur <b>impoverishment.</b> Plasticity could be a mechanism allowing species to adapt to this rapid global change. Trifolium repens L. is a key grassland species whose performances in community are strongly linked to nitrogen availability. Plasticity of three white clover lines contrasting {{in their ability to}} use atmospheric N 2 or soil N was assessed by analysing a set of functional traits along a gradient of nitrogen and sulphur fertilisation applied on a poor soil. White clover traits showed high morphological and physiological plasticity. Nitrogen appeared to be the most limiting factor for the VLF (Very Low Fixation) line. S was the element that modulated the most traits for the nitrogen fixing lines NNU (Normal Nitrate Uptake) and LNU (Low Nitrate Uptake). As expected, N fertilisation inhibited white clover fixation, but we also observed that N 2 fixation was enhanced when S was added. S fertilisation increased nodule length as well as the proportion of nodules containing leghaemoglobin. S fertilisation, with a direct effect and an indirect effect through N 2 fixation, increases white clover performances particularly with regards to photosynthesis and potential vegetative reproduction. The important plasticity {{in response to}} S availability should allow it to adapt to a large range of abiotic conditions, but its sensitivity to S nutrition would be a disadvantage for competition in a situation of <b>soil</b> sulphur <b>impoverishment.</b> In contrast, S fertilisation could help maintain this species when nitrogen status is against it.

In <b>soils</b> <b>impoverishment</b> and yield stagnancy context, noting that extensive bovine herds progressive disappearance in the groundnut basin moved deeply soils fertility management system, it is relevant to wonder how the different agricultural strategies adopted by Barry Sine and Diohine villages can impact terroir’s environmental sustainability. We will question nowadays the interest of i) maintaining traditional system remainder adapted to new environmental constraints (Diohine case) ii) or favouring new fertility management rise structured around bovine fattening (Barry Sine case). These divergent managements impact biomass and nutrient flows differently according to the analysis scale adopted: plot, household or terroir scales. Nutrient and biomass flows analysis informs each scale functioning while nutrient balance is a largely admitted environmental sustainability indicator (Roy et al. 2005). In other words, we will focus on system opening multi- scale effects on nutrient balance and especially for the terroir scale adopting a systemic approach. To be able to plan agricultural future of the former groundnut basin, it is primordial to consider actor’s terroir perception in terms of soils fertility evolution and to grasp the fertility management practices evolution dynamics {{in order to increase}} production. In that purpose, a multiple perspective analysis that distinguishes both terroirs (Barry Sine and Diohine) and genders 22 (men and women) will be necessary {{to take into account the}} different social status distinction, their role within the household and their position into agricultural activities. Physical, socio-political and economical changes impacted the former Senegalese groundnut basin what resulted in a strong natural resources use competition and therefore an agrarian transition that disconnects cropping and livestock farming sectors. Two terroirs were studied, one within a traditional model that conserved common fallows (Diohine), the other one that adopted livestock fattening practice (Barry Sine). Multi-scale nutrient balances based on surveys were sustainability indicators for the selected options and a participative workshop gathered their fertility management perceptions and dynamic per terroir and per gender. Plot scale nitrogen balances are both negative but higher for Diohine (- 13 kgN. ha- 1 for - 24 kgN. ha- 1 in Barry Sine) as well as nitrogen efficiency (116 for 4 à Barry Sine).

The former Basic Agriculture Act, which was effective between 1961 and 1999, promoted single cropping, the use of chemicals in agricultural methods, and the use of large-sized machines, which caused problems such as <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment,</b> replant failure, chemical residue accumulation, ground water pollution, and productivity reduction. Many of these livestock-related environmental problems are closely linked to substances in livestock excreta and excessive nitrogen, which is the prime cause of concern. These problems are related to externality and {{can be attributed to the}} overuse of natural resources. In addition, the former law ignored the multiple functions of agriculture, which, in turn, diminished the positive external effects. These problems are related to externality and can be attributed to the underuse of natural resources. This condition has been improved under the Food, Agriculture and Rural Areas Basic Act (New Basic Agriculture Act). Superficially, livestock excreta and excessive nitrogen contribute to the overuse problem, but if we regard them as unused resources, they can also be categorised as factors that contribute to the underuse problem. The new act offers measures to resolve underuse problems, but these measures continue to remain inadequate to arrive at a complete solution. Therefore, in addition to the legal approaches adopted, voluntary countermeasures by agriculture and livestock farmers should also be promoted. ...|$|E

40|$|Tree mono-plantations are {{susceptible}} to <b>soil</b> nutrient <b>impoverishment</b> and mixed species plantations have been proposed {{as a way of}} maintaining soil fertility while enhancing biodiversity. In the Solomon Islands, mixed species plantations where teak (Tectona grandis) is inter-planted with a local tree species (Flueggea flexuosa) have been used as an alternative to teak mono-plantations and are expected to increase soil microbial diversity and modify microbial biogeochemical processes. In this study, we quantified the abundance of microbial functional genes involved in the nitrogen (N) cycle from soil samples collected in teak, flueggea, and mixed species plantations. Furthermore, we measured soil properties such as pH, total carbon (C) and total N, stable N isotope composition (δ 15 N), and inorganic N pools. Soil pH and δ 15 N were higher under teak than under flueggea, which indicates that intercropping teak with flueggea may decrease bacterial activities and potential N losses. Higher C:N ratios were found under mixed species plantations than those under teak, suggesting an enhancement of N immobilisation that would help preventing fast N losses. However, inorganic N pools remained unaffected by plant cover. Inter-planting teak with flueggea in mixed species plantations generally increased the relative abundance of denitrification genes and promoted the enrichment of nosZ-harboring denitrifiers. However, it reduced the abundance of bacterial amoA (ammonia monooxygenase) genes compared to teak mono-plantations. The abundance of most denitrification genes correlated with soil total N and C:N ratio, while bacterial and archeal nitrification genes correlated positively with soil NH 4 + concentrations. Altogether, these results show that the abundance of bacterial N-cycling functional guilds vary under teak and under mixed species plantations, and that inter-planting teak with flueggea may potentially alleviate N losses associated with nitrification and denitrification and favour N retention. Mixed plantations could also allow an increase in soil C and N stocks without losing the source of income that teak trees represent for local communities...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation ecology {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} broad {{research}} areas, floristic/environmental gradient analysis and studies of vegetation dynamics. The early influential American ecologist Clements combined the two areas into a dynamic system for classifying vegetation. His succession and climax theory, however, was later severely criticized. A new approach {{to the study of}} distributional dynamics, called "landscape ecology," focuses on the dynamics of spatial vegetation patterns. There is a spatial hierarchy rule, which implies greater stability of species and community patterns when one considers larger area units versus smaller ones. It is argued that this rule is frequently transgressed in biotically impoverished areas, like the Hawaiian Islands, where certain dominant plant species have become established over unusually broad areas and habitat spectra. A further point made is that with "species packing" successional patterns change from auto-succession, where the dominant species retains dominance by in situ generation turnover (termed chronosequential monoculture), via "normal" succession (i. e., displacement of dominants by other dominants over time [termed chronosequential polyculture]), to small-area patch or gap dynamics (termed chronosequential gap rotation). Examples of the three spatially different succession paradigms are given for Hawaii, and the point is made that chronosequential monocultures cannot be expected to last, but change to chronosequential gap rotation with the invasion of alien dominants. Before the invasion of alien dominants, certain native dominants seem to have segregated into races or varieties by evolutionary adaptation to successional habitats. Finally, the concept of climax is discussed as having two meanings: (I) permanency of community type, which can only be observed for the aggregate assemblage of smaller communities in a larger space, such as occupied by a biome; (2) the mode of organic production in ecosystem development. The mode seems to occur between 1000 and 3000 yr in the Hawaiian rainforest biome on volcanic soils.

40|$|Aim Observations of long chronosequences {{in forest}} {{ecosystems}} show that, after some millennia of build-up, biomass declines {{in relation to}} the slow depletion of soil phosphorus. Plants that dominate during this period of <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment</b> have specialized strategies for P acquisition, including ectomycorrhiza or root clusters. We use quantitative, pollen-based reconstructions of regional vegetation in four Quaternary warm stages (Holocene, Eemian, Holsteinian, Harreskovian) to test whether inferred forest cover and productivity changes are consistent with long-term modification of soil nutrient pools. Location Southern Scandinavia (Denmark, southern Sweden). Methods The REVEALS model was used to estimate regional vegetation abundances of 25 pollen-type-equivalent taxa from pollen records of large sedimentary basins in southernmost Scandinavia. Based on the estimated regional vegetation, we then calculated time-series of Ellenberg indicator values for L (light), R (soil reaction) and N (a productivity proxy). We classified the vegetation records into distinct phases and compared these phases and the samples using hierarchical clustering and ordination. Results All three interglacials developed coniferous or mixed forests. However, pure deciduous forests were never reached during the Holsteinian, while pure coniferous forests never developed in the Holocene. Above-ground productivity was inferred to be low initially, peaking in the first third of the warm stages and then slowly declining (except during the Holocene). Dominant trees of the post-peak phases all had ectomycorrhiza as a strategy for P acquisition, indicating that easily accessible P pools had become depleted. Increases in fire regimes may have amplified the inferred final drop in productivity. Mid/late Holocene productivity changes were much influenced by agricultural activities. Main conclusions REVEALS vegetation estimates combined with Ellenberg indicator values suggest a consistent pattern in warm stages of initially rising productivity, followed by a long and slow decline. The P-acquisition strategies of dominant trees indicate that the decline reflects increasing P depletion of soils...|$|E

Mesofauna and macroarthropods were identified {{at the level of}} zoological group, order, super-family or family, when possible. They were then classified into morphotypes on the basis of features observable under a magnifying glass. The humus form varied from amphimull to dysmull in the 24 -year-old spruce stands (regeneration), and was a dysmoder under the 136 -year-old trees (adult). Results of correspondence analysis and ANOVA indicated that soil pH was higher in regeneration stands, where animal communities were mainly characterized by high densities of collembola, centipedes, and macrofauna. The diversity of zoological (and functional) groups was also higher in regeneration stands. The two regeneration stands differed only in the abundance of gamasids and Protura. Soil carbon and nitrogen contents increased in the mature spruce stand, as did the C/N ratio. The abundance of animals increased due to higher densities of mites, particularly oribatids while collembola, macrofauna, zoological diversity and the rate of disappearance of the litter decreased. The comparison of morphotype assemblages by hierarchical agglomerative clustering indicated that the shift between 24 -year-old and 136 -year-old trees, observed for humus forms, also occurred for animal communities. Differences in soil characteristics and animal communities between the two phases of the forest cycle corresponded to those generally observed between mull and moder, except for collembola which are generally more abundant in the thick organic layers of moder soils. Our findings confirm the change in humus form previously noted by other authors in the French Alps, but are inconsistent with data on humus forms and collembola and oribatid mite populations from Northern Europe. We conclude that changes in invertebrate communities, particularly arthropods, with the growth phases of spruce may be attributed to (1) <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment,</b> due to the increased rate of nutrients and water uptake by growing trees; and (2) increase in recalcitrant litter input, mostly transformed by oribatid mites. Our data indicated that animal communities and humus forms could be a reliable means of assessing functional characteristics of the ecosystem corresponding to each growth phase of spruce. # 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Fertilizer {{placement}} method plays a {{vital role}} in modulating crop response to nutrients. Previous studies found a split combination of top-dressing and base placement of poultry manure superior (on growth and dry matter yield of plantain) to either of the placement methods used singly. The present study investigated the effect of manure placement method vis-à-vis the duration of growth of a previous plantain crop on the substrate fertility (nutrient leftover) and growth of a follower maize crop. In a pot experiment, three manure application methods, consisting of top-dressing (T 1), base placement (T 2), or a split combination of methods T 1 and T 2 (T 3), were tested against a no manure control (T 4) on growth and dry matter yield of ‘PITA 14 ’ (a plantain hybrid) for a growth period of 3 or 5 months. The residual fertility of the leftover substrates was evaluated, based on growth and biomass production of two maize varieties (acid and non-acid tolerant) for 9 weeks. The acidity, organic matter and NPK contents of the substrates were determined. Data were collected on percentage seedling emergence and vigour, plant height, stem diameter, number of live leaves, leaf area, leaf area index (LAI) and dry weights of shoot and root components. The duration of growth of the previous plantain crop and the manure placement methods significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced nutrient leftover and all the growth parameters of the follower maize crop. The acid tolerant maize variety generally performed better than the non-tolerant variety. Longer duration of growth of the previous plantain crop reduced residual NPK. Top dressed soil (T 1) substrate previously cropped for three months supported maize plants that had the highest LAI (0. 56) and total dry weight (2. 39 g) at 3 WAP. However, at 6 and 9 WAP, substrates with split combination of top-dressing and base placement (T 3) supported the highest LAI and total dry matter yield of maize. T 3 substrates also maintained the highest residual nutrients and an ideal pH (6. 6) for plant growth. Irrespective of manure placement method, maize growth performances were better in substrates previously cropped for three months than those cropped for five months. Maize performance in soil amended with manure but not previously cropped (positive control) was not better than other manured substrates, particularly those cropped for 3 months. The quantity of residual K had the highest correlation coefficient with LAI and total dry weight of maize. The results implied that nutrient mining and associated <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment</b> in plantain cultivation could be ameliorated through appropriate nutrient placement methods. A split combination of top-dressing with base placement of poultry manure in plantain fields ensures a slower but steadier availability of crop nutrients needed for better sustainability of crop yields.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the A. L. Belgard system of vascular plant species coenomorphs as indicators of biotopes by using standardized Y. P.  Didukh phytometer scales for 12 environmental factors. The classification and ordination of coenomorphs in the phytometer space was performed by using algorithms of discriminant analysis. The analysis is based on 2, 186 species of the vascular plant flora of Ukraine. The classification accuracy was around 80 % and above, the least homogenous was the petrophyte coenomorph. The validity of identification of ruderal coenomorphs was proved {{as an indicator of}} biotopes with increased content of soil nitrogen. Analysis of the a posteriori probability of species attribution to a coenomorph supports the validity of distinguishing transitional coenomorphs. Their number is small and each group contains a small number of species. The principal factors of classifying species by coenomorph are (in descending order of significance) : minimum soil moisture, minimum light (shade), impoverishment of salts in the soil solution, high porosity of <b>soil</b> and <b>impoverishment</b> of carbonates of calcium in the soil and maximum values for radiation balance. The analysis of the distribution of coenomorphs in the space of the square of Mahalanobis distances and the ordination in the discriminant functions axis has determined the ranking of coenomorph of biotope and coenotic substitution: soil moisture (first discriminant function), radiation balance and shade (second discriminant function), salt regime and soil aeration (third discriminant function). For the vegetation of Ukraine this ordination of coenomorphs corresponds to the zonal factors of the distribution of biotopes and their limiting factors and the factors determining A. L.  Belgard’s typology of natural and artificial forests: soil moisture, salinity of the soil solution, light conditions. The coenomorph optima for the principal factors have been defined in phytometer scales. This allows coenomorphs to be used as biotope phytometers and provides a preliminary assessment of those species whose place in the scales has not yet been determined. Analysis of posterior probabilities enabled us to determine the transitional coenomorphs, which are typical for ecotones between zonal and intrazonal vegetational ecosystems of Ukraine...|$|R
40|$|During the Bukavu Conference on {{flora and}} fauna {{conservation}} (26 - 31 October 1953), a French delegation submitted a recommendation, which was unanimously adopted, calling for an overall policy for nature protection in Africa. The 1933 London Convention, which only addressed the “conservation of fauna and flora in their natural state”, no longer seems adequate: the conservation of a few animal or plant species {{and the creation of}} national parks and nature reserves only address particular areas of nature conservation, which need to be extended to protect the whole environment in which African people live. This includes spontaneous vegetation, which protects water and soils and forms not only forests but also indeterminate “bush”. A specific convention for Africa is justified because nature in Africa is different and more seriously endangered than elsewhere. It is in danger because of the extreme climate, but also from bush fires and slash-and-burn agriculture that cannot sustain the undernourished population. Savannah encroachment, <b>soil</b> erosion and <b>impoverishment</b> and desertification are gaining ground. A common policy for all African territories has become essential to ensure their protection, and also to fight epidemics. Africa's nature forms a whole that has no boundaries, but natural regions that interact climatically. Over and above a Charter for nature protection in Africa, the issue is that of protecting Africa's populations, but with¬out subjecting them to scientific planning that disregards their customary practices.

40|$|China’s {{south-western}} {{province of}} Yunnan is a mountainous area of high biological {{and cultural diversity}} that was annexed into China relatively late in Chinese history. The province has lost over two thirds of its original forest cover and lost half of what remained in the last fifty years. Ethnic minorities make up {{about a third of}} the population of the province but predominate in forested areas. Chinese policy towards ‘minority nationalities’ at first recognized their right to self-determination but since liberation has oscillated between assimilationist and integrationist approaches. Despite strong central government control, the law grants them an important measure of cultural and institutional autonomy at the local level. Nationally, forest policy has been highly centralized and geared towards timber production. Quota driven overharvesting has depleted forests and led to serious <b>soil</b> erosion, local <b>impoverishment,</b> flooding and massive loss of life in the lowlands. While mass afforestation efforts have disappointed. Since 1998, the government has banned logging in Yunnan, allowing only a very restricted cut for domestic use. Imprudent natural resource use is linked to the doctrine of State ownership of all lands and forests and the imposed structure of village collectives. Since the late 1970 s, the government has progressively devolved land and then forests to local farmers to manage and enjoy use rights to. Massive increases in agricultural production have resulted, but the lesser degree of autonomy granted farmers with respect to forest land, combined with the top-down quota system, inadequate supervision capacity, poor delineation of forests and the slower rate of return on investment have frustrated social forestry initiatives. Farmers’ skepticism that devolved tenure would really give them rights over timber has been confirmed by the logging ban. At the same time, in Yunnan, many upland farmers are being obliged to plant trees on their higher fields, with the aim of limiting run-off. The simultaneous loss of grain for subsistence and income from timber has hit farmers hard. The losses have not been made up with subsidies and grain handouts. Local activists distinguish between the government’s ‘social forestry’ and the ‘community forestry’ that has been promoted, since the late 1980 s, by the Ford Foundation, international development assistance projects and the international networks, notably RECOFTC. Despite major advances in awareness raising, training, the development of forestry school courses and curricula, and despite numerous educational pilot projects, community forestry has not yet ‘taken off’ in the province. This can only come when the central government’s policy changes. Laws restricting civil society organizations are quite strict in China, yet despite these limitations an incipient provincial level network has evolved promoting participatory approaches to development. Efforts to promote a national level community forestry network have been less successful. Although Yunnan has had a relatively limited experience with international community forestry networks, local actors provide highly insightful lessons and suggestions about how such networking should be improved. International networking is valued as a source of information and inspiration but should be made more interactive, locally driven and strategic. The main challenges now facing community forestry in Yunnan are achieving national policy reform, and building local capacity and awareness in both communities and forestry bureaux. Recent government moves to allow village level democracy and slim down the administration offer opportunities to give farmers greater initiative. Perhaps minority areas, where indigenous forest related knowledge is retained, and where more autonomy is, notionally, allowed, offer hopeful beginnings...|$|R
40|$|International Service for National Agricultural Research Food {{requirements}} {{in many developing}} countries keep in creasing at unprecedented rates. Consumption patterns change with rapid urbanization and increasing incomes. Agricultural practices, in compatible with growing land scarcity, are causing erosion and <b>soil</b> <b>impoverishment.</b> Drought problems are exacerbated as cultivation moves into less favourable areas Governments must respond to these drastic changes with new and invigorated agricultural policy and development thrusts, and with urgent steps to make new technologies available. No country with a sizeable agricultural sector can meet such needs without an effective agricultural research capacity of its own. This national capacity is needed for several key functions. First, to search the world agricultural knowledge base for suitable technologies, and to collect appropriate germplasm and prototypes. Second, to adapt available technologies to the particular needs of different categories of local producers, and to present such material, techniques, and practices in a form suitable for use by extension. Third, to provide government policy makers and planners with information and insights on what is technically, economically, and socially feasible. And, fourth, within limits imposed by resource constraints, this national capacity is required to generate some essential technology of its own where other options don't work. These are tall assignments, especially for agricultural research systems in developing countries operating under severe institutional, manpower, and funding constraints. It was recognition of the imperative need to have strong, well-managed national agricultural research systems, able to do all these things, that led to the creation in 1980 of ISNAR as the latest of 13 international centers supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) As a complement to the predominant emphasis on commodity research within the CGIAR system, ISNAR's task is to assist developing country governments in their efforts to strengthen the organization, management, and structure of their national agricultural research systems. To improve the creative functioning of such a system is a complex managerial task demanding a holistic approach. ISNAR's support is multi-faceted and integrative, taking account of specific country needs. Initial activities are analytical and diagnostic, culminating in recommendations for change, as appropriate. ISNAR has developed a distinct strategy and methodology for carrying out such comprehensive system reviews. To date, it has done nineteen such reviews, at the invitation of and in close collaboration with the governments concerned. The diagnostic review constitutes a first broad and rapid assistance in response to a country's request for guidelines for change, based on the agricultural research management experience of its staff, combined with relevant concepts and methods of management science. Usually, as national research systems evolve, countries seek assistance in solving more specific organization and management problems relating to individual components of their agricultural research systems. Because management as a discipline has been developed primarily for industry and commerce, there is a substantial knowledge gap in applying management techniques to national agricultural research systems. To respond to anticipated and emerging needs, ISNAR is taking on the adaptive research task of bringing modern management concepts and techniques to bear on national agricultural research systems, by distilling, modifying, and synthesizing existing management tools and creating a body of knowledge directly applicable to agricultural research systems. ISNAR's strategy of creating multiplier effects finds further expression in its conference and training activities, aimed at both awareness and skill enhancement and at improving communication among research managers, regionally and nationally. As a support for its own work and that of its clients, ISNAR is rapidly expanding its specialized documentation in research management and agricultural research system development. ISNAR presently has 24 professional staff {{of more than a dozen}} nationalities based in its offices in The Hague, and a few outposted staff. The staff includes economists, agricultural scientists of several disciplines, management experts, and social scientists. More importantly, it comprises a wide diversity of managerial experience, and of cultural backgrounds, all focused on service to, and study of, system-building for effective management of national agricultural research. With this resource, ISNAR is currently working in one form or another and at different levels of intensity with well over twenty developing countries in all parts of the world.
