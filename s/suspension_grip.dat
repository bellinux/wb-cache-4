50|$|The {{first game}} in the series was known outside Japan and Asia as Felony 11-79 and was Designed and {{produced}} by Kan Naito. While it features three separate environments (DOWN TOWN, SEA SIDE, METRO CITY) and a test course {{as opposed to the}} later games' use of one city, the game itself is rather short. Most of the player's time is spent unlocking the game's many bonus vehicles. Even players can set the car's performance included steering, front suspension, rear <b>suspension,</b> <b>grip</b> balance, acceleration and brake. All cars have a different performance rate (horsepower, torque, length, weight, fuel).Players may need to refill the tank. This feature only on this episode.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{activity}} <b>suspension</b> of <b>Grip</b> Inc. in 2006, {{he founded the}} gothic metal band Eyes of Eden. He recorded with this band the album Faith, released on 17 August 2007. Also in 2006, he founded the thrash metal group Enemy of the Sun, which recorded the album Shadows, released on 7 December 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} of each {{vehicle in the}} game was unique. Not only with respect to engine power, but also areas such as tire <b>grip,</b> <b>suspension</b> stiffness, steering tightness, and between different drive-trains such as front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive. The game also features the possibility of damaging the vehicles, although the damage does not affect performance.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analysed}} the physiological, nutritional {{and performance}} profiles of athletes practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu. To this end, 15 athletes that practiced Brazilian jiu-jitsu (aged: 28 ± 5 years; 8 brown belts and 7 black belts; training experience: 11 ± 4 years) underwent anthropometric measurements (body composition and somatotype), dietary evaluation (24 h recall) and physical fitness tests (movement time, dynamometer handgrip, kimono grip strength, vertical jump and sit-and-reach tests). The athletes had 12. 7 ± 4. 8 % of body fat, 59. 2 ± 5. 0 % of muscle mass and their somatotype {{was dominated by}} the mesomorphic component (5. 3 ± 2. 0), followed by endomorphic (3. 7 ± 1. 5) and ectomorphic (1. 4 ± 0. 9) components. Nutritional assessment suggested a diet consisting of 54 ± 7 % of carbohydrates, 19 ± 4 % of protein and 27 ± 6 % of lipids. Movement time on the handgrip tests was 0. 42 ± 0. 05 s, for handgrip strength, 53 ± 7 kgf was found for the dominant hand and 50 ± 9 kgf for the non-dominant hand. For the countermovement jump, the jiu-jitsu athletes reached 41 ± 5 cm. Athletes remained 30 ± 14 s in the maximum static <b>suspension</b> test <b>gripping</b> a kimono, and reached 27 ± 8 cm in the sit-and-reach test. Overall the sample presented average levels of body fat, elevated muscle mass and a predominantly mesomorphic somatotype. Diet was generally poor, with low carbohydrate intake, high protein intake and adequate lipid intake. Maximum isometric handgrip strength was consistent with observations of other athletes in this sport discipline. However, the performance in the maximum static <b>suspension</b> test <b>gripping</b> a kimono was lower than in other Brazilian jiu-jitsu athletes. Movement time was comparable and lower body muscle power was worse compared to athletes in similar sports. Additionally, flexibility was rated as poor...|$|R
5000|$|Power {{came from}} a Chrysler supplied, Shelby tuned Turbo II 2.2 Liter Intercooled SOHC I4, with 175 hp (130 kW) and 175 ft·lbf (237 Nm). Weight was just over 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) with the average driver, so {{performance}} was {{not as good as}} the lighter and lesser-equipped Shelby GLHS. It took about 7.2 seconds to get to 60 mi/h km/h and quarter mile times were in the mid to high 15-second range with factory boost levels peaking at about 12 PSI. Road handling was quite good for a sedan at the time, pulling an advertised 0.85 g on the skidpad. Ride comfort was stiff but not unbearable, providing a good balance between a sport suspension coupe and a touring sedan. Goodyear Gatorback tires, Monroe Formula GP struts and larger sway bars were used to provide a firmer <b>suspension</b> with better <b>grip.</b> Shelby also used an experimental (at the time) 4-wheel disc brake system to improve braking.|$|R
