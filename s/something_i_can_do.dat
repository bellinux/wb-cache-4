500|$|Ruby Messer Barber {{had this}} to say about joining the WAVES, [...] "It was a choice of adventure. I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> one way I can make a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much {{discipline}} and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Wicked, she recorded material with Brian May for her debut album and performed at various live events including her {{first set of}} solo musical showcase concerts entitled Kerry Ellis Sings the Great British Songbook at the Shaw Theatre on Euston Road in London. She performed on four dates in late June 2009 with the inclusion of Brian May in each night's encore. Of the concerts, Ellis commented, [...] "It's finally <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as me, {{as opposed to being}} in a show as a character. It's lovely to be able to sing songs that I really want to sing or which I wouldn't normally get to sing." [...] The showcase paid tribute to some of Ellis' favourite British composers and lyricists including Take That, Duffy, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney. Of her [...] "eclectic set" [...] with [...] "velvety rich distinctive vocals," [...] a critic professed, [...] "Ellis is as sexy as any other female pop star out there today and she sings like a true diva," [...] and concluded, [...] "She may have left Oz for good but there is no place like home and for Kerry Ellis that home is most definitely the stage." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{describing}} her music, O'Connor says, [...] "My music is definitely pop, {{and at first}} had a country feel. Since Iwas a child actress in the musical theater world, it is influenced by that too, {{with a bit of}} rock. I want to keep my songs interesting and different, but still catchy. The song, 'Just the thing' is about accepting who you are, and loving what makes you, you. It is a fun upbeat track, and has a similar message to it like the game does, but the game is more of a ballad or anthem. 'Just the thing' is lighter and fun. It can be to a boyfriend or girlfriend, or to a best friend that really gets you. When I wrote it I was thinking about that, and close relationships with people who love you for your weirdness. I co wrote the song with Heather Holley, and she was really awesome. Writing the bridge of 'Just the Thing' is probably my favorite verse I have ever written, because it is so different and theatrical. Freddie Mercury from Queen inspired it, and the song really does describe me. I love being a singer. I really feel that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> influence my fans, and those who listen to my music for the better, and music is such a powerful way to do it. Acting will always be a job I love to do, but music is <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to really tell people my story. It is such a rewarding platform to have, just like speaking for my cause." ...|$|R
5000|$|Larudee {{was arrested}} in and {{deported}} from Israel in 2006. Larudee was accused by Israeli authorities of being engaged in [...] "anti-Israeli" [...] activities that included meetings with the Hamas terrorist group. Larudee had been photographed with Hamas leaders where he received an award after the first Gaza flotillas. He was in fact traveling this time under the false identity Paul Wilder {{because he had been}} banned from the country before due to his association with Palestinian terrorist groups according to Kaplan. Lee Kaplan from StoptheISM.com alerted the Israeli security before his trip. LaRudee tried to remain in Israel in a case that went to Israel's Supreme Court but Larudee claimed he was deported due to Kaplan's articles about him. “This is <b>something</b> small <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to make life under occupation just a little more bearable for people, so I do it,” he said. But when he disembarked from his plane, Israeli authorities put him in a holding cell. When they ordered him back onto the plane to be deported, he refused to go and instead contacted an Israeli leftist human-rights attorney. Lee Kaplan just released undercover videos of Larudee at meetings of the Board of Directors for ISM and the BDS movement in which Larudee states he does not really care about BDS but his real purpose is to destroy the Jewish state. The videos are viewable here: http://israelbehindthenews.com/bds-movement-inside/14626/ [...] Larudee was also shown by Kaplan this week, 1/21/2017 of being guilty of fraud and violating US health and trade laws in selling and mislabeling olive oil he sells: http://israelbehindthenews.com/poisoning-people-palestine-bds-raises-funding-olive-oil-fraud/.|$|R
