In order to determine the origin of these bacteriophages, lysogeny of P. freudenreichii was determined by isometric bacteriophage type analysis. The genomic DNA of 76 strains were hybridized with the DNA of nine bacteriophages isolated from <b>Swiss</b> type <b>cheeses,</b> and the DNA of 25 strains exhibited strong hybridization. Three of these strains released bacteriophage particules following UV irradiation (254 nm) or treatment with low concentrations of mitomycin C.
