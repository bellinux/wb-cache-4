50|$|In the {{scientific}} community, {{there was a}} debate about how objects cooled and in 1461 Marliani confirmed that he had experimentally observed hot water freezing faster than cold water.

Marliani also lectured on the quantities and production of natural body heat.

However, Marliani maintained that human body temperature is higher during the winter than in summer.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of reducing fuel-cycle {{costs for the}} N. S. SAVANNAH by replacing the stainless steel fuelelement containers in the permanent reactor core structure by <b>similar</b> <b>containers</b> of a zirconium alloy was investigated. These containers, although not integral parts of the fuel-bearing components, are located within the active core and divide the core into 32 separate channels into which the fuel elements are placed. Areas of investigation included reactor physics, fuel-cycle economics, materials compatibility, structural design, and reactor hazards. A summary of the method of analysis and results is given for each area ot investigation. Calculations indicated that the substitution of Zircaloy containers would increase core reactivity about 6 % DELTA k and control- rod worth about 4 % DELTA k. Fuel-cycle costs would be reduced about 26 %. Zircaloy- 4 appears to be compatible with the reactor system, except for some uncertainty with respect to fretting corrosion, which can be resolved only by tests. The substitution of cold-worked Zircaloy for stainless steel in the container assembly would necessitate only minor design modifications. Although this evaluation is strictly applicable only to the N. S. SAVANNAH reactor, the results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using zirconium alloys for in-core capital-cost components. (auth...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study is an evaluation of liquid and frozen plasma from the standpoint of the stability of certain constituents having important physio-logical activity. METHOD For the comparative study of liquid and frozen plasma, 3 fresh pools of plasma were prepared by the Blood Plasma Department of the U. S. Naval Medical School, Washing-ton, D. C. One half of each pool was transferred to small containers holding 200 ml. of citrated plasma and im-mediately frozen at- 30 ° C. The other half was kept in <b>similar</b> <b>containers</b> in the liquid state at room tempera-ture. At predetermined intervals, a liquid sample and its duplicate frozen sample were shipped to Boston for study. The frozen sample was preserved in this state by shipment in solid carbon dioxide. The usual preparation of the plasma consisted of drawing blood into 35 ml. of 2. 5 per cent sodium citrate to make a total volume of 300 ml. Thus, a 0. 31 per cent sodium citrate concentration was obtained. Eighteen hundred ml. of plasma from such bleedings were aspirated after centrifuging into 200 ml. of 50 per cent glucose to give a volume of 2000 ml. This pool was then subdivided as given above.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (Department) has {{ultimate}} {{responsibility for}} the safety of all nuclear explosives and weapons operations conducted by the Department and its contractors. The Department also has joint {{responsibility for the}} safety of nuclear weapons in the custody of the Armed Services. Since the 1970 s, the Department has designed, developed, and produced accident resistant containers to promote safety when transporting certain types of nuclear weapons by air. After successfully developing and modifying accident resistant containers for use on Army helicopters, the Department subsequently designed, modified, and produced <b>similar</b> <b>containers</b> for the United States Air Force. Because the Department spent millions of dollars on this project, we conducted the audit to determine if the Department had adequate controls in place to preclude the development and production of projects which did not have customer agreement or meet customer requirements. One goal of the Department`s Strategic Plan is to ensure that customer expectations are met by having them participate in the planning process. Although nuclear safety responsibility was shared with the Department of Defense, the Department designed and produced 87 accident resistant containers for about $ 29 million when the customer did not want them and expressed no desire to use these containers. This occurred because the Department unilaterally decided to produce containers without ensuring that the containers met customer expectations. There may be circumstances where the Department will do some preliminary design and testing before agreeing with the Department of Defense on requirements. However, the Departments of Energy and Defense should reach agreement on the requirement for products before final design and production, otherwise funds will be spent unnecessarily...|$|E
30|$|The models {{indicate}} a slow or extended establishment phase in kauri for young seedlings and saplings. This {{is most likely}} attributable {{to a number of}} factors. While the majority of the stands used in this study were established as woodlots, none of the expected management after planting was undertaken. The root development of kauri seedlings can be poor. Young kauri have a well-developed taproot, and it is possible that penetration and exploitation of free-draining soils is important for optimum growth (Morrison and Lloyd [1972]). Therefore, slow development of roots after establishment may account for the slow establishment of planted seedlings (Bergin and Steward [2004]). Nursery practice and the development of appropriate sized and aged seedlings are also likely to play a part in the early growth of kauri. It is common for kauri to be raised in PB 3 planter bags (that contain the equivalent of 3 pints of potting mix) or <b>similar</b> <b>containers,</b> with seedlings up to one metre tall, or more. As the moisture and fertility requirements are supplied artificially to a seedling in a nursery situation it is easier to grow seedlings where a large top is out of proportion to the root system. Hence, seedlings may take some time after planting to re-establish an appropriate root structure able to support the top and initiate growth. A further important consideration was the lack of knowledge of the seed source for individual stands, the number of parent trees from which collections were made {{and the size of the}} parent stand. The productivity in some stands may therefore simply reflect poor seed collection techniques where only a narrow genetic base is represented. A `juvenile' ontogenetic phase of slower growth may also be the cause. These explanations must be tested in order to achieve early site capture and improve site productivity if kauri is to be planted for production.|$|E

By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|R
