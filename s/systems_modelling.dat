We argue that category theory provides a precise and convenient conceptual language and tool to <b>model</b> complex <b>systems.</b> System descriptions are regarded as categories, in which each object is a <b>system</b> <b>model</b> and each morphism represents changes and transformations of <b>system</b> <b>models.</b> A <b>system</b> <b>model</b> is in turn viewed as a category together with some faithful functors. The category in a <b>system</b> <b>model</b> describes {{the structure of the}} device being diagnosed and the faithful functors describe the behaviour of components of the device. The morphism (transformation of <b>system</b> <b>models)</b> in the category as system description is a functor between categories describing structures of the device being diagnosed.

They wanted to create [...] "a notation that should enable the analyst to organize the problem around any piece of hardware". Their work was a first effort to create an abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components. A next step in IS modelling was taken by CODASYL, an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of [...] "a proper structure for machine independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing". This {{led to the development of}} a specific IS information algebra.|$|E
