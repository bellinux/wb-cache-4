50|$|The Holden HG {{range was}} {{introduced}} on 26 July 1970, replacing the Holden HT series {{which had been}} in production since May 1969. Changes from the previous model included new grilles and body decorations {{as well as new}} <b>safety</b> features, <b>colours</b> and trim designs. All V8-engined models were now fitted with improved disc brakes and the suspension system of the Monaro GTS was modified for greater comfort.|$|R
50|$|While the Millennium train {{concept is}} an {{evolution}} of the Tangara concept (manufactured by A Goninan & Co), the Millennium train introduced new features such as internal electronic destination indicators, automated digital voice announcements for upcoming stops, a return to reversible seating, surveillance cameras, wider stairways, a new <b>safety</b> yellow <b>colour</b> scheme, and push-button opened internal doors. The Millennium Train also introduced crumple zones to absorb impact in a collision. Interiors were designed by Transport Design International.|$|R
50|$|Orange is {{the colour}} most easily seen in dim light {{or against the}} water, making it, {{particularly}} the shade known as <b>safety</b> orange, the <b>colour</b> of choice for life rafts, life jackets or buoys. Highway temporary signs about construction or detours in the United States are orange, because of its visibility and its association with danger.|$|R
40|$|This International Standard {{establishes}} the <b>safety</b> identification <b>colours</b> and design principles for safety signs {{to be used}} in workplaces and in public areas for the purpose of accident prevention, fire protection, health hazard information and emergency evacuation. It also {{establishes the}} basic principles to be applied when developing standards containing safety signs. This part of ISO 3864 is applicable to workplaces and all locations and all sectors where safety-related questions may be posed. However, it is not applicable to the signalling used for guiding rail, road, river, maritime and air traffic and, generally speaking, to those sectors subject to a regulation which may differ...|$|R

This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. Quality and <b>safety</b> attributes, like <b>colour</b> (CIELab parameters), texture (Maximum force – MF), total phenolics content (TPC), peroxidase activity (POD), microbial count and moulds & yeasts (Log 10 cfu g- 1) were determined on heat treated mature-green tomatoes at temperature ranging of 40 to 50 ºC and different times. Heat treatments (HT) did not affect significantly (p> 0. 05) the tomatoes colour. In terms of texture, a reduction of 10 % MF was observed at 50 ºC_ 15 min [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Location {{is among}} the main {{determinants}} of residential property value. It has been realised from the existing literature that location could either be tangible or intangible in nature. Tangible location factors include accessibility, transportation, closeness to central business districts etc. On the other hand, intangible location factors are those attributes of location that are invisible in nature. They include race, ethnic background, crime, <b>safety,</b> skin <b>colour,</b> native inclination, apartheid, cultural background, security, religious inclination, socioeconomic background, indigene ship and the like. This study is intended to {{examine the effect of}} these intangible location attributes on the values of residential properties in the study area. The data for this research was sourced through interviews, field survey and questionnaires. Tables and charts were employed in order to analyse the data for the research. Pictures were also taken in order to give pictorial information of what is on ground. In order to arrive at the required sample size for the research, stratified random sampling was adopted. The study area was divided into two clusters, that is, Jos North and Jos South. The outcome of the research revealed that areas that are classified as violent free neighbourhoods command high rental and sales value of land and landed properties. The research discovered that people prefer areas that are predominantly of their religious and ethnic extraction. As a result of that, the residential pattern of the study area was drastically altered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Normal {{vision is}} a {{universal}} requirement for safe riding of motorcycles. This study aims to determine the prevalence of visual impairment among commercial motorcyclists in Benin City, Nigeria. Method: This is a prospective cross sectional study carried out in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA) of Benin City. Each motorcycle park was taken as a cluster, and all motorcyclists in that park had structured questionnaires administered to them. One hundred and forty three commercial male motorcyclists in eleven motorcycle parks in Oredo LGA were subsequently examined with Snellen′s chart or illiterate E chart as applicable. The main outcome measures eligibility for driver′s licence on account of vision test {{as required by the}} Federal Road Safety Corps of Nigeria. Results: Ninety eight point six percent (98. 6 %) of those examined had acceptable driving vision requirement according to Federal Road Safety Corps. One point four percent (1. 4 %) had subnormal visual acuity, while 5. 3 % had refractive errors. Ocular pathologies were found in 11. 5 % of the eyes examined. Conclusion: Most commercial motorcyclists may pass the Federal Road <b>Safety</b> Corps. However <b>Colour</b> vision and visual field testing may give a more reliable result...|$|R
40|$|High O- 2 atmospheres (higher than 70 kPa O- 2) {{have been}} {{recently}} suggested as an innovation to modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for fresh processed vegetables to maintain sensory quality and <b>safety.</b> Visual appearance, <b>colour,</b> taste, off-odour, crispness, and microbial growth were monitored {{in a variety}} of lettuce salads, packed initially in 95 % O- 2, combined {{with the use of a}} barrier film for packaging. Mixed vegetable salads packed under conventional MAP (3 kPa 02 and 5 kPa CO 2) were used as controls. Since temperature changes along the cool chain must be taken into account when quality loss and shelf life of fresh processed vegetables are evaluated, actual documented conditions (i. e. abusive temperatures of 7 and 12 degreesC) in the retail sale display were applied. Four days after processing the microbial recommended limit of 10 (8) CFU/g for psychrotrophic bacteria was exceeded when product was held at 12 degreesC. However, when temperature within retail sale cabinets was 7 degreesC, this limit was exceeded almost 6 days after processing. At 7 degreesC no significant difference on total bacterial count between high O- 2 and conventional atmospheres was observed and a slight difference in sensory quality was found. As expected, the best quality occurred when the lowest temperature was used, although no significant difference was found between high O- 2 atmosphere and conventional MAP...|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} birds which {{live on the}} ground, {{everyone}} admits that they are coloured so as to imitate the surrounding surface. How {{difficult it is to}} see a partridge, snipe, woodcock, certain plovers, larks, and nightjars when crouched on the ground. Animals inhabiting deserts offer the most striking instances, for the bare surface affords no concealment, and all the smaller quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds depend for <b>safety</b> on their <b>colours.</b> As Mr. Tristram has remarked,[279] in regard to the inhabitants of the Sahara, all are protected by their “isabelline or sand-colour.” Calling to my recollection the desert-birds which I had seen in South America, as well as most of the ground-birds in Great Britain, it appeared to me that both sexes in such cases are generally coloured nearly alike. Accordingly I applied to Mr. Tristram, with respect to the birds of the Sahara, and he has kindly given me the following information. There are twenty-six species, belonging to fifteen genera, which manifestly have had their plumage coloured in a protective manner; and this colouring is all the more striking, as with most of these birds it is different from that of their congeners. Both sexes of thirteen out of the twenty-six species are coloured in the same manner; but these belong to genera in which this rule commonly prevails, so that they tell us nothing about the protective colours being the same in both sexes of desert-birds. Of the other thirteen species, three belong to genera in which the sexes usually differ from each other, yet they have the sexes alike. In the remaining ten species, the male differs from the female; but the difference is confined chiefly to the under surface of the plumage, which is concealed when the bird crouches on the ground; the head and back being of the same sand-coloured hue in both sexes. So that in these ten species the upper surfaces of both sexes have been acted on and rendered alike, through natural selection, for the sake of protection; whilst the lower surfaces of the males alone have been diversified through sexual selection, for the sake of ornament. Here, as both sexes are equally well protected, we clearly see that the females have not been prevented through natural selection from inheriting the colours of their male parents: we must look to the law of sexually limited transmission, as before explained.|$|R
40|$|Marketers {{are faced}} with {{informed}} and highly complex consumers. The consumer market is becoming more competitive {{and more difficult to}} predict as consumers make purchase decisions in their everyday life. An ongoing need exists for information and an examination of purchasing behaviour for marketers to succeed in their pursuit of business endeavours. This study examines the influence of selected variables on motor vehicle-related purchasing behaviour. Five independent variables, namely branding, price, promotion, <b>safety</b> features and <b>colour</b> were investigated and the dependent variable (purchasing behaviour) was examined. In doing so, various stages which consumers undergo when making purchasing decisions were discussed. These stages were outlined as need recognition, information search, and evaluation of alternatives, purchase and post-purchase behaviour. The primary research objective {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of selected variables on motor vehicle-related purchasing behaviour. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, an empirical investigation was undertaken. The quantitative (positivistic) paradigm was used in this study, as the aim was to test the hypotheses and conceptualmodel of the study using statistical analysis. In gathering primary data, 192 self-administered questionnaires were issued to respondents for completion by means of convenience and quota non-probability sampling. Upon completion of all the questionnaires, data was analysed in order to arrive at the conclusions regarding the research questions. The empirical findings and analysis followed a systematic and statistical process, where exploratory factor analysis using target rotation was used to test the validity of the measuring instrument. Cronbach alpha correlation coefficients were used to confirm the reliability of the measuring instrument, while multiple regression analysis was carried out to test the hypothesised relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable of the study. ANOVA was applied to determine differences in the demographic characteristics of respondents. The main findings on the validity and reliability of the measuring instrument proved to be statistically satisfactory. The main findings which emerged from the multiple regression analysis suggested that price and colour had statistically significant influence on motor vehicle-related purchasing behaviour. Findings revealed that branding, promotion and safety conditions had no significant effects on motor vehicle related purchasing behaviour. Accordingly, the hypotheses for price and colour were accepted and those for branding, promotion and safety conditions were rejected. Therefore according to respondents, price and colour of a motor vehicle are the most important considerations when undertaking purchasing decisions regarding motor vehicles. Additionally, the empirical investigation revealed that significant differences exist between age groups of respondents, meaning that different age groups of respondents had different perceptions and opinions with regard to their purchasing patterns relating to price. Furthermore, significant differences were also found between male and female respondents in terms of price and colour, meaning that the two genders had different perceptions and opinions with regard to their purchasing patterns in these areas. The empirical findings of this study are relevant for motor vehicle retailers and original equipment manufacturers, as the findings provide important information regarding the influence of selected variables on motor vehicle-related purchasing behaviour. Secondly the findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge regarding purchasing behaviour...|$|R
