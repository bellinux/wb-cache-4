25|$|Eleftherios {{was born}} in Mournies, near Chania (formerly known as Canea) in then-Ottoman Crete to Benny <b>Selon</b> who {{provides}} {{the origin of the}} name Veni-zelos, and Styliani Ploumidaki. When the Cretan revolution of 1866 broke out, Venizelos' family fled to the island of Syros, due to the participation of his father in the revolution. They were not allowed to return to Crete, and stayed in Syros until 1872, when Abdülaziz granted an amnesty.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s he also {{recorded}} for the Erato label, mostly with the Ensemble Intercontemporain, {{with a greater}} emphasis on the music of his contemporaries (Berio, Ligeti, Carter etc.). There was a Stravinsky cycle—including his only recording of the complete The Soldier's Tale—as well as a survey of some of his own music, including a second recording of Pli <b>selon</b> pli (with Phyllis Bryn-Julson as soloist) and recordings of Le Visage nuptial, Le Soleil des eaux and Figures—Doubles—Prismes. In 2015 Erato issued Pierre Boulez—The Complete Erato Recordings on 14 CDs.|$|E
25|$|His {{appearances}} {{became more}} infrequent after an eye operation in 2010 {{left him with}} severely impaired sight. Other health problems included a shoulder injury resulting from a fall. In late 2011, when he was already quite frail, he led the combined Ensemble Intercontemporain and Lucerne Festival Academy, with the soprano Barbara Hannigan, in a tour of six European cities of his own Pli <b>selon</b> pli. His final appearance as a conductor was in Salzburg on 28 January 2012 with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Mitsuko Uchida in a programme of Schoenberg (Begleitmusik zu einer Lichtspielszene and the Piano Concerto), Mozart (Piano Concerto No.19 in F major K459) and Stravinsky (Pulcinella Suite). Thereafter he cancelled all conducting engagements.|$|E
25|$|Apart from Pli <b>selon</b> pli, {{the only}} {{substantial}} new work {{to emerge in}} the first half of the 1960s was the final version of Book 2 of his Structures for two pianos. Boulez and Yvonne Loriod gave the premiere at the Donaueschinger Musiktage in October 1961. Midway through the decade, however, Boulez appeared to find his voice again. Éclat, a short and brilliant piece for small ensemble, had its first performance in Los Angeles in March 1965 and by 1970 it had grown into a substantial half-hour work, Éclat/Multiples. In 1968 the final version of Figures—Doubles—Prismes for large orchestra, a version of two movements from Livre pour quatuor for string orchestra (Livre pour cordes) and the two versions of Domaines (clarinet solo/clarinet and ensemble) all received first performances.|$|E
25|$|Boulez {{employed}} {{variants of}} the technique {{in a number of}} works over the next two decades: in the Third Piano Sonata (1955–57/63) the pianist may choose different routes through the score and in one movement (Trope) has the option of omitting certain passages altogether; in Éclat (1965), the conductor triggers the order in which each player joins the ensemble; in Domaines (1961–68) it is the soloist who dictates the order in which the sections are played by his movement around the stage. In later works, such as Cummings ist der Dichter (1970/86)—a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by E. E. Cummings—the conductor is given choice as to the order of certain events but there is no freedom for the individual player. In its original version Pli <b>selon</b> pli also contained elements of choice for the instrumentalists, but much of this was eliminated in later revisions.|$|E
25|$|All these {{regional}} {{varieties of}} the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan, also called occitan larg (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis that respects and admits soft regional adaptations (which {{are based on}} the convergence of previous regional koinés). So Occitan can be considered as a pluricentric language. The standardisation process began with the publication of Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians, grammar of the languedocien dialect, by Louis Alibert (1935), followed by the Dictionnaire occitan-français <b>selon</b> les parlers languedociens (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of Pierre Bec (Gascon), Robèrt Lafont (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet. It is mostly supported by users of the classical norm. Due to the strong situation of diglossia, some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive Occitan as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.|$|E
25|$|Born in Montbrison in the Loire {{department}} of France, {{the son of}} an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as Music Director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing {{an important role in the}} development of integral serialism and controlled chance music. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as Le Marteau sans maître, Pli <b>selon</b> pli and Répons. His commitment to the modernist project and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist, a reputation which softened in later years.|$|E
25|$|Between 1966 and 1989 he {{recorded}} for Columbia Records (later Sony Classical). Among the first projects were the Paris Wozzeck (with Walter Berry) and the Covent Garden Pelléas et Mélisande (with George Shirley and Elisabeth Söderström). He made a highly praised recording of Le Sacre du printemps with the Cleveland Orchestra {{and a number}} of recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, including rarities such as Berlioz's Lélio and the first complete recording of Mahler's Das klagende Lied. The LSO also contributed to the Webern edition which Boulez supervised, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. When he took up his posts with the New York Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras, and later the Ensemble Intercontemporain, he made most of his recordings with them. A particular focus of the Columbia years was a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg, including Gurrelieder, Moses und Aron, Erwartung and Pierrot lunaire, but also less well-known works such as Die Jakobsleiter and the unaccompanied choral music. As for Boulez's own music, there were two further recordings of Le Marteau sans maître (with Yvonne Minton in 1972 and Elisabeth Laurence in 1985), a first recording of Pli <b>selon</b> pli (with Halina Łukomska as soprano soloist) and recordings of Rituel and Éclat/Multiples. In 2014 Sony Classical issued Pierre Boulez—The Complete Columbia Album Collection on 67 CDs.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decades}} after the war many of Cardus's earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry's death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as [...] "A great Englishman, {{measured}} by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation". In 1959, still in harness, Newman {{died at the age}} of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a Companion of Honour (CH), or even to the Order of Merit. Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend's powers, though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham's 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: [...] "He led us out of the Teutonic captivity. He showed us other and more sensitive worlds". After Beecham's death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau; in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers. Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing Pierre Boulez's Pli <b>selon</b> pli after a performance in 1965, he said he [...] "could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music".|$|E

When one of the reciters says [...] "I have a present for you", the orchestra follows immediately with the introductory chord from Don, the first movement from Pli <b>selon</b> pli by Pierre Boulez.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the text}} of his next major work, Pli <b>selon</b> pli (1957–89), Boulez turned to the symbolist poetry of Stephane Mallarmé, {{attracted}} by its extreme density and radical syntax. At seventy minutes, it is his longest composition. Three Improvisations—of increasing complexity—on individual sonnets are framed by two orchestral movements, into which fragments of other poems are embedded. For Griffiths these outer movements, Don and Tombeau, [...] "represent... the birth and death of the poet, but they stand too for the birth and death {{of the work of}} art". Boulez’s word-setting, which in the first Improvisation is straightforwardly syllabic, becomes ever more melismatic, to the point where direct comprehension is impossible. Boulez’s stated aim was to make the sonnets become the music at a deeper, structural level. The piece is scored for soprano and large orchestra, often deployed in chamber groups. Boulez described its sound-world, rich in percussion, as [...] "not so much frozen as extraordinarily 'vitrified. The work had a complex genesis, reaching its definitive form in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|In 1555 or 1556, Le Testu {{published}} a world atlas entitled Cosmographie Universelle <b>selon</b> les Navigateurs, tant anciens que modernes and was consequently awarded {{the title of}} Pilote Royale by Henry II. The Cosmographie Universelle contained 56 maps reportedly based on charts Le Testu had personally drawn by hand on his expeditions. This atlas was dedicated to his mentor and patron Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, who had become leader of the Huguenots three years earlier. The manuscript was based on charts from French, Spanish and Portuguese sources supplied by Coligny. Included in this atlas were twelve charts of Jave le Grand/Terra Australis, which Le Testu located southward of the Moluccas. Le Testu commented: [...] "However, what I have marked and depicted is only by imagination, and I have not noted or remarked {{on any of the}} commodities or incommodities of the place, nor its mountains, rivers or other things; for there has never yet been any man who has made a certain discovery of it." [...] Coligny subsequently supported a proposal from the d'Albagno brothers, for an expedition to Terra Australis to investigate the possibility of a French colony there.|$|E
2500|$|From 1991 onwards Boulez {{recorded}} {{under an}} exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon. It centred on the orchestras of Chicago and Cleveland in the United States and Vienna and Berlin in Europe. He re-recorded {{much of his}} core repertoire—the orchestral music of Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky and Bartók—and oversaw a second Webern edition, extending this time to the unpublished works. His own late music featured prominently, including Répons, ...explosante-fixe... and sur Incises. There was a fifth recording of Le Marteau sans maître (with Hilary Summers in 2002) {{and a third of}} Pli <b>selon</b> pli (with Christine Schäfer) in its definitive version, incorporating revisions made in the late 1980s. Composers new to his discography included Richard Strauss, Szymanowski and Anton Bruckner—his recording of the Eighth Symphony met with particular acclaim. The most significant addition to his recorded repertoire was the multi-orchestra cycle of the Mahler symphonies and vocal works with orchestra. It began with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in a 1994 studio recording of the Sixth Symphony and ended with the same orchestra in a live recording from the 2011 Salzburg Festival of Das klagende Lied (this time omitting Waldmärchen). Coupled with Berg's Lulu-Suite, it was his final recording.|$|E
2500|$|Baltens {{published}} {{a number of}} dynastic genealogies. [...] In 1575 he published the Brabantiae Ducum imagines, a series of 11 prints depicting the Dukes of Brabant as Heads of the Order of the Golden Fleece, starting from the order’s founder, Philip the Good, to the then current head of the Order, Philip II of Spain. Around 1580 Baltens {{published a}}n illustrated book in Antwerp under the title: Les généalogies et anciennes descentes des forestiers et comtes de Flandre, avec brièves descriptions de leurs vies et gestes le tout recueilly des plus véritables, approvées croniques et annales qui se trouvent, par Corneille Martin Zélandoys. et ornées de portraicts figures et habitz <b>selon</b> les façons et guises de leurs temps, ainsi qu’elles ont esté trouvées ès plus anciens tableaux, par Pierre Balthasar, et par lui-mesme mises en lumière (The genealogies of the Foresters and Counts of Flanders, with {{a brief description of}} their lives and deeds, as they have been found in the most genuine and approved chronicles and annals by Corneille Martin from Zeeland; and decorated with portraits, figures and dresses according to the fashion of the time, as they have been found in the oldest paintings and highlighted by Pierre Balthazar). The book contained prints of the 33 counts and countesses of Flanders including their mythical ancestors, the so-called 'forestiers'. The picture of each of these persons {{can be found on the}} recto of each folio, while the facing verso page offers a brief account of the person’s life. [...] The text was written by Corneille Martin. Peeter Baltens drew and engraved the plates, had the book printed and sold it in his publishing house.|$|E
