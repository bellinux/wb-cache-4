5|$|August 9, 1970 was a Sunday, and Flight 502 was {{originally}} scheduled to depart Cuzco at 8:30 am, but <b>since</b> <b>many</b> {{of the members}} of the American group wanted to visit the nearby Pisac native handicraft market prior to leaving for Lima, the airline postponed the departure time to 2:45 pm.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{the top end}} of a clarinet's {{range is}} difficult, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> {{advanced}} players can produce notes well above the highest notes commonly found in method books. G6 is usually the highest note clarinetists encounter in classical repertoire. The C above that (C7 i.e. resting on the fifth ledger line above the treble staff) is attainable by advanced players and is shown on many fingering charts, and fingerings as high as A7 exist.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{can live}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{substrates}} and uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate, and carbon dioxide. <b>Since</b> <b>many</b> pathways in mixed-acid fermentation produce hydrogen gas, these pathways require the levels of hydrogen to be low, as is the case when E. coli lives together with hydrogen-consuming organisms, such as methanogens or sulphate-reducing bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of the {{original}} parking facilities is also necessary to meet demand at many stations, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> started with small lots suitable {{for just a few}} dozen cars. The rebuilt stations at Branford, Guilford, Madison, Clinton, and Westbrook have larger lots than the 1990 stations, and a second lot with 272 spaces opened at Branford in June 2011. A 585-space, three-level parking garage is eventually planned for Madison station.|$|E
5|$|In {{many other}} neighborhoods, the City had renewed and thus gentrified areas without public hearings, because {{residents}} of those neighborhoods were low-income renters. In Milwaukee Avenue's case, however, the residents were of medium income, and seasoned protesters, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> had protested the Vietnam War. By 1970, the City of Minneapolis planned to raze the Milwaukee Avenue houses using {{funds from the}} Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. <b>Since</b> <b>many</b> complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
5|$|LTP was {{discovered}} in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research <b>since.</b> <b>Many</b> modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E
5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. <b>Since</b> <b>many</b> antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>many</b> {{substrates}} are not stable to sodium hydride, several {{procedures have}} been developed using milder bases. Masamune and Roush have developed mild conditions using lithium chloride and DBU. Rathke extended this to lithium or magnesium halides with triethylamine. Several other bases have been found effective.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>many</b> tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. Another potential risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E

5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, {{a member of the}} ACLU.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} known living ctenophore species is uncertain, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> of those named and {{formally}} described {{have turned out}} to be identical to species known under other scientific names. Claudia Mills estimates that there about 100 to 150 valid species that are not duplicates, and that at least another 25, mostly deep-sea forms, have been recognized as distinct but not yet analyzed in enough detail to support a formal description and naming.|$|E

5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though <b>since</b> <b>many</b> of the competitors lasted for {{only one or two}} issues, Venture {{can be thought of as}} at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone were not enough to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the later}} Disney feature films had animators being {{responsible}} for single characters, in The Jungle Book the animators {{were in charge of}} whole sequences, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> have characters interacting with one another.
