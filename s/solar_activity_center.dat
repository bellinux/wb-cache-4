40|$|In {{this last}} Paper III {{additional}} evidences that the solar high energetic particles radiation with energies higher as 100 MeV (the {{solar cosmic rays}} SCR) is an very important component for the "Sun- climate" relationship are given (see also Paper I and II). The total solar irradiance (TSI) and the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) variations given an integral climate effect of cooling in sunspot minima and warming in the sunspot maxima. Unlike the both ones the powerful solar corpuscular events plays a cooling climate role during the epochs of their heigh levels. By this one subcenturial global and regional temperature quasi- cyclic changes by duration of approximately 60 years could be track during the last 150 years of instrumental climate observations. It has been also evided {{in the paper that}} this subcenturial oscilation is very important in the Group sunspot number (GSN) data series since the Maunder minimum up to the end of 20 th century. Thus the <b>solar</b> erruptive <b>activity</b> effect make the total "Sun -climate" relationship essentially more complicated as it could be follow when only the TSI and GCR variations are taken into account. In this light the climate warming tendency after AD 1975 is rather by a natural as by an antropogenic origin. Most probably the last one is very close related to the general downward tendency of erruptive solar events which is superimposed over the high long term TSI levels during the last three decades (AD 1975 - 2007). It is evided, that the efficiency of the solar corpuscular activuty over the climate is strongly depended by the "north-south" asymmetry of the <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centers</b> (as a proxy the sunspots area north-south asymmetry index A is used there). The climate cooling effect in the Northern hemisphere is most powerful during the epochs of positive values of A. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

It is quite possible that this condition is satisfied not in the average but rigorously for each CME. The streamer observed on the limb does not disrupt if the CME in transit either only slightly overlaps with the streamer or lies at all outside it.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Solar</b> <b>activity,</b> {{together}} with human activity, {{is considered a}} possible factor for the global warming observed in the last century. However, in the last decades <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> has remained more or less constant while surface air temperature has continued to increase, which is interpreted as an evidence that in this period human activity is the main factor for global warming. We show that the index commonly used for quantifying long-term changes in <b>solar</b> <b>activity,</b> the sunspot number, accounts for {{only one part of}} <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> and using this index leads to the underestimation of the role of <b>solar</b> <b>activity</b> in the global warming in the recent decades.
