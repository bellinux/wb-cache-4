3000|$|A {{wide-band}} <b>sonic</b> <b>detector</b> {{was used}} for ultrasonic testing. The excitation transducer used a 50 -kHz excitation probe. The emission voltage, transmission gain, number of sampling points, and sampling interval were set to 250  V, 36  dB, 2000, and 1  s, respectively. In addition, to reduce the air space between the emission probe (or the receiving probe) and the outer walls of the grottoes and to increase the detection sensitivity, normal glue {{was chosen as the}} coupling agent. The normal glue is boiled from wheat flour and water at a 1 : 6 ration under 353  K, which is availability, suitability for direct use, and quasi-flow structure. Normal glue does not penetrate easily into stones, it does not cause secondary pollution, and it is easy to clean. Considering the unevenness of the testing regions, uneven coating of the coupling agent and variation in the placement of transducers during field ultrasonic, there may be some errors in the test results. Outliers in the original ultrasonic wave time (t) data are eliminated before the data analysis using Grubbs’ test. By looking up Grubbs’ tables, we are able to obtain values of G (n 0) for use in excluding outliers [for which G is greater than G (n 0)]. And G is defined as follows: [...]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) {{is related}} to {{identifying}} the presence of those defects, imperfections and discontinuities in the finished product which impair the performance level. Many defects are also generated during service. The nature of this defects differ according to the design, processing, fabrication and service conditions under which the components have to work. Knowledge of these defects {{with a view to}} detect and evaluate them and then minimizing them in the product is essential to achieve improve or acceptable level of quality. Improvements in the product quality increase its reliability and in turn the safety of the machines and equipment, thus bringing economic returns to the user. There is therefore a need to know the methods by which the defects in the products can be examined without affecting their performance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 Young's modulus, {{often called}} the modulus of elasticity, gives {{a measure of the}} {{stiffness}} of a material to an imposed load. The modulus of a wooden beam is most often obtained by destructive tests which destroy the specimen. If a practical method can be found to measure Young's modulus non-destructively, several advantages can be realized: First, any number of specimens can be thoroughly tested and accepted or rejected according to the results of the measurement. Second, a single beam can be tested repeatedly. Finally, a wooden beam already in use can be measured. A background on the measurement of Young's modulus of wooden beams is presented. The standard destructive test is described as are several non-destructive techniques employing acoustics. Examples of non-destructive tests at sonic and ultrasonic frequencies are given. From this background a non-destructive method of testing which makes use of the reactions of a wooden beam when excited at its natural resonant frequency is selected for further study. The mathematical background necessary to interpret the results and to relate them to Young's modulus is developed. Test equipment is set up to determine the practicality of this method. Since this non-destructive method seems feasible, a <b>sonic</b> generator and <b>detector</b> is designed and constructed as a single unit. It is built with the qualifications that it be rugged, compact, easy to operate, and relatively inexpensive. The design calls for a variable frequency oscillator, a ten watt amplifier, excitation and detection transducers, a detection amplifier, and a display meter. The design of the equipment is discussed in detail, and the reliability and accuracy of the apparatus {{over an extended period of}} time are predicted. Methods of operation of the <b>sonic</b> generator and <b>detector</b> are discussed, and the results of a short series of measurements made with the equipment are presented...|$|R
