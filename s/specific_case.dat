His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> studies.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} found that a law which only applied to a <b>specific</b> <b>case,</b> {{identified}} by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate {{the separation of powers}} in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset of the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. §8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that §8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of §8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75billion in cash.|$|E
