He {{frequently}} called Jennifer his [...] "best production". He said of fatherhood: [...] "My life changed the day Jennifer was born. I've come {{to think that the}} reason we're put on this earth is to procreate. To leave <b>something</b> <b>behind.</b> Not films, because you know that I don't think my films will last very long once I'm gone. But another human being. That's what's important." [...] Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968. On March 12 that month he was involved in a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine. Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising.|$|E

500|$|... "Baby Don't Lie" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Ryan Tedder, Benny Blanco, and Noel Zancanella, with Tedder and Blanco also serving as the song's producers. It is a midtempo electropop and reggae-pop song which begins with Stefani announcing, [...] "Uh huh, here we go," [...] to a rubbery bass line and hand claps. The song also has a hip hop-inflected breakdown, in which Stefani raps, [...] "You can tell me what you're hidin' boy/And {{you can tell me}} if I'm gettin' warm". Lyrically, the song {{discusses}} insecurities in a relationship, where Stefani questions her man's love. Nolan Feeney of Time complimented that the song is [...] "about falling in love with someone who's got a few skeletons in their closet." [...] As noted by Spins Brennan Carley, [...] "Stefani sounds shattered as she sings, [...] "But there's <b>something</b> <b>behind</b> those eyes / Those eyes / That you can't that you can't disguise / Disguise." [...] In the [...] "stomping, infuriatingly catchy" [...] chorus she sings, [...] "Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie…/I don't want to cry no longer." [...] Melodically, [...] "Baby don't Lie" [...] is written in the key of B♭ minor, performed in a common time moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute and follows the sequence B♭m - G♭ - D♭ as its chord progression. Stefani's voice spans two octaves from the lowest note A♭3 to the highest note A♭5.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading the}} veiled accusations made {{against him in}} the Public Ledger, Kent {{determined}} to clear his name, and accompanied by a witness went to see John Moore. [...] The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had drawn up for the ghost to answer. [...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was <b>something</b> <b>behind</b> darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E

Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that [...] "similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years".|$|E

The judge rejected the motion and dismissed the 43 charges with prejudice, which permanently bars {{the revival of}} the charges. Wecht's defense counsel argued that his prosecution was politically motivated. The initial indictment was announced in early 2006, before the November 2006 elections. During the trial, the judge barred the defense from arguing that the case was politically motivated. Although discussions about possible political motivations were not allowed during the trial, the jury foreman told reporters after the trial that some jurors began to see {{the prosecution}} as [...] "political"."I don't know if politically motivated or not, but {{it seemed to me that}} the motivations were certainly less than pure.

2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has <b>something</b> <b>behind</b> the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her expression.

[...] In the words of a recent biographer, Gordon Bowker, [...] "the people that had effaced that reality, the Soviet Communists, now had an implacable enemy they would come to regret having made." [...] Christopher Hitchens: [...] "The narrative core of Homage to Catalonia, it might be argued, is a series of events that occurred in and around the Barcelona telephone exchange in early May 1937. Orwell was a witness to these events, by the relative accident of his having signed up with the militia of the anti-Stalinist POUM upon arriving in Spain ... he became convinced that he had been the spectator of a full-blown Stalinist putsch ... Moreover, he came to understand that much of the talk about discipline and unity was a rhetorical shield for the covert Stalinization of the Spanish Republic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, however, a few critics {{were willing to}} {{consider}} Marston as a writer who {{was very much in}} control of the world he creates. T. S. Eliot saw that this [...] "irregular demesne" [...] was a part of Marston's world and declared that [...] "It is … by giving us the sense of <b>something</b> <b>behind,</b> more real than any of the personages and their action, that Marston establishes himself among the writers of genius". [...] Marston's tragic style is Senecan and although his characters may appear, on Eliot's own admission, [...] "lifeless", they are instead used as types to convey their [...] "theoretical implications". Eliot in particular admired Sophonisba and saw how Marston's plays, with their apparently stylised characters and bitter portrayal of a world where virtue and honour only arouse [...] "dangerous envy" [...] (Sophonisba; Act 1, scene 1, line 45) in those around them, actually bring to life [...] "a pattern behind the pattern into which the characters deliberately involve themselves: the kind of pattern which we perceive in our own lives only at rare moments of inattention and detachment".|$|E
