The fragrance range, consisting of scents for both for men and women, is sold through Macy's department stores in microphone-shaped bottles. Speaking at its launch, Levine said: [...] "The task was to make something that I would wear. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a process and we finally came to a great conclusion and it smells great" [...] The fragrance garnered media attention for contradicting his tweet the previous year, {{in which he said}} that he wanted to [...] "put an official ban on celebrity fragrances.

[...] "They rang to ask about my availability", Jackman explained in an April 2003 interview, [...] "probably about 20 other actors as well. I wasn't available, unfortunately. <b>So,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a bummer." [...] "We needed somebody who {{has a bit of}} rock and roll sensibility in him", Andrew Lloyd Webber explained. [...] "He's got to be a bit rough, a bit dangerous; not a conventional singer. Christine is attracted to the Phantom because he's the right side of danger." [...] Director Joel Schumacher had been impressed with Gerard Butler's performance in Dracula 2000.

500|$|Actor John Noble {{called the}} {{beginning}} scene with Olivia and Walter naked [...] "the funniest thing" [...] yet, explaining [...] "The writers keep throwing challenges at me, because I never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s {{staying at the}} Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except {{for a pair of}} slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E

I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my experience." ...|$|E

Joseph Mawle, who was previously cast to play Benjen Stark and was featured in three episodes in the show's first season before disappearing (as he does in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that the show is based on). In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bryan Cogman spoke of the re-introduction of Benjen and Mawle to the show saying [...] "It was great to have Joe Mawle back with us – {{it must have been a}} trip for him to step back into the character after so long – but he's also decidedly not the Benjen of season 1. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fun to explore." [...] Mawle had been interviewed in 2013, where he expressed his desire to return to the series.|$|E
500|$|Till {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with Conference Premier club York City on 29 June 2010 and following the move he said [...] "I spoke {{to a number of}} clubs but this felt right. The gaffer made me feel really wanted <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a key decision in coming". He made his debut in the opening game of the 2010–11 season as a 38th-minute substitute for Levi Mackin in a 2–1 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers on 14 August 2010. His first goal for York came in his next appearance after he scored the equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Bath City on 21 August 2010 after entering the game as a 74th-minute substitute. Till made his first start in a 3–0 victory against Altrincham on 28 August 2010 and he was substituted in the 82nd minute. He scored his first home goal with the opener as York beat Rushden & Diamonds 2–0 on 4 September 2010. He finished the season with 45 appearances and four goals.|$|E
500|$|On Slant Magazines [...] "Best of the Aughts" [...] list, {{the album}} was placed at numbersix out of one-hundred.

There are some sadder moments that I think has made it resonate and made it last. It does sound like a 23 year old kid in his bedroom making a record to me, but you can hear that innocence and joy in the discovery of finding all those sounds. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> kind of infectious for people." [...] In October 2010, it was listed at No.10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. Philip Sherburne, writing for Rhapsody, said that [...] "along with DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, {{this is one of}} plunderphonic music's greatest LPs."

500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample is so good.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 Grant {{published}} {{an article in the}} New Statesman entitled [...] "The Bugger, Bugged" [...] about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, a former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (née Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: [...] "Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my submission to parliament – that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{ends with}} [...] "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where {{something}} [...] "doesn't have to happen... every three seconds." [...] He said, [...] "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It {{has become a}} song with space." [...] The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it {{was chosen as the}} closing track because [...] "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast {{and not being able to}} keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the only resolution there could be: to slow down." [...] The [...] "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" [...] draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.|$|E

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The stage used {{multimedia}} projection {{and technology}} conceived by Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil. After Madonna's entrance, {{the ground and}} stage floor revealed animated Vogue magazine covers featuring the singer. The effect was achieved by projection mapping, which turns an object (often irregularly-shaped) into a surface for video projection. Although projection mapping {{had been used to}} introduce the Nokia Lumia and project images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011, it had never been used on such a large scale. Moment Factory partner and executive producer Eric Fournier said that since the studio had been associated with technology-dependent shows, preparing for and accommodating the requirements of the Super Bowl were easy. When Moment Factory began the halftime-show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs, and the studio developed visual effects complementing the songs' choreography. According to Moment Factory creative director Sakchin Bessette, using video projections was the most efficient method for the visual effects, as this required moving less equipment to the field than other methods. Fournier said, [...] "It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, and she wanted to do something extraordinary, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the objective of everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E
500|$|Another {{challenge}} that the studio {{had to face}} was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality. According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle, [...] "'s not really a fluid. It’s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It can be compressed into snowballs. All of these different effects {{are very difficult to}} capture simultaneously." [...] In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (the material point method) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key sequences. Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as [...] "an important character in the film," [...] therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers. [...] "When you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> an important property we took advantage of," [...] explained Selle. [...] "There you see [...] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see [...] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already– you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up." [...] The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.|$|E
