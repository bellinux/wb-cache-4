40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the cutting performance of a <b>spindle</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> the machine tool, the finite element (FE) model of spindles is required to be coupled with machine tool. However, the unknown joint dynamics (e. g., bolts) between the spindle and machine tool column limit {{the accuracy of the}} model. In this paper, an FE model updating method is proposed based on the identification of joint dynamics in both translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The receptance coupling (RC) technique is enhanced to estimate frequency response functions (FRFs) corresponding to rotational DOFs. The joint stiffness is identified through the iteration process by minimizing the difference between the simulated FRF and the measured FRF of the assembly. The proposed method is verified with a machine-tool spindle system. The good agreement between simulation and experiment shows the effectiveness of the method...|$|R

Plots cleaned by machine had a larger number of birch or aspen sprouts, than plots cleaned by brush saw. Mean height of stumps was significantly greater on plots cleaned by machine. Stumps cleaned by machine under snow conditions were 30 - 70 cm high. There were no significant differences in the number of sprouts or in the height of sprouts, between high and low stumps. Cleaning by machine damaged 7 - 13 per cent of conifers classified as main stems, as compared to no damage caused by brush saw cleaning.

40|$|The defect of wear <b>in</b> <b>journal</b> {{bearings}} appears usually after long-time {{operation of}} rotating {{systems and the}} main symptom is the decrease in the bearing load carrying capacity. Wear in aligned or misaligned pattern can result in higher eccentricities of whirling and changes the properties of stiffness and damping of the fluid film. In this work the operation of worn journal bearings is investigated by incorporating a radial active magnetic bearing (AMB) on the same shaft which acts as a collocated sensor/actuator unit. This combination offers a possibility to identify and observe the characteristic symptoms that the wear provokes under external excitation and without disturbance from the nominal operation conditions of the system. Under specific electromagnetic excitation the harmonic components that are introduced due to wear are detected. A simple rotor <b>mounted</b> <b>in</b> two worn <b>journal</b> bearings is used and the response at steady operational speed and at transient electromagnetic external excitation with linearly varying frequency (chirp) is analyzed in the time and frequency domains. The occurrence of additional sub- and super-harmonic components is observed when the external frequency lies {{in the region of}} the first natural frequency of the operating system. The time-frequency analysis discloses the onset of additional frequency components, especially in the sub-harmonic domain. This offers a distinct detection of wear if wear depth becomes higher than 20 % of the radial clearance. An experimental test rig is outlined for future studies in order to benchmark the observations from the present numerical calculations...|$|R

40|$|In 1976, Paolo Cerretelli {{published}} an article entitled "Limiting factors to oxygen transport on <b>Mount</b> Everest" <b>in</b> the <b>Journal</b> of Applied Physiology. The paper demonstrated the role of cardiovascular oxygen transport in limiting maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max). In agreement with the predominant view of VO 2 max limitation at that time, however, its results were taken to mean that cardiovascular oxygen transport does not limit VO 2 max at altitude. So it was argued that the limiting factor {{could be in the}} periphery, and muscle blood flow was proposed as a possible candidate. Despite this suggestion, the conclusion generated a series of papers on muscle structural characteristics. These experiments demonstrated a loss of muscle oxidative capacity in chronic hypoxia, and thus provided an unambiguous refutation of the then widespread hypothesis that an increased muscle oxidative capacity is needed at altitude to compensate for the lack of oxygen. This analysis is followed by a short account of Cerretelli's more recent work, with a special attention to the subject of the so-called "lactate paradox"...|$|R
