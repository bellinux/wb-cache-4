5|$|Subjects may be {{instructed}} not {{to judge}} {{whether or not the}} <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the proposition expressed by the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.|$|E
5|$|In its 332nd article, {{the current}} penal code punishes infractions with a prison {{sentence}} {{of up to}} two years. If the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> shorter than 240days, there is a formula for converting it into a fine. If the offense is directed towards regional symbols, the penalties are halved.|$|E
5|$|Non-aggravated {{offences}} involving damage {{valued at}} less than £5,000 are triable only summarily by magistrates and the maximum <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> three months' imprisonment and a fine of £2,500. If {{the value of the}} property damaged exceeds £5,000, the defendant is entitled to claim trial on indictment by a jury, but if tried summarily, may be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a £5,000 fine. Where the value of the property is unclear, the court may hear representations as to value, but may also offer the defendant the option of summary trial, with limited penalties.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{word order}} for {{transitive}} <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> subject-object-verb language. Intransitive <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> subject-verb. ditransitive <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> subject-dative-object-verb.|$|R

5|$|Shawn Adolf was {{retained}} in prison on a $1 million bond for several outstanding warrants involving drug charges. He was initially charged with {{possession of a}} firearm by a prohibited person, possession of body armor by a violent felon and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. On November 6, 2009, Adolf pleaded guilty to the firearm possession charge, {{and the other two}} charges were dropped. On February 5, 2010, Adolf was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison over the weapons charges; that <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> concurrent with Adolf's subsequent sentence on March 15 to 10 years in Colorado state prison on unrelated robbery charges.|$|E
5|$|The Sharia {{courts have}} general {{jurisdiction}} over most {{civil and criminal}} cases. At present, {{there are two types}} of courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases. Cases are adjudicated by single judges, except criminal cases if the potential <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> death, amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges. There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters. Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with Sharia.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
50|$|Informally, a {{soundness}} theorem for a deductive system expresses {{that all}} provable <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> true. Completeness states that all true <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> provable.|$|R
30|$|We {{used the}} same 15 English <b>sentences</b> as <b>were</b> used in the first experiment. Every <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> {{additionally}} synthesized using the (RES) strategy. Each subject was shown a subset containing 20 samples: 4 different sentences, each synthesized using the 5 different strategies from Table 1. While distributing the 15 sample sentences among the participants, each <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> used {{as many times as}} possible. The order in which the samples of a given <b>sentence</b> <b>were</b> shown was randomized.|$|R
50|$|In Rastatt 19 death <b>{{sentence}}s</b> <b>were</b> pronounced. Otto von Corvin, who {{had also}} been given the death <b>sentence,</b> <b>was</b> reprieved and his sentence commuted to imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5|$|Salim {{rebels and}} amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is {{sentence}}d to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> carried out, she begs {{to have a few}} hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we chose}} speech data of 400 {{sentences}} {{from a single}} female speaker for training HMMSS. In the VC stage, all 400 <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> used for training and 15 <b>sentences</b> that <b>are</b> part of these 400 <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> used for testing.|$|R
50|$|The {{verdicts}} and <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> pronounced {{together with}} all defendants present.

50|$|<b>Sentence</b> <b>was</b> {{passed on}} 7 July 1947. The state {{prosecution}} had sought {{the death sentence}} in eleven cases, but only four <b>were</b> passed. The <b>sentences</b> on the nursing sisters were generally more lenient than had been asked for. The death <b>sentences</b> <b>were</b> carried out in March 1948 in Dresden.

50|$|According to Global Security Al-Ahdal {{was born}} in 1971, and {{received}} a three-year sentence.The Prosecution appealed, because they thought the original <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> too lenient.However, the original <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> upheld.|$|R
50|$|From the {{previous}} lemma, {{the set of}} finitely satisfiable <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> recursively enumerable. Assume that the set of all finitely valid <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> recursively enumerable. Since ¬φ is finitely valid iff φ is not finitely satisfiable, we conclude that the set of <b>sentences</b> which <b>are</b> not finitely satisfiable is recursively enumerable. If both a set A and its complement are recursively enumerable, then A is recursive. It follows that the set of finitely satisfiable <b>sentences</b> <b>is</b> recursive, which contradicts Trakhtenbrot's theorem.|$|R

25|$|In {{his study}} of grammaticality in the 1950s, Chomsky {{identified}} three criteria which cannot {{be used to determine}} whether or not a <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> grammatical.|$|E
25|$|The subject pronominals are all {{incorporated}} into the verb. Thus when the subject is represented as a pronominal, the subject position of the <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> empty.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a special}} grammar {{phenomena}} in Liangshan Yi such that grammartical relations can be changed through tone change. When personal pronouns combine with verbs, from the view of personal pronouns, the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in SV pattern if personal pronouns are mid-level tones, while the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in OV pattern when personal pronouns are sub-high tones. From the view of verbs, the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in SV pattern if verbs are low-falling tones while the <b>sentences</b> <b>are</b> in OV pattern when verbs are sub-high tones. This paper discusses how case relations can be marked with grammatical tone in the Yi language...|$|R
50|$|Currently, it is {{estimated}} that there are about 5 individuals on death row in Brunei. The last known death <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> handed out in 2015, and one death <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> commuted in 2009.|$|R
50|$|A jury convicted {{a husband}} and wife of larceny. The husband's <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> {{restitution}} and a fine of $50; the wife's <b>sentence</b> <b>was</b> suspended. The couple appealed their convictions to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.|$|R
25|$|Conversely, any {{dependence}} logic <b>sentence</b> <b>is</b> {{equivalent to}} some {{sentence in the}} logic of branching quantifiers, since all existential second-order sentences are expressible in branching quantifier logic.|$|E
