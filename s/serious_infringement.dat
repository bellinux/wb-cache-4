East Week's senior management did not approve of the action and offered an apology to Shum. Magistrate Colin Mackintosh determined that Yuyun's actions were premeditated and done for financial gain and that the <b>serious</b> <b>infringement</b> of the patient's privacy warranted a custodial sentence. On that occasion, Shum was discharged from the hospital in July 2007.|$|E

Résumé : La lutte contre la pêche INN (pour pêche illicite, non déclarée et non réglementée) est un sujet clé dans la gestion des pêches. Cette expression est généralement comprise comme correspondant à des infractions très graves mettant en danger les ressources halieutiques et est maintenant utilisée dans les instruments juridiques. Cependant, la juxtaposition des trois termes illégale, non déclarée, non réglementée est quelque peu étrange. Le but de cette contribution est d'abord de montrer comment cette expression a été forgée dans une organisation régionale de gestion des pêches (la CCAMLR), sans aucune signification juridique à l'origine. Dans un deuxième temps, il est décrit comment cette notion a évolué, y compris avec une définition figurant dans un plan d'action de la FAO et considérée comme généralement acceptée; cette définition a cependant une portée plus restreinte par rapport à l'utilisation initiale. Enfin, le troisième chapitre donne des exemples d'actions contre la pêche INN par les États, (l'Union européenne, au nom de ses États membres et les USA) ...|$|R

40|$|Swiss {{competition}} policy {{has traditionally been}} relatively lenient and low profile. The impact of {{competition policy}} on economic development has therefore been at best neutral. As the slow rate of growth becomes an issue, however, a more vigorous approach to competition {{has been identified as}} an important factor for improving growth prospects. The 2003 reform of the Cartel Act strengthened Swiss competition law, in particular by introducing direct sanctions for the most <b>serious</b> <b>infringements</b> and a leniency programme, thus bringing it closer to that of the European Union and of many other OECD countries. The Swiss Competition Commission has been given considerable new powers to combat private restraints of competition. Comco will have to enforce the new laws resolutely and step up action to promote regulatory reforms. In doing so, it is burdened by institutional arrangements and mechanisms that temper its full independence. The Swiss competition enforcers do not benefit from the networks of exchanges available to national competition authorities in EU member States. Matters are further complicated by a relative lack of resources. Strengthening competition is key for an effective internal market. The amendments to strengthen the Cartel Law and pending reform proposals signal determination {{on the part of the}} Confederation to tackle the problems.

40|$|Among the {{negative}} effects on Internet consumers, the divulgence of personal {{information to the public}} has been reported {{as one of the most}} <b>serious</b> <b>infringements</b> on consumer rights. Both consumers and sellers around the world have sought to come up with an optimal solution for information privacy. Several incompatible characteristics of regulating consumer privacy in e-commerce between the U. S. and Korea were explored, and curative suggestions were made to establish a new legal framework to protect online consumer privacy. First, Korea’s regulations for protecting online consumer privacy were found to be centrally controlled, while the U. S. authorities have encouraged self-regulation. Considering the long run efficiency of self-regulation, the Korean authorities should seek more self-regulatory measures and establish consensus among the businesses to voluntarily protect consumer online privacy. Second, U. S. regulations on protection of online consumer privacy are for the most part commercially oriented and controlled by the FTC, whereas in Korea, an administrative department, the Ministry of Information and Communication, regulates online consumer privacy as a primary authority, resulting in lack of specialization in the matters of consumer protection. To improve the efficiency and specialization in regulation of online consumer privacy in Korea, it would be necessary to promulgate a directive specially designed for protecting consumer privacy and delegating the regulatory power to the Korea Consumer Protection Agency established by the Consumer Protection Act. Finally, international arbitration is recommended as the best tool to resolve and prevent the intricacies of international litigation brought against violation of online consumer privacy...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a history}} of {{conflicting}} research on {{the reliability and validity}} of student evaluation of faculty (SEF) it has typically not been viewed as an infringement on academic freedom. When it is suggested that SEF may impinge on academic freedom, it is often considered an attack on either student rights, or on the process of evaluating faculty performance in general. Faculty and educational administrator views and surveys are reviewed as SEF is used in salary, promotion and tenure decisions. It is suggested that the literature shows that SEF infringe on instructional responsibilities of faculty by providing a control mechanism over curricular, course content, grading, and teaching methodology. It is further suggested that SEF play a significant role in current attacks on tenure, and that its role in a demographically diverse 21 st century educational system has changed from its benign historical origins.

The information from three companies, Beijing Superstar Electric Company, Beijing Founder APABI Technology Limited, and Beijing Sursen Electronic Technology Company Limited, showed that the B 2 B market has been developed due to the huge requirement from organization customers, universities libraries in particularly, and the B 2 C market is still immature. The information from interviews and relative data revealed that both Superstar and Sursen have <b>serious</b> copyright <b>infringement</b> which is an important problem impeding the further development of the eBook market. The questionnaire explored awareness, purchase, reading and other experiences of eBook end-users. Questions indicated that readers were attracted by the technical advantages including costless to copy, easy to transfer, searchable and easy to store, but did not want to pay for eBooks. Because the computers, especially desktop PCs, were the main device for reading and the CRT displays were massive used while there were few dedicated reading device in the market, many eBook end-users still preferred to read extended passages of text on papers rather than screens. Today the copyrights issue, user acceptance and the reading device are three significant obstacles for eBook industry in China. Comment: Lund University Master Degree thesis, 44 page...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interpretation of}} section 35 (5) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, which empowers the courts to exclude unconstitutionally obtained evidence in criminal trials. A generous and purposive interpretation {{should be at the}} heart of the admissibility assessment. This work explores the threshold requirements and the substantive phase of the interpretation of section 35 (5). Given that this provision is manifestly modelled on the terms contained in section 24 (2) of the Canadian Charter, the manner in which the courts of that country have grappled with the interpretation of section 24 (2) has been accorded particular importance. As a preliminary issue, the courts must consider whether the threshold requirements of section 35 (5) have been satisfied. It is concluded that the courts of South Africa have interpreted the threshold requirements of section 35 (5) in a broad manner, thereby making it less onerous to satisfy, compared to the threshold requirements contained in section 24 (2) The substantive phase of the admissibility assessment should consist of two legs that must be clearly separated from each other, for the reason that the assessment in each leg of the analysis serve to enhance different societal interests. The public interest in protecting the rights of the accused should be the central consideration during the first leg, while the societal interest in convicting the guilty should be contemplated during the second leg. The first leg of the analysis is concerned with the effect that admission of the evidence would have on the fairness of the trial. It is suggested that the trial fairness requirement should be determined by means of a conscription analysis. The prosecution may rely on the ‘discoverability’ doctrine or on the ‘independent source’ exception. The admission of evidence based on these exceptions would not render the trial unfair. Such an infringement would, accordingly, not add to the seriousness of the violation. Conversely, although admission would tend to render the trial unfair, the evidence should not ‘automatically’ be excluded. However, such an infringement should be regarded as a serious violation, since section 35 (5) was designed to prevent unfair trials. The second leg is focused on the effect that either the admission or exclusion of the evidence would have on the integrity of the criminal justice system. It is concluded that the ‘current mood’ of society should not be determinative of the admissibility assessment. The following overall admissibility framework is recommended: Despite the fact that admission would render the trial unfair, the courts should be allowed to consider police ‘good faith’ and other factors ordinarily considered during the second leg, in order to make an admissibility ruling. Differently put, a balancing exercise should be performed, in which the factors identified in the seminal case of Collins are considered and weighed at the end of the analysis. More importantly, the seriousness of the violation should be a significant factor in the overall admissibility assessment, since judicial condonation of <b>serious</b> <b>infringements</b> would generally impact negatively on the repute of the criminal justice system.
