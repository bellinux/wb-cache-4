5000|$|Swiss cheese {{features}} (SCFs) {{are curious}} pits {{in the south}} polar ice cap of Mars (Mare Australe quadrangle) named from their similarity to the holes in Swiss cheese. They were first seen in 2000 using Mars Orbiter Camera imagery. They are typically a few hundred meters across and 8 metres deep, with a flat base and steep sides. They tend to have similar bean-like shapes with a cusp pointing towards the south pole, indicating that insolation is involved in their formation. The angle of the Sun probably contributes to their roundness. Near the Martian summer solstice, the Sun can remain continuously just above the horizon; {{as a result the}} walls of a round depression will receive more intense sunlight, and sublimate much more rapidly than the floor. The walls sublimate and recede, while the floor remains the <b>same.As</b> the seasonal frost disappears, the pit walls appear to darken considerably relative to the surrounding terrain. The SCFs have been observed to grow in size, year by year, at an average rate of 1 to 3 meters, suggesting that they are formed in a thin layer (8m) of carbon dioxide ice lying on top of water ice. [...] Later research with HiRISE showed that the pits are in a 1-10 meter thick layer of dry ice that is sitting on a much larger water ice cap. Pits have been observed to begin with small areas along faint fractures. The circular pits have steep walls that work to focus sunlight, thereby increasing erosion. For a pit to develop, a steep wall of about 10 cm and a length of over 5 meters in necessary.|$|E
5000|$|A {{leader of}} the Pharisees during the 1st century BCE and by {{tradition}} vice-president of the great Sanhedrin of Jerusalem. He was of heathen descent (Bab. Yoma, 71b; [...] 'Eduy. v.6; Giṭ. 57b; Yer. M. Ḳ. iii.81b; see Weiss, Dor Dor we-Dorshaw, i.1, and Landau, p. 319). Despite this fact, Abtalion, {{as well as his}} colleague, Shemaiah, the president of the Sanhedrin, {{was one of the most}} influential and beloved men of his time. Once, when the high priest was being escorted home from the Temple by the people, at the close of a Day of Atonement, the Talmud (Yoma, 71b) relates that the crowd deserted him upon the approach of Abtalion and his colleague and followed them. Abtalion used his influence with the people in persuading the men of Jerusalem, in the year 37 BCE, to open the gates of their city to Herod the Great. The king was not ungrateful and rewarded Abtalion, or, as Josephus calls him, Pollion, with great honors (Josephus, Ant. xv.1, § 1). Although there is no doubt that, in this passage of Josephus, Abtalion is meant by this name Pollion (the original form of the name is presumably Ptollion, which explains both the prefixed A in the Talmud and the omission of the t in Josephus), in another place (Ant. xv.10, § 4), where this name recurs, it is doubtful whether Abtalion is intended or not. Josephus relates there how Herod exacted the oath of allegiance under penalty of death, and continues: [...] "He desired also to compel Pollion, the Pharisee, and <b>Sameas,</b> together with the many who followed them, to take this oath; they, however, refused to do this, but nevertheless were not punished as were others who had refused to take it, and this indeed out of consideration for Pollion." [...] Since this episode took place in the eighteenth year of Herod's reign (20 or 19 BCE), this Pollion can not have been Abtalion, who died long before, as we learn from authoritative Talmudic sources, according to which Hillel, the pupil and successor of Abtalion, was the {{leader of the}} Pharisees about 30 BCE. It is probable, therefore, that Josephus was misled by the similarity of the names Shemaiah and Shammai, and so wrote [...] "Pollion and Sameas" [...] instead of [...] "Hillel and Shammai." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Linked Data {{initiative}} {{promotes the}} publication of previously isolated databases as interlinked RDF datasets, thereby creating a global scale data space. Datasets are frequently interlinked using some automated matching process that results in a materialized <b>sameAs</b> linkset, that is, a set of links of the form (s, owl:sameAs, o), which asserts that s denotes the same resource as o. This paper proposes strategies to reduce the cognitive overhead of creating ma-terialized <b>sameAs</b> linksets and to correctly maintain them. The paper also out-lines an architecture to improve the support for materialized <b>sameAs</b> linksets...|$|E
40|$|In Linked Data, OWL: <b>sameAs</b> {{predicate}} is {{used for}} linking different datasets. However, there are reservations about its use {{and its role in}} linking data. In linking different datasets, OWL: <b>sameAs</b> can lead to violation of the strict identity semantics of this predicate, because it is symmetric and transitive, meaning that anyone can link their data with your dataset, from anywhere. Consequently, the growth of the <b>sameAs</b> network raises concerns as to how accurate different datasets will be in the future. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} more sophisticated applications and systems built upon different published datasets that verify and optimize the accuracy of the Linked Datasets. To achieve that goal, we purpose a method that provides a similarity-based numeric identification score, which reviews different constraints and measuring metrics, and verifies the accuracy of the use of <b>sameAs</b> in the selected datasets. The system utilizes different matching algorithms on datasets comprising of three features, URI data management, statistical data and similarity matching score. The functionalities developed in this system were compared with its closest equivalents. The results obtained from the system indicate that not all claimed subjects linked via OWL: <b>sameAs</b> across different entities are simila...|$|E

40|$|Linked Data {{is based}} on the idea that {{information}} from dif-ferent sources can flexibly be connected to enable novel ap-plications that individual datasets do not support on their own. This hinges upon the existence of links between datasets that would otherwise be isolated. The most notable form, <b>sameAs</b> links, are intended to express that two identifiers are equivalent in all respects. Unfortunately, many existing ones do not reflect such genuine identity. This study pro-vides a novel method to analyse this phenomenon, based on a thorough theoretical analysis, as well as a novel graph-based method to resolve such issues to some extent. Our experi-ments on a representative Web-scale set of <b>sameAs</b> links from the Web of Data show that our method can identify and remove hundreds of thousands of constraint violations. ...|$|E

40|$|Established in 2005, the South African Monitoring and Evaluation Association (<b>SAMEA)</b> {{is celebrating}} its tenth anniversary as a {{voluntary}} organisation for professional evaluation (VOPE). This VOPE occupies a special space in South African society as an independent and credible voice of monitoring and evaluation practitioners, drawing its membership from individuals working for government, academia, civil society, consultancies, donor agencies and private sector foundations, including students and the international community. As the biggest user of evaluations, government has become a natural partner for <b>SAMEA</b> since its first conferences organised {{in partnership with the}} Public Service Commission. The establishment of the Department of Performance (now Planning,) Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) in the Presidency of South Africa in 2010 created new impetus for the institutionalisation of evaluation in government through the establishment of the National Evaluation System (NES). In 2012, DPME entered into a formal partnership with <b>SAMEA</b> to enhance monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity and continuous professional development. Working with the PSC and the DPME as well as other key partners like universities and development agencies, the role of <b>SAMEA</b> has been enhanced via the establishment of provincial associations, direct input to the development of government policy, evaluation standards, competencies and training – and co-hosting of high-profile conferences and workshops. The partnership between <b>SAMEA</b> and the government of South Africa is extremely useful for ensuring evaluation capacity development and institutionalisation of the practice in government and society. There have been tensions, especially as government’s role in evaluation has strengthened. However, the significance of the partnership between <b>SAMEA</b> and the DPME has gained international interest and appreciation because of its structured nature, mutual respect, collaboration on capacity development and practical implementation of innovative projects. </p...|$|R

In this context, when a typed link is instantiated between two different resources referring to the same real world entity, the usage of owl:sameAs is generally predominant. However, recent research discussions within the Linked Data community have shown issues {{in the use of}} owl:sameAs. Problems arise both in cases in which <b>sameAs</b> is automatically discovered by a data linking tool erroneously, or when users declare it but meaning something less 'strict' than the semantics defined by OWL.

40|$|The Ontology Web Language (OWL) <b>sameAs</b> {{predicate}} {{states that}} if the predicate holds between two Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) A and B, then an object identified by A is the same object identified by B; its purpose is to enable machines to understand that both objects are the same although they may have distinct Web identifiers, i. e., URIs. The proliferation {{of the use of}} this predicate has brought several issues to the Web, e. g., high cost of manually creating <b>sameAs</b> statements, inconsistent use of the predicate leading to distinct objects to be identified as being a single object, and too many <b>sameAs</b> statements prevent efficient reasoning with objects. ^ The goal of this thesis is to mitigate the proliferation of statements based on the owl:sameAs predicate by avoiding its use for every single pair of object identifiers that may be represented in multiple Web sites. In other words, instead of creating the same object person in multiple Web sites, the object of type person will be created at only one Web site, which is called master server, and a materialized reference of this object will be automatically created to support the reuse of the object in many other Web sites, called receiver servers, maintaining the object the same URI used for the object in the master server. ^ To show the effectiveness of the approach, this thesis describes a use case developed {{in the context of the}} collaboration between the NSF-funded Cyber-ShARE Center of Excellence at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the TRUST Laboratory from the UTEP Computer Science Department.
