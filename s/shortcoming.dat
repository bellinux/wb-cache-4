5|$|Author Camilla Fojas later criticized Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon for its <b>shortcoming</b> as {{a promotional}} vehicle for Guam and its film industry, noting the colonialistic {{portrayal}} of Guam, {{especially in the}} parting scene where U.S. mainland-based characters bid farewell to Chamorro people in a cliché fashion.|$|E

5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A <b>shortcoming</b> {{of this approach is}} the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E

5|$|Benzoquinone is {{actually}} not a necessary component for this reaction; its {{role is to}} regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while {{at a much higher}} cost. Since the reaction typically employs near-stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some {{progress has been made in}} the development of catalytic variants. Despite this <b>shortcoming,</b> the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} liberalization pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus. Others have stressed that the main <b>shortcoming</b> of economic policy-making during the 1990s was that economic reform was not pursued with enough determination. A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E
5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical <b>shortcoming</b> that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup. Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.|$|E

Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his or her principal election agent shows that he or she acted in good faith {{and that there is a}} reasonable explanation for the <b>shortcoming</b> such as inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer. In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his or her principal election agent if he or she did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common <b>shortcoming</b> of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E

50|$|Blade element {{momentum}} (BEM) theory alone {{fails to}} represent accurately the true physics of real wind turbines. Two major <b>shortcomings</b> are {{the effects of}} a discrete number of blades and far field effects when the turbine is heavily loaded. Secondary <b>shortcomings</b> originate from having to deal with transient effects like dynamic stall, rotational effects like the Coriolis force and centrifugal pumping, and geometric effects that arise from coned and yawed rotors. The current state of the art in BEM uses corrections to deal with these major <b>shortcomings.</b> These corrections are discussed below. There is as yet no accepted treatment for the secondary <b>shortcomings.</b> These areas remain a highly active area of research in wind turbine aerodynamics.|$|R

40|$|Smart city {{criticism}} {{concentrates on}} conceptual and methodological ambiguity, corporate driven utopian visions, overlooking citizen and other stakeholder potential, ‘splintering urbanism’, {{and lack of}} long term vision for sustainable urban development adapted to local needs. Inspired by this critical discourse, this paper aims to present smart city planning and development <b>shortcomings</b> {{on the basis of}} applied experience and, further, use this experience to create a new theoretical construct about <b>shortcomings</b> to smart city planning and development. Nine individual smart city cases (Barcelona, Stockholm, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, PlanlT Valley, Cyberjaya, Masdar, Songdo International Business District, Konza) are explored on the basis of selected published material and in-depth case studies, highlighting the challenges and <b>shortcomings</b> that appeared during their development and implementation. Subsequently, the identified <b>shortcomings</b> are synthesized and assessed critically across contextual and strategic levels, uncovering underlying causal relationships. The findings are used to create a new theoretical construct, comprising two paths to <b>shortcomings</b> towards smart city planning and development...|$|R
