40|$|<b>Strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> {{production}} {{areas in}} Queensland are assessed {{for the presence}} of Pratylenchus vulnus (lesion nematode) and Meloidogyne hapla (root-knot nematode) as part of the approval process for sites used in runner production under the approved runner scheme. M. hapla is known to infest strawberry. The ability of three other Meloidogyne species occurring in Queensland to infest this host was investigated. The species M. arenaria, M. incognita and M. javanica, in addition to M. hapla, were able to reproduce on strawberry roots of the cultivar 'Joy', which sustained higher nematode reproduction rates than 'Jewel' and 'Sweet Charlie'. The ability of species other than M. hapla to infest strawberry needs to be recognised in site selection for runner production, and in screening cultivars for resistance to nematodes...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, ethanedinitrile (C 2 N 2, EDN) was {{examined}} {{as an alternative}} to the ozone-degrading fumigant, methyl bromide (MB), for soil disinfestation in the nursery production of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). In microplot studies, EDN killed buried inoculum of several soil-borne pathogens of strawberry (Pythium ultimum, Phytophthora cactorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia fragariae and Rhizoctonia solani) and reduced natural populations of plant-parasitic nematodes (Tylenchus and Helicotylenchus spp.) to levels equivalent to MB. EDN was most efficacious when it was injected at depth into soil (20 cm) and sealed with low-density polyethylene. In field trials, EDN reduced the emergence of weeds (Poa annua, Spregula arvensis, Agrostis tenuis and Raphanus raphanistrum) by 98 %, and increased <b>strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> yields by 135 %, which was equivalent to MB. Although trials are continuing, these preliminary results demonstrate a strong potential for EDN {{as an alternative to}} MB for strawberry production...|$|R

40|$|Until 2008 {{methyl bromide}} (MeBr) {{was used in}} The Netherlands for {{fumigation}} of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners,</b> intended as mother planting stock, to make them free of contamination by strawberry tarsonemid mites (Phytonemus pallidus). As an alternative of MeBr fumigation a 48 h CATT method was developed and scaled up by Wageningen UR {{in cooperation with the}} plant propagating association Plantum. This results in an excellent disinfection and a mortality of 99. 8 % of the strawberry tarsonemid mite. This method provides a healthy production of highly qualified <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> in the field. From 2009 CATT is up scaled to a commercial level and widely applied by Dutch nurseries. In 2011 this CATT method was successfully modified to eradicate also root knot nematodes Meloidogyne hapla (> 99. 7 % mortality), which was not effectively controlled by MeBr fumigation. For an effective killing of the root knot nematodes, temperature must be raised to 40 °C. In several experiments the optimum for a high mortality of both tarsonemids and nematodes was studied. This leads into an adapted CATT of 20 hours at a temperature of 35 °C and 50 % CO 2 followed by 20 hours at a temperature of 40 °C. In 2012 this adapted CATT was successfully upgraded and tested under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|A utilização de um sistema adequado para a condução das plantas-matrizes fornecedoras de mudas é de {{fundamental}} importância, tanto com a finalidade de favorecer a quantidade de mudas produzidas, como para a qualidade das mesmas; por outro lado, a disponibilidade de mudas em períodos não convencionais de plantio, através da utilização da frigoconservação, possibilita a produção de frutos na entressafra, propiciando maiores ganhos pelos produtores devido aos melhores preços alcançados. Os presentes trabalhos tiveram como objetivos comparar o sistema de produção de mudas de morangueiro convencional com o de produção em vasos suspensos, assim como avaliar a frigoconservação em mudas produzidas em sistema de vasos suspensos. Avaliaram-se a matéria seca, os teores de carboidratos nas mudas e a percentagem de sobrevivência das mesmas após o transplante para local definitivo. No primeiro trabalho, foi utilizado o delineamento inteiramente ao acaso, em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 (três cultivares: Campinas, Pelican e Guarani; e dois sistemas de produção de mudas), com três repetições de 30 mudas; no segundo trabalho, utilizou-se o delineamento experimental inteiramente ao acaso, com cinco cultivares (Campinas, Dover, Pelican, Sequoia e Sweet Charlie) e nove repetições. Neste último trabalho, após a coleta, as mudas foram acondicionadas em sacos de polietileno e frigoconservadas durante 120 dias em câmara fria (- 1 ± 1 ºC). As mudas produzidas em vasos suspensos apresentaram maior percentagem de sobrevivência e maiores teores de carboidratos totais, com resultados semelhantes para as três cultivares estudadas. A frigoconservação de mudas de morangueiro produzidas em sistema de vasos suspensos resultou em baixa percentagem de sobrevivência de mudas no experimento. An appropriate conduction {{system of}} the plants that originate the runners has a fundamental importance, in order to favor the amount of produced plants and their quality. On the other hand, {{through the use of}} the cold storage, the availability of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> in the off season periods, makes it possible to produce during the off-season period, so that producers can get better prices for the production. These experiments were conducted in order to compare the conventional strawberry runners' production system with the runner production system in suspended pots, and also to evaluate the cold storage of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> produced in suspended pots system. It was measured the dry matter and carbohydrates contents in runners and the survival percentage when the runner was transplanted to field production areas. The first experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with 3 x 2 factorial outline (three cultivars: Campinas, Pelican and Guarani; and two runners production systems) with three repetitions of thirty runners each; in the second experiment, it was used the experimental entirely random design, with five strawberry cultivars (Campinas, Dover, Pelican, Sequoia and Sweet Charlie) and nine replicates, in the final experiment. After the selection, the runners were conditioned in polyethylene bags and stored under low temperatures during 120 days (- 1 ± 1 ºC). The runners produced in the system of suspended pots showed higher amount of total carbohydrates and higher plant survival rate. The results were similar for the three cultivars. Cold storage of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> produced in the system of suspended pots resulted in lower percentage of seedlings survival...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera aphanis) {{and leaf}} blotch (caused by Gnomoniopsis fructicola) are {{important}} diseases of strawberry in nursery and fruit production regions of Australia. Myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin and penthiopyrad are registered {{for control of}} powdery mildew in Australia, but are not restricted to either nursery or fruit production. Due to the specific mode of action of these fungicides against P. aphanis, their repeated use over the successive stages of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> and then fruit production may {{increase the risk of}} fungicide resistance in the pathogen. Currently, there is no fungicide registered for control of G. fructicola in strawberry in Australia. A series of field trials in Queensland and Victorian strawberry nurseries over two seasons (2013 / 14 to 2014 / 15) evaluated the efficacy of 19 fungicide and biorational products, applied alone or as part of a program (in combination with other products), against powdery mildew and leaf blotch. Our aim was to manage the risk of fungicide resistance by developing disease control programs specifically for use in the <b>strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> nurseries with different activity groups to the fungicides used in strawberry fruit production. Treatments were applied weekly using a knapsack sprayer starting December/January for approximately 16 weeks until prior to harvest of runners in March/April. Runners were randomly selected and rated for the incidence of powdery mildew and leaf blotch prior to harvest. Where single fungicide treatments were applied (2013 / 14), the field trial results identified bupirimate, cyflufenamid, quinoxyfen, proquinazid, azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, as equally or more effective in controlling powdery mildew as the industry standard program of sulphur, myclobutanil and trifloxystrobin. Field trials in 2014 / 15 assessed spray programs that were based on sulphur in different combinations with quinoxyfen, bupirimate, cyflufenamid and/or with reduced applications of myclobutanil and trifloxystrobin. All programs were as effective against powdery mildew as the industry standard program. Azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, prochloraz, and chlorothalonil were the most effective against leaf blotch in trials in 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15. It is anticipated that the coordinated use of different chemistries across the strawberry nursery and fruit industries will reduce the risk of fungicide resistance developing in pathogen populations, and increase the sustainability of disease protection across strawberry crops...|$|R
40|$|Experiments with {{pairs of}} <b>strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> plants {{joined by the}} stolon and acting as donor/receptor units are reported. Long photoperiods or a light-break {{treatment}} on donor plants brought about increased petiole length, increased leaf size, and delayed flower initiation in receptor plants themselves in short photo-periods. The response of receptor plants was increased by exposing donor plants to illumination by full daylight 3 hours earlier each morning than receptor plants. It is thought that this earlier illumination increased translocation from the earlier to the later illuminated plants. In translocation experiments, radioactive P 32 moved more freely from the older to the younger plant of each pair, except when the older plants were partially defoliated or when the younger plants were exposed to full light {{for a longer period}} of time each day than the older attached plants. The results are discussed and it is concluded that they are good evidence for the existence of a growth-regulating substance(s) Which promotes vegetative growth and inhibits flower initiation. It seems possible that the regulation of vegetative growth and the control of flower induction is principally achieved in the strawberry by a flower inhibiting, vegetative growth-promoting system...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Bacterial {{contamination}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important problems both in plant tissue culture research and commercial laboratories. Early detection of contaminants saves time, effort, and money. <b>Strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> explants were screened for contaminants during June to August, 1994 and 1995. Most contaminants found were bacterial rather than fungal. Bacterial contaminants from 22 contaminated genotypes were isolated, purified, and identified to genus using standard biochemical tests such as Gram's stain, King's B medium, starch hydrolysis, and carbon source utilization (Biolog). From those 22 genotypes, 16 different bacterial strains were isolated. The majority were Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped fluorescent pseudomonads. Xanthomonads, enterobacterium, and other unidentified Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were also found. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of single (Timentin, streptomycin sulfate, dihydrostreptomycin, and gentamicin) and combinations of two and three (Timentin, streptomycin sulfate, and gentamicin) were tested for inhibition of the bacterial isolates. Combinations of Timentin, streptomycin sulfate, and gentamicin killed all bacterial isolates tested. Fragaria virginiana subsp. glauca (S. Watson) Staudt and F. x ananassa Duch. Cv. Jucunda were inoculated with Pseudomonas corrugata or Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria then treated with a combination of Timentin, streptomycin sulfate, and gentamicin. F. virginiana subsp. glauca died after inoculation with either bacteria. Antibiotic treatments were 100...|$|R
40|$|Com o objetivo de estudar o sistema de produção de mudas de morangueiro em vasos suspensos e a aplicação das técnicas de frigoconservação e vernalização nas mudas produzidas nesse sistema, foram realizados quatro experimentos no Departamento de Produção Vegetal, ESALQ/USP, Piracicaba/SP, no período compreendido entre janeiro de 2000 e junho de 2003. No primeiro experimento comparou-se o sistema de produção de mudas em vasos suspensos com o sistema convencional. Foram avaliados: matéria seca, teor de carboidratos totais e percentagem de sobrevivência de mudas. Foram utilizadas as cultivares IAC-Campinas, Pelican e IAC-Guarani. Foi utilizado o delineamento {{experimental}} em esquema fatorial 3 x 2 (três cultivares e dois sistemas de produção de mudas), com três repetições. As mudas produzidas em vasos suspensos apresentaram maior percentagem de sobrevivência e maiores teores de carboidratos totais. O segundo e terceiro experimentos tiveram como objetivo avaliar o uso da técnica de frigoconservação em mudas produzidas no sistema de vasos suspensos. As mudas foram acondicionadas em sacos de polietileno e frigoconservadas durante 120 dias em uma B. O. D. a - 1 + 1 oC. Foram então retiradas da câmara fria e plantadas em bandejas de poliestireno expandido de 128 células preenchidas com vermiculita. As bandejas foram colocadas em uma câmara nebulizadora, onde permaneceram por 21 dias para enraizamento. Em seguida foram transplantadas para vasos de 250 ml e levadas para casa de vegetação. Foi avaliada a percentagem de sobrevivência das mudas. No segundo experimento utilizou-se o delineamento experimental inteiramente ao acaso com cinco cultivares (IAC-Campinas, Dover, Pelican, Sequoia e Sweet Charlie) e nove repetições. No terceiro experimento foi utilizado o esquema fatorial 5 x 2 (cinco cultivares: IAC-Campinas, Oso Grande, Camarosa, Dover e Sweet Charlie; e dois tratamentos de enraizamento: com e sem ácido indol butírico) com quatro repetições. O sistema de frigoconservação adotado apresenou desempenho insatisfatório devido à baixa percentagem de sobrevivência das mudas. O quarto experimento estudou o efeito da vernalização em mudas de cinco cultivares de morangueiro produzidas no sistema de vasos suspensos. As mudas foram plantadas em vasos de 250 ml, preenchidos com substrato formulado com areia e vermiculita (4 : 1) e mantidas em casa de vegetação durante seis meses. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o fatorial 5 x 2, com cinco cultivares (IAC-Campinas, Dover, Sweet Charlie, Cartuno e Oso Grande) com e sem vernalização das mudas, com quatro repetições. Para vernalização, as mudas foram levadas para câmara fria, à temperatura de 10 + 2 ºC, e fotoperíodo de 10 h de luz/dia, durante 28 dias. Em seguida, foram transplantadas para dois locais de cultivo com características climáticas distintas, Piracicaba,SP e Caldas,MG. Foram avaliadas as percentagens de sobrevivência, florescimento, frutificação e emissão de estolhos e o peso da matéria fresca e número de frutos produzidos por planta. A sobrevivência de mudas não foi afetada pela vernalização em nenhuma das localidades. Houve efeito significativo no florescimento e na frutificação das plantas vernalizadas apenas em Piracicaba. O estolonamento de plantas foi mais precoce em Piracicaba. Para todas as cultivares a produção de frutos foi e insignificante e comercialmente inviável em ambas as localidades. With {{the objective}} of studying the runners production system in suspended pots under protected cultivation {{and the application of}} techniques of stored cold and vernalization of runners produced by this system, four experiments were conducted in the Department of Crop Production, ESALQ, Piracicaba, SP-Brazil. In the first experiment it was compared the conventional <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> production system with the runner production system in suspended pots. For that, it was measured the dry matter and carbohydrates contents in runners and the survival percentage when the runner were transplanted to field production areas. The cultivars IAC-Campinas, Pelican and IAC-Guarani were used, in an experimental design of factorial arrangement 3 x 2 (three cultivars and two runners production systems), three replications. The runners produced by the system of suspended pots accumulated higher amount of total carbohydrates and the plant survival rate. The second and third experiments had {{the objective of}} evaluating the use of a technique of storage cold in runners produced in the system of suspended pots. After the selection, the runners were conditioned in polyethylene bags and storage cold conditions for 120 days in a B. O. D. at - 1 + 1 ºC. After that they were removed of the cold camera and planted in trays of expanded polystyrene of 128 cells with vermiculite. The trays were put in a spray chamber 21 days for rooting. After that hey were transplanted to pots of 250 mL and then placed in the greenhouse. It was evaluated the percentage of runners survival. In the second experiment it was used the experimental entirely random design, five strawberry cultivars (IAC-Campinas, Dover, Pelican, Sequoia and Sweet Charlie), and nine repetitions. In the threat experiment the factorial outline used was 5 x 2 (five cultivars: IAC-Campinas, Big Oso, Camarosa, Dover and Sweet Charlie; and two treatments: with and without indol butyric acid) with four repetitions. The storage cold of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> produced in system of suspended pots lower percentage of survival of seedlings in the two experiments. Therefore, the system of storage cold was not compatible with the type of storage runners. The fourth experiment had the objective of studying the effect of the runner vernalization of five strawberry cultivars produced in suspended pot system. In order to have availability of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> during the off season, they were planted in pots of 250 mL, filled out with substrate formulated with sand and vermiculite (4 : 1) and kept in the greenhouse for six months. Completely randomized blocks with the factorial design 5 x 2, with five strawberry cultivars (IAC-Campinas, Dover, Sweet Charlie, Cartuno and Big Oso) and two treatments (with and without <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> vernalization). For vernalization, the <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> were taken from cold camera to the temperature of 10 + 2 ºC, and fotoperiod of 10 h of light/day for 28 days. After that, they were transplanted for two cultivation places with different climatic conditions, Piracicaba/SP and Caldas/MG. They were analyzed the survival percentages, flower blooming, fructification and emission of stolons and the weight and number of fruits produced by plant. The <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> survival was not affected by the vernalization in none of the places. There were only significant effect on flower appearance and fructification of the vernalized plants, only in Piracicaba. The runner emitions were earlier in Piracicaba. For all strawberry cultivars the production of fruits was very low and the produced fruits were unsuitable for commercialization in both places...|$|E
30|$|Aphelenchoides spp. control {{includes}} {{removal and}} destruction of infected strawberry leaves. Avoiding periods of relatively long plant wetness should be considered since this nematode relies on moisture {{to move up the}} plant and between plants. Following this line of thinking, drip irrigation is preferable over overhead spray irrigation. These nematodes are vulnerable to elevated temperatures; hot water treatment at a temperature of 115 [*]°F for 5 [*]min of dormant plant materials such as <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> or cuttings intended for propagation can be used and is effective at eliminating most nematodes that may be infesting the plant material (Qiu et al. 1994). Sanitation of equipment is also important to control the nematode. Pots, soil, and tools should be cleaned by baking or steaming at 180 – 200 [*]°F for 30 [*]min (Anonymous 2018 b). Care must be taken so that the temperatures needed to eliminate the infesting nematodes do not irrevocably harm the plant material (Jenkins and Taylor 1967).|$|E
40|$|Phytoplasmas are phloem-limited plant {{pathogens}} {{that have}} been identified in over 1000 plant species worldwide. Outbreaks of the phytoplasma-related disease, papaya dieback, has resulted in 10 - 100 % crop losses in south-east Queensland and Western Australia. Strawberry lethal yellows and green petal disease outbreaks in Queensland have led to 10 - 50 % of <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> being destroyed. Lucerne yellows disease has been reported to cause an annual loss of AU$ 7 million to the lucerne seed industry. Disease surveys in Australia have increased our understanding of phytoplasma diseases in Australia and these fastidious organisms have been detected in similar to 70 native and introduced plant species. The majority of the Australian phytoplasmas are assigned to the 16 SrII group, however, a member of the 16 SrXII group is more commonly associated with economically important diseases in Australia such as strawberry lethal yellows, papaya dieback and grapevine yellows. These phytoplasma diseases have been diagnosed using PCR primers specific for their 16 S rRNA gene.

40|$|Microbial {{contaminants}} {{were detected}} in surface-sterilized <b>strawberry</b> <b>runner</b> explants partially submerged in half-strength liquid Murashige and Skoog medium. From June to August, 1994, 45 of 70 strawberry genotypes {{were found to}} be contaminated, whereas from June to August, 1995, 53 of 72 contained contaminants. There were more bacterial than fungal contaminants. Bacterial contaminants from 22 strawberry genotypes were isolated, purified, and identified to genus by standard biochemical tests such as Gram's stain, motility, oxidase, and gelatinase, and carbon source utilization (Biolog Microplates, Biolog, Inc., Hayward, CA). Among the 30 isolates identified with the Biolog system, the majority were fluorescent pseudomonads including Pseudomonas fluorescens types A, F, and G. P. corrugata, P. tolaasii, P. paucimobilis, Xanthomonas campestris, Xanthomonas spp., and Enterobacter cloacae were also identified. Five Gram-negative and two Gram-positive contaminants could not be identified by the Biolog test. Biochemical tests were used to characterize the bacteria and to confirm Biolog test results. Bacteria identified in this study were soil, water, and plant related, indicating that efforts to reduce explant contaminant levels should be centered on the care of stock plants or the sterility of the watering system.

40|$|Biological soil {{disinfestation}} is {{an environmentally}} friendly method to disinfest soil. From now on {{we refer to}} it as anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD). With ASD a green manure crop (40 t/ha) is homogeneously incorporated into the topsoil (0 - 30 cm) after which the field is lightly compacted and irrigated. Subsequently the field is mechanically covered with air tight virtually impermeable film (VIF) to restrict oxygen supply to the topsoil. The soil is left covered for six weeks in the summer. In this period anaerobic conditions develop rapidly in which toxic fermentation products are formed. These conditions are responsible for elimination of fungal and bacterial pathogens as well as parasitic nematodes, insects and weeds. In the Netherlands since 2004 anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) was applied on approximately 70 ha mainly for asparagus and <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> production. When the asparagus crop was replanted ASD proved to be profitable for many years by controlling Fusarium oxysporum. Although highly effective against soilborne pathogens and pests ASD is not applied widely in the Netherlands due to the high costs of about € 4000 per ha. Apart from the costs this technique needs special attention to prevent plastic damage. Moreover the mechanism behind ASD is not well defined which makes recommendations for growers complex. A new and promising development in ASD is the application of defined products on a basis of mixtures of carbon hydrates and proteins. The mechanism of ASD will be studied {{in the next few years}} with some of these products by measuring gases and fatty acids and microbial shifts in relation to efficacy. Chemical soil disinfestation with fumigants is restricted more and more and a non-chemical approach of soil disinfestation like ASD is urgently neede...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{numerical}} optimization algorithm {{inspired by the}} strawberry plant for solving complicated engineering problems. Plants like <b>strawberry</b> develop both <b>runners</b> and roots for propagation and search for water resources and minerals.

The proposed algorithm has three main differences with the trivial nature-inspired optimization algorithms: duplication-elimination of the computational agents at all iterations, subjecting all agents to both small and large movements from the beginning to end, and the lack of communication (information exchange) between agents. Moreover, it has the advantage of using only three parameters to be tuned by user. This algorithm is applied to standard test functions and the results are compared with GA and PSO. The proposed algorithm is also used to solve an open problem in the field of robust control theory. These simulations show that the proposed algorithm can very effectively solve complicated optimization problems...|$|R

Algumas das rotas desencadeadas ocorrem logo após a herbivoria, quando a planta passa a {{responder}} de forma indireta através da produção de substâncias voláteis atrativas aos inimigos naturais dos fitófagos infestantes. Uma outra rota seria a resposta direta da planta através da síntese de inibidores de proteases produzidos após a injúria, o que pode afetar o desenvolvimento e crescimento de fitófagos infestantes. As plantas, por sua vez, podem apresentar especifidade nas respostas induzidas, ou seja, as defesas podem intimidar a herbivoria posterior, porém em alguns casos as espécies re- infestantes não tem o desempenho afetado. Estudos recentes têm demonstrado mecanismos de resistência em plantas de interesse comercial contra o ataque de pragas. Plantas de morangueiro que são cultivadas em larga escala no Brasil têm sofrido sérios danos pelo ácaro-rajado Tetranychus urticae, que é praga primária para a cultura. Desse modo, o presente estudo teve como objetivo estudar a resistência induzida direta em plantas de morangueiro (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) sobre populações de T. urticae. Nos estudos experimentais foram utlizadas plantas de morangueiro limpas (controle), plantas injuriadas mecanicamente e plantas pré-infestadas por T. urticae. Para determinação dos inibidores de proteases foram utilizadas amostras de folhas limpas de cada tratamento. Baseado nestes métodos, testou-se no ensaio 1 a hipótese de que a pré-infestação de T. urticae induziria a produção de inibidores de proteases reduzindo o crescimento populacional de seus coespecíficos. No ensaio 2, estudou-se a especificidade dos compostos defensivos, testando a hipótese de que a pré-infestação de T. urticae induziria a produção de inibidores de proteases que afetariam o desenvolvimento do ácaro-vermelho Tetranychus mexicanus, uma espécie de ácaro que também ocorre em morangueiro. No ensaio 3, foi testada a hipótese de que a infestação por T. urticae nas plantas matrizes de morangueiro induziria a produção de inibidores de proteases e estes seriam translocados através dos estolões até as plantas-filhas prejudicando o desenvolvimento de T. urticae nestes propágulos. De acordo com os resultados, menor número de indíviduos de T. urticae foram encontrados em plantas previamente infestadas com o coespecífico. O ácaro T. mexicanus não teve seu desenvolvimento afetado pela resposta induzida decorrente da pré-infestação de T. urticae. A resposta da planta teve efeito contrastante a T. mexicanus, aparentemente as defesas induzidas em morangueiro não atuam em re-infestações de heteroespecíficos, pelo menos para T. mexicanus. O crescimento populacional de T. urticae também foi menor nos propágulos de morangueiro. A defesa induzida por T. urticae em plantas matrizes de morangueiro apresentou sistemicidade, através do estolão, afetando o desempenho dos fitófagos nos propágulos. Nos resultados das concentrações de inibidores de proteases, verificou-se em geral, que as mesmas variaram entre os tratamentos nos experimentos, mas não foram correlacionados ao desempenho dos fitófagos. Possivelmente, outros compostos fitoquímicos produzidos pelas plantas estejam envolvidos nas respostas induzidas por T. urticae. Estes resultados suportam a hipótese de que as plantas que apresentam defesa direta podem reduzir o desempenho de fitófagos coespecíficos na geração seguinte. Plants previously {{attacked by}} herbivores may have their defense system activated. The defense forms may occur by different routes. Some of the unleashed routes take place {{right after the}} herbivory, when the plant starts responding {{in an indirect way}} through the production of volatile substances attractive to natural enemies of the infesting phytophagous. Another route would be the direct response from the plant through the synthesis of proteinase inhibitors produced post-injury, which can affect the development and growth of the infesting phytophagous. The plants can present specificity in the induced responses, that is, the defenses may intimidate a subsequent herbivory; however, in some cases the re- infesting species do not have their performance affected. Recent studies have shown resistance mechanisms in plants of commercial interest against the attack of pests. Strawberry plants which are cultivated in large scale in Brazil have suffered serious damage by the two spotted mite Tetranychus urticae, which is a primary pest for the culture. Therefore, the present study had as an aim to study induced direct resistance in strawberry plants (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) upon the population dynamics of the two-spotted mite T. urticae. In the experimental studies clean strawberry plants (control), plants that were mechanically injured as well as plants pre-infected with the two-spotted mite T. urticae were used. In order to determine the proteinase inhibitors, samples of each treatment were used. Based on these methods, in test 1 the hypothesis that the pre-infestation of T. urticae would induce the production of proteinase inhibitors reducing the population growth of their co-specifics was tested. In test 2, the specificity of the defensive compounds was studied, testing then the hypothesis that the pre- infestation of T. urticae would induce the production of proteinase inhibitors which would affect the development of red mite Tetranychus mexicanus, a species of spider mite that also occur in strawberry plants. In test 3, the hypothesis that the infestation by T. urticae in the mother strawberry plants would induce the production of proteinase inhibitors and these would be translocated through stolons unt il the <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> injuring the development of T. urticae in these daughter plants was tested. According to the results a smaller number of individuals of T. urticae were found in plants previously infected with the co-specific. The spider mite T. mexicanus did not have its development affected by the induced response due to the pre-infestation of T. urticae. The plant response had contrasting effect to T. mexicanus, apparently the induced defenses in strawberry plants do not act in reinfestations of hetero-specifics, ate least for T. mexicanus. The population growth of T. urticae was also smaller in the <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> of strawberry plants. The induced defense by T. urticae in mother strawberry plants presented systemic defense signals through the stolon, affecting the performance of the phytophagous of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners.</b> In the results of the concentrations of proteinase inhibitors, one could verify that they varied among the treatments in the experiments, but were not correlated to phytophagous performance. Possibly, other phytochemicals compounds produced by the plants might be involved in the induced responses by T. urticae. These results support the hypothesis that the plants that present direct defense can reduce the performance of co-specific phytophagous in the following generation...|$|E
40|$|A produção de morango é sazonal, e os melhores preços dos frutos são obtidos fora da estação. Buscando obter frutos fora da estação, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da vernalização em mudas de cinco cultivares de morangueiro. As mudas foram produzidas no sistema de vasos suspensos. O delineamento {{experimental}} utilizado foi blocos ao acaso em fatorial 5 x 2 x 4, com cinco cultivares ("IAC-Campinas", "Dover", "Sweet Charlie", "Cartuno" e "Oso Grande"), dois tratamentos (com e sem vernalização das mudas) e quatro tempos, com quatro repetições. Para vernalização, as mudas foram levadas para câmara fria à temperatura de 10 + 2 °C e fotoperíodo de 8 h de luz dia- 1 durante 28 dias, e em seguida transplantadas. Foram avaliadas as percentagens de sobrevivência, florescimento, frutificação, emissão de estolhos, a massa e o número de frutos produzidos por planta. A sobrevivência de mudas não foi afetada pela vernalização. Houve efeito significativo no florescimento e na frutificação das plantas vernalizadas. O estolonamento de plantas foi mais precoce nas mudas vernalizadas. Para todas as cultivares e tratamentos, a produção de frutos foi insignificante e comercialmente inviável. The strawberry {{production is}} seasonal, {{and the best}} fruit prices are obtained during the off season. Seeking to get fruits off season, this research was aimed at evaluating {{the effect of the}} seedling vernalization of five strawberry cultivars. The strawberry seedling were produced in suspended pot system. The experimental design was is completely randomized blocks with the factorial design 5 x 2 x 4, with five strawberry cultivars (IAC-Campinas, Dover, Sweet Charlie, Cartuno and Oso Grande), two treatments (with and without <b>strawberry</b> <b>runners</b> vernalization) and four times. For vernalization, the strawberry seedling was taken to cold chamber at 10 ± 2 °C, and photoperiod of 8 h of light day- 1 for 28 days, after this they were transplanted. The parameters evaluation were survival percentages, flower blooming, fructification, stolons emission, the weight and the number of fruits produced. The strawberry seedling survival was not affected by the vernalization. The results showed statistic differences among this treatments only on flower appearance and fructification of the vernalized plants. The runner emitions were earlier in the vernalized seedlings. For all strawberry cultivars and treatments the production of fruits was very low and the produced fruits were unsuitable for commercialization...|$|E
40|$|Strawberry {{nursery plants}} require {{chilling}} {{and also a}} high acquisition of phosphorus nutrition for helping capture and transfer energy for its rapid top growth. Soil phosphorus availability can be reduced in presence of high soil Fe, Ca and Mg concentrations in the adsorption process, which can vary with soil water content (SWC) and pH levels. A {{study was conducted in}} two commercial nursery plant production fields in the temperate Atlantic coastal areas in 2008. The objectives were to examine soil P availability, strawberry nursery plant propagation and P acquisition in relation to different soil pH, SWC and Ca, Mg and Fe concentrations. The cultivar ‘Strawberry Festival’ was used in the study and measurements were systematically taken along transects. The strawberry nursery plant propagation and productivity expressed using runners and daughter plants were significantly related to soil P availability, soil water and pH levels (0. 50 < R 2 < 0. 61, P < 0. 05). Soil soluble P concentrations were associated with soil water, pH and Ca, Mg and Fe concentrations. <b>Strawberry</b> produced 25 <b>runners</b> and 17 daughter plants in the soil with the optimal pH (6. 5) and higher SWC and P availability, a 60 % higher nursery productivity than that in the acidic soil (pH 5. 7). Soil P concentrations were decreased while Ca, Mg and Fe cations were high in the acidic conditions. It was suggested that soil P could be fixed rapidly and thus result in low strawberry nursery productivity...|$|R
