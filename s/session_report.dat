50|$|Among Peru’s {{reported}} cases of HIV/AIDS, 77 percent are in Lima and Callao - the capital city area (United Nations General Assembly Special <b>Session</b> <b>report,</b> 2010). Sexual transmission accounts for the majority (97 percent) of cases, followed by mother-to-child transmission (2 percent), and contaminated blood and blood products (1 percent) (UNGASS, 2010). The prevalence among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), which was 14 percent nationally and 23 percent in Lima in 2005, has continued to rise in recent years, while among sex workers prevalence remains low (0.6 to 2 percent). In five Central American countries, the annual HIV incidence was 5.1% among {{men who have sex with}} men, while an incidence of 3.5% has been found among men who have sex with men who attended public health clinics in Lima, Peru. A recent analysis by Alarcon-Villaverde indicated MSM account for a large proportion of HIV incidence (55 percent) in Peru (UNAIDS, 2009). In addition, transsexuals who are sex workers are the most affected population, with an estimated prevalence between 32 percent and 45 percent (UNGASS, 2010). Although 96 percent of female sex workers (FSWs) report having used a condom with their last client (MOH, 2003), the frequency of condom use among male sex workers is only 42 percent (UNGASS 2008). HIV/AIDS incidence in the main prisons in Peru is approximately 1.1 percent (Instituto Nacional Penitenciario INPE, 2005), and condom use by prison inmates is low (32.8 percent reported in 2004) (INPE, 2005).|$|E

40|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} <b>session</b> <b>report,</b> we open reflecting on a period of significant UK flooding. The Summer and Autumn 2012 floods are still very fresh {{in the memory of}} those who have been trying to manage and respond to these events and for some the impacts are still affecting daily lives. Initial estimates indicate that the 2012 summer floods affected 2, 700 properties with 70, 000 properties receiving flood warnings. No doubt these damages estimates will increase as further information is gathered. However, what has changed from the previous 2007 to 2010 session has been the further development of meteorological and hydrological forecasting approaches and the emergence of hydrometeorology capabilities across England, Wales and Scotland to help improve prediction of these types of events. Radar continues {{to play an important role}} in flood risk and water management and the application of emerging science is the focus of this report. At the beginning of this current session, the Committee were keen to promote ways to influence the greater use of weather radar by operating agencies and to highlight areas of improvement and research in support of the user community. Specifically, the Committee wanted to explore various service and system developments, understand various ongoing research areas and their application for hydrology and water management, and promote the role of radar in flood risk management. Section 3 of the Committee report highlights research needs and presents the considerable range of ongoing science developments across various research groups. The approaches to raingauge-radar merging and data assimilation of radar data for Numerical Weather Prediction are presented as are the requirements from an established hydrological and emerging water management community. The requirement to provide forecasting capabilities for the whole of the country and for longer lead times was driven as an outcome of the Pitt Review. In Section 4, the efforts of some agencies in developing these capabilities are presented with emphasis on the development of countrywide grid-based hydrological models. In addition, Section 4 reflects on the largest upgrade to the UK radar network in its 30 year history and the introduction of significant radar capabilities that will benefit the user community once completed. Section 5 presents what has been the main focal point for the Committee’s attention during the session period. Following the Committee’s successful bid to host the International Symposium on Weather Radar and Hydrology, most of the Committee have been in some way involved in the successful delivery of this major event. Held over four days at the University of Exeter, this was the 8 th in the symposium series and attracted over 250 international delegates. It is worth highlighting that following the organisation of Weather Radar and Hydrology 2011, the International Association of Hydrological Sciences has now published the conference proceedings as part of their Red Book series. The volume brings together over 100 peer-reviewed papers from the symposium providing a valuable record of the current activity in this field. Finally, the appendices to this <b>session</b> <b>report</b> provide an overview of the UK academic and operational agency activity in this sector...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{authors have}} {{researched}} multimedia system and support system for nursing studies on {{and practices of}} reminiscence therapy and life review therapy. The concept of the life review is presented by Butler in 1963. The process of thinking back on one's life and communicating about one's life to another person is called life review. A therapist must keep a record of sessions for inspection of methods and ways of valuation on reminiscence and life review therapy, but it is trouble for the therapist to record. The aim of research is to develop the support system which can automatically give an optimum topic and write down a <b>session</b> <b>report</b> about the activity. This life review is often assisted by aids such as videos, pictures, objects, archives and life story books, {{in order to make}} an opportunity of talking. We want to develop an omni-directional display system for cooperative activity on a round table to enable all-around viewing and unification of media contents by an electronic form. There is a famous episode concerning the memory. It is called as Proustian effects. This effect is mentioned on the Proust’s novel as an episode that a story teller reminds his old memory when he dipped a madeleine in tea. So many scientists research why smells trigger the memory. The authors pay attention to the relation between smells and memory although the reason is not evident yet. Then we have tried to add an olfactory display to the multimedia system so that the smells become a trigger of reminding buried memories.
