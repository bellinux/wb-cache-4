5000|$|Despite being a 14,000 residue long transcript, {{a single}} {{cytidine}} is targeted for editing. Within the ApoB mRNA a sequence consisting of 26 nucleotides necessary for editing is found. This {{is known as}} the editing motif. These nucleotides (6662-6687) were determined to be essential by <b>site</b> <b>specific</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> experiments. An 11 nucleotide portion of this sequence 4-5 nucleotides downstream from the editing site is an important region known as the mooring sequence. A region called the spacer element is found 2-8 nucleotides between the edited nucleoside and this mooring sequence. There is also a regulatory sequence 3' to the editing site. The active site of ApoBEC-1, the catalytic component of the editing holoenzyme is thought to bind to an AU rich region of the mooring sequence with the aid of ACF in binding the complex to the mRNA.The edited cytidine residue is located at nucleotide 6666 located in exon 26 of the gene. Editing at this site results in a codon change from a Glutamine codon (CAA) to an inframe stop codon (UAA). [...] Computer modelling has detected for editing to occur,the edited Cytidine is located in a loop. The selection of the edited cytidine is also highly dependent on this secondary structure of the surrounding RNA. There are also some indications that this loop region is formed between the mooring sequence and the 3' regulatory region of the ApoB mRNA. The predicted secondary structure formed by ApoB mRNA is thought to allow for contact between the residue to be edited and the active site of APOBEC1 as well as for binding of ACF and other auxiliary factors associated with the editosome.|$|E

Universal Stress Protein A of Escherichia coli displays activation in response to a wide range of stresses. The protein is phosphorylated at a serine or threonine under conditions of stasis. One obstacle in the genetic analysis to elucidate a specific function of UspA has been the lack of a strong differential phenotype. We have previously investigated the ability of our strains to form biofilms in microtiter plates. In these preliminary studies, biofilm formation was shown to have promise as a selectable phenotype for uspA functionality since mutants appear to form a less robust biofilm. A Quikchange© protocol was used for <b>site</b> [...] <b>specific</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of uspA in an attempt to determine the site(s) and necessity of phosphorylation for protein function. The biofilm assay is a modification of the OToole and Kolter (1998) assay in a 96 -well polystyrene plate, staining adherent cells with crystal violet and visualizing the solubilized stain spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The uspA- deletion strain shows a significant phenotype differential from wild type (W 3110) at 24 hours growth in LB, with the assay giving mutant to W 3110 ratios of 0. 70. In addition, paralog uspC, D, and E- deletion strains show varying strengths of biofilm formation. Four site-specific mutations of uspA have been created and confirmed by sequencing, and each shows biofilm formation comparable to a uspA+ strain. The 24 hour biofilm assay shows a reliable and significant differential between wild type E. coli and uspA mutants, making it suitable for several paths of investigation.

The mutations lie at position - 36 of the rod in a "d" position of the heptad repeat pattern, and thus air oxidation can introduce a zero-length cystine cross-link. Mutant keratins 8 and 18 purified separately from Escherichia coli readily formed cystine homodimers in 2 M guanidine-HCl, and could be separated from the monomers by gel filtration. Heterodimers with a cystine cross- link were obtained when filaments formed by the two reduced monomers were allowed to oxidize. Subsequent ion exchange chromatography in 8. 5 M urea showed that only a single dimer species had formed. Diagonal electrophoresis and reverse phase HPLC identified the dimer as the cystine containing heterodimer. This heterodimer readily assembled again into IF indistinguishable from those obtained from the nonmutant counterparts or from authentic keratins. In contrast, the mixture of cystine-stabilized homodimers formed only large aberrant aggregates. However, when a reducing agent was added, filaments formed again and yielded the heterodimer after oxidation. Thus, the obligatory heteropolymer step in keratin IF assembly seems to occur preferentially at the dimer level and not during tetramer formation. Our results also suggest that keratin I and II homodimers, once formed, are at least in 2 M guanidine-HCl a metastable species as their mixtures convert spontaneously into heterodimers unless the homodimers are stabilized by the cystine cross-link. This previously unexpected property of homodimers explains major discrepancies in the literature on the keratin dimer...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRhodococcus equi is an {{important}} cause of subacute or chronic abscessating bronchopneumonia of foals up to 3 - 5 months of age. It shares the lipid-rich cell wall envelope characteristic of the mycolata, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{as well as the}} ability of pathogenic members of this group to survive within macrophages. The possession of a large virulence plasmid in isolates recovered from pneumonic foals is crucial for virulence. The plasmid contains an 27 kb pathogenicity island (PI) that encodes seven related virulence-associated proteins (Vaps), including the immunodominant surface-expressed protein, VapA. Only PI genes are differentially expressed when the organism is grown in macrophages in vitro. Ten of the PI genes, including six Vap genes, have signal sequences, suggesting that they are exported from the cell to interact with the macrophage. Different PI genes are regulated by temperature, pH, iron, oxidative stress and probably also by magnesium, all environmental changes encountered after environmental R. equi are inhaled in dust and are ingested into macrophages in the lung. The basis of pathogenicity of R. equi is its ability to multiply in and eventually to destroy alveolar macrophages. Infectivity is largely or exclusively limited to cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Current evidence suggests that infection of foals with virulent R. equi results in some foals in subversion of cell-mediated immunity and development of an ineffective and sometimes lethal Th 2 -based immune response.
