5|$|Whether the bigeye and <b>smalltooth</b> sand tigers {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with {{morphological}} and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E

5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the sawfish family Pristidae {{has been described}} as chaotic, with uncertainty as to the true number of valid species. It contains two genera grouped by similar visual characteristics. [...] The genus Anoxypristis contains one species (A. cuspidata) and the genus Pristis contains from four to six species. Pristis has been divided into two groups, commonly referred to as <b>smalltooths</b> and largetooths.|$|R
5|$|With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, {{and large}} mouth filled with {{protruding}} teeth, the {{bigeye sand tiger}} looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind {{the level of the}} eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34–43 upper and 37–46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower symphysis. In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, and those in the rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger, which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger (O. ferox). Until more specimens were examined in the 1980s, some authors speculated that this species represented an extreme variant of the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger. Other names for this shark include black sand tiger, oceanic sand tiger, and bigeye ragged-tooth shark.|$|E
500|$|The {{bigeye sand tiger}} (Odontaspis noronhai) is an {{extremely}} rare species of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a possible worldwide distribution. A large, bulky species reaching at least [...] in length, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without nictitating membranes, and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color.|$|E
500|$|The park's eastern {{boundary}} {{lies just}} beyond {{the rise of the}} offshore reef at ten-fathom (...) sea depth. Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding [...] to a depth of [...] The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans, magnificent frigatebirds, brown boobies, particularly around the offshore lights, [...] and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels. Whales in offshore waters are rare, but can include right whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, fin whales and sei whales, all of them endangered. The <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish is similarly rare in park waters and endangered. Threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals, as well as pillar coral, listed as endangered in Florida.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of the wounds left by the cookiecutter shark on various animals is in ancient Samoan legend, which held that atu (skipjack tuna) entering Palauli Bay would leave behind pieces of their flesh as a sacrifice to Tautunu, the community chief. In later centuries, various other explanations for the wounds were advanced, including lampreys, bacteria, and invertebrate parasites. In 1971, Everet Jones of the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (a predecessor of the National Marine Fisheries Service) discovered the cigar shark, {{as it was then}} generally known, was responsible. Shark expert Stewart Springer thus popularized the name [...] "cookiecutter shark" [...] for this species (though he originally called them [...] "demon whale-biters"). Other common names used for this shark include luminous shark, <b>smalltooth</b> cookiecutter shark, and smooth cookiecutter shark.|$|E

50|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, performed by Naylor et al. in 1997, {{suggests that the}} <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger and its relative, the bigeye sand tiger (O. noronhai), are {{more closely related to}} the thresher sharks than to the grey nurse shark, to which it bears a strong resemblance. If true, this would indicate that the similarities between this species and the grey nurse shark arose as the result of convergent evolution. Fossil teeth belonging to the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger have been found from Lower Pliocene (5.3 - 3.6 Ma) deposits in Italy and Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the grey}} nurse shark, the {{dentition}} of the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger is less robust and lacks specialized cutting and crushing teeth, {{suggesting that it}} tends to tackle smaller prey. The diet of the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger consists of bottom-dwelling bony fishes such as rockfish (Sebastes spp.), invertebrates such as squid, shrimp, and possibly marine isopods, and cartilaginous fishes including rays and chimaeras. The largest known prey item taken by this species was a 1.3 m (4.3 ft) long kitefin shark (Dalatias licha), found inside the stomach of a 2.9 m (9.5 ft) long male from New Caledonia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger has a bulky {{body with}} a long, bulbous, {{slightly}} flattened snout. The eyes are medium-sized, with large round pupils (as opposed to slit-like in the grey nurse shark), and lack nictitating membranes.|$|E
50|$|Pachystomias microdon, the <b>smalltooth</b> dragonfish, is {{a species}} of barbeled dragonfish found in the oceans at depths of from 660 to 4000 m. This species grows to a length of 22.1 cm SL. This species is the only known species in its genus.|$|E
50|$|Protected {{species in}} the park include the giant {{armadillo}} (Priodontes maximus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguar (Panthera onca), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas), green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish (Pristis pectinata), West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) and Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis).|$|E
5000|$|The {{reproductive}} behavior of <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish {{has not been}} well studied, despite their classification as a critically endangered species and the dire need for captivity breeding to return the population to its ideal size. [...] Nevertheless, much can be inferred based on information known about the {{reproductive behavior}} of other elasmobranchs. Observations show that <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish may participate in precopulatory behavior in captivity. Much of this activity involves the biting of pectoral fins known as “courtship biting.” [...] There is sexual dimorphism {{in the teeth of}} <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish, with males presenting a higher mean value for both left and right rostral tooth counts. The electrosensory system is believed {{to be used in the}} courtship behavior of sawfish and other elasmobranchs. [...] Reproductively active males use the sensory organs in their saw to locate females and vice versa. [...] Once a mate has been selected, several copulations occur during which the male inserts his claspers, which are paired intromittent organs, into the female’s vagina. The claspers contain subdermal siphon sacs that provide the propulsive power for sperm transfer. It is also possible that the siphon sacs assist with sawfish sperm competition by washing away rival sperm from the female’s vagina before copulations.|$|E

50|$|Typically {{regarded}} as a deepwater species, the <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger has been caught down {{to a depth of}} 880 m (2,900 ft). They are usually found near the bottom in rocky, boulder-strewn regions on continental shelves and the upper continental slope, as well as around submarine ridges and mountains. There are also reports of this species near the drop-offs of rocky or coral reefs and in the upper layers of the open ocean. In the Mediterranean, <b>smalltooth</b> sand tigers occur at depths less than 250 m (820 ft), including at depths accessible to divers. They have been seen swimming over sandy flats at Cocos Island and Fernando de Noronha. The temperature range favored by this species is 6 - 20 °C (43 - 63 °F); in hot climates they are found below the thermocline in cooler water.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger is a strong-swimming shark {{that may}} be {{encountered}} singly or in aggregations of up to five individuals. Catch records suggest that this species may cover long distances in oceanic waters along underwater ridges or [...] "hopping" [...] between seamounts. It has a very large, oily liver, which allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy {{in the water column}} with minimal effort. At a location called [...] "Shark Point" [...] off Beirut, Lebanon, small groups of <b>smalltooth</b> sand tigers appear every summer on rocky reefs at a depth of 30 - 45 m (100 - 150 ft). The same individuals have been documented returning to this site year after year. Their purpose there is unknown, being speculated to relate to mating. When confronted, these sharks have been observed to stall, gape their mouths, turn around, and shake their tails towards the perceived threat.|$|E
50|$|Capturing a sawfish {{is illegal}} in certain {{countries}} like the United States and Australia. The sale of <b>smalltooth</b> sawfish rostra is prohibited in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

50|$|Discoveries, {{beginning}} in the 1970s, of <b>smalltooth</b> sand tigers in shallow water have raised urgent conservation concerns, as this species is apparently more vulnerable to human activity than previously believed. There is at present insufficient data for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess the worldwide conservation status of this species. It has been assessed as Vulnerable in Australian waters, due to a decline of over 50% in catches off New South Wales since the 1970s. Populations of this species in the Mediterranean are also believed to have declined, due {{to a combination of}} habitat degradation, overfishing, pollution, and human disturbance. The <b>smalltooth</b> sand tiger has been protected by the Australian government since 1984; this came about concurrently with protection for the grey nurse shark, which had been decimated in Australian waters, so as to prevent any claims of confusing one species for the other. However, these regulations have proven difficult to enforce.|$|E
