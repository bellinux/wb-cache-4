5|$|Arbeideren ("The Worker") was a Norwegian newspaper, {{published}} in Hamar, Hedmark county. It {{was started in}} 1909 as the press organ of the Labour Party in Hedemarken and its adjoining regions, and was called Demokraten ("The Democrat") until 1923. It was issued {{three days a week}} between 1909 and 1913, <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week in 1914, three days a week again between 1914 and 1918 before again increasing to <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week. It was renamed to Arbeideren in 1923, and in the same year it was taken over by the Norwegian Communist Party. The Communist Party incorporated the newspaper Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad into Arbeideren in 1924, and until 1929 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad. After Arbeideren had gone defunct, the name was used by the Communist Party for other newspapers elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|As the {{war years}} went, the newspaper's {{finances}} gradually improved. The Norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements. Demokraten acquired its own type-setting machine in October 1918 and a printing press in 1917, which it used from 1 January 1918. From 1 July 1918, circulation once again increased to <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week.|$|E
5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week {{in order to ensure}} that they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E

5|$|At age 11, Cassidy began {{singing and}} playing guitar in a Washington-area band called Easy Street. This band {{performed}} {{in a variety of}} styles at weddings, corporate parties, and pubs. Due to her shyness, she struggled with performing in front of strangers. While a student at Bowie High School, she sang with a local band called Stonehenge. During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week at the theme park Wild World. Her younger brother Dan, a fiddler, was also a member of this working band. She enrolled in art classes at Prince George's Community College but dropped out after finding them unhelpful.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the revelation}} of the illegal activities, {{expenditures}} had been routinely made on a cash basis, all of the university funding and program money was thrown into a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated. The new leadership had to advertise in Louisiana newspapers to find out to whom they owed money. The first year {{of dealing with the}} situation required 16- to 18-hour days, <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week, and after that the process still required overtime through the year 1941. Faculty and staff members, accustomed to making purchases without bids, purchase orders or knowledge of the budget, had to be educated on the accepted business procedures on which {{the rest of the world}} operated.|$|E
5|$|Deshasth Brahmans and Marathas {{observe the}} Champasashthi festival {{every year in}} honour of Khandoba. The festival begins on the bright half of the Hindu month of Margshirsha.

On the seventh day the worshippers break their fast by a feast known as the Champasashtliiche parne. An {{invitation}} to this feast is regarded as an invitation from the god Khandoba himself and is harder to refuse.|$|E

5|$|Many Danish media {{corporations}} {{are located in}} Copenhagen. DR, the major Danish public service broadcasting corporation collected their activities in a new headquarters, DR Byen, in 2006 and 2007. Similarly TV2 {{which is based in}} Odense has concentrated its Copenhagen activities in a modern media house in Teglholmen. The two national daily newspapers Politiken and Berlingske Tidende and the two tabloids Ekstra Bladet and B.T. are based in Copenhagen. Kristeligt Dagblad is based in Copenhagen and is published <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week.

5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> {{week at the}} Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a cat {{in exchange for a}} repair, as the starving repairman had already eaten several.|$|E
5|$|The Hunting Party was {{recorded}} at the Larrabee Sound Studios, located in Hollywood, Los Angeles.

5|$|The chefs were {{initially}} {{surprised at how}} busy they were at lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give the chefs a break. Now based near Hyde Park, they had {{four or five times}} the number of covers for a lunch service than before. White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La Tante Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week, expecting similar hours from those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|When complete, the Monadnock was {{the largest}} office {{building}} in the world, with 1,200 rooms and an occupancy of over 6,000. The Chicago Daily Tribune commented that the population of most Illinois towns in 1896 would fit comfortably in the building. It was a postal district unto itself, with four full-time carriers delivering mail six times a day, <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week. It was the first building in Chicago wired for electricity, {{and one of the}} first to be fire-proofed, with hollow fire clay tiles lining the structure so that the metal frame would be protected even if the facing brick were to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Ashton town centre, {{which is}} the largest in Tameside, {{developed}} in the Victorian period. Many of the original buildings have survived, and as a result, the town centre is protected by Tameside Council as a conservation area. As well as being populated by leading high-street names, Ashton has an outdoor market which was established in the medieval period. It is made up of about 180stalls, and is open <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week. The farmers' market, with over 70stalls, is the largest in the region, as is the weekday flea market. Ashton Market Hall underwent a £15M restoration after it was damaged by fire. The Ashton Renewal Area project has attracted investment in the town centre, encouraging conservation and economic development.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular}} time with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E
5|$|Gallagher was {{the first}} Australian woman to win a medal at the Winter Paralympics, and Australia's second female Winter Paralympian. She was given the {{opportunity}} to compete at the highest levels in skiing after being identified during a talent search and because of her snowboarding experience. As she is blind, she competes with a guide with Eric Bickerton being her first guide. She is coached by Steve Graham, who also coached Michael Milton and is the current head coach of the Australian Institute of Sport's Winter Paralympic program. Her Australian training base is at the Victorian Institute of Sport's training centre located at Lakeside Stadium in South Melbourne. While actively training <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week, her individual training sessions will last between two and three hours each a total of ten to twelve sessions {{by the end of the}} week.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{started his}} English {{campaign}} slowly. Australia typically selected their strongest {{team for the}} tour opener against Worcestershire, and the all-rounder was omitted as the visitors won by an innings. As the Australians often played <b>six</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week, they employed a rotation policy in the county matches, {{and in the second}} game against Leicestershire, Loxton made his debut on English soil. He made only four, before opening the bowling in both innings and taking a total of 1/23 in an innings victory. His attempts to break into the first-choice team were hampered by a groin strain he suffered in the third match against Yorkshire when he was striving for extra pace in his only over in the first innings. As a result, he played no further part in the match. One man down, Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour. They fell to 6/31 in pursuit of 60—effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat—before scraping home without further loss after Yorkshire dropped both batsmen.|$|E
