Methods for the stabilization are compaction and use of admixtures. Lime and Cement was commonly used as stabilizer for altering the properties of soils. This project focuses {{on the effect of}} Cement and Lime on selected engineering properties of lateritic soils in Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria. In order to study this effect, fresh laterite was obtained and tested for its index and geotechnical properties. Afterwards, the soil sample was altered with additives proportions which includes 0 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 % of both cement and lime replacement by dry weight. On examination laterite, it was discovered that the laterite can be classified as good. After carrying out the engineering properties on the sample, it was observed that the maximum dry density reduced with increase in the lime content and for cement content at 2. 5 and 10 % but increases at 5 - 7. 5 %. Also, the optimum moisture content increased for increasing lime content and fluctuates for increasing cement content. However, an increase in the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) was noticed for increase in cement but a low effect for lime addition. It was therefore concluded that lime and cement modifies the chemical property of the tested soil with cement the most suitable...|$|E

Department of Physiotherapy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland 2. Department of Spatial Management and Tourism, Faculty of Earth Sciences, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland Abstract The spatial orientation of the lumbar part of spine determines the position of central axis of the human skeleton, which in turn is closely related to the position of the pelvis. In a biomechanical aspect, the pelvis should be connected with the lumbar spine but also with the hip joints (lumbo-pelvic-hip complex – LPH). This area is intended to provide the body with the stability needed to carry the load with simultaneous maintaining the mobility required to perform locomotive functions. <b>Stabilization</b> <b>means</b> the maintenance of balance in both static and dynamic conditions, where the complex moves along a specific track. In the last decades of 20 th and early 21 st century there was a discussion whether stabilization of the LPH complex was more about the activation of deep muscles (local) or combination of deep and superficial muscles contraction (global). It is now known that both global and local muscles play an important role in stabilization. The stabilizing system of the spine, which was introduced by Panjabi in 1992, works on the cooperation of those three systems: neural, which is the control system; muscular-fascial, which is the active system; osteoarticular - ligamentous, which creates a passive system. Hoffman and Gabel [22] proposed a new, extended theoretical model in which the new mobility system is placed beside the existing stability system and subsystems. Harmonious work of stability and mobility systems determines the quality of movement, but the malfunction of these systems affects other subsystems and thereby the quality of movement. The authors of this theoretical model suggest that both rehabilitation and mobility systems should be involved in rehabilitation exercises, with the movement being at a possible level but without pain and discomfort. LPH stabilization exercises are used in physiotherapeutic procedures in patients with pain and traumas, with stress urinary incontinence and in pregnant women.

Results of wind tunnel tests, {{in the framework of}} a NASA program, to determine the force-control characteristics of a symmetrical airfoil with scoop-fed slots are discussed. Further tests showed that a fluidic amplifier could be built into the airfoil and operate with ram air. A fluidic rudder was then developed, consisting of cascaded fluidic amplifiers necessary to couple low-level fluidic sensors with slot flow control of the aerodynamic force on the vertical tail...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The general problem {{under study}} {{in this paper}} is the robust {{asymptotic}} stabilization of nonlinear systems. Different types of systems are considered: the Artstein’s circles, the systems which are asymptotically controllable to the origin and also the chained systems. We recall some results on the <b>stabilization</b> by <b>means</b> of hybrid feedback laws (namely controller with a mixed continuous/discrete component) and by means of discontinuous feedbacks. We note that hybrid feedbacks yield a robust stabilization property with respect to measurement noise, actuator errors and exogeneous disturbances, for a larger class of solutions than those obtained with discontinuous state-feedbacks. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{consensus}} emergence in multi-agent systems via external feedback controllers. We consider a set of agents interacting with dynamics given by a Cucker-Smale type of model, and study its consensus <b>stabilization</b> by <b>means</b> of centralized and decentralized control configurations. We present a characterization of consensus emergence for systems with different feedback structures, such as leader-based configurations, perturbed information feedback, and feedback computed upon spatially confined information. We characterize consensus emergence for this latter design as a parameter-dependent transition regime between self-regulation and centralized feedback stabilization. Numerical experiments illustrate the different features of the proposed designs...|$|R

In particular, we show that whenever suitable dissipative effects are induced either by the unmonitored environment, or by non Hermitian measurements, there is no need for feedback, as open-loop time-invariant control is sufficient to achieve stabilization of the target set in probability. Constructive necessary and sufficient conditions on the form of the control Hamiltonian can be provided in this case. When time-invariant control is not sufficient, state stabilization in expectation can be attained by the addition of filteringbased feedback control...|$|R
40|$|Handling {{constraints}} {{in control}} system design {{is an important}} issue in most, if not all, real world problems. On the other hand, it is generally true that higher levels of performance are associated with operating on, or near, constraint boundaries. Thus, a designer really cannot ignore constraints without incurring a performance penalty. Several constrained control problems have been treated in this thesis. In the framework of linear systems with saturating actuators three issues have been considered: unbounded invariant strips and <b>stabilization</b> by <b>means</b> of linear feedbacks, robust stabilization via sliding mode control, explicit characterization of null controllable regions. Moreover an optimal control problem for cooperative multi robot localization in the presence of energy constraints has been studied. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{correspondence}} {{presents a}} new recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive algorithm. The proposed computational scheme uses a finite window {{by means of}} a lemma for the system matrix inversion that is, for the first time, stated and proven here. The new algorithm has excellent tracking capabilities. Moreover, its particular structure allows for <b>stabilization</b> by <b>means</b> of a quite simple method. Its stabilized version performs very well not only for a white noise input but also for nonstationary inputs as well. It is shown to follow music, speech, environmental noise, etc, with particularly good tracking properties. The new algorithm can be parallelized via a simple technique. Its parallel form is very fast when implemented with four processors. © 1999 IEEE...|$|R
