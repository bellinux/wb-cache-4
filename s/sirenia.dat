5|$|The <b>Sirenia,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The <b>Sirenia</b> currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sirenia,</b> {{commonly}} sirenians, {{are also}} referred to by the common name sirens, deriving from the sirens of Greek mythology. This comes from a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for mermaids. Seekoei (sea cow) is also the name for a hippopotamus in Afrikaans.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sirenia</b> is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E

5|$|Sirenians are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. <b>Sirenia,</b> Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E
25|$|Manatees {{comprise}} {{three of}} the four living species in the order <b>Sirenia.</b> The fourth is the Eastern Hemisphere's dugong. The <b>Sirenia</b> are thought to have evolved from four-legged land mammals over 60 million years ago, with the closest living relatives being the Proboscidea (elephants) and Hyracoidea (hyraxes).|$|E
25|$|Afrotheria {{contains}} {{several groups}} that are only distantly related according to the paleontologists' version: Afroinsectiphilia ("African insectivores"), Tubulidentata (aardvarks, which paleontologists regard as much closer to odd-toed ungulates than to other members of Afrotheria), Macroscelidea (elephant shrews, usually regarded as close to rabbits and rodents). The only members of Afrotheria that paleontologists would regard as closely related are Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Proboscidea (elephants) and <b>Sirenia</b> (manatees, dugongs).|$|E
50|$|A {{few weeks}} went by when Veland {{had a new}} band along with three other members. He had written {{material}} for Tristania's next release {{but because of the}} split he used it towards <b>Sirenia's</b> debut album At Sixes and Sevens with other new material written for it as well. The band entered the studio by November or December 2001. The band failed to find a suitable singer prior to recording in France, so they hired a session female singer named Fabienne Gondamin.|$|R
25|$|In the 2000s {{understanding}} of the relationships among eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Pholidota, and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, <b>Sirenia,</b> Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian cytogenetics.|$|E
25|$|Through {{dedicated}} stranding {{and mortality}} research and monitoring, the PRMCC has documented over 120 manatee deaths in Puerto Rico, via salvage and necropsies. Pathology and disease processes {{in these cases}} have been documented cooperatively with veterinary pathologist Gregory Bossart of the Georgia Aquarium and manatee biologist Robert Bonde of the US Geological Survey (USGS) <b>Sirenia</b> Project in Gainesville, Florida. During 2015, two successful rescues were conducted, including one manatee calf in the Condado Lagoon of San Juan with a bicycle tire on its torso and one newborn calf who got separated from its mother {{in the town of}} Isabela.|$|E
25|$|The PRMCC {{is one of}} the 12 {{facilities}} federally deputized in the US to {{hold and}} care for manatees and one of five critical care manatees facilities. These facilities conform the Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership, which includes the following organizations: Cincinnati Zoo, Columbus Zoo, Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park, Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens, Miami Seaquarium, Mote Marine Laboratory, Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center, Puerto Rico Zoo, Save the Manatee Club, Sea to Shore Alliance, Sea World Orlando, South Florida Museum, Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, USFWS, USGS <b>Sirenia</b> Project, University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine, and Walt Disney World’s The Seas.|$|E

[...] It is currently illustrated by Vince Locke. The digest includes the occasional collaboration with Sonya Taaffe.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} component of the mammalogy collection is the marine mammal collection, consisting of 310 manatee, dolphin and over five hundred whales. [...] The large size of the collection is [...] the result of a long-term cooperative effort with the U.S. National Biological Service's <b>Sirenia</b> research project, Marine Mammal [...] Stranding Network, researchers David and Melba Caldwell, and Marineland of Florida.

2500|$|Gothic metal is {{a varied}} genre with bands {{pursuing}} many different directions, from [...] "slow and crushing variations" [...] to [...] "orchestral and bombastic". The doom metal background of early pioneers like Anathema, Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride {{has been taken}} up by groups like Artrosis, Ava Inferi and Draconian. The black metal approach of Cradle of Filth, Theatres des Vampires and early Moonspell {{can be found in}} such subsequent bands as Graveworm, Drastique and Samsas Traum while the symphonic metal approach of Tristania and Within Temptation can be found in other groups like Epica, <b>Sirenia</b> and After Forever. Other variations include the symphonic black metal of Trail of Tears, the folk metal of Midnattsol, the industrial metal of Deathstars, Gothminister and Neon Synthesis, the alternative metal of Katatonia and Lacuna Coil, the doom metal of Type O Negative, the nu metal of Coal Chamber and Evanescence, and the metalcore of Motionless in White.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{bands that}} {{contrast}} aggressive male vocals and clean female vocals continued {{to emerge in}} the late 1990s. Trail of Tears had formed in 1994 while Tristania formed in 1995 and The Sins of Thy Beloved were formed in 1996. All three Norwegian groups released their debut albums in 1998. Tristania stood apart from the others with their use of three distinct vocal styles in the [...] "operatic soprano Vibeke Stene, clean-singing counter-tenor Østen Bergøy, and harsh, black metal-style shrieker Morten Veland". Their second album Beyond the Veil in 1999 made use of a ten members choir and featured violin passages from Pete Johansen of The Sins of Thy Beloved, earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] across Europe. By then, the band had risen to [...] "the top of the goth metal heap" [...] with their [...] "lush, symphonically enhanced" [...] approach. They were [...] "dealt a potentially crippling blow" [...] when singer, guitarist and principal composer Veland left the group to form <b>Sirenia.</b> Tristania has continued to prosper with subsequent releases and has since been [...] "regarded as one of the world's premiere goth metal bands".|$|E
2500|$|The new {{frontier}} in manatee research pivots on population health assessment and habitat use {{through the use}} of radio-telemetry. Thus, in the coming years, the PRMCC will focus its research on manatees through a cooperative project titled [...] "Puerto Rico Manatee Health Assessment and Telemetry Project". This research will be led by the PRMCC together with the Inter American University, PRDNER, USFWS, USGS <b>Sirenia</b> Project, Puerto Rico’s Environmental Quality Board (PREQB), San Juan Bay Estuary Program (SJBEP), University of Florida’s Veterinary School, and the Georgia Aquarium. Since detrimental activities that have led to the manatee endangerment include habitat degradation, which in turn influences manatee health and the particular use of specific habitats, the PRMCC seeks to ascertain the effects of these two factors in the survival of the manatee in Puerto Rico. The study will be conducted in two important estuarine habitats for the species: Jobos Bay and San Juan Bay. Health assessments are a valuable tool to determine the fitness, specifically related to environmental and medical issues of any population of wildlife. Telemetry studies provide hard evidence on the preference and use of any wildlife to a specific habitat and its use of the resources (food, water, shelter, etc.) needed for survival. Wild manatees will be medically examined and tested for signs of health issues. Once examined and samples are collected for analysis, the manatees will be fitted with a satellite tag to monitor their movement and habitat preference for a year.|$|E

60|$|With much {{reason the}} Lemurs are removed {{altogether}} from the Primates, {{under the name}} of Prosimiae.

6000|$|That the Didelphia were {{developed}} {{out of some}} ornithodelphous form, as Professor Haeckel supposes, seems to be unquestionable; but the existing Opossums and Kangaroos are certainly extremely modified and remote from their ancestors the [...] "Prodidelphia," [...] of which we have not, at present the slightest knowledge. The mode of origin of the Monodelphia from these {{is a very difficult}} problem, for the most part left open by Professor Haeckel. He considers the Prosimiae, or Lemurs, to be the common stock of the Deciduata, and the Cetacea (with which he includes the <b>Sirenia)</b> to be modified Ungulata. As regards the latter question, I have little doubt that the <b>Sirenia</b> connect the Ungulata with the Proboscidea; and none, that the Cetacea are extremely modified Carnivora. The passage between the Seals and the Cetacea by Zeuglodon is complete. I also think that there is much to be said for the opinion, that the Insectivora represent the common stock of the Primates (which passed into them by the Prosimiae), the Cheiroptera, the Rodentia, and the Carnivora. And I am greatly disposed to look for the common root of all the Ungulata, as well, in some ancient non-deciduate Mammals which were more like Insectivora than anything else. On the other hand, the Edentata appear to form a series by themselves.|$|E
6000|$|I must {{venture to}} demur to this statement. I showed, in my {{previous}} paper, {{that there is}} no reason to doubt that the term [...] "great sea monster" [...] (used in Gen. i. 21) includes the most conspicuous of great sea animals--namely, whales, dolphins, porpoises, manatees, and dugongs; [2] and, as these are indubitable mammals, it is impossible to affirm that mammals come after birds, which are said to have been created on the same day. Moreover, I pointed out that as these Cetacea and <b>Sirenia</b> are certainly modified land animals, their existence implies the antecedent existence of land mammals.|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{now look}} to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species. All fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once {{explained}} {{on the principle of}} descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland long ago remarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existing groups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, is certainly true; but as this statement has often been ignored or even denied, it may be well to make some remarks on this subject, and to give some instances. If we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct species of the same class, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system. In the writings of Professor Owen we continually meet with the expression of generalised forms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the writings of Agassiz, of prophetic or synthetic types; and these terms imply that such forms are, in fact, intermediate or connecting links. Another distinguished palaeontologist, M. Gaudry, has shown in the most striking manner that many of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica serve to break down the intervals between existing genera. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders of mammals; but so many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen has had to alter the whole classification, and has placed certain Pachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants; for example, he dissolves by gradations the apparently wide interval between the pig and the camel. The Ungulata or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into the even-toed or odd-toed divisions; but the Macrauchenia of South America connects to a certain extent these two grand divisions. No one will deny that the Hipparion is intermediate between the existing horse and certain other ungulate forms. What a wonderful connecting link in the chain of mammals is the Typotherium from South America, as the name given to it by Professor Gervais expresses, and which cannot be placed in any existing order. The <b>Sirenia</b> form a very distinct group of the mammals, {{and one of the most}} remarkable peculiarities in existing dugong and lamentin is the entire absence of hind limbs, without even a rudiment being left; but the extinct Halitherium had, according to Professor Flower, an ossified thigh-bone [...] "articulated to a well-defined acetabulum in the pelvis," [...] and it thus makes some approach to ordinary hoofed quadrupeds, to which the <b>Sirenia</b> are in other respects allied. The cetaceans or whales are widely different from all other mammals, but the tertiary Zeuglodon and Squalodon, which have been placed by some naturalists in an order by themselves, are considered by Professor Huxley to be undoubtedly cetaceans, [...] "and to constitute connecting links with the aquatic carnivora." ...|$|E
60|$|Another most {{conspicuous}} difference {{between man and}} the lower animals is the nakedness of his skin. Whales and dolphins (Cetacea), dugongs (<b>Sirenia)</b> and the hippopotamus are naked; {{and this may be}} advantageous to them for gliding through the water; nor would it be injurious to them from the loss of warmth, as the species which inhabit the colder regions are protected by a thick layer of blubber, serving the same purpose as the fur of seals and otters. Elephants and rhinoceroses are almost hairless; and as certain extinct species which formerly lived under an arctic climate were covered with long wool or hair, it would almost appear as if the existing species of both genera had lost their hairy covering from exposure to heat. This appears the more probable, as the elephants in India which live on elevated and cool districts are more hairy[216] than those on the lowlands. May we then infer that man became divested of hair from having aboriginally inhabited some tropical land? The fact of the hair being chiefly retained in the male sex on the chest and face, and in both sexes at the junction of all four limbs with the trunk, favours this inference, assuming that the hair was lost before man became erect; for the parts which now retain most hair would then have been most protected from the heat of the sun. The crown of the head, however, offers a curious exception, for at all times it must {{have been one of the}} most exposed parts, yet it is thickly clothed with hair. In this respect man agrees with the great majority of quadrupeds, which generally have their upper and exposed surfaces more thickly clothed than the lower surface. Nevertheless, the fact that the other members of the order of Primates, to which man belongs, although inhabiting various hot regions, are well clothed with hair, generally thickest on the upper surface,[217] is strongly opposed to the supposition that man became naked through the action of the sun. I am inclined to believe, as we shall see under sexual selection, that man, or rather primarily woman, became divested of hair for ornamental purposes; and according to this belief it is not surprising that man should differ so greatly in hairiness from all his lower brethren, for characters gained through sexual selection often differ in closely-related forms to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
