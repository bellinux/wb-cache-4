For a test-particle orbiting a Kerr black hole, each multipolar amplitude is truncated at relative 6 post Newtonian (PN) order, both for the orbital (nonspinning) and <b>spin</b> <b>factors.</b> By taking a certain Padé approximant (typically the P^ 4 _ 2 one) of the orbital factor in conjuction with the inverse Taylor (iResum) representation of the <b>spin</b> <b>factor,</b> {{it is possible to}} push the analytical/numerical agreement of the energy fluxe at the level of 5 % at the last-stable-orbit for a quasi-maximally spinning black hole with dimensionless spin parameter + 0. 99. When the procedure is generalized to comparable-mass binaries, each orbital factor is kept at relative 3 ^+ 3 PN order, i. e. the 3 PN comparable-mass terms are hybridized with higher PN test-particle terms up to 6 PN relative order. The same Padé resummation is used for continuity. By contrast, the <b>spin</b> <b>factor</b> is only kept at the highest comparable-mass PN-order currently available. We illustrate that the consistency between different truncations in the spin content of the waveform amplitudes is stronger in the resummed case than when using the standard Taylor-expanded form of Pan et al.
