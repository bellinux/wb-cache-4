5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{blocked the}} speech, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would shock {{many people and}} would be a grave breach of {{constitutional}} principles. By modern convention, the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers. In seeking the people's support against the government, Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a private individual. Edward's British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.|$|E

Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> all started with Stonewall.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, Portsmouth F.C. {{announced}} plans {{to move away from}} Fratton Park to a new stadium situated on a piece of reclaimed land beside the Historic Dockyard, nicknamed Portsmouth Dockland Stadium. The £600 million mixed-use development, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, would also include 1500 harbourside apartments as well as shops and offices. The scheme attracted criticism due to its large size and location, with some officials <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would interfere with harbour operations. The £600 million project for a new stadium was rejected by the city council due to the financial crisis of 2008.|$|E

He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} military commission, and <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E

Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was mechanically stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E

Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E
