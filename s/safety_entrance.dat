50|$|Originally {{opened on}} July 24, 1993 as Sega World, {{it was the}} first arcade to be opened up by Sega's European {{department}} known as 'Sega Operations UK'. The original floor plan design failed a fire <b>safety</b> check (<b>entrances</b> and exits & layout of machines being main factors) and the site was closed for 2 weeks. During this time, the floor was lowered and the entrance adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 February 2007 {{a second}} {{entrance}} was constructed {{on the opposite}} end of the station to improve <b>safety.</b> The new <b>entrance</b> was opened on 28 May 2008 and leads to the central reservation of Brandenburgischer Straße, between Wittelsbacher and Ballenstedter Straße. The next station is Fehrbelliner Platz (change here for U3) ...|$|R
60|$|For the <b>safety</b> of our <b>entrance</b> upon Omean we {{depended}} largely {{upon the}} very boldness of it, believing {{that it would}} be some little time before the First Born on guard there would realize that it was an enemy and not their own returning fleet that was entering the vault of the buried sea.|$|R
50|$|The Wadsworth Electric Manufacturing Company {{was formed}} by George B. and Harry Wadsworth in 1904. George {{received}} his first patent for an electrical service <b>entrance</b> <b>safety</b> switch in 1907. This device reduced the likelihood of accident or fire and enabled homeowners to replace their own fuses. He received an additional 15 patents in the field between 1907 and 1925. Harry Wadsworth left the business in 1910.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{stations}} on the Silver Line, Tysons Corner has {{an elevated}} island platform and two tracks. Access {{is provided by}} two entrances, one at street level at {{the northwest corner of}} the intersection of Chain Bridge Road and Tysons Boulevard and the other on the southwest corner; the siting of the railway viaduct {{on the north side of}} Chain Bridge Road as well as pedestrian <b>safety</b> means that <b>entrance</b> to the station from this corner is by a pedestrian overpass to a mezzanine above platform level.|$|R
40|$|Ports {{have always}} played {{a vital role}} in {{international}} transportation. Port selection decision is a process that requires consideration of many important and relevant criteria. The selection of the influential decision-making criteria is also a significant and vital issue which demands cautious thoughts. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} weigh the most dominant decision-making criteria by Technique for Order Preference to Similarity by Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and select an optimised container seaport in the Persian Gulf by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) according to decisive port selection factors. This paper presents an extensive review of port selection decision-making attributes in different past studies. Finally, by using TOPSIS and AHP, the findings of this research suggest that the working time, stevedoring rate, <b>safety,</b> port <b>entrance,</b> sufficient draft, capacity of port facilities, operating cost, number of berths, ship chandelling, and international policies are critical factors for selecting container seaport in the Persian Gulf...|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerated}} {{development of}} the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the industry of biologics products, has brought an increase in clinical research and strengthening regulatory agencies to achieve product registration studies in the shortest time and with the required quality under the rules of Good Clinical Practice. For improvement {{of this type of}} research arise Contract Research Organizations (CRO), which allow the development of research and provide services ranging from preclinical studies to conducting and realization of clinical trials. For instance, these companies should know the peculiarities of the product and, to demonstrate <b>safety,</b> efficacy and <b>entrance</b> to pharmaceutical market with a precise indication. In this article we hereby inform you the first CRO in Ecuador to meet these standards for clinical research...|$|R
40|$|Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is {{a service}} to promote traffic fluency and <b>safety</b> in the <b>entrance</b> to ports. This article's purpose has been to explore {{everyday}} operations of the VTS system to gain insights in how it contributes to safe and efficient traffic movements. Interviews, focus groups and an observation have been conducted to collect data about everyday operations, {{as well as to}} grasp how the VTS system adapts to changing operational conditions. The results show that work within the VTS domain is highly complex and that the two systems modelled realise their services vastly differently, which in turn affects the systems' ability to monitor, respond and anticipate. This is of great importance to consider whenever changes are planned and implemented within the VTS domain. Only if everyday operations are properly analysed and understood, it can be estimated how alterations to technology and organisation will affect the overall system performance...|$|R
50|$|The arena was {{designed}} by Ludwig Moshamer, a Berlin architect. It is 102 m wide at its widest point (to {{reduce the amount of}} blasting required, the upper tier of seats was not extended to match the lower), and 30 m (175 steps) deep. According to a contemporary construction periodical, there were originally 6,500 seats and standing room for 5,600. The current capacity is 15,000, the largest open-air theatre in Saxony and the second largest in Germany; under the GDR it was given as 20,000. In 2010, the town further reduced the number of tickets to a maximum of 12,500 as a <b>safety</b> measure. The <b>entrance</b> is at the stage end of the arena; originally the technical equipment was housed under the stage together with an open space presumably intended for permanent displays, as at Halle. Emergency exits at the sides have been added, as well as emergency lighting.|$|R
25|$|When {{the king}} {{went to the}} publicity, he was hidden behind a curtain, and had some of his men in front of him, whose duty {{was to keep the}} masses away from the king and to make his way clear. When one came to the king, he/she had to {{prostrate}} before him, also known as proskynesis. The king was guarded by a group of royal guards, known as the pushtigban. On other occasions, the king was protected by a group of palace guards, known as the darigan. Both of these groups were enlisted from royal families of the Sasanian Empire, and were under the command of the hazarbed, {{who was in charge of}} the king's <b>safety,</b> controlled the <b>entrance</b> of the kings palace, presented visitors to the king, and was allowed to be given military command or used in negotiations. The hazarbed was also allowed in some cases to serve as the royal executioner. During Nowruz (Iranian new year) and Mihragan (Mihr's day), the king would hold a speech.|$|R
5000|$|... "Trouble {{started when}} a {{resident}} of Mumtaz hostel was assaulted and his room set afire", said DIG Aligarh Range, Govind Agarwal, who led the police operations. The victim of the assault rushed to the proctor's office to file his complaint. As soon as news of the incident spread, students belonging to the two rival factions gathered and a clash broke out. Police said that the victim, Mehtaab was shot dead later that night near the Proctor's office where the warring groups exchanged fire. The students set afire a jeep and over half-a-dozen bikes. The mob also indulged in arson and set the proctor's office building on fire. The violence was so widespread that it took the police nearly two hours to control the situation. An official of AMU said that trouble between rival groups belonging to Azamgarh and Sambhal regions has been simmering since quite some time. Rapid Action Force was later deployed at all sensitive spots to ensure <b>safety</b> during the <b>entrance</b> test for the engineering college which was scheduled to happen {{the next day with}} more than 13,000 expected candidates.|$|R
40|$|This review {{identifies}} possible pharmacological {{targets for}} {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) within the IL- 23 /IL- 17 axis. Specifically, there are several targets within the IL- 23 /IL- 17 pathways for potential pharmacological intervention with antibodies or small molecule inhibitors. These targets include TL 1 A (tumor necrosis factor-like molecule), DR 3 (death receptor 3), IL- 23, IL- 17 and the receptors for IL- 23 and IL- 17. As related to IBD, there are also other novel pharmacological targets. These targets include inhibiting specific immunoproteasome subunits, blocking a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism (sphingosine kinase), and modulating NF-κB/STAT 3 interactions. Several good approaches exist for pharmacological inhibition of key components in the IL- 23 and IL- 17 pathways. These approaches include specific monoclonal antibodies to TL 1 A, IL- 17 receptor, Fc fusion proteins, specific antibodies to IL- 17 F, and small molecule inhibitors of IL- 17 like Vidofludimus. Also, other potential approaches for targeted drug development in IBD include specific chemical inhibitors of SK, specific small molecule inhibitors directed against catalytic subunits of the immunoproteasome, and dual inhibitors of the STAT 3 and NF-κB signal transduction systems. In the future, well-designed preclinical studies are still needed to determine which of these pharmacological approaches will provide drugs with the best efficacy and <b>safety</b> profiles for <b>entrance</b> into clinical trials...|$|R
