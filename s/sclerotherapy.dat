5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. <b>Sclerotherapy</b> is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sclerotherapy</b> {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of spider veins and occasionally varicose veins for over 150 years. Like varicose vein surgery, <b>sclerotherapy</b> techniques have evolved during that time. Modern techniques including ultrasonographic guidance and foam <b>sclerotherapy</b> are the latest developments in this evolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sclerotherapy</b> is {{one method}} (along with surgery, {{radiofrequency}} and laser ablation) {{for the treatment}} of spider veins, occasionally varicose veins, and venous malformations. In ultrasound-guided <b>sclerotherapy,</b> ultrasound is used to visualize the underlying vein so the physician can deliver and monitor the injection. <b>Sclerotherapy</b> often takes place under ultrasound guidance after venous abnormalities have been diagnosed with duplex ultrasound. <b>Sclerotherapy</b> under ultrasound guidance and using microfoam sclerosants {{has been shown to be}} effective in controlling reflux from the sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions.|$|E
25|$|A Health Technology Assessment {{found that}} <b>sclerotherapy</b> {{provided}} less benefit than surgery, but {{is likely to}} provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux from the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junctions. It did not study the relative benefits of surgery and <b>sclerotherapy</b> in varicose veins with junctional reflux.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the evolution of}} <b>sclerotherapy</b> was the advent of duplex ultrasonography in the 1980s and its incorporation into the practise of <b>sclerotherapy</b> later that decade. Knight was an early advocate of this new procedure and presented it at several conferences in Europe and the United States. Thibault's article was the first on this topic to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.|$|E
25|$|Aspiration with ethanol <b>sclerotherapy</b> can be {{performed}} {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic simple renal cysts, but can be impractical in advanced patients with multiple cysts. The procedure itself consists in the percutaneous insertion of a needle into the identified cyst, under ultrasound guidance, with subsequent draining the contained liquid; the <b>sclerotherapy</b> is used to avoid liquid reaccumulation that can occur in the cyst, which can result in symptom recurrence.|$|E
25|$|However, {{some authors}} believe that <b>sclerotherapy</b> is not {{suitable}} for veins with reflux from the greater or lesser saphenous junction, or for veins with axial reflux.|$|E
25|$|Gastroscopy (endoscopic {{examination}} of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) is performed in patients with established cirrhosis to exclude the possibility of esophageal varices. If these are found, prophylactic local therapy may be applied (<b>sclerotherapy</b> or banding) and beta blocker treatment may be commenced.|$|E
25|$|Injecting the {{unwanted}} veins with a sclerosing solution causes the target vein to immediately shrink, and then dissolve {{over a period}} of weeks as the body naturally absorbs the treated vein. <b>Sclerotherapy</b> is a non-invasive procedure taking only about 10 minutes to perform. The downtime is minimal, in comparison to an invasive varicose vein surgery.|$|E
25|$|Non-randomised {{controlled}} trials {{conducted in}} the 90s showed that patients with symptomatic simple renal cysts who had recurrence of symptoms after initial response to simple aspiration could be safely submitted to cyst decortication, with a mean pain-free life between 17 and 24 months after surgery. Laparoscopic decortication presents a 5% recurrence rate of renal cysts compared to an 82% recurrence rate obtained with <b>sclerotherapy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colonoscopy {{is useful}} for the {{diagnosis}} and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including: clipping, cauterizing, and <b>sclerotherapy.</b> Preparation for colonoscopy takes a minimum of six hours which in those bleeding briskly may limit its applicability. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI bleeds, is still commonly used to manage lower GI bleeds by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. Angiographic embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI bleeds. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may also be considered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sclerotherapy</b> {{can also}} be {{performed}} using microfoam sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great and small saphenous veins. After {{a map of the}} patient's varicose veins is created using ultrasound, these veins are injected whilst real-time monitoring of the injections is undertaken, also using ultrasound. The sclerosant can be observed entering the vein, and further injections performed so that all the abnormal veins are treated. Follow-up ultrasound scans are used to confirm closure of the treated veins, and any residual varicose veins can be identified and treated.|$|E
25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically includes octreotide or if not available vasopression and nitroglycerin to reduce portal pressures. This is typically in addition to endoscopic banding or <b>sclerotherapy</b> for the varicies. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates {{may be used for}} the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues then balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varicies. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.|$|E
25|$|Further work on {{improving}} the technique {{and development of}} safer more effective sclerosants continued through the 1940s and 1950s. Of particular importance was the development of sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) in 1946, a product still widely used to this day. George Fegan in the 1960s reported treating over 13,000 patients with <b>sclerotherapy,</b> significantly advancing the technique by focussing on fibrosis of the vein rather than thrombosis, concentrating on controlling significant points of reflux, and emphasizing the importance of compression of the treated leg. The procedure became medically accepted in mainland Europe during that time. However it was poorly understood or accepted in England or the United States, a situation that {{continues to this day}} amongst some sections of the medical community.|$|E
25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically include octreotide or, if not available, vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin {{appears to be more}} effective than octreotide, but it is not available {{in many areas of the}} world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or <b>sclerotherapy</b> for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality. Octreotide reduces the need for blood transfusions and may decrease mortality. No trials of vitamin K have been conducted.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a nasogastric tube {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended, in addition to medical management. A number of endoscopic treatments may be used, including: epinephrine injection, band ligation, <b>sclerotherapy,</b> and fibrin glue depending on what is found. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the amount {{of blood in the}} stomach and thus improve the operators view. They also decrease the amount of blood transfusions required. Early endoscopy decreases hospital and the amount of blood transfusions needed. A second endoscopy within a day is routinely recommended by some but by others only in specific situations. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. High and low dose PPIs appear equivalent at this point. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours. Those at low risk of re-bleeding may begin eating typically 24 hours following endoscopy. If other measures fail or are not available, esophageal balloon tamponade may be attempted. While there is a success rate up to 90%, there are some potentially significant complications including aspiration and esophageal perforation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study by}} Kanter and Thibault in 1996 {{reported}} a 76% success rate at 24 months in treating saphenofemoral junction and great saphenous vein incompetence with STS 3% solution. Padbury and Benveniste found that ultrasound guided <b>sclerotherapy</b> {{was effective in}} controlling reflux in the small saphenous vein. Barrett et al. found that microfoam ultrasound guided <b>sclerotherapy</b> was [...] "effective in treating all sizes of varicose veins with high patient satisfaction and improvement in quality of life".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{reported}} attempt at <b>sclerotherapy</b> was by D Zollikofer in Switzerland, 1682 who injected an acid into a vein to induce thrombus formation. [...] Both Debout and Cassaignaic reported success in treating varicose veins by injecting perchlorate of iron in 1853. Desgranges in 1854 cured 16 cases of varicose veins by injecting iodine and tannin into the veins. This was approximately 12 {{years after the}} probable advent of great saphenous vein stripping in 1844 by Madelung. However, due to high rates of side-effects with the drugs used at the time, <b>sclerotherapy</b> had been practically abandoned by 1894. With the improvements in surgical techniques and anaesthetics over that time, stripping became the treatment of choice.|$|E
2500|$|... is a {{procedure}} {{used to treat}} blood vessels or blood vessel malformations (vascular malformations) and also those of the lymphatic system. [...] A medicine is injected into the vessels, which makes them shrink. It is used for {{children and young adults}} with vascular or lymphatic malformations. In adults, <b>sclerotherapy</b> is often used to treat spider veins, smaller varicose veins, hemorrhoids and hydroceles.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{complications}} occur due to {{an intense}} inflammatory reaction to the <b>sclerotherapy</b> agent in the area surrounding the injected vein. [...] In addition, there are systemic complications that are now becoming increasingly understood. [...] These occur when the sclerosant travels through the veins to the heart, lung and brain. [...] A recent report attributed a stroke to foam treatment, although this involved the injection of an unusually large amount of foam.|$|E
2500|$|Foam <b>sclerotherapy</b> is a {{technique}} that involves [...] injecting [...] “foamed sclerosant drugs” within a blood vessel using a pair of syringes – one with sclerosant in it and one with gas (originally air). The original Tessari method has now been modified by the Whiteley-Patel modification which uses 3 syringes, {{all of which are}} silicone free. The sclerosant drugs (sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol) are mixed with air or a physiological gas (carbon dioxide) in a syringe or by using mechanical pumps. This increases the surface area of the drug. The foam sclerosant drug is more efficacious than the liquid one in causing sclerosis (thickening of the vessel wall and sealing off the blood flow), for it does not mix with the blood in the vessel and in fact displaces it, thus avoiding dilution of the drug and causing maximal sclerosant action. It is therefore useful for longer and larger veins. Experts in foam <b>sclerotherapy</b> have created “tooth paste” like thick foam for their injections, which has revolutionized the non-surgical treatment of varicose veins [...] and venous malformations, including [...] Klippel Trenaunay syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|If the sclerosant is {{injected}} properly into the vein, {{there is no}} damage to the surrounding skin, but if it {{is injected}} outside the vein, tissue necrosis and scarring can result. Skin necrosis, whilst rare, can be cosmetically [...] "potentially devastating", [...] and may take months to heal. It is very rare when small amounts of dilute (<0.25%) sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) is used, but has been seen when higher concentrations (3%) are used. Blanching of the skin often occurs when STS is injected into arterioles (small artery branches). Telangiectatic matting, or the development of tiny red vessels, is unpredictable and usually must be treated with repeat <b>sclerotherapy</b> or laser.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sclerotherapy</b> is the [...] "gold standard" [...] and is {{preferred}} over laser for eliminating large spider veins (telangiectasiae) and smaller varicose leg veins. [...] Unlike a laser, the sclerosing solution additionally closes the [...] "feeder veins" [...] {{under the skin}} that are causing the spider veins to form, thereby making a recurrence of the spider veins in the treated area less likely. Multiple injections of dilute sclerosant are injected into the abnormal surface veins of the involved leg. The patient's leg is then compressed with either stockings or bandages that they wear usually for two weeks after treatment. Patients are also encouraged to walk regularly during that time. It is common practice for the patient to require at least two treatment sessions separated by several weeks to significantly improve the appearance of their leg veins.|$|E
