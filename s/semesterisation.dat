50|$|While {{the society}} has {{played host to}} several intervarsity competitions, the Cork IV in its current {{incarnation}} has been hosted since the mid-1990s. The IV is traditionally held on the first weekend of December, though <b>semesterisation</b> in other Irish universities led to consideration of a move to an earlier date in recent years. It is the last Irish IV before the World Universities’ Debating Championships and the first Irish IV {{of the year for}} Ireland’s largest University, UCD, facts which add to the large numbers of teams that enter. Interestingly, until 2007 the Novice Final had only ever been won by teams with at least one former Irish World Schools’ (WSDC) speaker on the team.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the introduction of}} modularisation and <b>semesterisation</b> at ten UK-based business schools. Using this case study evidence, {{it is argued that}} the main reasons for the introduction of these schemes were the personal ambitions of senior managers, pressure from external regulatory agencies and a desire to emulate initiatives undertaken by competitor institutions. In addition, it is suggested that the form of these schemes varied between institutions {{as a consequence of the}} negotiations which accompanied the introduction of these new arrangements, and constraints imposed by the legacy of earlier degree structures, regulations from external agencies, institutional geography, limits on financial resources and the organization of internal management systems. The paper concludes by arguing that these constraints have meant that modularity has had limited effects on the experiences of staff and students, but that <b>semesterisation</b> has significantly increased costs without any accompanying benefits...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Supporting {{engineering}} students throughout their studies places a heavy demand on academic staff. Increasingly, {{to meet the}} challenge of widening participation and <b>semesterisation</b> it is necessary to provide help beyond the scheduled lecture and tutorial periods and to cope with a disparate range of student abilities. This is particularly the case in those topics which are mathematically based as the impact of changes in pre-University education takes its toll. An efficient and effective way of providing the support is through E-learning and the Blackboard Web portal has been used for this purpose [...] Through the use of Blackboard a convenient and effective means of enhancing and improving student learning has evolved. The visual impact of presenting teaching materials using MS PowerPoint has also been evaluated and using this medium an opportunity for students to re-play a lecture in their own time has been provided. This has been found to offer students the opportunity to reinforce their learning and to work at their own pace. These presentations have been integrated into Blackboard by packaging them for delivery via the Web. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{vulnerable}} part of open {{distance learning}} (ODL) is usually viewed as systemic, that is, the misalignment of processes and procedures. For example, ODL fails when marked assignments and tutorial letters with examination guidance do {{not reach the}} students in time to help them prepare for the examinations. This article critically reflects on the views of lecturers in the College of Education at University of South Africa (Unisa) regarding the adoption {{and implementation of the}} semester system. The specific aims of the research were to: Compare {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a semester system with a year system in the training of teachers in an ODL institution; Investigate whether lecturers’ workload increases in a semester system; Look at the quality of teaching regarding feedback and study material in terms of notional hours. The Systems Theory was used as the theoretical background to this research. The focus group consisted of lecturers from the College of Education. The data for this study were collected by means of a literature study, questionnaires and interviews. As respondents, lecturers answered open and closed-ended questions, and indicated their experiences of <b>semesterisation.</b> Curriculum and Instructional Studie...|$|E
40|$|In 2002, a study {{conducted}} within Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) examined the numerical skills of first year engineering students to ascertain {{the impact of these}} skills on their ability to successfully pass the year. The results showed a strong likelihood that students with low numerical skills would withdraw or fail to pass the year. DIT is a multi-level institute, offering engineering programmes at levels six, seven and eight, and also incorporating a “ladder system”, which allows students who perform sufficiently well at one level to proceed into the next. As a result, students of different educational backgrounds often find themselves in the same mathematics module. Anecdotal evidence indicated that particular difficulties were experienced by students who, having completed a level seven programme, proceeded directly into third year of a level eight programme, where a significantly higher level of maths was suddenly demanded. As a result of these, and other, issues, the Students’ Maths Learning Centre (SMLC) was established to provide additional mathematical support for DIT students. Last year, one in ten students from the Faculty of Engineering availed of the SMLC’s drop-in service, with almost a fifth of engineering students making significant use of the SMLC’s online resources. In this paper, we identify the most common problem areas in maths for DIT engineers at various levels, along with the most useful resources for these topics. We also consider the possible effects of <b>semesterisation</b> on the learning of mathematics for engineers, based on patterns of attendance {{over the past couple of}} years. ...|$|E
40|$|Departing from student-led {{evaluations}} of Spanish classrooms {{in a university}} in Canada a few years ago, this chapter focuses on the conditions that space and time impose on our contemporary university classrooms. In those evaluations, students pointed towards the use {{of space and time}} in their universities as {{one of the main reasons}} contributing to failure in language learning. In their journals and interviews, they gave specific examples of the impact of spatial and time constraints on their learning of Spanish and they claimed that the time was ripe for a review of the notions of space and time in order to tackle the issue of language learning in higher education. This chapter attempts at such a review with a description of the physical characteristics of standard language classrooms in our globalized university settings and an analysis of the constraints that the organization of space and time impose on language learning in an aim to offer solutions to overcome these obstacles. It also looks at class timetables and <b>semesterisation</b> in third level European institutions, by offering a sample from a few universities in Ireland and in Spain in order to understand how their classrooms and timetables are organized. Through a series of short open-ended surveys at the same higher education institutions, it takes into account the influence of timetable and calendars on student engagement. It points towards the promotion of space-time awareness and examines the scope available both for language teachers and students to manage these two variables. It investigates the influence of virtual spaces for language learning (social networks and open source materials) as they are used in these universities in order to cope with time and space constraints and to support our students in their race to attain their goals in language learning.

40|$|In Dublin Institute of Technology, {{there has}} been a recent move to <b>semesterisation,</b> with an {{increased}} emphasis on continuous assessment. In mathematics, this would traditionally mean that students would sit a number of short, written assessments during the course of each semester, in conjunction with an end-of-module exam. However, it was decided to combine these usual assessments with presentations on mathematics for certain cohorts this semester. As part of their continuous assessment mark, students were required to work in groups of three, to prepare and deliver a short presentation to their classmates. Two techniques were employed: in one instance, third-year Engineering students gave presentations revising one of a selection of fundamental mathematical topics studied in previous years; in the second instance, second-year Product Design students explored possible applications of the mathematics they had studied to their other modules or future careers. The aim of the first technique was to ensure that students were familiar with core mathematical concepts, which would be necessary for the new topics they would meet in the coming year. It also allowed them to experience the challenge of presenting this material in a clear and interesting fashion, giving them a new appreciation for the position of the lecturer. The second technique was employed to encourage students to consider the relevance of mathematical topics to their area of study, providing them with an opportunity to discover the importance of fundamental mathematical concepts in the design process. In both cases, the students developed an important skill for the workplace in which they may often be required to give presentations on technical matters. Every group in the class was required to anonymously award a mark out of ten to each presentation, and these marks were combined to produce the final mark. The lecturer also awarded a mark to each group, and this was compared to the mean mark awarded by the students, to examine the difference between this and the peer-marking system. Arising from this, some possible issues associated with peer marking are discussed. In addition to the presentation itself, students were required to complete a reflective survey on WebCT. The purpose of this was two-fold: to encourage the students to reflect on their own learning experience and how the presentations had contributed to this; and also to provide valuable feedback to staff as to students’ perceptions of this learning methodology. The results of this survey are provided in the paper...|$|E
