5|$|Governor Dayton {{formally}} {{proposed a}} state budget on February 15, calling for $37 billion in <b>state</b> <b>spending,</b> necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies. Because {{the state was}} projected to take in only about $32 billion in taxes, {{the rest of the}} budget shortfall was covered by increases to income and property taxes for wealthier Minnesotans, as he had promised during his campaign. Meanwhile, Republican legislators, led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch, demanded the budget be kept below $32 billion.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of <b>state</b> <b>spending.</b>|$|E

Marostica edged out McNaught in the Republican primary by about 250 votes, or 5% of voters. In contrast with McNaught's conservative credentials, Marostica was considered by observers on both {{the left and the right}} to be a moderate Republican; he supported Colorado's 2005 Referendum C, a loosening of <b>state</b> <b>spending</b> restrictions under the state's Taxpayer Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1977, beginning a gradual decline in Fairbanks' economy. The loss of construction spending was mostly offset by <b>state</b> <b>spending.</b> Taxes on oil {{flowing through the}} pipeline were spent on low-interest loans, grants, and business assistance that poured money into the city. To entice businesses to return to downtown Fairbanks, the city demolished many of the bars favored by pipeline workers and attempted to attract a hotel or major business to the location. This effort was unsuccessful, and the land remained vacant until the late 1990s. Redevelopment of the Fairbanks airport was more successful. A new terminal built in 1984 functioned until 2009.|$|E

40|$|Many {{believe the}} high level of United States health care costs {{compared}} with other countries is attributable to high administrative costs inherent in our pluralistic health care financing system. Instead of the well known statistics examining the percentage of GDP that various countries spend on health care, which show the US as a large outlier, we show the percentage of Gross State Product various <b>states</b> <b>spend</b> on health care. Even adjusting for age and income, there is considerable variation across the <b>states</b> in <b>spending</b> levels, with the lowest quintile of <b>states</b> <b>spending</b> approximately the same percentage as the higher spending OECD countries other than the US. This implies that the US' pluralistic financing system may not be an important cause of the large percentage of GDP that the US devotes to health care. Even in the low <b>spending</b> <b>states,</b> however, absolute amounts of spending are higher than in other OECD countries. Although a more centralized payment system may be a sufficient condition to spend at the percentages of GDP found in northern Europe, it is not a necessary condition. ...|$|R
