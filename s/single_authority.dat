The general Bengali Muslim clergy remains deeply orthodox and conservative. Members of the clergy include Mawlānās, Imams, Ulamas, and Muftis.|$|E

A select committee of both Houses of the Northern Ireland Parliament was appointed to review the reports. It completed its deliberations in mid 1939 and recommended that the Government should compel the NIRTB and the railways to co-ordinate their services. The political climate in the late summer of 1939 was, however, such that no action would be taken and the unsatisfactory transport situation continued.|$|E

This task requires a comprehensive plan for the whole area designed to secure the benefit of its port, its industries and its commerce, the reclamation of its marshlands, the building of new roads and bridges, the renewal of obsolete parts of the old riverside development, the designing of new centres and the provision of new amenities. This formidable task gives scope not for ten authorities to develop or redevelop ten towns but for a <b>single</b> <b>authority</b> to work out the details of the probable future growth and needs of Tees-side, and then prepare and carry out a single plan for the whole area.|$|E
25|$|The {{commissioned}} {{ranks in}} the BSAP were entirely white, {{but the number of}} black constables in its ranks gradually rose, with many being recruited abroad. This kind of recruitment was not uncommon in colonial Africa, as many white officials of the day believed that blacks who policed their own communities were easily corruptible, and often not inclined to properly ensure the payment of colonial institutions such as hut tax. In Southern Rhodesia, many constables came from Barotseland, Zululand and Zanzibar. Locally sourced black policemen were officially reintroduced to Matabeleland in 1904; that year the force nominally contained 550 whites and 500 blacks. The SRC was merged into the BSAP in 1909, putting law enforcement in Southern Rhodesia into the hands of a <b>single</b> <b>authority</b> for the first time. Following the end of Company rule in 1923, the BSAP endured as Southern Rhodesia's police force.|$|E
25|$|Interstate 10 (I-10) is {{the major}} east–west Interstate Highway in the Southern United States. In the U.S. state of Texas, it runs east from Anthony, at the border with New Mexico, through El Paso, San Antonio and Houston to the border with Louisiana in Orange, Texas. At just under , the Texas segment of I-10, {{maintained}} by the Texas Department of Transportation, is the longest continuous untolled freeway in North America that is operated by a <b>single</b> <b>authority,</b> a title formerly held by Ontario Highway 401. It is also the longest stretch of highway with a single designation within a single state. Mile marker 880 and its corresponding exit number in Orange, Texas are the highest numbered mile marker and exit on any freeway in North America, with Interstate 5 in California coming in second with mile marker 796 and corresponding exit. After widening was completed in 2008, {{a portion of the}} highway west of Houston is now also believed to be the widest in the world, at 26 lanes. There is a wider section in China on the G4 Beijing–Hong Kong–Macau Expressway, however that section is a toll plaza approach.|$|E

25|$|Vietnam's {{recorded}} history stretches {{back to the}} mid-to-late 3rd century BCE, when Âu Lạc and Nanyue (Nam Việt in Vietnamese) were established (Nanyue conquered Âu Lạc in 179 BCE). Pre-historic Vietnam was {{home to some of}} the world's earliest civilizations and societies—making them one of the world's first people who practiced agriculture. The Red River valley formed a natural geographic and economic unit, bounded to the north and west by mountains and jungles, to the east by the sea and to the south by the Red River Delta. The need to have a <b>single</b> <b>authority</b> to prevent floods of the Red River, to cooperate in constructing hydraulic systems, trade exchange, and to fight invaders, {{led to the creation of}} the first Vietnamese states approximately 2879BC. Another truly influential part of history in Vietnam occurred during the late Bronze Age, when the Đông Sơn culture dramatically advanced the civilization. Vietnam's peculiar geography made it a difficult country to attack, which is why Vietnam under the Hùng kings was for so long an independent and self-contained state. The Xích Tỵs and Qins were among the earliest foreign aggressors of Vietnam, but the ancient Vietnamese managed to regain control of the country soon after the invasions.|$|E
500|$|Concerned by {{the exodus}} of so many whites from the Cape and Natal, and taking the view that they {{remained}} British subjects, the British Governor Sir Harry Smith in 1848 annexed the area between the Orange and Vaal rivers as the [...] "Orange River Sovereignty". A Boer commando led by Pretorius against this was defeated by Smith at the Battle of Boomplaats. Pretorius also lived in the Magaliesberg mountains and often hosted the young Kruger, who greatly admired the elder man's resolve, sophistication and piety. A warm relationship developed. [...] "Kruger's political awareness can be dated from 1850", Meintjes writes, [...] "and it was {{in no small measure}} given to him by Pretorius." [...] Like Pretorius, Kruger wanted to centralise the emigrants under a <b>single</b> <b>authority</b> and win British recognition for this as an independent state. This last point was not due to hostility to Britain—neither Pretorius nor Kruger was particularly anti-British—but because they perceived the emigrants' unity as under threat if the Cape administration continued to regard them as British subjects.|$|E
500|$|The {{objective}} of regulation is to [...] "promote {{high standards of}} safety {{in all aspects of}} aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, pilot qualification, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the European Union (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the <b>single</b> <b>authority</b> throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.|$|E

Alternatively, they also have more autonomy at conducting rent dissipating activities. We estimate a modified McFadden symmetric generalized cost function for airports to distinguish among technical efficiency, optimal input use (allocative efficiency), and technical change over time. We find authorities have a significantly higher level of technical efficiency. Cities, however, appear more nimble at adopting labor cost saving innovations over time. About 1 / 3 of the cost saving, however, appears to be dissipated through higher employee wages, and a slower rate of labor saving technical change...|$|R
