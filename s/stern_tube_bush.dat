50|$|An {{effective}} <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> {{and associated}} bearings were required. The <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> contains the propeller shaft where {{it passes through}} the hull structure. It should provide an unrestricted delivery of power by the propeller shaft. The combination of hull and <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> must avoid any flexing that will bend the shaft or cause uneven wear. The inboard end has a stuffing box that prevents water from entering the hull along the <b>tube.</b> Some early <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> were made of brass and operated as a water lubricated bearing along the entire length. In other instances a long bush of soft metal was fitted in the after end of the <b>stern</b> <b>tube.</b> The Great Eastern had this arrangement fail on her first transatlantic voyage, with very large amounts of uneven wear. The problem was solved with a lignum vitae water-lubricated bearing, patented in 1858. This became standard practice and is in use today.|$|R
40|$|The {{lubricating}} {{performance of}} a segment-type seawater lubricated <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing is examined in this paper. The effect {{that the number of}} bearing segments and water supply grooves has on bearing load capacity is clarified. When there are few segments and the width is wide, the load capacity of <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing becomes greater. If a relative inclination exists between the propeller shaft and <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing, the pressure on the bearing stern edge will increase. In this paper, a quantitative evaluation of this pressure is also presented...|$|R

40|$|To {{respond to}} the recent {{increase}} in container transportation {{and the pursuit of}} higher economic efficiency of ocean transportation, container ships are getting bigger and have higher propulsive power. Due to the increased propulsive power and propeller thrust, the propeller weights and the propeller shaft forces of these ships have become larger than those of past ones. Also the risk of uneven contact and seizure of the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearings is increasing. Therefore, the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing design has become very important. By considering not only propeller weights but also propeller shaft forces for the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing designs, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.

50|$|A {{stuffing}} box of a sailboat {{will have a}} <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the <b>stern</b> <b>tube,</b> the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nonlinear friction-induced {{vibration}} deteriorated {{the performance}} of marine rubber <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearings (RSTB) {{in a wide variety}} of propulsion system. In the paper, this study was performed on the level of both practical and experimental bifurcation analysis. Hereto, an experimental set-up of SSB- 100 marine <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing test machine was applied to carry on this project. The synthesis of these practical and experimental results confirmed that nonlinear friction-induced vibration was due to a subtle balance of negative damping at lower speeds or viscous friction at higher speeds. Furthermore, it was shown how these essential friction characteristics depended on physical conditions such as temperature, normal forces and the material properties in the frictional contact...|$|R

50|$|Early submarines, {{when they}} carried torpedoes, were {{fitted with a}} variety of torpedo {{launching}} mechanisms in a range of locations; on the deck, in the bow or stern, amidships, with some launch mechanisms permitting the torpedo to be aimed over a wide arc. By World War 2, designs favoured multiple bow tubes and fewer or no <b>stern</b> <b>tubes.</b> Modern submarine bows are usually occupied by a large sonar array, necessitating midships tubes angled outward, while <b>stern</b> <b>tubes</b> have largely disappeared. The first French and Russian submarines carried their torpedoes externally in Drzewiecki drop collars. These were cheaper than tubes, but less reliable. Both the United Kingdom and United States experimented with external tubes in World War II. External tubes offered a cheap and easy way of increasing torpedo capacity without radical redesign, something neither had time or resources to do prior to, or early in, the war. British T class submarines carried up to 13 torpedo tubes, up to 5 of them external. America's use was mainly limited to earlier Porpoise-, Salmon-, and Sargo-class boats. Until the appearance of the Tambor, most American submarines only carried 4 bow and either 2 or 4 <b>stern</b> <b>tubes,</b> something many American submarine officers felt provided inadequate firepower. This problem was compounded by the notorious unreliability of the Mark 14 torpedo.|$|R
50|$|For 9 weeks Houston {{was stuck}} in port while a special team from Pearl Harbor {{repaired}} the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing.

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 December, she sighted a darkened ship {{believed}} to be a large cargo carrier. A torpedo spread was fired from the <b>stern</b> <b>tubes,</b> but they all passed ahead of the ship due to an error in her estimated speed.

40|$|Simulation {{calculations}} {{has been}} performed {{for measuring the}} elastohydrodynamic lubrication characteristics of a <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearing, and several main characteristic values has been determined. If it is not parallel to the propeller shaft and <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> bearings, {{the magnitude of the}} maximum oil film pressure generated in the bearing increases significantly. The magnitude of the maximum oil film pressure generated is greatly affected by the attitude angle of the shaft. As the attitude angle of the shaft is varied from 90 to 180 degrees, the maximum oil film pressure gradually increases. If the eccentricity at the centre of the bearing, the angle of the shaft centre relative to the bearing centre and the attitude angle of the shaft can be determined, then it is possible to quantitatively determine the maximum oil film pressure taking the elastic deformation of the bearing into account by the method described in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a stuffing box, also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a <b>stern</b> <b>tube,</b> also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the <b>stern</b> <b>tube</b> and the stuffing box. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|R
