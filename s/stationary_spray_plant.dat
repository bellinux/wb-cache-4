Major pests recorded in the study site were Melanagromyza vignalis Spencer (Diptera : Agromyzidae), Marucatestulalis Geyer (Lepidoptera : Pyralidae), Cydia ptychora Meyrick (Lepidoptera : Tortricidae), Heliothis armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera : Noctuidae), Aphis craccivora Koch (Homoptera : Aphididae), Apion species (Coleoptera : Curculionidae), Coreid bugs (Heteroptera : Coreidae), and Bruchids (Coleoptera : Bruchidae).

40|$|<b>Spray</b> <b>planting</b> {{engineering}} method {{had been}} applied {{for more than}} thirty years. The <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> apparatus has been continuously ameliorated and the applied materials are more diversified. This method is mostly applied on cutting slope and nature sliding area. We found that <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> method has highly economic benefit and can stabilize slope environment. In this study, ‘Tension Soil Flock’(TSF) <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> method and the Acacia confusa、Lespedeza bicolor and Cynodon dactylon’s seeds was chosen as tested specimen. The germination rate of these species in different mulching thickness of the <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> mixture will be determined. Two construction sites were chosen as study areas those had been vegetated using the ‘TSF’ <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> method. The construction sites included a landslide slope and a mudstone slope where are in Ming-De Reservoir and Tian-Liao. Both sites were convinced those are difficult to recovery by using vegetation engineering method. In this study, the vegetative characteristics and the plant physiological were investigated. In the meanwhile, the physical and chemical characteristic of planting mixture were analyzed, which will provide the suggestion of the improvement and manufacture of <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> mixture of this method. The results are summarized as the following: 1. According to the physical and chemical analysis data of the <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> mixture, the percentage of available nutrient were apparently higher in the mixture and in the ‘Jet Soil’ material than in the Gravel Red soil or the mudstone soil. The ’Polyesters’ were treated as adhesive agent, {{it also has the}} ability to aggregate soil. As the result of the three-phase experiment of the mixture, it is the best policy to control concentration of the Polyesters within 0. 3 %. 2. The mixture has highly water holding capacity, and the field moisture arise while the consistency of the Polyesters increase. After knowing the retention ability of the mixture, the maintenance schedule could be made. Different plant species need varied soil moisture during the germination stage, so the maintenance schedule should be modified depend on plant species. 3. The germination rate of Acacia confusa、Lespedeza bicolor and Cynodon dactylon was inhibited both by mulching thickness and stickiness of the aggregate agents. Although the negative influence on the germination of Acacia confusa and Cynodon dactylon was not serious, Lespedeza bicolor’s seed cannot germinate well in mixture with heavy stickiness. Whenever to apply these species in the same time, the concentration of the mixture could be set at about 0. 2 %. 4. The physiological responses, including net photosynthesis, leaf conductance, Ci/Ca, vapor pressure differential(VPD), transportation and water use efficiency(WUE) were affected by light intensity and ambient CO 2 concentration of the same temperature and humidity circumstance. The physiological factors were apparently varied with the light intensity and CO 2 concentration. The compensation intensity of light of Acacia confusa’s and Lespedeza bicolor’s were between 0 - 100 μmolm- 2 s- 1 and the compensation concentration of CO 2 were between 30 - 50 ppm and 50 - 70 ppm respectively. The saturation intensity of light of Acacia confusa’s and Lespedeza bicolor’s were between 800 - 1200 μmolm- 2 s- 1 and 400 - 800 μmolm- 2 s- 1 respectively. The physiological responses remained in steady except the photosynthesis and water use efficiency descend while the light intensity were higher than the saturation point. 5. The water use efficiencies (WUE) of Acacia confusa’s and Lespedeza bicolor’s WUE were 0. 4 % and 0. 22 % respectively. Because Acacia confusa has higher WUE than other species, it became the main species during the drought season. The leaves of Lespedeza bicolor will fall off in order to reduce water consuming during the drought season. We suppose that Acacia confusa is a xerophilous plant and Lespedeza bicolor is a xerophobous <b>plant.</b> 6. After <b>spray</b> <b>planting</b> on slope treated with netting about year later, the soil samples had been taken and analyzed. The amount of Fe 2 + and Zn 2 + in the soil increased tremendously. The phenomena indicated that the plants growing at the construction sites may injured by the toxicity of absorbing excessive Fe 2 + and Zn 2 +. It is worth for further study to considerate about either change the density of the net or leave out netting. 噴植工法之引進與應用迄今有近三十年，噴植機具不斷改良，應用材料更具多樣性，在多數人為開挖坡面或自然裸露之崩塌地施行，應用噴植方法之整體經濟效益及坡面穩定效益頗佳，且噴植施工迅速安全亦能克服各種崩塌坡面環境應力，將是未來植生復育應用工法的趨勢。本研究選取連續纖維團粒噴植工法(TSF噴植工法) 應用之噴植基材，配合相思樹、胡枝子、百慕達草等三種植物種子進行材料特性分析及不同噴植設計厚度下種子之發芽試驗，並選取苗栗縣明德水庫南側崩塌地及高雄縣田寮泥岩地區作為試驗區，此二處均為植生復育困難度頗高之地點，於兩處施工地點進行植生調查及植物生理反應測定，提供此工法爾後在施工設計及種子材料應用之參考。茲將結果摘要如下： 1. 由噴植基材之特性分析結果，得知客土材料與噴植基材之養分含量比率頗高。團粒劑在基材中除充當噴植黏著劑外，對於土壤之團粒化具有明顯之效果，由基材土壤三相之試驗結果，團粒劑之使用量其重量百分率濃度控制在 0. 3 ％以內為宜。 2. 噴植基材具有良好之水分保持能力，基材含愈高之團粒劑濃度具有較高之田間容水量。由基材之保水能力訂定養護週期，但實際應用時仍須針對不同植物種子發芽生長所需之土壤水分加以修正。 3. 相思樹、胡枝子、百慕達草之發芽情形受到設計厚度之影響。團粒劑使用量增加造成基材黏滯度提高，對於相思樹及百慕達草發芽影響較小，胡枝子則不適合應用於高黏滯度之噴植基材中。同時使用此三種植物時，以將基材團粒劑濃度控制於 0. 2 ％為最適宜。 4. 在相同之溫、濕渡環境下，植物之淨光合成率、氣孔導度、Ci/Ca值、葉內外蒸汽壓差、蒸散率、用水效率等生理因子，在不同光度及CO 2 條件下具有明顯之差異，相思樹與胡枝子之光補償點在 0 - 100 μmolm- 2 s- 1 之間，CO 2 補償點分別在 30 - 50 ppm及 50 - 70 ppm之間，光飽和點隨CO 2 濃度之供應而改變，分別在 800 - 1200 μmolm- 2 s- 1 及 400 - 800 μmolm- 2 s- 1 之間，在光飽和點之後除淨光合成率及用水效率呈下降趨勢外，其他因子皆維持較穩定之情況。 5. 由植物生理試驗得知，旱季時相思樹之用水效率約為 0. 4 ％，能適應乾旱之氣候，為旱季時之優勢樹種。胡枝子在旱季時之用水效率約為 0. 22 ％，於旱季時落葉以減少水分之消耗量，推測胡枝子應屬於乾旱躲避型之植物 。 6. 採行鋪網噴植之方式，鐵絲網在鏽蝕之後滲入土壤，造成土壤中鐵、鋅含量大量增加，對於部分植物可能造成在生長上之負面影響，因此在施工安全性及坡面穩定無虞之前提下，是否改變鋪網之密度或可於立地條件較佳之緩坡省略鋪網之施工，在技術上仍須進一步探討。目錄 頁次 中文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅰ 英文摘要…………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅲ 圖次………………………………………………………………… [...] Ⅴ 表次……………………………………………………………. …….

D.) {{experiment}} with three replicates {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of foliar application of magnesium salts on growth, yield components and some inorganic minerals of leaves of garlic (Allium sativum L.) local variety. The salts (MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O, Mg(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O and MgCl 2. 6 H 2 O) addition to untreated plants as control. The concentration of Mg were used was constant (1. 97 g Mg. L- 1 which comes from 2 % MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O). The results revealed that vegetative growth of garlic was affected significantly by magnesium salts. Highest number of leaves was found in plants treated with MgCl 2, the treatment which gave the lowest plant height, each of MgSO 4 and Mg(NO 3) 2 had the highest shoot dry weight. Foliar spraying with Mg(NO 3) 2 produced highest shoot dry matter percent and highest percent of leaves Phosphorus leaves content, significantly compared to other treatments. The results showed that <b>spraying</b> <b>plants</b> with Mg(NO 3) 2 and MgSO 4 improved yield components where head diameter, head weight, cloves number per head and bulbs yield were increased. Foliar spray with MgSO 4 had a significant effects on head scale thickness, whereas there were non- significant effects between different Magnesium salts spraying on each of clove dry matter and percent of TSS content. This study concluded that <b>spraying</b> <b>plants</b> with MgSO 4 or Mg(NO 3) 2 twice (45 days after planting and a month later) increased garlic yield and yield quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} foliar sprays with aqueous vermicompost {{extracts}} on growth, yields, morphological and chemical fruit quality and natural infection with late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans(Mont.) de Bary)) on three tomato varieties (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Diplom F 1, cv. Matina, cv. Rheinlands Ruhm) {{was investigated in}} a field experiment. Extracts were prepared of vermicompost produced from fruit, vegetable and cotton waste by redworms (Eisenia fetida Sav., Lumbricidae); tap water served as control treatment. Foliar application (spraying) of vermicompost extracts did not affect plant growth, biomass or nutrient allocation, or yields and number of fruits of the three tomato varieties; however, for several dates it significantly {{reduced the number of}} flowers produced. Foliar vermicompost spraying either increased or decreased peel firmness dependent on tomato variety and increased fruit circumference consistently as well as contents of nitrogen but decreased L-ascorbic acid compared with water sprayed fruits. All other measured parameters of fruit quality (dry matter, C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, glucose and fructose content) were similar for vermicompost and water <b>sprayed</b> <b>plants.</b> Natural infection of leaves, stems and fruits by P. infestans was generally very low under the experimental conditions; however, across varieties, only half as many vermicompost <b>sprayed</b> <b>plants</b> showed clear signs of P. infestans infection as water sprayed plants; the severity of the infection was unaffected by the two spraying treatments. In conclusion, these results suggest that the use of vermicompost might be considered more in organic farming not only as a substitute for peat in potting media but also as foliar sprays for fertilization and biological disease prevention...|$|R
50|$|For small {{backyard}} infestations, simply <b>spraying</b> the <b>plants</b> thoroughly with {{a strong}} water jet every few days may be sufficient protection for roses and other plants. An insecticidal soap solution {{can be an effective}} household remedy to control aphids and other soft-bodied arthropods. It will only kill aphids on contact and has no residual action against aphids that arrive after application.

50|$|<b>Spraying</b> <b>plants</b> with {{streptomycin}} or injecting {{plants with}} oxytetracycline can prevent new infections. The {{widespread use of}} streptomycin spray has led to antibiotic resistance in some areas, such as California and Washington. Certain biological controls consisting of beneficial bacteria or yeast can also prevent fire blight from infecting new trees. The only effective treatment for plants already infected is to prune off the affected branches and remove them from the area. Plants or trees should be inspected routinely for the appearance of new infections. The rest of the plant can be saved if the blighted wood is removed before the infection spreads to the roots. There is no known cure; prevention is the key.|$|R
40|$|Potential {{bacterial}} and fungal antagonists {{were isolated}} from rhizosphere soils and soils taken from rice fields. These were screened in vitro {{for their ability}} to suppress Rhizoctonia solani on agar medium. One isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens and one isolate of Bacillus subtilis were selected from one-hundred and twelve isolates of potential bacterial antagonists. One isolate of Trichoderma koningii was selected from sixty-seven isolates of potential fungal antagonists. They were selected for in vivo experiment {{on the basis of their}} ability to suppress mycelial growth and sclerotial production. The selected bacterial and fungal antagonists were tested in vivo in a greenhouse experiment for suppression of sheath blight disease development. Seed treatment, rice root dipping, and <b>plant</b> <b>spraying</b> were used for both single and combined antagonist applications. Better suppression of sheath blight disease development was obtained from seed treatment and <b>plant</b> <b>spraying.</b> The two bacterial antagonist applications gave better sheath blight suppression than the fungal antagonist. Application of individual antagonists was more effective than the combined applications (the concentration of bacterial and fungal antagonists in the combination treatments was 50 % of the antagonists applied singly). Seed treatment and <b>plant</b> <b>spraying</b> were selected as two application methods for a field experiment. Antagonists applied by <b>spraying</b> <b>plants</b> one day before Rhizoctonia solani inoculation gave the best suppression of sheath blight disease development. Both Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis established colonies on rice seeds, rice roots, and rice stems after application. Epidemiological data such as temperature and relative humidity should be used to predict the likelihood of Rhizoctonia solani infection so that the effectiveness of antagonist application can be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|Page(s) : 6 (2), 27 - 39, 6 RefThe {{response}} of guava seedlings, grown under nursery conditions, to foliar application of different fertilizer materials was studied. Three foliar fertilizers were used, namely Foliar-X, Compound Cryst and Bayfolan. The potted seedlings were sprayed 12 {{times during the}} study period of 6 months, using recommended concentrations. Data were recorded on the following growth parameters: plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, relative growth rate, leaf area and fresh and dry weights of leaves, stems and roots. Leaf nutrients content was determined at the termination of the experiment. The results showed that all foliar fertilizers resulted in significantly higher values of all growth parameters than the control. The highest values of all growth parameters were obtained in <b>plants</b> <b>sprayed</b> with the Foliar-X, followed by Compound Cryst and then Bayfolan. Leaf-N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn contents were significantly greater in the <b>sprayed</b> <b>plants</b> than the control.

40|$|Phenomena on {{millisecond}} {{time scale}} during the transient ignition {{process in a}} cryogenic model rocket combustor, like flame propagation, flame/spray interaction, and flame stabilization have not been investigated in detail up to now. Diagnostic techniques developed for characterizing the <b>stationary</b> <b>spray</b> flame are applied to investigate the transient evolution of the LOX-spray and the flame front during the ignition process. Ignition was initiated by focusing a pulsed laser into the combustion chamber. Thus ignition {{time as well as}} the position of ignition was well defined. This and the exact control of the delay between ignition and detection time allowed to observe the evolution of the flame front. The distribution of the liquid phase of LOX-droplets have been determined by light-sheet techniques using a double pulsed laser system. Simultaneously the position of the flame front is measured by recordimg the spontaneous emission of the OH-radical. By varying the delay time Pi between ignition and detection in a series of the test runs the transient ignition phenomena have been investigated in the interval from 0 to 5 ms after ignition...|$|R
