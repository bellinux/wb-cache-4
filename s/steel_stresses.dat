Firstly, the elasto-plastic and the elasto-visco-plastic return algorithms are compared. A method is introduced which allows to simulate the elasto-plastic solution within an iterative procedure where no derivative of the yield function is needed. Secondly, the update of stresses within the supplementary slip model is discussed. The <b>steel</b> <b>stress</b> is initially overestimated due to the perfect bond assumption in the global stiffness matrix. The supplementary slip model relaxes this <b>steel</b> <b>stress,</b> thus even within a monotonically increasing external load a reverse loading situation is obtained numerically within the iterations. Two stress update techniques will be discussed, where this overestimation of the <b>steel</b> <b>stress</b> never results in plastic strain {{at the end of}} the iteration. Finally, the number of sample points employed for the stress recovery is discussed.

30|$|In members having {{high-strength}} reinforcing bars, {{early studies}} showed that an increase in crack width is due {{to an increase in}} <b>steel</b> <b>stress</b> and, to a lesser extent, due to an increase in the curvature of the member. Thomas (1936) pointed out that an increase in the curvature at a constant <b>steel</b> <b>stress</b> tends to distribute the cracking rather than widening individual cracks. An increase in the <b>steel</b> <b>stress</b> affects the difference in the elongation between the reinforcing steel and concrete and causes additional slip to occur. This slip is the main cause of the increase in crack size. Slip occurs in the vicinity of a crack and extends to a point where the differential strain is zero. At that point the bond stress and resistance to slip reach maximum values and decrease toward the mid-point between cracks. The overall values of bond force decrease with an increase in load. This decrease is attributed to (a) the effects of the increase in transverse contraction of the reinforcing bar (i.e., Poisson effect) and (b) the deterioration of the concrete at the concrete-steel interface (Odman 1962). Therefore, the crack width increases while the crack spacing remains constant. If the load is increased further, the slip between concrete and reinforcement continues to increase. Due to the comparatively low values of concrete extensibility, the increase in crack width can be considered essentially equal to the accumulation of the slip between adjacent cracks.|$|R
30|$|In the truss-arch model, the shear {{resistant}} {{mechanism is}} explicitly considered as the truss action superimposing an arch action. Arch action in RC members subjected to shear force {{has been recognized}} by many researchers (Ichinose 1992; Kim et al. 1998). Especially, for members with low shear span-to-depth ratio, if the arch action is not taken into account, the shear stiffness tends to be underestimated. Ichinose (1992) presented a truss-arch model and proposed a design equation to prevent shear failure after the inelastic flexural deformation, which has been adopted in the Architectural Institute of Japan Design Guidelines (AIJ 1994). On {{the basis of the}} experimentally measured <b>steel</b> <b>stresses</b> over the shear span in the RC beams, Kim et al. (1998) proposed an empirical coefficient, which represents arch action contribution to the total shear capacity. Pan et al.

The steel fibers are suitable as shear reinforcement especially in thin members such as slabs and thin webs, where the use of shear reinforcement is not possible. An incremental- iterative method which utilizes the equations of equilibrium, compatibility of deformations and materials constitutive relationships is employed to find out the complete response of beams under increasing shear loads.

The influence of steel stress and concrete cover on crack widths close to the reinforcement and at the concrete surface has been investigated. The {{results show that the}} main features of cracking behaviour for axially loaded prisms and beams are similar. Beams resemble axially loaded prisms in that cone-shaped concrete failure occurs in the bond zone where the bar meets a crack. At higher <b>steel</b> <b>stresses</b> this concrete cone follows the displacement. For this reason crack widths close to the bar are significantly smaller and much less affected by the thickness of concrete cover than at the concrete surface.

40|$|When high {{strength}} steel is used as reinforcement in lightweight concrete members, great economies can be achieved. However, because lightweight concrete has low tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, the working <b>steel</b> <b>stresses</b> hoped for may not be fully utilised due to the limit states of serviceability (cracking and deflection) not being satisfied. To control the amount of cracking and deflection in flexural concrete members, {{a new type of}} construction has been employed, whereby precast fibre reinforced cement (f. r. c) units in the form of thin channels are used as a surface reinforcement at the flexural tensile zone of the concrete members. The concrete in the tensile zone, confined by the f. r. c channel, will have a greater resistance to formation and extension of crack; consequently the rate of reduction in the flexural rigidity of the member will be decreased.

In some latest reinforced concrete codes and manuals, the basic assumption regarding such calculations {{lies in the}} relationship between the mean steel (or concrete) strain and the steel strain in a fully cracked section. The authors have established a state-of-the-art for such relationships. All proposed formulas can practically be written in the following form: {Mathematical expression} where ε m stands for the mean steel and concrete strain, ε s the steel strain in a cracked section and where Δθ represents the tension stiffening effect of concrete lying between the cracks. Various propositions have been made for the relationship between Δθ and the <b>steel</b> <b>stress</b> (e. g. constant, linear, hyperbolic,); other important factors too are the strength of concrete in tension and the reinforcement ratio. Considering that little experimental evidence supports the various propositions, an experimental program on thirteen reinforced concrete prisms (ties) subjected to uniaxial tension was carried out. The influence of the reinforcement ratio is especially studied. Careful assessment of the validity of previous formulas is made.

40|$|Most of the {{industrial}} steel chimneys are tall structures with circular cross-sections. Such slender, lightly damped structures are prone to wind-exited vibration. Geometry of a self supporting steel chimney {{plays an important role}} in its structural behaviour under lateral dynamic loading. This is because geometry is primarily responsible for the stiffness parameters of the chimney. However, basic dimensions of industrial self supporting steel chimney, such as height, diameter at exit, etc., are generally derived from the associated environmental conditions. To ensure a desired failure mode design code (IS- 6533 : 1989 Part 2) imposes several criteria on the geometry (top-to-base diameter ratio and height-to-base diameter ratio) of steel chimneys. The objective of the present study is to justify the code criteria with regard to basic dimensions of industrial steel chimney. A total of 66 numbers self supporting steel flared unlined chimneys with different top-to-base diameter ratio and height-to-base diameter ratio were considered for this study. The thickness of the chimney was kept constant for all the cases. Maximum bending moment and stress for all the chimneys were calculated for dynamic wind load as per the procedure given in IS 6533 : 1989 (Part 2) using MathCAD software.

The crack plane is crossed perpendicularly by embedded reinforcing bars, each of 8 mm diameter. The variables of the tests were the concrete grade, the initial crack width, the shear stress level and the reinforcement ratio. The constant shear stress level was 45 %- 90 % of the static shear strength. The experimental program comprised 34 specimens. The duration of load application was at least 90 days. Periodically the crack width and the shear slip of the opposing crack faces were measured. Experiments started at a concrete age of 28 days at 20 °C and 50 % RH. On the one hand, the test results refer to measured material characteristics such as development of concrete compressive strength, shrinkage and loss of weight by the drying process. On the other, the measured instantaneous and the time-dependent displacements under sustained shear loading are given for each specimen. Moreover the crack-opening path and the displacements after release of the shear force are presented. The measured displacement-paths are described by non-linear regression analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Large {{numbers of}} {{reinforced}} concrete deck girder (RCDG) bridges were built during the highway infrastructure {{boom of the}} 1950 's. The advent of standardized deformed steel reinforcing bars during this time allowed for straight bar terminations in flexural tension regions. Designers of the time terminated reinforcing bars where {{they were no longer}} required by calculation and did not account for additional demands from the combination of shear and flexure. The design provisions of the time allowed higher shear stresses in the concrete than allowed in standards today which reduced the required quantity of transverse reinforcing steel. In addition, heavier trucks and higher traffic volumes on roadways today have greatly increased the service loading on these bridges. Engineers evaluating these older RCDG bridges often determine unsatisfactory load ratings due to flexural anchorage deficiencies in the girders, especially when the influence of shear is considered. These deficiencies result from inadequate capacity compared to current design standards due to poor cutoff details used in the initial design. Strengthening methods are necessary because comprehensive replacements of the large number of bridges are not economically feasible. Experimental research was conducted to evaluate the behavior of poorly detailed flexural anchorages and to develop methods to strengthen them. Realistic vintage girder specimens were constructed, retrofitted, instrumented, and tested to failure. The specimens reported in this thesis were full-scale inverted-T (IT) beams. Some of the specimens contained straight bar terminations crossing a preformed diagonal crack in the flexural tension region to investigate the influence of shear on the retrofit schemes. Instrumentation focused on measurement of the reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>stresses</b> surrounding the diagonal crack and along the development length of the cutoff bars. Using results of past research to quantify the behavior of girders with straight-bar flexural anchorages in flexural tension regions, an innovative strengthening technique was developed using either near-surface mounted (NSM) stainless steel or titanium.
