500|$|The {{story begins}} at the court of Emperor Conrad, who {{for all of his}} good qualities has one defect: he refuses to get married, {{especially}} since, as he <b>says,</b> <b>people</b> no longer are as valiant and as noble as they used to be. His minstrel, Jouglet, tells him of Guillaume de Dole and his sister Liénor, and quickly the emperor falls in love with her, although he does not actually see her until the story's [...] Guillaume is summoned to the court where he excels in chivalric exploits; the emperor tells him he wishes to marry his sister. Conrad's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume's family, where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark {{in the shape of a}} rose on her thigh. This knowledge is presented as proof that the seneschal has taken her virginity.|$|E

You wouldn't think {{to look at her}} that she had a tragedy in her life, but she has. Aunt Louisa told me the tale. It all happened long, long ago. Interesting things like this all did happen long ago, it seems to me. They never seem to happen now. This was in '49, when people were rushing to the gold fields in California. It was just like a fever, Aunt Louisa <b>says.</b> <b>People</b> took it, right here on the Island; and a number of young men determined they would go to California.|$|E

60|$|During {{the whole}} of the year which succeeded that in which the glorious battle of Ramillies had been fought, our army made no {{movement}} of importance, much to the disgust of very many of our officers remaining inactive in Flanders, who said that his Grace the Captain-General had had fighting enough, and was all for money now, and the enjoyment of his five thousand a year and his splendid palace at Woodstock, which was now being built. And his Grace had sufficient occupation fighting his enemies at home this year, where it began to be whispered that his favor was decreasing, and his duchess losing her hold on the Queen, who was transferring her royal affections to the famous Mrs. Masham, and Mrs. Masham's humble servant, Mr. Harley. Against their intrigues, our Duke passed a great part of his time intriguing. Mr. Harley was got out of office, and his Grace, in so far, had a victory. But her Majesty, convinced against her will, was of that opinion still, of which the poet <b>says</b> <b>people</b> are when so convinced, and Mr. Harley before long had his revenge.|$|E
6000|$|One thing more, my dear. This curious Amelius {{seems to}} notice trifles which escape men in general, {{just as we}} do. Towards {{the close of the}} evening, poor Mamma Farnaby fell into one of her vacant states; half asleep and half awake on the sofa in the back drawing-room. [...] "Your aunt {{interests}} me," [...] he whispered. [...] "She must have suffered some terrible sorrow, at some past time in her life." [...] Fancy a man seeing that! He dropped some hints, which showed that he was puzzling his brains to discover how I got on with her, and whether I was in her confidence or not: he even went the length of asking what sort of life I led with the uncle and aunt who have adopted me. My dear, it was done so delicately, with such irresistible sympathy and such a charming air of respect, that I was quite startled when I remembered, in the wakeful hours of the night, how freely I had spoken to him. Not that I have betrayed any secrets; for, as you know, I am as ignorant as everybody else of what the early troubles of my poor dear aunt may have been. But I did tell him how I came into the house a helpless little orphan girl; and how generously these two good relatives adopted me; and how happy it made me to find that I could really do something to cheer their sad childless lives. [...] "I wish I was half as good as you are," [...] he said. [...] "I can't understand how you became fond of Mrs. Farnaby. Perhaps it began in sympathy and compassion?" [...] Just think of that, from a young Englishman! He went on confessing his perplexities, as if we had known one another from childhood. [...] "I am a little surprised to see Mrs. Farnaby present at parties of this sort; I should have thought she would have stayed in her own room." [...] "That's just what she objects to do," [...] I answered; [...] "She <b>says</b> <b>people</b> will report that her husband is ashamed of her, or that she is not fit to be seen in society, if she doesn't appear at the parties--and she is determined not to be misrepresented in that way." [...] Can you understand my talking to him with so little reserve? It is a specimen, Cecilia, of the odd manner in which my impulses carry me away, in this man's company. He is so nice and gentle--and yet so manly. I shall be curious to see if you can resist him, with your superior firmness and knowledge of the world.|$|E
