5|$|After {{descending}} into Burlington, the QEW crosses former Highway2 {{before it}} encounters the Freeman Interchange, opened in 1958 to allow construction of Highway403 and expanded in 1999 to accommodate Highway407. The freeway curves to the east, becoming concurrent with Highway403 through Burlington and Oakville within Halton Region. The two routes travel east straight though a commercial office area. Service roads reappear through this <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> serve businesses fronting the highway. The segment includes high-occupancy vehicle lanes, opened in 2011, which required {{the construction of}} a second structure over Sixteen Mile Creek. In the eastern end of Oakville, the route curves northeast, passing the Ford Motor Assembly Plant. Highway403 diverges and travels north as the QEW curves back to the east and enters Mississauga and Peel Region.|$|E
5|$|In the 2009–10 NHL season, Brodeur led the NHL in wins (45), shutouts (9), {{games played}} (77) and minutes played (4,499). He also won his fifth Jennings Trophy {{and had the}} third-best GAA in the league, leading his team to {{back-to-back}} division wins that included a 6–0 regular-season sweep of the defending Stanley Cup champion Penguins. However, the Devils lost {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, losing to the seventh-seeded Flyers in five games. Brodeur had a 5–18–1 <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> begin the 2010–11 season, as New Jersey slumped to the bottom of the NHL. Although the Devils improved in the second half of the season, they did not reach the playoffs; Brodeur recorded 23 wins and a 2.45 GAA, but had his lowest save percentage (.903) in 16 seasons.|$|E

5|$|NY21 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY417 {{in the village}} of Andover. The route heads northward, paralleling the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (WNYP) through a rural stretch of eastern Allegany County. At Alfred Station, located just east of the village of Alfred, the highway meets the eastern terminus of NY244. NY21 and the WNYP head northeast through the village of Almond to the Steuben County line, where the road and rail line begin to turn to the southeast toward Hornell. The portion of NY21 near Almond briefly parallels the Southern Tier Expressway, designated Interstate86 (I-86) and NY17. East of the county line, NY21 leaves the vicinity of the expressway and passes through another undeveloped <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> reach the city of Hornell, where it becomes West Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Castorland, {{the road}} runs across a half-mile (0.8km) stretch of undeveloped land prior to {{crossing}} the Black River, {{which serves as}} {{the boundary between the}} towns of Denmark and Croghan. On the opposite riverbank, NY410 continues across another open <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> reach the small hamlet of Naumburg. Here, the route passes a handful of homes and intersects the north end of CR33 (Van Amber Road) before ending at an intersection with NY126 on the northeastern fringe of the hamlet. While NY410 terminates at this junction, its right-of-way continues past NY126 as Cross Road, a local highway connecting Naumburg to CR8 (Second Road).|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The navigations often form a {{short cut}} for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing {{over the top of}} the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous harpoon cells) and nematocysts (venomous harpoon cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E
5|$|Past the exit, NY264 turns northeastward {{away from}} the freeway to serve less {{developed}} areas of Schroeppel. The highway winds its way past a mixture of cultivated fields and forested areas, passing {{the south end of}} CR54 and crossing over Sixmile Creek on its way to a small cluster of homes near the northern town line. Here, NY264 connects to Godfrey Road, a local highway leading southeast to CR54 in the hamlet of Pennellville. The route climbs a hill as it crosses into the town of Palermo and the hamlet of Suttons Corner, located at the junction of NY264 and NY49. From Suttons Corner, the route heads generally north-northeastward across along another sparsely populated <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> a junction with NY3 south of the hamlet of Palermo. NY264 ends here while NY3 continues north on NY264's right-of-way toward Palermo.|$|E

5|$|The 747-500X concept {{featured}} {{an increased}} fuselage length of 18ft (5.5m) to 250ft (76.2m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700nautical miles (10,000mi, 16,100km), with a gross weight of over 1.0Mlb (450tonnes). The 747-600X concept featured a greater <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> 279ft (85m) with seating for 548 passengers, {{a range of}} up to 7,700nmi (8,900mi, 14,300km), and a gross weight of 1.2Mlb (540tonnes). A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400. The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, {{was estimated to be}} more than US$5billion. Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Tigers led the AL Central {{for periods}} {{at the start}} of the season in April, {{ultimately}} tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16. The Tigers held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards, holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6. Although the Tigers went 16–12 in September, their second-best month by winning percentage in 2009, they won just 1 of 4 games in October. The Twins went 16–11 and 4–0, respectively, over this same <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> tie the Tigers for the divisional lead after the 162-game regular season. More broadly, the Tigers were 48–39 over the first half of the season while the Twins were 45–44 but the Twins came back in the second half going 41–32 leading up to the tie-breaker while the Tigers went 38–37 over the same span. The Twins won 11 of the two teams' 18 match-ups that season prior to the tie-breaker.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{analyzing}} the unique cracks lining Europa found evidence showing that it likely spun around a tilted axis {{at some point}} in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must <b>stretch</b> <b>to</b> accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt also could affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis means that more heat is generated by tidal forces. This heat helps the ocean to remain liquid longer. Scientists did not specify when the tilt would have occurred and measurements have not been made of the tilt of Europa's axis.|$|E
