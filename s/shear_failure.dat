2500|$|Lateral earth stress {{theory is}} used to {{estimate}} the amount of stress soil can exert perpendicular to gravity. This is the stress exerted [...] on retaining walls. A lateral earth stress coefficient, K, {{is defined as the}} ratio of lateral (horizontal) effective stress to vertical effective stress for cohesionless soils (K=σ'h/σ'v). There are three coefficients: at-rest, active, and passive. At-rest stress is the lateral stress in the ground before any disturbance takes place. The active stress state is reached when a wall moves away from the soil under the influence of lateral stress, and results from <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> due to reduction of lateral stress. The passive stress state is reached when a wall is pushed into the soil far enough to cause <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> within the mass due to increase of lateral stress. There are many theories for estimating lateral earth stress; some are empirically based, and some are analytically derived.|$|E
2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> in the soil. [...] Allowable bearing stress is the {{bearing capacity}} divided {{by a factor of}} safety. [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements.|$|E

A special locator bolt, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, [...] it {{is not subject to}} either the plastic <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} force {{transferring}} mechanisms and shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The transferring mechanism of shear forces in RC beams {{can be characterized}} as the load paths in the disturbed regions and the beam regions. The domains of different regions are proposed to be determined by the beam geometry, the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement. The inclination angles in each region are defined according to the proposed load paths of the force transferring. The disturbed regions are failed due to <b>shear</b> compression <b>failure</b> and <b>shear</b> tension <b>failure.</b> The failure mode of the beam region is <b>shear</b> tension <b>failure.</b> The <b>shear</b> tension <b>failure</b> is the yielding of shear reinforcement and the <b>shear</b> compression <b>failure</b> is the diagonal crushing of concrete. The shear strength due to the <b>shear</b> compression <b>failure</b> can be predicted by the softened strut-and-tie model, and the <b>shear</b> tension <b>failure</b> can be calculated according to the ACI 318 - 05 code approach. Accuracy of the proposed model is gauged by comparing with the available test data. Finally, the proposed model of beams is applied to columns...|$|R

This paper describes the in-depth investigation undertaken to understand the cause of failure and the subsequent development of a deterioration model for identifying at-risk deck panel bridges. This was based on a comprehensive review of historical inspection records, bridge plans, special reports, on-site forensic investigation of bridges being replaced and interviews with inspectors. The qualitative deterioration model identified 13 stages leading to failure and was successfully used to prioritize the planned replacement of 85 precast deck panel bridges over ten years. The validity of the model was proven by subsequent punching <b>shear</b> <b>failures</b> of two more precast panel deck bridges, both included in the top ten at-risk bridge list. ...|$|R

40|$|A rammed-earth {{wall is a}} {{monolithic}} construction made by compacting processed soil in progressive layers in a rigid formwork. There is a growing interest in using this low-embodied-carbon building material in buildings. The paper investigates the strength and structural behavior of story-high cement-stabilized rammed-earth (CSRE) walls, reviews literature {{on the strength of}} CSRE, and discusses results of the compressive strength of CSRE prisms, wallettes, and story-high walls. The strength of the story-high wall was compared with the strength of wallettes and prisms. There is a nearly 30 % reduction in strength as the height-to-thickness ratio increases from about 5 to 20. The ultimate compressive strength of CSRE walls predicted using the tangent modulus theory is in close agreement with the experimental values. The <b>shear</b> <b>failures</b> noticed in the story-high walls resemble the <b>shear</b> <b>failures</b> of short-height prism and wallette specimens.

40|$|Design of flared columns {{to resist}} {{earthquake}} loading {{is a complicated}} issue due to the changing cross section along the column length. It was believed that if the flares had low longitudinal and transverse reinforcement ratios, they would fail during earthquakes. Therefore, the column core would be the element remaining to resist the earthquake. Past earthquakes have shown that flared columns are susceptible to premature <b>shear</b> <b>failures.</b> In the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, <b>shear</b> <b>failures</b> were caused by plastic hinge formation {{at the base of}} the flare and a subsequent increase in the level of column shear demand above design levels. This study presents an experimental and analytical study that is examining new details for flared columns, base hinges and joints. The purpose is to maintain the aesthetic value of the flare without impacting the system performance. The primary feature is a gap at the top of the column and the amount of transverse flare reinforcement. Four bents were tested using the shake table to examine dynamic effects as well as column and beam interaction. The test specimens had different amounts of confining reinforcement in the flare. An analytical non-linear finite element analysis study was conducted using the DIANA program to explore different parameters effects...|$|R

50|$|Faults {{are another}} form of {{fracture}} in a geologic environment. In any type of faulting, the active fracture experiences <b>shear</b> <b>failure,</b> as {{the faces of the}} fracture slip relative to each other. As a result, these fractures seem like large scale representations of Mode II and III fractures, however that is not necessarily the case. On such a large scale, once the <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> occurs, the fracture begins to curve its propagation towards the same direction as the tensile fractures. In other words, the fault typically attempts to orient itself perpendicular to the plane of least principal stress. This results in an out-of-plane shear relative to the initial reference plane. Therefore, these cannot necessarily be qualified as Mode II or III fractures.|$|E

These higher dowel forces together with the highly concentrated bond stresses in HSC beams, result in higher bond-splitting stresses where the shear cracks cross the longitudinal tension bars. These combined effects can lead finally to brittle <b>shear</b> <b>failures.</b> The applicability of the resistance-demand procedure is examined by comparing the predictions of the procedure with the experimental shear strength of the beams.

The statistics values of VES parameters related to adiabatic shearing sensitivity were calculated to substitute for the most probable value among the multiple solutions according to the view that the microstate statistics values can reflect the macro physical quantity. The research shows that the adiabatic shearing sensitivity is growing with the rise of the statistics value of bond energy of the strongest covalent bond, and is decreasing with the rise of the statistics value of the lattice electron number. The statistics value of bond energy of the strongest covalent bond in aluminum bronze (QAl 9 - 4) is larger than that in pure copper, and the statistics value of the lattice electron number in QAl 9 - 4 is smaller than that in pure copper. Therefore, QAl 9 - 4 is prone to adiabatic <b>shearing</b> <b>failure,</b> and the grains were only elongated due to the large deformation for pure copper without any adiabatic shear band (ASB). It is of great significance for the selection and design of material with different adiabatic shearing sensitivity to research the effect of alloy elements on adiabatic shearing sensitivity from the electronic structure perspective...|$|R
