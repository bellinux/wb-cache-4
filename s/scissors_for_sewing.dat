40|$|Graduation date: 1976 This study {{investigated}} the relationships between motivation <b>for</b> <b>sewing</b> and: amount of sewing, perceived depersonalization of the job, and creativity among employed women. <b>Sewing</b> <b>for</b> creativity and <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> economic reasons were the two motivations investigated. Previous studies indicated that <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> economic reasons was the prevalent motivation <b>for</b> <b>sewing.</b> Current literature has indicated that <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> creativity may also be an important motivation. Studies have also indicated that leisure activities may compensate for characteristics perceived to be lacking in the job. The possibility that <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> creativity might be this type of leisure activity was also investigated in this study. The {{study was limited to}} home sewers who were full-time employees. A sample was collected of women who had taken a sewing class at a retail fabric store, and who worked over 30 hours per week. Fifty women who returned completed questionnaires were included in this study. Measures of <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> creativity, <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> economic reasons, and perceived depersonalization of the job were developed. All of these measures were tested for validity by item analysis and for reliability by test-retest. The measure of creativity was also tested for validity by item analysis. The findings indicated positive relationships at a significant level between <b>sewing</b> <b>for</b> creativity and: amount of sewing, and number of children out of school who lived at home. <b>Sewing</b> <b>for</b> economic reasons was positively related at a significant level to: age of the respondent, and number of children who lived at home. <b>Sewing</b> <b>for</b> creativity was not significantly related to perceived depersonalization of the job...|$|R
