5|$|The Cape sparrow is <b>social,</b> <b>lives</b> in flocks, {{and usually}} breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E

5|$|With family estates in Scotland and England, Elizabeth's {{upbringing}} involved much travel. Their {{main residence}} was the lavish Stafford House, London, which they acquired in 1827; they also resided on many country estates. The couple, especially Harriet, led vibrant <b>social</b> <b>lives.</b> She {{was a political}} hostess known for her friendship and position as Mistress of the Robes to the young Queen Victoria. In 1833, the 1st Duke died and Elizabeth's father succeeded as 2nd Duke of Sutherland, inheriting extensive property. The historian Eric Richards writes that {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century saw the height of the House of Sutherland's social and economic influence, with its wealth being derived from rents, various stocks, and dividends from transportation firms.|$|E
5|$|After the Erdut Agreement {{was signed}} in 1995, the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was {{established}} to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998. It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, {{and many of the}} pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitants– less than half the pre-war total– of whom 18,199 (57.46%) were Croats and 10,412 (32.88%) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: Croats and Serbs now lived separate <b>social</b> <b>lives.</b> Public facilities such as shops, cafés, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for each community.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the eastern}} image of farm {{life in the}} prairies {{emphasized}} {{the isolation of the}} lonely farmer and wife, plains residents created busy <b>social</b> <b>lives</b> for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange meetings, church activities and school functions. Women organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families. The Grange was a nationwide farmers' organization, they reserved high offices for women, and gave them a voice in public affairs.|$|E
25|$|Although her novels were {{hugely popular}} during her lifetime, Burney's {{reputation}} as a writer of fiction suffered after her death {{at the hands of}} biographers and critics, who felt that the extensive diaries, published posthumously in 1842–46, offered a more interesting and accurate portrait of 18th-century life. Today critics are returning to her novels and plays with renewed interest in her outlook on the <b>social</b> <b>lives</b> and struggles of women in a predominantly male-oriented culture. Scholars continue to value Burney's diaries as well for their candid depictions of English society in her time.|$|E

School feeding is just one facet of school health initiatives, as other programs may include de-worming, HIV/AIDS prevention and education, and life and health skills education. Overall, school feeding programs have been shown to directly increase the educational and nutritional status of recipient children, and indirectly impact the economic and <b>social</b> <b>lives</b> of themselves and their family. Additionally, school feeding directly addresses the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of reducing hunger by one-half, achieving universal primary education, and achieving gender parity in education by 2015.|$|E

The custom of the Janissaries {{and the various}} {{restrictions}} on the religious, economic and <b>social</b> <b>lives</b> of the non-Muslim inhabitants of the Empire constituted an imminent danger for {{the continuation of the}} Greek inhabitation of Asia Minor. Conditions were improved over the following centuries, but the Greeks remained in the lower caste status of Dhimmi. Islamization and gradual Turkification continued. The ideas of The Enlightenment and the subsequent Greek War of Independence, raised the hopes of the Asia Minor Greeks for sovereignty. Many Greeks from Anatolia fought as revolutionaries and faced the retaliations of the Sultan.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the divorce extend past the {{separation}} of both parents. The remaining conflict between parents, financial problems, and the re-partnering or remarriage of parents can cause lasting stress. Studies conducted by Booth and Amato (2001) have shown {{that there is no}} correlation between post-divorce conflict and the child’s ability to adjust to their life circumstance. On the other hand, Hetherington (1999) completed research on this same topic and did find adverse effects in children. In regards to the financial standing of a family, divorce does have the potential to reduce the children’s style of living. Child support is often given to help cover basic needs such as schooling. If the parents’ finances are already scarce then their children {{may not be able to}} participate in extracurricular activities such as sports and music lessons, which can be detrimental to their <b>social</b> <b>lives.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Wales, which produced Bible translations into Welsh, the churches of Cornwall never produced {{a translation of}} the Bible in the Cornish language, which {{may have contributed to}} that language's demise. During the English Reformation, churches in Cornwall officially became affiliated with the Church of England. In 1549, the Prayer Book Rebellion caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. The Methodism of John Wesley proved to be very popular with the working classes in Cornwall in the 19th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing {{a central role in the}} <b>social</b> <b>lives</b> of working class Cornishmen. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Cornwall today, although Cornwall has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling. In 1876 a separate Cornish diocese of the Church of England was established with the bishop's see at Truro.|$|E
