5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the <b>summer,</b> <b>at</b> noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki {{wrote the}} script after he decided the film {{would be based}} on the 10-year-old {{daughter}} of his friend, associate producer Seiji Okuda, who came to visit his house each <b>summer.</b> <b>At</b> the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of Spirited Away began in 2000. During production, Miyazaki realized the film would be over three hours long and decided to cut out several parts of the story. Pixar director John Lasseter, a fan of Miyazaki, was approached by Walt Disney Pictures to supervise an English-language translation for the film's North American release. Lasseter hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer of the adaptation. Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E
