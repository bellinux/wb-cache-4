25|$|If {{a worker}} covered by Social Security dies, a <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> can receive survivors' {{benefits}}. In some instances, survivors' benefits are available {{even to a}} divorced spouse. A father or mother with minor or disabled children {{in his or her}} care can receive benefits which are not actuarially reduced. The earliest age for a non-disabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. The benefit is equal to the worker's basic retirement benefit (PIA) (reduced if the deceased was receiving reduced benefits) for spouses who are at, or older than, normal retirement age. If the <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> starts benefits before normal retirement age, there is an actuarial reduction. If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their normal retirement age, the <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> will have those credits applied to their benefit.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle Onassis' health began deteriorating rapidly {{following}} the death of his son Alexander in a plane crash in 1973, and he died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $26million from Christina Onassis—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir— and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.|$|E
25|$|A Federal {{law passed}} in 2010 (Public Law 111-275) extends burial {{benefits}} to certain parents of servicemembers who die {{as a result}} of hostile activity or from combat training-related injuries who are buried in a national cemetery in a gravesite with available space. The biological or adopted parents of a servicemember who dies in combat or while performing training in preparation for a combat mission, leaving no <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> or dependent child, may be buried with the deceased servicemember if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that there is available space.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse,</b> a grant is not usually required.|$|E
25|$|In {{marriage}}, {{there are}} three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses in a marriage {{continue to be the}} property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in order to sell them, both the husband and wife must sign. In the case of divorce, both the man and woman are entitled to ownership of the marital home. In the case of the death of a spouse, the <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse,</b> regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home. If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as the children for inheritance. Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets.|$|E

2500|$|ERISA also {{regulates the}} manner in which a pension plan may pay benefits.

[...] In 1993, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which required states to attempt to recoup [...] "the expense of long-term care and related costs for deceased Medicaid recipients 55 or older." [...] The Act also allowed states to recover other Medicaid expenses for deceased Medicaid recipients 55 or older, at each state's choice. However, states are prohibited from estate recovery when [...] "there is a <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse,</b> a child under the age of 21 or a child of any age who is blind or disabled" [...] and [...] "the law also carved out other exceptions for adult children who have served as caretakers in the homes of the deceased, property owned jointly by siblings, and income-producing property, such as farms." [...] Each state now maintains a Medicaid Estate Recovery Program, although the sum of money collected significantly varies from state to state, [...] "depending on how the state structures its program and how vigorously it pursues collections." ...|$|E

[...] He was widely viewed as a quiet, unassuming, almost shy man with dark wavy hair, {{in sharp contrast to the}} flamboyant, in-your-face image of his predecessor Jack Gremillion. Voters rewarded Guste's competence and integrity and kept him in the attorney general's position for two decades until his retirement from the office.

2500|$|With {{the defeat}} of Nazi Germany in 1945 the laws banning mixed marriages were lifted again. Marriage dates could be backdated, if so desired, for couples who lived {{together}} unmarried during the Nazi era due to the legal restrictions, upon marrying after the war. Even if one spouse was already dead, the marriage could be retroactively recognised, in order to legitimise any children and enable them or the <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> to inherit from their late father or partner, respectively. In the West German Federal Republic of Germany 1,823 couples applied for recognition (until 1963), which was granted in 1,255 cases.1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, (12002), (Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6), simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, p. 469.|$|E

With respect to Social Security, housing, and food stamps, the GAO found that [...] "recognition of the marital relationship is integral {{to the design of}} the program." [...] The report also noted several other major program categories that were affected—veterans' benefits, including pensions and survivor benefits; taxes on income, estates, gifts, and property sales; and benefits due federal employees, both civilian and military—and identified specifics such as the rights of the <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse</b> of a creator of copyrighted work and the financial disclosure requirements of spouses of Congress members and certain officers of the federal government.

2500|$|At home, Tsarina Marie Alexandrovna was {{suffering}} from tuberculosis and was spending increasing time abroad. In 1866, Alexander II took a mistress, Princess Catherine Dolgorukya, with whom he would father three surviving children. The affair, {{in the face of}} the tsarina's declining health, served to alienate the rest of his adult children, save his son Alexei and his daughter, who, like Alexander II's brothers, believed that the tsar was beyond criticism. In 1880, however, following threats on Catherine's life, the tsar moved his mistress and their children into the Winter Palace, installing them in rooms directly above the apartments of his ailing wife. When Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna made a visit in May 1880, being warned that her mother was dying, she was horrified to learn of his father's mistress' living arrangements and confronted her father. Shocked by the loss of support from his daughter, he quietly retreated to Gatchina Palace for military reviews. The quarrel, however, evidently, jolted his conscience enough to lead him to return to St. Petersburg each morning to ask after his wife's health. The tsarina, however, had not much longer to live, dying on [...] On , Alexander II and Catherine were married in a secret ceremony at Tsarskoe Selo. The action scandalized both his family and the court, also violating Orthodox custom which required a minimum period of 40 days mourning between the death of a spouse and the remarriage of a <b>surviving</b> <b>spouse,</b> eliciting criticism in foreign courts. Alexander also bestowed on Catherine the title of Princess Yurievskaya and legitimized their children.|$|E
