25|$|This distinguishes {{bullying}} from isolated behaviours {{and other}} forms of job stress and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae. Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>in</b> the US.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policies <b>in</b> {{local governments to}} assess compliance with model policies, and {{the nature and extent}} of training on the topic, and provides policy recommendations where policies appear lacking. A content analysis of municipal <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policies <b>in</b> the state ofMich-igan suggests that policy shortcomings are those of omission rather than commission. Few policies include any elements that have been identified as being detrimental to effective implementation pro-cesses. Rather, many policies are silent on aspects that are critical to successful implementation. And this silence has several very important potential repercussions for the effective implementation of poli-cies as well as an ultimate reduction in the levels of workplace <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> Recent research has identified the critical challenges to effective implementation of <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policy <b>in</b> a medium-sized city and a comprehensive university (Reese & Lindenberg, 1999). Prior to this publication, research on sexual harass-ment had focused predominantly on definitions of whether, when, and how <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> occurred (e. g., Crocker, 1983; Niehouse & Doades, 1980; Paludi et al., 1990). Researchers also focused on the types of policies that should be developed and how they ought to be implemented, and surveys were conducted to determine the extent and types of policies in place in particular organizations (Biles, 1981; Hoyman & Robinson, 1980; Ross & England, 1987). Still, little research to date has compared existing local government <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> policies to model policies, particularly regarding the finer points of process.

25|$|Sexual {{harassment}} is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action {{is used to}} change a victim's sexual status against {{the will of the}} victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment.</b> <b>In</b> the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy.

It is often recommended that consistent anti-sexual harassment workshops begin in the younger grades so that students remain informed and the policies are strongly enforced.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience <b>sexual</b> <b>harassment</b> <b>in</b> school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their words and actions, and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, a student with disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E

Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment.
