2500|$|On 24 September, Richelieu {{took part}} in the defence of Dakar against British and Free French forces. There was a gunnery duel between Richelieu and the British battleships [...] and : Barham was hit twice by the shore {{batteries}} manned by ratings from Richelieu. In the engagement Richelieu was struck by two [...] shells causing no serious damage; there were 250 near misses. Richelieu was damaged in the battle the first time her main battery fired: a [...] shell blew back and disabled two guns in the #2 main turret; this was thought to be from the use of the wrong propellant type. There was no more firing during this day with the #2 main turret. On the day after, the #1 main turret was used instead. The propellant was changed to the SD19 propellant of the reconditioned Strasbourg powder charges; however, this caused serious problems regarding range-finding. In 1941, an inquiry commission under Admiral [...] concluded there had been a mistake in the <b>shell</b> <b>base</b> design. During the two days, Richelieu fired a total of 24 rounds. No hits were recorded. The third day, as HMS Resolution had been struck by a torpedo from a French submarine, the British and Free French force retreated.|$|E

50|$|Rifled {{guns were}} also {{developed}} elsewhere - by Major Giovanni Cavalli and Baron Martin von Wahrendorff in Sweden, Krupp in Germany and the Wiard {{gun in the}} United States. However, rifled barrels required some means of engaging the shell with the rifling. Lead coated shells were used with the Armstrong gun, but were not satisfactory so studded projectiles were adopted. However, these did not seal the gap between shell and barrel. Wads at the <b>shell</b> <b>base</b> were also tried without success.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{thin-walled}} forged-steel design made feasible shrapnel shells for howitzers, {{which had}} a much lower velocity than field guns, by using a larger gunpowder charge to accelerate the bullets forward on bursting. The ideal shrapnel design {{would have had a}} timer fuze in the <b>shell</b> <b>base</b> to avoid the need for a central tube, but this was not technically feasible due to the need to manually adjust the fuze before firing, and was in any case rejected from an early date by the British due to risk of premature ignition and irregular action.|$|E

50|$|The final {{shrapnel}} shell design used a much thinner forged steel shell {{case with a}} timer fuze in the nose and a tube running through the centre to convey the ignition flash to a gunpowder bursting charge in the <b>shell</b> <b>base.</b> The use of steel allowed the shell wall to be made much thinner and hence allow space for many more bullets. It also withstood {{the force of the}} powder charge without shattering, so that the bullets were fired forward out of the shell case with increased velocity, much like a shotgun. This is the design that came to be adopted by all countries and was in standard use when World War I began in 1914.|$|E
5000|$|... “Mesosphere” (not to be {{confused}} with mesosphere, a layer of the atmosphere) is derived from “mesospheric shell”, coined by Reginald Aldworth Daly, a Harvard University geology professor.
