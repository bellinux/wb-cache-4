5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>case.</b> Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the result}} of such a decision, {{would be that the}} FR would be denied the {{opportunity}} to have a direct link between its two railways and would be forced to negotiate an access agreement with WHR Ltd, to allow its trains to run over WHR Ltd metals into Porthmadog(WHR) station. Having the WHR Ltd as its landlord at the southern end, also meant accepting that WHR Ltd would have the power to ensure that any promises made to secure such access, would be honoured and would be able to prevent access to Porthmadog, in the event of any future dispute between the two companies. The only way to avoid this, would be for the FR to somehow persuade WHR Ltd to withdraw their objection, so that their <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> {{was not included in the}} evidence presented by the inquiry inspector to John Prescott.|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} usage {{a statement of}} Fact {{has to do with}} a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to its very occurrence. In contrast, a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Case</b> may refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned. Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that different observers adopt over time. Finally, a statement of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and not because of its syntactic form. So far in this discussion, all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement. In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by the roles that they play within an argument, not by their style of expression. When the time comes to branch out from the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary syntactic forms.|$|E

40|$|It is basic, but critical, {{to persuade}} the court that the result you seek is the right result. The court has {{to feel good about}} ruling in favor of your client. Judge Gurfein (2 nd Cir.) : “It is still the mystery of the appellate process that a result is reached in an opinion on {{thoroughly}} logical and precedential grounds while it was first approached as the right and fair thing to do. ” The <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Case</b> and Facts is critical in this regard. You are most likely to prevail if your properly presented statement of the facts [...] without argument [...] makes the reader believe that your client should prevail. In order to do this, you should not set out the facts in the same way in every brief; sometimes you may need a chronology of facts, other times you may not. This does not mean ignoring bad facts, or slanting facts your way even though you were the losing party below. It means marshaling your facts, within the standard of review the court will be applying, in a manner that inexorably leads the reader to conclude that your client should win. Even, for example, if your argument is that error wasn’t preserved, you should remind the court why the preservation rule is a good rule of judicial efficiency and fairness. Consider the broader ramifications of a legal ruling in your client’s favor: Is the ruling good or bad as a general, jurisprudential principle? Remember – the first thing the court reads should be what the issue is and why you prevail on that issue. 1 Sylvia Walbolt is the chair of the Carlton Fields Appellate Practice Group.
