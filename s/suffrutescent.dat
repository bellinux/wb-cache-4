50|$|Haplophyton is a genus {{of plants}} in the family Apocynaceae, first {{described}} in 1844. It is native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Guatemala. It is a <b>suffrutescent</b> herb with alternative leaves and showy colorful flowers.|$|E
50|$|They have a <b>suffrutescent</b> habit {{typical of}} their genus. They produce {{unbranched}} and unarmed aerial stems {{of less than}} a metre tall. The various populations show considerable variation {{in terms of the}} number of pinnae pairs and the number, size and shape of the leaflets. They flower from September to November and are pollinated mainly by the African honeybee. The flowering racemes are typically confined to the lower part of the stem, so that the pods are usually suspended just above ground level, or alternatively rest inconspicuously on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|When Snodgrass and Heller {{visited in}} 1898, they {{reported}} that [...] "no land plant is native to the island". Historical accounts from 1711, 1825 and 1839 show a low grassy or <b>suffrutescent</b> (partially woody) flora (Sachet, 1962). Coconut palms were introduced in the 1890s and a few still survive. Introduction of pigs by guano miners {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century reduced the crab population, which in turn allowed grassland to gradually cover about 80 percent of the land surface (Sachet, 1962). The elimination of these pigs in 1958 — as the result of a personal project by Kenneth E. Stager, — has caused most of this vegetation to disappear as millions of land crabs (Johngarthia planata) have returned.' The result is virtually a sandy desert, with only 674 palms counted by Christian Jost during the [...] "Passion 2001" [...] French mission, and five islets in the lagoon with grass that the terrestrial crabs cannot reach.|$|E
30|$|Masticated sites had {{significantly}} less live cover than untreated chaparral, but density and species richness were substantially higher (Table 1). Another structural {{difference was that}} live plants on masticated sites were only half as tall as undisturbed chaparral (2.3 m versus 1.1 m, P < 0.001). Shrub cover and density were substantially lower in masticated sites, whereas <b>suffrutescents</b> and herbaceous species had {{more than twice the}} cover, density, and richness found in controls. Non-native species were also significantly more abundant in masticated treatments versus controls.|$|R
30|$|While shrubs had a density {{that was}} the same or lower in {{masticated}} treatments versus untreated chaparral, most other growth forms were more abundant (Table 2). The subshrub Salvia mellifera was equally present on controls and masticated sites but, due to seedling recruitment, there was over twice the density in sites that were treated. Other subshrubs such as Eriogonum fasciculatum and Hazardia squarrosa (Hook & Arn.) Greene were poorly represented in undisturbed chaparral, yet had over five times the density on masticated sites. <b>Suffrutescents</b> followed a similar pattern.|$|R

There are around 500 species of Artemisia in Asia, Europe and North America and 34 species {{of this family}} are found all over Iran (Mozaffarian 2010). Artemisia aucheri is limited mostly to mountainous landscapes with high slope, sandy soils and with annual precipitation of 300 – 450  mm (Hosseini et al. 2013). Morphological features of this plant consist of perennial, <b>suffrutescent,</b> stem numerous and erect, indumentum white-tomentose, leaves pinnate or bipinnate, capitula arranged in a panicle-congested, calathium sessile and ovate, phyllaries imbricate and multiseriate, florets 3 – 4 (Podlech 1986).

40|$|Abstract—The recent {{encroachment}} of piñon (Pinus edulis) and juniper trees (Junipe-rus osteosperma) into historically shrub- and grass-dominated landscapes {{has caused}} {{major changes in}} ecosystem structure and function, including dramatic changes in fuel structure and fi re regimes. Such encroachment is currently occurring on thousands of acres on the Shivwits Plateau in northwestern Arizona and land managers are seeking effective techniques to restore these areas to pre-invasion conditions and reduce the threat of high severity crown fi res. A study was established on the Shivwits Plateau to test the effectiveness of three thinning techniques for reducing the density of recently established piñon and juniper trees and to assess changes to the fuelbed structure. The thinning treatments were: (1) cut and leave; (2) cut, buck and scatter; and (3) herbicide. The line-point intercept method was used to characterize changes in the fuelbed structure. Belt transects were used to quantify tree density. Responses of the shrubs and <b>suffrutescent</b> plants (herein collectively referred to as ‘shrubs’) are reported.

Paired t-tests were used to statistically determine significant differences between controls and masticated treatments (P < 0.05, 2 -tailed), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) {{was used to compare}} masticated sites to wildfire sites for both the case study and regional comparisons (P < 0.05, 2 -tailed). Data assumptions of normality and equal variance were tested using Shapiro-Wilk and Levene’s tests, respectively, and when necessary, data were log or square-root transformed to meet those assumptions. In several instances in which the data could not be transformed to meet the assumptions of a paired t-test, we used the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. This was necessary when comparing the cover and density of non-natives, annuals, herbaceous perennials, suffrutescents, and subshrubs between controls and treatments as well as when comparing the richness of suffrutescents and subshrubs. Bivariate regression analyses were conducted using the ordinary least squares model to determine if the time elapsed since treatment had an effect on vegetation characteristics (P < 0.05), and Jaccard’s Index was used to compare community diversity between masticated and wildfire sites in both the case study and regional comparisons (Krebs 1999).|$|E
40|$|International audienceGranitic outcrop {{vegetation}} {{was compared}} in 22 inselbergs of French Guiana, South America, using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses {{to identify the}} main relationships between environmental gradients and plant traits. At {{the scale of the}} whole territory the distribution of species and species traits was mostly driven by a spatially-structured gradient embracing regional climate (annual rainfall), forest matrix (canopy openness), and inselberg features (altitude, shape, habitats, summit forest, degree of epiphytism, fire events). Biogeographic, environmental and past historical factors contribute to explain the variation observed at coarse scale and two groups of inselbergs are identified. A first group occupies the southern peneplain in a semi-open forest matrix and exhibits a higher representation of <b>suffrutescent</b> species and climbers, a lower representation of upright shrubs, a lower degree of Guiana Shield endemism, and a higher incidence of human use and autochory. All these features suggest an adaptation to more disturbed environments linked to past climate changes and savannization and to human influences. A second group, characterized by opposite plant traits, occupies the northern part of French Guiana and the far south within a closed forest matrix. Within archipelagos (inselbergs at less than 7 km distance), C-score and Mantel tests revealed a random co-occurrence of plant species and an increase of floristic dissimilarity with distance without any concomitant change in plant traits, respectively, suggesting that spatially-structured stochastic factors (limitation by dispersal) were the driving force of vegetation change at fine scale...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{collections}} representing {{one species}} each of Symbolanthus and Tachia, and 17 species of Macrocarpaea were studied {{by means of}} light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Wood details show that the three genera form a coherent group; Tachia differs from the others {{in only a few}} minor characters. Because the species studied form a natural group, wood variations within Helieae offer the basis for correlations and interpretations with respect to habit and ecology. Diameter of stems studied proves to be an important variable that must be taken into account. Correlations with stem diameter include wider vessels in outer wood of wider samples. This would correspond to deeper penetration of reliable water tables by roots of helioid trees or large shrubs. Ray height decreases with increase in stem diameter, an indication of paedomorphosis. Rays of all species are paedomorphic in histology by virtue of relative paucity or even absence of procumbent cells in multiseriate rays. Pseusoscalariform lateral wall pitting of vessels is also a feature characteristic of paedomorphosis. The assemblage of paedomorphic features correlates well with the conclusion, reached by authors who used cladistic methods, that Gentianaceae other than Gentianeae are derived from <b>suffrutescent</b> prennials. The Mesomorphy Ratio, which incorporates three vessel features, correlates with leaf length and with stem diameter. All Helieae are mesophytic, but to various degrees. Septate fiber-tracheids, where present, are typically near vessels and form a substitute for or an addendum to vasicentric axial parenchyma as a mechanism for photosynthate storage. Vestured pits occur on lateral wall pits of vessels of all Helieae, but not on the fibertracheids. Vestured pits show diversity within Macrocarpaea, a feature of possible systematic significance...|$|E

The article presents statistical data on the dynamics of livestock in arid, humid and contemporary, transitional climatic cycles. The first (1987) cycle {{is characterized by the}} highest, the second (1995) by the lowest and third (2014) by increasing load of cattle pasture. Furthermore, these periods have coincided with the change of political situation in the country. The study of key areas of vegetation pastures was carried out according to the "Field geobotany" guideline (1974) by expeditionary and stationary methods. Results. Years of research have allowed following the dynamics of pasture conditions for faulty stages in different types of vegetation to determine the modern state under the influence of modern grazing pressure. It was found that the indicators of pasture digression are species composition as well as other derivatives of plant communities. In the steppe cenoses the weak stage is indicated by caespitosa cereals, the average – domination of xerophilic semishrubs, very strong - ephemera, ephemeroids, harmful and poisonous plants. In the zonal <b>suffrutescent</b> deserts degradation becomes clearly apparent in the severe stages of failure. According to the degree of failure layering, complexity and productivity of plant communities are reduced. Conclusion.

40|$|Nitrogen-fixing {{diazotrophic}} root-nodule {{bacteria are}} of immense economic importance {{because of their}} symbiosis with leguminous plants. Diazotrophic bacteria infect the host legume root inducing the formation of nodules in which the bacteria (also termed rhizobia) replicate and synthesize the enzyme nitrogenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia for subsequent use by the plant as {{a major source of}} nitrogen. Nitrogen is an essential element required by plants for growth and synthesis of protein and is usually the most limiting element in agricultural production as well as being the most expensive component of fertilizer. The aim of my {{study was to determine the}} diversity and taxonomy of a specific group of root nodule bacteria associated with different species of Lebeckia. The genus Lebeckia Thunb. (Family Leguminosae, subfamily Papilionoideae, tribe Crotalarieae) comprises some 33 plant species. These plants are mainly indigenous to the southern and Western Cape regions of South Africa. They are divided into shrubby trifoliate-leaf species in the sections Calobota, Stiza and Viborgioides and <b>suffrutescent</b> unifoliate needle-leaf species in the section Lebeckia. Plants of this genus are adapted to harsh environmental conditions such as are found in the Karoo and Namaqualand. Several Lebeckia species are beneficial, such as L. spinescens and L. multiflora, which are valuable as pasture legumes and well grazed by animals especially in winter. All the species have ecological value because of their nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. To my knowledge, no attempts have been made in the past to investigate these microsymbionts of Lebeckia. Root nodules were collected from Lebeckia species at a wide variety of localities in the western and southern Cape regions of South Africa. Indigenous rhizobia isolated from these nodules were investigated for their nodulation abilities on their respective host plants as well as on non-host promiscuous legumes, cowpea and siratro. The isolates were then characterized using random amplified DNA fingerprinting followed by DNA sequencing of selected isolates. Results presented in this study showed that the indigenous South African genus Lebeckia is nodulated by diverse rhizobia from both α- and β-Proteobacteria. The first chapter contains a literature review of symbiotic nitrogen fixation that includes a general description of the biology, inoculant technology and the taxonomy of legumes and their rhizobia. The genera within the tribe Crotalarieae (such as Crotalaria, Lotononis, and Aspalathus) were discussed with special reference to the genus Lebeckia. Technical methods used for the classification of rhizobia were also reviewed. Non-DNA-based methods such as host specificity, substrate utilization, antibiotic resistance, morphological characters and biochemical properties as well as DNA based fingerprinting methods (ARDRA, RFLP RAPD, and AFLP), DNA sequence information, analysis of whole genomes, DNA-DNA hybridization and polyphasic approaches were outlined. The second chapter describes the isolation of 79 rhizobial isolates from the root nodules of 10 Lebeckia species. The isolates were purified and tested for nodulation and nitrogen fixation on cowpea and siratro as well as their host plants. All the isolates fixed nitrogen on their respective Lebeckia hosts, whereas 56 % of the strains were effective on cowpea and 77 % on siratro. The third chapter describes initial comparison and screening of the isolates by SP-PCR fingerprinting analysis. DNA profiles showed that most of the isolates grouped according to host plant species rather than geographical location. Isolates selected from different clusters were subjected to partial 16 S rDNA gene sequencing to confirm their taxonomic identity. This revealed that Lebeckia is nodulated by diverse genera of root nodule bacteria from both the α-Proteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Sinorhizobium) as well as the β-Proteobacteria (Burkholderia). The final chapter (Chapter 4) provides concluding remarks on my results and possible future avenues of research on the Lebeckia rhizobia. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of my doctoral studies, which were focussed on main phylogenetic relationships and important evolutionary processes within two families of Lamiales, Scrophulariaceae Juss. (dealing with the type genus Scrophularia L.) and Orobanchaceae Vent. (tribe Rhinantheae Lam. & DC.). Rhinantheae are hemiparasitic plants with a predominantly Northern Hemisphere distribution, alongside some representatives which have radiated on southern continents, e. g. the genus Bartsia L. sensu Molau (1990) with several Andean and two afromontane species. The figwort genus Scrophularia is widespread across the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It comprises about 250 species of mainly herbaceous or <b>suffrutescent</b> perennials, and is characterized by considerable morphological variability and chromosomal diversity. Reticulate evolution is common in Scrophularia as well as several genera within Rhinantheae. The aim of this thesis was 1) to test previous phylogenetic hypotheses of Rhinantheae, also by including several small genera; 2) to investigate phylogenetic relationships within Bartsia sensu Molau (1990) and Odontites Ludw., and to re-evaluate existing taxonomic concepts; 3) to verify the monophyly of Scrophularia and, for the first time, establish a comprehensive phylogenetic framework including all relevant lineages; 4) to reconstruct the biogeographic history of the genus, to gain insight into colonization pathways and the processes which have formed present distribution patterns; 5) to determine possible causes for the high species diversity and endemicity in several areas of the distribution range; 6) to assess the influence of hybridization on the evolutionary history of Scrophularia, and to identify possible parental lineages of polyploid (and homoploid) hybrid species; 7) to examine the impact of hybridization and other processes on molecular phylogenetic reconstruction; and 8) to explore how the problems resulting from this influence can be alleviated or even utilized to elucidate the underlying processes; and to compile corresponding practical workflows. To achieve these goals, I followed a molecular systematic approach. Nucleotide sequences from five non-coding chloroplast loci (intergenic spacers trnQ-rps 16 and psbA-trnH, the trnL-trnF region, part of the trnK region, and the rps 16 intron) as well as nuclear ribosomal DNA (the internal transcribed spacer region, ITS) were analyzed to infer phylogenetic relationships. This was done using Bayesian inference, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony approaches, and statistical parsimony networking. Information from nuclear intra-individual sequence polymorphisms as well as plastid indels was coded, and selected individuals were cloned for the ITS marker. Regarding plastid and nuclear data, among-dataset incongruence and within-dataset uncertainty and conflict were assessed with statistical tests and examined using unrooted phylogenetic networks (split networks). The biogeographic history of the genus was inferred using divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstruction. Where appropriate, a taxon duplication approach was applied to permit the incorporation of incongruent taxa into a combined analysis of markers from both compartments. Plant material for the studies was obtained from specimens on loan from several herbaria and collected during herbarium studies at Vienna (W/WU) and Harvard University (A/GH); several species were cultivated at the greenhouses at the Botanical Garden in Munich. According to my phylogenetic analyses, Rhinantheae contain a core group of four major lineages. Bartsia sensu Molau (1990) is polyphyletic; most species belong to either the African genus Hedbergia Molau or the hitherto monotypic Bellardia All., with the latter also including Parentucellia Viv. For Odontites, a broader circumscription was proposed; Rhinantheae are updated to comprise app. 13 genera. Topological incongruence among plastid and nuclear trees in some cases could be the result of intergeneric hybridization; this process might also have created the genera Nothobartsia Bolliger & Molau and Odontitella Rothm. However, plastid and nuclear markers can be reconciled by pruning conflicting taxa. By contrast, my studies on Scrophularia revealed far more substantial plastid - nuclear marker incongruence. In ITS, intra-individual nucleotide polymorphism is widespread, which argues for incomplete concerted evolution and causes topological ambiguity. I inferred these phenomena to be caused by a combination of reticulation (including introgression), incomplete lineage sorting ("ILS") of ancestral polymorphisms, and, regarding ITS, possibly incipient pseudogenization and inter-array heterogeneity. Species diversity in Scrophularia is however largely attributable to ancient and recent hybridization and (allo-) polyploidization, for which I was able to illustrate several examples. It is evident that these processes were one major driving force in the evolutionary history of the genus. The other key factor likely was allopatric speciation, promoted by the heterogeneous topography of the preferred mountain habitats. Often, these two factors have supposedly acted in combination, also under the influence of different climatic periods and associated temperature oscillations (including the Pleistocene glaciations). The emergence and diversification of Scrophularia are closely linked to geological and climatic events in the Irano - Turanian region and Central / Eastern Asia; the genus originated in Southwestern Asia during the Miocene. Most diversification events and further successful dispersals to its present distribution areas occurred in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This also involved the colonization of the New World across the Bering Land Bridge and dispersal to the Macaronesian and Caribbean islands. My analyses support two main species groups in Scrophularia, which correspond to previously proposed major sections. The genus is monophyletic upon inclusion of the Himalayan genus Oreosolen Hook. f. Like in Rhinantheae, morphological synapomorphies are rarely present, and some morphological traits have presumably evolved in convergence. Scrophularia represents a useful model for studying evolutionary history in the context of reticulation. This dissertation provides the first comprehensive phylogenetic framework for the genus, which will serve as a solid basis for subsequent research. The methodical workflows implemented in this thesis constitute valuable guidelines for researchers dealing with similarly complex plant lineages. Die vorliegende Dissertation stellt die Ergebnisse meiner Doktorarbeit vor, die die grundsätzlichen phylogenetischen Beziehungen und wichtige evolutionäre Prozesse innerhalb zweier Familien der Lamiales zum Schwerpunkt hatte, den Scrophulariaceae Juss. (und hierbei die Typusgattung Scrophularia L.) und den Orobanchaceae Vent. (Tribus Rhinantheae Lam. & DC.). Die Rhinantheen sind halbparasitische Pflanzen mit einer vornehmlich nordhemisphärischen Verbreitung, abgesehen von einigen Vertretern mit Radiationen auf südlichen Kontinenten, wie z. B. der Gattung Bartsia L. sensu Molau (1990) mit mehreren andinen sowie zwei afromontanen Arten. Die Gattung Scrophularia, die Braunwurz, ist weitverbreitet auf der gemäßigten Nordhalbkugel. Sie umfaßt ca. 250 hauptsächlich krautige oder halbstrauchige, mehrjährige Arten, und ist durch erhebliche morphologische Variabilität sowie eine Vielfalt an Chromosomenzahlen gekennzeichnet. Vernetzte Evolution ("reticulate evolution") ist häufig, wie auch in einigen Gattungen der Rhinantheae. Das Ziel dieser Doktorarbeit war 1) bestehende stammesgeschichtliche Hypothesen betreffend die Rhinantheae zu überprüfen, auch unter Einbeziehung mehrerer kleiner Gattungen; 2) phylogenetische Beziehungen innerhalb Bartsia sensu Molau (1990) und Odontites Ludw. zu erforschen, und bestehende taxonomische Konzepte neu zu bewerten; 3) die Monophylie von Scrophularia zu bestätigen und erstmalig ein umfassendes verwandtschaftliches Grundgerüst zu etablieren, das alle relevanten Linien umfaßt; 4) die biogeographische Entwicklung der Gattung zu rekonstruieren, um Einblicke in Ausbreitungswege zu erhalten sowie in die Prozesse, welche gegenwärtige Verbreitungsmuster geformt haben; 5) mögliche Gründe für die hohe Artdiversität und den Endemismus in mehreren Bereichen des Verbreitungsgebiets zu finden; 6) den Einfluß von Hybridisierung auf die Evolutionsgeschichte von Scrophularia einzuschätzen, und mögliche Elternlinien polyploider (und homoploider) hybridogener Arten zu identifizieren; 7) die Einwirkung von Hybridisierung und anderen Prozessen auf die molekularbasierte Rekonstruktion von Stammesgeschichte zu untersuchen; und 8) zu erkunden wie die Probleme, die sich aus diesem Einfluß ergeben, abgeschwächt oder sogar nutzbar gemacht werden können, um die zugrundeliegenden Prozesse aufzuklären; und entsprechende praktische Arbeitsabläufe zusammenzustellen. Um diese Ziele zu erreichen, verfolgte ich einen molekularsystematischen Ansatz. Nukleotidsequenzen von fünf nicht-codierenden Chloroplasten-Loci (intergenic spacer trnQ-rps 16 und psbA-trnH, die trnL-trnF Region, ein Teil der trnK Region, und das rps 16 Intron), sowie ribosomale Kern-DNA (die internal transcribed spacer Region, ITS), wurden analysiert, um auf Verwandtschaftsbeziehungen rückzuschließen. Dabei wurden Bayes'sche Statistik, Maximum-Likelihood- und Maximum-Parsimony-Methoden, und Netzwerke auf Basis statistischer Parsimonie verwendet. Information aus nukleären intraindividuellen Sequenzpolymorphismen und plastidären Insertionen-Deletionen (Indels) wurde codiert, und ITS-Sequenzbereiche ausgewählter Individuen wurden kloniert. Inkongruenzen zwischen den Plastiden- und Kerndatensätzen sowie Konflikt und Unklarheit innerhalb derselben wurden mittels statistischer Tests bewertet, und unter Verwendung von nicht-gewurzelten phylogenetischen Netzwerken (Split- Netzwerken) untersucht. Aus der Datierung von Artaufspaltungen (divergence time estimation) sowie der Rekonstruktion ursprünglicher Verbreitungsgebiete (ancestral area reconstruction) wurde die historische Biogeographie der Gattung abgeleitet. Wo nötig wurde eine Methode zur Aufteilung der Sequenzinformation einzelner Akzessionen (taxon duplication approach) angewandt, um inkongruente Taxa in eine kombinierte Analyse von Markern beider Kompartimente einbeziehen zu können. Pflanzenmaterial für die Studien wurde von entliehenen Belegen diverser Herbarien entnommen, auch wurden Herbarstudien in Wien (W/WU) und an der Universität Harvard (A/GH) durchgeführt; mehrere Arten wurden in den Gewächshäusern des Botanischen Gartens München kultiviert. Meine Abstammungsanalysen zeigen, daß die Tribus Rhinantheae eine zentrale Artengruppe aufweist, die aus vier Hauptlinien besteht. Bartsia sensu Molau (1990) ist polyphyletisch; die meisten Arten gehören entweder der afrikanischen Gattung Hedbergia Molau an oder der bis dato monotypischen Bellardia All.; letztere beinhaltet auch Parentucellia Viv. Eine breitere Umschreibung wurde für Odontites vorgeschlagen; die Tribus Rhinantheae besteht nun aus ca. 13 Gattungen. Inkongruenzen bezüglich der Position von Taxa in Plastiden- versus Kernmarker-Stammbäumen könnten in einigen Fällen das Ergebnis gattungsübergreifender Hybridisierung sein; dieser Prozess könnte auch die beiden Gattungen Nothobartsia Bolliger & Molau und Odontitella Rothm. erzeugt haben. Nach Ausschluß zwiespältiger Akzessionen können plastidäre und nukleäre Marker jedoch kombiniert analysiert werden. Im Gegensatz dazu offenbarten meine Studien an Scrophularia weit beträchtlichere Konflikte zwischen Chloroplasten- und Kernmarkerdaten. Zusätzlich sind innerhalb der ITS-Sequenzen häufig Nukleotid-Polymorphismen vorhanden, was zu Unsicherheiten in der Baumtopologie führt und für eine unvollständige Homogenisierung verschiedener Sequenzkopien spricht (incomplete concerted evolution). Diese Phänomene sind nach meinen Schlußfolgerungen das Ergebnis einer Kombination von retikulater Evolution (inklusive Introgression), unvollständiger Aufteilung ursprünglicher Allelvarianten (incomplete lineage sorting, "ILS"), und, im Fall von ITS, möglicherweise beginnender Pseudogenisierung und abweichender Kopien in getrennten Genbereichen. Die Artenvielfalt in Scrophularia ist jedoch zum großen Teil auf historische und rezente Hybridisierung und (Allo-) Polyploidisierung zurückzuführen, für die ich mehrere Beispiele aufzeigen konnte. Es ist offensichtlich, daß diese Prozesse eine der Hauptantriebskräfte in der Evolutionsgeschichte der Gattung waren. Der andere Schlüsselfaktor war wahrscheinlich geographische Artbildung, gefördert durch die ungleichmäßige Topographie der bevorzugten bergigen Habitate. Diese beiden Faktoren wirkten vermutlich des Öfteren kombiniert, auch unter dem Einfluß verschiedener Klimaperioden und der dazugehörigen Temperaturschwankungen (inklusive der Vergletscherungen während des Quartärs). Das Erscheinen und die Auffächerung von Scrophularia sind eng mit geologischen und klimatischen Ereignissen in der irano-turanischen Florenregion sowie in Zentral- und Ostasien verbunden; die Gattung entstand in Südwestasien, während des Miozän. Die meisten Artaufspaltungsereignisse und die weitere erfolgreiche Ausbreitung in ihre heutigen Verbreitungsgebiete fanden im Pliozän und Pleistozän statt. Dies beinhaltete auch die Kolonisierung der Neuen Welt über die Bering-Landbrücke und die Ausbreitung auf die makaronesischen und karibischen Inseln. Meine Untersuchungen stützen zwei große Artgruppen in Scrophularia, die bisher vorgeschlagenen Hauptsektionen entsprechen. Die Gattung ist monophyletisch nach Einbeziehung der himalayischen Gattung Oreosolen Hook. f. Wie in den Rhinantheen sind kaum gemeinsame abgeleitete morphologische Merkmale (Synapomorphien) vorhanden, und einige morphologische Eigenschaften haben sich vermutlich konvergent entwickelt. Scrophularia stellt ein geeignetes Modell dar, um Evolutionsgeschichte unter dem Einfluß von Retikulation zu erforschen. Diese Dissertation legt das erste umfassende Grundgerüst der Stammesgeschichte der Gattung vor, das als solide Basis für weitergehende Forschungen dienen wird. Die methodischen Arbeitsschritte, die in dieser Arbeit angewandt wurden, bilden wertvolle Richtlinien für Forscher, die mit ähnlich komplexen Pflanzengruppen arbeiten...|$|E
