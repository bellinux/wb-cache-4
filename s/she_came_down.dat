25|$|At {{the age of}} 11 months Genie {{was still}} in overall good health, and had no noted mental abnormalities, but had fallen to the 11th {{percentile}} for weight.

When Genie was 14 months old, <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a fever and pneumonitis and her parents took her to a pediatrician who had not previously seen her. The pediatrician said that, although her illness prevented a definitive diagnosis, there was a possibility that she was mentally retarded and that the brain dysfunction kernicterus might be present, further amplifying her father's conclusion that she was severely retarded.|$|E

In 1705 he was created Viscount Mount Crawfurd (later changed to Viscount Garnock) by Queen Anne, and died in December 1708. He married Margaret Stewart, daughter of the first Earl of Bute, and the couple had two sons and three daughters.

[...] Andrews subsequently joined the band on tour, with Adkins stating, [...] "there's female vocals on most of our records, so it's nice to have that represented live.

2500|$|Following the {{conventions}} of Afghan nobility, Babajan was reared under the strict purdah tradition, in which women were secluded from the outside world, and also subservient to a custom of arranged marriages. She opposed an unwelcome marriage planned for her, and {{ran away from home}} on her wedding day at the age of eighteen. Disguised in her burqa, she journeyed to Peshawar, the frontier city {{at the foot of the}} Khyber Pass. It was in or near Peshawar that she eventually came into contact with a Hindu sadguru. Following instruction from the guru, [...] "she went into seclusion in a nearby mountain outside Rawalpindi and underwent very severe [...] (spiritual austerities) for nearly seventeen months. Thereafter <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to [...] Punjab and stayed a few months in Multan. It was in Multan, while [...] was 37 years of age, she contacted a Muslim saint … who put end to her spiritual struggle by giving her God-realisation." [...] After that experience she returned to Rawalpindi to reconnect with the Hindu guru who, after several years, helped her return to normal consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, The Kolkata Telegraph {{reported}} that director Rituparno Ghosh wanted to cast Chakraverti {{in a film}} based on a case the Wiccan had encountered while practicing the craft. Ghosh commented, [...] "Till now, I have dealt with relationships and {{the intricacies of the}} human mind. With this film, I want to delve into that which lies beyond and observe how this non-conventional spiritualism, Wicca, guides me. [...] It's a story of two time zones, separated by a span of 150 years, two people of different mindsets and different cultures." [...] However, in 2006, the story Sacred Evil from Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown was adapted into a film by Sahara One Motion Pictures; Ipsita served as creative director. The film, titled as Sacred Evil– A True Story, was a joint venture between Sahara One and Percept Picture Company. Sacred Evil was the last story in the book and is about a nun who was hounded by her troubled past and for whom the convent eventually sought counseling from Chakraverti. Sahara One had approached August 2004 to make a film on Sacred Evil, but she was reluctant to play herself on the big screen when offered the role, and chose, instead to be the creative director. Chakraverti helped pen the script, incorporating a large amount of dialogue from her story. [...] "I told the production team how the protagonist reacted in certain situations, since I had lived the story, and how the dialogue happened. [...] I also insisted that the film be shot in Calcutta, though others had suggested other places, because it's here where I have done most of my therapies." [...] Actress Sarika was signed to play Chakraverti's part, to which Chakraverti said: [...] "The other and more important task was familiarizing Sarika with the ways of a Wiccan. We had several sittings before going for the shoot. Sarika wanted to imbibe me. So, <b>she</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to Delhi and lived with me for a while. I showed her how the healing took place and how certain rituals had been conducted." ...|$|E
