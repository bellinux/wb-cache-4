In 2016, Cadence expanded the portfolio with an upgraded serial link analysis flow including an IBIS-AMI modeling-building technology, USB 3.1 (Gen 2) compliance kit, and cut-and-stitch model extraction technology to segment long serial links into sections that should be modeled using 3D full-wave and sections that can be modeled using hybrid extraction technology. In 2015, Cadence released the Sigrity Parallel Computing 4-pack which enabled efficient product creation with 3X speedup in signoff-accurate PCB extraction, an updated power-aware <b>system</b> <b>signal</b> integrity (SI) feature which supports LPDDR4 analysis with full JEDEC compliance checking, and flexible licensing options.|$|E
50|$|A less {{positive}} {{story is}} that of the native white-clawed crayfish, which has suffered at the hands of another American import, the signal crayfish. Originally imported by the aquaculture industry, the signal crayfish was seen as a way for trout farms to diversify and exploit new markets. However, due to their expert, escapologist nature, signal crayfish soon escaped into surrounding river systems and quickly spread throughout the majority of the UK's southern river <b>system.</b> <b>Signal</b> crayfish have carried crayfish plague, to which they are resistant, but the native white-clawed crayfish is not. The result has been the gradual eradication of native crayfish from the UK's rivers. In the case of the Chess, white-clawed crayfish have been extinct since the mid-1990s.The Chess is also home to a number of invasive alien plant species including Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and Orange balsam.|$|E

A 57 kHz subcarrier (phase locked {{to the third}} harmonic of the stereo pilot tone) is used to carry a low-bandwidth digital Radio Data <b>System</b> <b>signal,</b> providing extra features such as Alternative Frequency (AF) and Network (NN). This narrowband signal runs at only 1,187.5 bits per second, thus is only suitable for text. A few proprietary systems are used for private communications.

In Germany the analog ARI system was used prior to RDS for broadcasting traffic announcements to motorists (without disturbing other listeners).
