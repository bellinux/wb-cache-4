Devices performances strongly depend on the ferroelectrics characteristics: Curie Temperature (Tc) which determines the use in the paraelectric or ferroelectric phase, permittivity , and losses. Integration of such materials implies the control of high quality thin films on substrates <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>microwaves</b> range. In this frame we investigated KTaxNb 1 -xO 3 (KTN) compound which gives access to various Tc according to x, together with quite low losses.

Although films were epitaxially grown on both substrate a higher crystalline quality was achieved on LaAlO 3 because of the better lattice mismatch: XRD rocking curves lin the range 0. 5 - 0. 8 ° were recorded on KTN films on LaAlO 3, and around 1. 2 ° on MgO.
