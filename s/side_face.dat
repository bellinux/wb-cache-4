The two through lines serve platform 4 (previously platform 3) and platform 6, the north <b>side</b> <b>face</b> of the new central island. The former platform 4 is no longer in public use, and while {{at the time of the}} East London Line service commencing it still had its platform furniture and information displays, these have since been removed.|$|E

6000|$|The barkeeper {{looked a}} little disappointed, for he was calculating to hug those old people, I judge; {{but it was the}} gladdest and proudest {{multitude}} you ever saw--because they had seen Moses and Esau. Everybody was saying, [...] "Did you see them?--I did--Esau's <b>side</b> <b>face</b> was to me, but I saw Moses full in the face, just as plain as I see you this minute!" ...|$|E
60|$|The observant matron did {{not fail}} to report this {{conversation}} to Charity, who laughed at the time, but treated Mr Moddle that very evening with increased consideration, and presented her <b>side</b> <b>face</b> to {{him as much as}} possible. Mr Moddle was not less sentimental than usual; was rather more so, if anything; but he sat and stared at her with glistening eyes, and seemed grateful.|$|E

60|$|All {{this she}} stated without {{question}} or remark from Miss Panney; {{and when she}} had finished, she began again to tie the vines to their wires. Miss Panney gazed very steadily through her spectacles at the resolute <b>side</b> <b>face</b> of the girl, and said only {{that she was very}} glad that Miriam had been able to make such a good arrangement. It was plain enough to her that Molly Tooney must be dropped, but in doing this, Miss Panney would not drop her plans. They would simply be changed to suit circumstances.|$|E
60|$|First, their curiosity made them, from resolving to be concealed, {{discover}} {{one another}} wilfully; from utter strangers grow {{as familiar as}} old friends in a moment, swear one another to secrecy, and exchange the sentiments of their hearts together; and, from being friends, become envious of each other's enjoying a similitude of happiness; the compliments made on either <b>side</b> <b>face</b> to face, were, upon the turning of the back, turned into reflections, detraction, and ridicule; each was a self-lover and admirer of her own beauty and merit, and a despiser of the other's.|$|E
60|$|John Vansittart Smith shuffled {{towards the}} {{attendant}} with some intention of addressing him. He was not light of touch in conversation, {{and found it}} difficult to strike the happy mean between the brusqueness of the superior and the geniality of the equal. As he came nearer, the man presented his <b>side</b> <b>face</b> to him, but kept his gaze still bent upon his work. Vansittart Smith, fixing his eyes upon the fellow's skin, was conscious of a sudden impression that there was something inhuman and preternatural about its appearance. Over the temple and cheek-bone it was as glazed and as shiny as varnished parchment. There was no suggestion of pores. One could not fancy a drop of moisture upon that arid surface. From brow to chin, however, it was cross-hatched by a million delicate wrinkles, which shot and interlaced as though Nature in some Maori mood had tried how wild and intricate a pattern she could devise.|$|E

6000|$|It was easy, now, to see {{the change}} which had come over Lucy's position, in the attentions she received. All the ladies in the {{principal}} boxes had nods and smiles for her and half the fashionable-looking young men in the house crowded round her box, or actually entered it to pay their compliments. I fancied Andrew Drewett had a self-satisfied air that seemed to say, [...] "you are paying your homage indirectly to myself, in paying it to this young lady." [...] As for Lucy, my jealous watchfulness could not detect the smallest alteration in her deportment, so far as simplicity and nature were concerned. She appeared in a trifling degree more womanly, perhaps, than when I saw her last, being now in her twentieth year; but the attentions she received made no visible change in her manners. I had become lost in the scene, and was standing in a musing attitude, my <b>side</b> <b>face</b> towards the box, when I heard a suppressed exclamation, in Lucy's voice. I was too near her to be mistaken, and it caused the blood to rush to my heart in a torrent. Turning, I saw the dear girl, with her hand extended over {{the front of the}} box, her face suffused with blushes, and her eyes riveted on myself. I was recognised, and the surprise had produced a display of all that old friendship, certainly, that had once existed between us, in the simplicity and truth of childhood.|$|E
