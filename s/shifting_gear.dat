50|$|A multi-clutch gearbox {{avoids the}} {{difficulties}} of <b>shifting</b> <b>gear</b> by avoiding the need to shift at all. It operates {{as a number of}} separate gearboxes, each one controlled by a separate clutch, interlocked to avoid multiple selection. Selecting a gear is a matter of selecting the appropriate clutch. An advantage of this type is that it's simple to arrange remote operation, as there is no gear shift linkage as such, merely duplication of a clutch linkage.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the system}} does not have {{separate}} gears, but one (continuously <b>shifting)</b> <b>gear</b> and a separate 'reverse mode' (as opposed to a reverse gear), the gear works in reverse as well, giving it the interesting side effect that one can drive backwards as fast as forwards. As a result, in the former Dutch annual backward driving world championship, the DAFs {{had to be put}} in a separate competition because no other car could keep up. Thus, these very cheap and simple cars were the 'formula one' in this competition.|$|E

50|$|Hull trim is the {{adjustment}} of a boat's loading {{so as to}} change its fore-and-aft attitude in the water. In small boats, it is done by positioning the crew. In larger boats, {{the weight of a}} person has less effect on the hull trim, but it can be adjusted by <b>shifting</b> <b>gear,</b> fuel, water, or supplies. Different hull trim efforts are required for different kinds of boats and different conditions. Here are just a few examples: In a lightweight racing dinghy like a Thistle, the hull should be kept level, on its designed water line for best performance in all conditions. In many small boats, weight too far aft can cause drag by submerging the transom, especially in light to moderate winds. Weight too far forward can cause the bow to dig into the waves. In heavy winds, a boat with its bow too low may capsize by pitching forward over its bow (pitch-pole) or dive under the waves (submarine). On a run in heavy winds, the forces on the sails tend to drive a boat's bow down, so the crew weight is moved far aft.|$|E
5000|$|Lap 23 saw Webber, Alonso and Hamilton all pit {{again and}} yet again Hamilton {{had a problem}} with his left rear leaving him {{stationary}} for a mammoth 12.2 seconds while his pit time hit 30.622 seconds. Hamilton had an identical problem from the first pit stop with his left rear wheel nut not working properly. For the second time in the race Rosberg forced someone wide and off-road in the straight before turn 4, this time Alonso was his victim. Alonso was very vocal on the radio on Rosberg's actions which saw the stewards again decide to look at the incident after the race and not during it. Lap 25 saw Maldonado behind the duelling Rosberg and Alonso obtain a left rear puncture which sent him into a 360 degree spin and forced him to retire.Lap 31 saw Vettel lead from the two Lotus cars and Webber. By this stage it was clear that di Resta was on a two-stop strategy along with Sauber's Kobayshi. Räikkönen also started to catch leader Vettel and was within the DRS zone on lap 33. Vettel was told on his radio to dig deep and find some pace to defend with. Räikkönen moved ever closer to Vettel and on lap 36 attempted an overtake down the inside but then under braking switched to the outside unsuccessfully. Vettel was told [...] "push to pass" [...] meaning he was able to use his maximum 18,000rpm down the main straight to defend against Räikkönen and his DRS. Presumably Vettel had been <b>shifting</b> <b>gear</b> at under the permitted 18,000rpm limit in a bid to save fuel, as consequently Vettel stopped right after the completion of the race at the pit exit.Lap 39 saw Hamilton set the fastest lap at the time from 10th position. It also saw the last round of pit stops from leader Vettel, Räikkönen and Red Bull driver Webber. Backmarkers were now starting to be lapped, some for the second occasion of the race. After the pit stops, where both Vettel and Räikkönen both chose medium tyres, the gap that between them was under a second was out to more than three seconds. All of the top 10 were now on the preferred medium compound.|$|E
5000|$|Music Week {{made the}} record its {{album of the}} week; ' It has all the trade-marks of his past work along {{with a couple of}} Stonesy riffs, greater vocal depth and a little more {{diversity}} In style. It takes a while to really get into but Cole's musings and the lush synthesized backing soon become irresistible. He's certainly lost none of his appeal.'St. Petersburg Times gave the album a glowing review; 'Cole uses his austere yet seductive voice to create mental pictures. His songs are vivid vignettes and scenarios... The songs are closely related enough to make Lloyd Cole a cohesive whole. Cole's shades are gray, but translucent enough to show musical light, and enjoyable enough to show he is a viable solo artist.'The Guardian praised the assembled musicians who feature on the album, 'They charge into the mostly laid-back, introspective material with a rare confidence, balancing crisp guitar lines against a moody swirl of Hammond organ, <b>shifting</b> <b>gear</b> for a chugging, wide-screen ballad setting, or showing their New York underground roots with a pounding muted rocker. They are so good that they could easily run away with the album, and it's to Cole's credit that his personality dominates.'Record Mirror gave the album a positive review but identified the lack of exceptional material; 'Of the 13 songs on the album, those with harder edges work best. The bluesy riffs of 'What Do You Know About Love', the gamboling bass and haunting harmonica of 'Downtown'... and the hard, Stones-ish rock of 'I Hate To See You Baby Doing That Stuff' smack of leathers and punky sneers. The single 'No Blue Skies' and the ballad 'Loveless' are the pick of the lighter moments on the album which, though not disappointing, offers no surprises or classics.'The Washington Post criticised the album describing it as 'Moody, low-key and drowsy, this long album is almost too too Lloyd Cole, complete with such characteristically literary put-downs as [...] "Baby, you're too well-read." [...] A few more songs that aspire to the rambunctiousness of 'Sweetheart' or 'I Hate to See You Baby Doing That Stuff' would be welcome.' ...|$|E

In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed to synthesize the design concept of the three-speed automatic speed changer. In this paper, we accord to the design concepts of planetary gear trains with two degrees of freedom, which are proposed by Hong-Sen Yan and Long-Chang Hsieh. By applying the TRIZ creative design method to centrifugal clutch, one-way clutch, and brake, 10 kinds of creative design concepts of three-speed automatic speed changer was created. The results not only can serve as a teaching tool for creative design courses, but also can provide as a reference to industrial circles for development of the three-speed automatic speed changer of bicycle, electric motorcycle, and electric scooter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} vehicle fuel economy {{improvement}} using D-Range neutral control of automatic transmission. The system objected to reducing of fuel consumption during idle. Usually, turbine of conventional auto transmission is mechanically linked to wheel during idling condition. Therefore speed ratio of torque converter is zero for that period. This causes needless power loss by the torque converter slip. To improve this inefficiency automobile makers develops electronically-controlled D-range neutral control system. The D-range neutral control system minimizes slip on the torque converter by <b>shifting</b> <b>gear</b> to a neutral position during vehicle stoped with D-range gear position. However there's insufficient study {{about the effect}} of D-range neutral control system on vehicle fuel economy. In this paper, researches are performed on effect of D-range neutral control system on vehicle fuel economy by experiment with two different vehicle. And it is also estimated the effect on vehicle fuel economy using computer simulation. As a result, 1. 8 % of LA- 4 mode fuel economy improvement can be achieved in a vehicle by D-range neutral control system.

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{represents}} one of the grand societal challenges which policy makers around the world have agreed to jointly tackle it under the Paris Agreement. Henceforth, much research and policy advice has focused on de-veloping model-based scenarios to identify pathways towards achieving corre-sponding decarbonisation targets. In this paper, we complement such model-based analysis (based on IMAGE and Enertile) with insights from socio-technical transition analysis (MLP) to develop socio-technical storylines that plausibly show how low-carbon transitions can be implemented. We take the example of the transition of the German electricity system towards renewable energies, and elaborate two transition pathways which are assumed to achieve an 80 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, but differ in terms of lead actors, depth of change and scope of change: the first pathway captures the substitu-tion of technological components (pathway A) and assumes incumbents as lead actors and focuses on radical technological change while leaving other system elements intact; in contrast, pathway B (broader system transformation) postu-lates new entrants as lead actors, which rests on the assumption that trans-formative change occurs in the whole system, i. e. affecting the architecture of the system, technologies but also practises. For both pathways, we focus on how policy makers could govern such transition processes through transforma-tive policy mixes, and compare the requirements of such policy mixes depend-ing on the pathway pursued. We find that multi-dimensional socio-technical change going beyond technological substitution (pathway B) requires much greater emphasis on societal experimentation and a more proactive role for an-ticipatory deliberation processes from the outset. In contrast, <b>shifting</b> <b>gear</b> from a new entrant friendly past trajectory to an incumbent dominated pathway (pathway A) requires active agency from incumbents and is associated with what we have called regime stabilizing instruments which defend core principles of the old regime while simultaneously fulfilling decarbonisation as additional success criteria...|$|E
