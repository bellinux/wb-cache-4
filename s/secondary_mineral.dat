5|$|Widgiemoolthalite {{occurs as}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>mineral.</b> It is found {{overlaying}} nickel sulfide that has undergone weathering, often in hollow spaces on gaspéite surfaces, and often exhibiting fibrous and rarely massive crystal habits. Other minerals associated with widgiemoolthalite include annabergite, carrboydite, dolomite, glaukosphaerite, hydrohonessite, kambaldaite, magnesite, nepouite, nullaginite, olivenite, otwayite, paratacamite, pecoraite, reevesite, retgersite, and takovite. Two additional unnamed minerals were also reported as associated secondary minerals from the 132 North site, the only locality at which widgiemoolthalite has been found. The 132 North waste pile from which widgiemoolthalite was first recovered {{is no longer}} in existence, making it a rare mineral. In support of the designation of an Anthropocene epoch, the existence and provenance of widgiemoolthalite, along with 207 other mineral species, have been cited as evidence of uniquely human action upon global stratigraphy.|$|E

25|$|As a <b>secondary</b> <b>mineral,</b> {{turquoise}} forms by {{the action}} of percolating acidic aqueous solutions during the weathering and oxidation of preexisting minerals. For example, the copper may come from primary copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite or from the secondary carbonates malachite or azurite; the aluminium may derive from feldspar; and the phosphorus from apatite. Climate factors appear {{to play an important role}} as turquoise is typically found in arid regions, filling or encrusting cavities and fractures in typically highly altered volcanic rocks, often with associated limonite and other iron oxides. In the Southwestern United States turquoise is almost invariably associated with the weathering products of copper sulfide deposits in or around potassium-feldspar-bearing porphyritic intrusives. In some occurrences alunite, potassium aluminium sulfate, is a prominent <b>secondary</b> <b>mineral.</b> Typically turquoise mineralization is restricted to a relatively shallow depth of less than , although it does occur along deeper fracture zones where secondary solutions have greater penetration or the depth to the water table is greater.|$|E

40|$|The nakhlites are olivine-bearing clinopyroxenites {{that formed}} in a Martian lava flow or shallow {{intrusion}} 1. 3 Ga ago [1, 2]. They are scientifically extremely valuable because they interacted with water-bearing fluids on Mars [3]. Fluid-rock interactions {{led to the}} precipitation of <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals,</b> {{many of which are}} hydrous. The <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> consist in a mixture of poorly crystalline smectitic material and Fe-oxide, collectively called “iddingsite”, but also carbonate and sulphate [4]. The proportion, chemistry and habit of the <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> vary between members of the Nakhlite group, which is thought to reflect compositional variation of the fluid within the Martian crust [5]. However, some <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> are quite similar to terrestrial alteration products and thus the chemical and textural variations could also reflect terrestrial contamination (deposition or exchange). Identifying the origin of the <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> is not straightforward but essential to unravel the Martian fluid chemistry and conditions. Yamato 000593 (Y- 000593) is a nakhlite meteorite that was discovered in Antarctica near the Yamato Mountains by the Japanesse Antarctic Research Expedition in 2000 - 2001 [6]. Most of the meteorite is covered by a black shiny fusion crust but it also has deep erosion features in its underside that probably formed by freeze- thaw cycles. As in most other Nakhlites, Y 000593 contains iddingsite-like alteration products believed to have been formed on Mars because they have devolatilization features at the vicinity of the fusion crust [7]. Additional evidence of Martian aqueous alteration is the presence of laihunite, a high temperature oxidative alteration product of fayalitic olivine [8]. The <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> in Y- 000593 can provide a powerful insight into the Martian hydrosphere from high to low temperature environments with implications for the origin, cycling, and availability of water on Mars. However, it is highly likely that some <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> have formed on Earth which can biased our understanding of the Martian groundwater chemistry. With this in mind, we are trying to identify all the different <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> and document their spatial and textural relations, their mineralogy and chemistry to better constrain their possible origin and the impact that terrestrial fluids may have had on the Martian alteration products. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Investigation {{of modern}} and fossil teeth from {{northern}} and central Kenya, using the ion micro-probe, electron microprobe, and transmission electron microscope, confirms that fossil tooth chemistry is controlled {{not only by}} the diagenetic precipitation of <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> but also by the chemical alteration of the biogenic apatite. Increases in the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Si, Al, Ba, and possibly Cu in fossil vs. modern teeth reflect mixtures of apatite and <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals.</b> These <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> occur in concen-trations ranging from; 0. 3 % in enamel to; 5 % in dentine and include sub-mm, interstitial Fe-bearing manganite [(Fe 31, Mn 31) O(OH) ], and smectite. The pervasive distribution and fine grain size of the <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> indicate that mixed analyses of primary and secondary material are unavoidable in in situ methods, even in ion microprobe spots only 10 mm in diameter, and that bulk chemical analyses are severely biased. Increases in other elements, including the rare earth elements, U, F, and possibly Sr apparently reflect additional alteration of apatite in both dentine and enamel. Extreme care will be required to separate <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> from original biogenic apatite for paleobiological or paleoclimate studies, and nonetheless bulk analyses of purified apatite may be suspect. Although the PO 4 component of teeth seems resistant to chemical alteration, the OH component is extensively altered. This OH alteration implies that bulk analyses of fossil tooth enamel for oxygen isotope composition may be systematically biased by 61 ‰, and seasonal records of oxygen isotope composition may be spuriously shifted, enhanced, or diminished.

40|$|The 500, 000 km 2 of Deccan basalts are {{situated}} in Maharastra, India.

The {{frequency of occurrence}} and distribution of the zeolite species in an area 15, 000 km 2 has been determined and {{does not support the}} zonal scheme proposed by earlier workers. The zeolites occur in vesicles and veins which are often lined by celadonite. Heulandite, stilbite, mordenite and apophyllite are the most common <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> with other species occurring at a frequency of less than one identification per locality studied. Evidence is discussed which shows that the observed zeolite distribution was produced by temperatures of 70 °C at the top and 110 °C {{at the base of the}} basalt pile. This temperature range is low in comparison with other zeolitised basalt domains and zeolite zones which are characteristic of similar regions elsewhere have not developed. Chemical analysis of the <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> for major and trace elements indicates considerable variation in the principle cations within a species, and a marked absence of trace constituents, especially the rare earth elements.

Chemical and oxygen isotopic compositions of the basalt indicate that interaction occurred between the zeolitising fluid and the basalt and that this interaction was more intensive along fluid pathways e. g. at flow boundaries. Major elements, Ba, Rb and Sr were leached from the basalt in contrast to other trace elements including the rare earth elements.

40|$|By {{providing}} the largest {{part of the}} reactive surface area of soils, <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> {{play a major role}} in terrestrial biogeochemical processes. The understanding of the mechanisms governing neo(trans-) formation of pedogenic clay minerals in soils is therefore of the utmost importance to learn how soils evolve and impact the chemistry of elements in terrestrial environments. Soil-forming processes governing the evolution of secondary aluminosilicates in Podzols are however still not fully understood. The evolution of silicon (Si) isotope signature in the clay fraction of a podzolic soil chronosequence can provide new insight into these processes, enabling to trace the source of Si in secondary aluminosilicates during podzol-forming processes characterized by the mobilization, transport and precipitation of carbon, metals and Si. The Si isotope compositions in the clay fraction (comprised of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals)</b> document an increasing light 28 Si enrichment and depletion with soil age, respectively in illuvial B horizons and eluvial E horizon. The mass balance approach demonstrates that <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> in the topsoil eluvial E horizons are isotopically heavier with δ 30 Si values increasing from - 0. 39 to + 0. 64 ‰ in c. a. 200 years, while <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> in the illuvial Bhs horizon are isotopically lighter (δ 30 Si=- 2. 31 ‰), compared to the original "unweathered" <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> in BC horizon (δ 30 Si=- 1. 40 ‰). The evolution of Si isotope signatures is explained by the dissolution of pedogenic clay minerals in the topsoil, which is a source of light 28 Si for the re-precipitation of new clay minerals in the subsoil. This provides consistent evidence that in strong weathering environment such as encountered in Podzols, Si released from <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> is partially used to form "tertiary clay minerals" over very short time scales (ca. 300 years). Our dataset demonstrates the usefulness to measure Si isotope signatures in the clay fraction to discern clay mineral changes (e. g., neoformation versus solid state transformation) during soil evolution. This offers new opportunity to better understand clay mineral genesis under environmental changes, and the short-term impact of the dissolution and re-precipitation of pedogenic clay minerals on soil fertility, soil carbon budget and elemental cycles in soil-plant systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.

A major factor in determining the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a repository is the potential for the site to be flooded by water during the regulatory lifetime. The current study was undertaken to examine the past fluid history at the site, to gain a better understanding of the possibility of flooding in the near geologic future. To estimate the past fluid flux into the repository horizon, research has focused on <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> that precipitated in open space in lithophysal cavities, fractures, and breccias in the host Miocene tuffs. U. S. Geological Survey researchers concluded that <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> formed from descending surficial meteoric fluids in a vadose environment. State of Nevada scientists observed 2 -phase fluid inclusions with homogenization temperatures of 35 to 85 °C in <b>secondary</b> <b>minerals</b> and concluded that these minerals formed in the phreatic environment from upwelling hydrothermal fluids. They further concluded that upwelling hydrothermal fluids repeatedly invaded the site, have invaded the site in the recent geologic past, and could do so again making Yucca Mountain an unsafe site for high level nuclear waste storage. These studies did not constrain the timing of incursion of the fluids with elevated temperatures or the extent of this fluid flux across the site. This report provides the geologic context for subsequent fluid inclusion and geochronological studies (Wilson et al., 2002) that identified the temperature and extent of the fluid incursion and placed absolute temporal constraints on the fluid history at Yucca Mountain.
