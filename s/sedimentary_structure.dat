It is made up from thick beds of grey quartz sandstone mostly, but has some beds included of siltstone and grey shale. The grain size is fine to medium. It was originally named by Öpik after the mountain—Black Mountain where it is found. Originally it {{was believed to be}} Ordovician, but is actually from the Silurian period, late Llandoverian epoch. Some of the slopes of Black mountain are covered in fanglomerate. The deposition was in a marine proximal turbidite fan, with the turbidity current flowing to the east. There are no fossils, but there is some <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structure</b> including plane, cross or convolute laminations, load casts, slump units and flute moulds.|$|E

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) exploits {{changes in}} permittivity within sediments to image <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> and stratigraphy {{and has been}} shown to work very well in aeolian sands. This approach has proved highly valuable in studies of aeolian <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> and has resulted in new models of dune development. When combined with high resolution optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, GPR has also provided new insights into long-term (decades to millennia) dune dynamics. Full realization of the potential of GPR to determine dune evolution and dynamics is however hampered by the complexity of visualizing and quantitatively analyzing <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> and deposits in three dimensions.

40|$|The Eagle Ford Formation is {{currently}} the most economically significant unconventional resource play {{in the state of}} Texas. There has been much debate as to the environment of deposition for the lowermost Facies A of the Eagle Ford in outcrop exposures in Lozier Canyon, Texas. Two conflicting hypotheses were proposed: 1) <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> in Facies A are hummocky cross-stratification (HCS) and swaley cross-stratification (SCS), which indicates a shelfal depositional environment above the storm wave base (SWB). 2) <b>Sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> in Facies A are a mixture of diagenetically separated contourites, turbidites, and pinch-and-swell beds, which indicate a distal-slope depositional environment below SWB. This research used field work, three-dimensional analysis of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structures,</b> measurements of ripple height, and laboratory analysis to interpret the environment of deposition. The results of these observations and data suggest that the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> in Facies A record a depositional environment above SWB. Observation of cross-bedded structures in three-dimensions reveals (i) isotropic truncation of laminae; (ii) symmetric rounded ripples; (iii) large variations in laminae geometry, truncation, and dip inclination, attributed to fluctuations in storm intensity, frequency, and duration; and (iv) and bidirectional downlap and reactivation surfaces associated with oscillatory flow above the SWB. This study interprets cross-bedded <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structures</b> in Facies A as swaley cross-stratification (SCS) and hummocky cross-stratification (HCS) associated with storm events, and thus places Facies A in a depositional environment above storm wave-base (SWB) ...|$|R

50|$|Parting lineation (also {{known as}} current lineation or primary current lineation) {{is a subtle}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>structure</b> in which sand grains are aligned in {{parallel}} lines or grooves {{on the surface of}} a body of sand (or lithified as a sandstone).

50|$|During the {{conventional}} formation process of cross-stratification, sand grains saltate up the upstream {{side of the}} dune, collecting at the peak until the angle of repose is reached.
