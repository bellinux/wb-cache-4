In 2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine darcin, after Mr. Darcy, because it strongly attracted females. In 2016, a scientific paper {{published in the}} Journal of Inherited Metabolic Diseases speculated that Mrs. Bennet {{may have been a}} carrier of a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn't have any sons, and why some of the Bennet sisters are <b>so</b> <b>silly.</b>|$|E

Completely unnecessary." [...] She told a USA Today reporter, [...] "This is <b>so</b> <b>silly,</b> there's no reason they need to send you this much information." [...] Ezarik is a heavy user who typically sends and receives tens of thousands of text messages a month, which generated an exceptionally long, $275 bill – 300 double-sided pages that had to be sent in a box with postage charges of $7.|$|E
500|$|Alonso Duralde of MSNBC {{described}} Doomsday: [...] "It's ridiculous, derivative, confusingly {{edited and}} laden with gore, but it's {{the kind of}} over-the-top grindhouse epic that wears down your defenses and eventually makes you just go with it." [...] Duralde believed that Mitra's character would have qualified as a [...] "memorable fierce chick" [...] if the film was not <b>so</b> <b>silly.</b> David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer rated Doomsday at 2.5 out of 4 stars and thought that the film was better paced than most fantasy-action films, patiently building up its action scenes to the major [...] "fireworks" [...] where other films would normally be exhausted early on.|$|E

500|$|Robert Fulford in the Toronto-based {{magazine}} Maclean's, {{noted that}} [...] "the characteristic which makes Fleming appear <b>so</b> <b>silly</b> also helps make him so popular: his moral simplicity. When we read James Bond we know whose side we are on, {{why we are}} on that side and why we are certain to win. In the real world {{that is no longer}} possible." [...] Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission [...] "is aimed at restoring Britain's pre-World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent." [...] The Boston Globes Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was [...] "Bond's latest and grimmest mission", which she called [...] "Escapism in the Grand Manner".|$|E
500|$|He {{found the}} writing process for [...] "The Infinite Vulcan" [...] "unbearable". This was due to {{interference}} from Roddenberry, which resulting in Koenig producing ten drafts of the screenplay, and because of Koenig's frustration in not otherwise {{being involved in the}} series. He could not understand why so many redrafts were required, a view shared by story editor/associate producer D.C. Fontana. Roddenberry was keen in particular {{to make use of the}} benefits of an animated medium, by including things which could not have been shown on a live-action series. These included [...] "talking vegetables" [...] as characters, which Koenig said were not his idea but were <b>so</b> <b>silly</b> as to not be worthy of a fight. David Alexander, in his book Star Trek Creator: The Authorised Biography of Gene Roddenberry, suggested that Koenig was hired to write [...] "The Infinite Vulcan" [...] because Roddenberry felt [...] "bad" [...] about Koenig's exclusion from the series.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were {{completely}} negative; others were more mixed. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "as far as [...] go, 'Agua Mala' was pretty standard fare." [...] However, he criticized the episodes resolution, noting that Scully should have {{had no way to}} know pure water would kill the creature. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote that, [...] "'Agua Mala' won't end up on anybody's 'best of' list, but it's <b>so</b> <b>silly</b> that it's sort of fun." [...] Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! News named [...] "The Hurricane Monster" [...] as one of [...] "The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week", writing, [...] "I'll tell you one thing about this X-Files episode and this X-Files monster: you'll never go to the bathroom during a rainstorm again without thinking twice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brooks {{felt that}} a sketch show would best suit her assets (acting, singing, and dancing).

500|$|Captain Henry Blackwood {{arrived at}} Merton early on 2 September, {{bringing}} {{news that the}} French and Spanish fleets had combined and were currently at anchor in Cádiz. Nelson hurried to London where he met cabinet ministers and was given command of the fleet blockading Cádiz. It was while attending one of these meetings on 12 September, with Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Nelson and Major General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, met briefly in a waiting room. Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans. Wellington later recalled, [...] "He (Nelson) entered at once into conversation with me, if I can call it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all about himself and, in reality, a style so vain and <b>so</b> <b>silly</b> as to surprise and almost disgust me." [...] However, {{after a few minutes}} Nelson left the room and having been told who his companion was, returned and entered into an earnest and intelligent discussion with the young Wellesley which lasted for a quarter of an hour, on the war, the state of the colonies and the geopolitical situation, that left a marked impression upon Wellesley. This was the only meeting between the two men.|$|E
2500|$|Le Tissier {{was forced}} to quickly kick the ball from play to prevent himself losing money on the bet and managed to [...] "push" [...] after {{managing}} to kick the ball out after 70 seconds.

2500|$|Stephens later said, [...] "With all {{due respect}} to the governor, he knew it was a comedy show. It's general {{knowledge}} for people under 90 years of age. It was when he came off looking <b>so</b> <b>silly</b> that he said {{he thought it was a}} regular news program. Even assuming he didn't know about it beforehand, we had to sign a release before the interview." ...|$|E

5000|$|Besser {{remained}} {{in show business}} and developed a unique comic character: a whiny, bratty, impish guy who was easily excitable and upset, throwing temper tantrums with little provocation. Besser, with his frequent outbursts of [...] "You crazy, youuuuu!" [...] and [...] "Not so faaaaaast!" [...] or [...] "Not so harrrrd!!" [...] was so original and <b>so</b> outrageously <b>silly</b> that he became a vaudeville headliner, and movie and radio appearances soon followed.|$|R
5000|$|Stuart Jeffries in The Guardian, meanwhile, found a {{comparison}} between {{the tone of the}} series and 1960s spy/detective capers; [...] "Never since The Avengers has there been anything <b>so</b> unremittingly <b>silly</b> on British television as Dirk Gently...Dainty harpsichord music tells us we're back in an era of TV misrule, in whose glory days John Steed, Mrs Peel and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) played fast and loose with viewers' intelligences." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Living in the USA, Ronstadt {{conducted}} album promotional tours and concerts. She made a guest appearance onstage with the Rolling Stones at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, {{in her hometown of}} Tucson, where she and Jagger sang [...] "Tumbling Dice". On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, [...] "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared.

2500|$|Lumet {{began his}} career as a {{director}} with Off-Broadway productions and then evolved into a highly respected TV director. After working off-Broadway and in summer-stock, he began directing television in 1950, after working as an assistant to friend and then-director Yul Brynner. He soon developed a [...] "lightning quick" [...] method for shooting due to the high turnover required by television. As a result, while working for CBS he directed hundreds of episodes of Danger (1950–55), Mama (1949–57), and You Are There (1953–57), a weekly series which co-starred Walter Cronkite in one of his earliest leading roles. He chose Cronkite for the role of anchorman [...] "because the premise of the show was <b>so</b> <b>silly,</b> was so outrageous, that we needed somebody with the most American, homespun, warm ease about him," [...] Lumet said.|$|E

60|$|One day a {{discussion}} rose about Italian society between Mr. Temple and his host. His lordship {{was a great}} admirer of the domestic character and private life of the Italians.
