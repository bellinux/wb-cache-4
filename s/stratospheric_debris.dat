40|$|On 15 February 2013 an 11 000 ton meteor entered Earth's {{atmosphere}} south east of Chelyabinsk {{creating a}} large fireball at 23 km altitude. The resulting stratospheric aerosol loading {{was detected by}} the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) in a high altitude polar belt. This work confirms the presence and lifetime of the <b>stratospheric</b> <b>debris</b> using the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS) onboard the Odin satellite. Although OSIRIS coverage begins in mid-March, the measurements show a belt of enhanced scattering near 35 km altitude between 50 ° N and 70 ° N. Initially, enhancements show increased scattering of up to 15 % over the background conditions, decaying in intensity and dropping in altitude until they are indistinguishable from background conditions by mid-May...|$|E
40|$|Aims. Thermal {{infrared}} imaging and spectroscopy of the July 19, 2009 Jupiter impact site {{has been used}} to identify unique features of the physical and chemical atmospheric response to this unexpected collision. Methods. Images and high-resolution spectra of methane, ethane and acetylene emission (7 - 13 μm) from the 2009 impact site were obtained by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) mid-infrared camera/spectrometer instrument, VISIR. An optimal estimation retrieval algorithm was used to determine the atmospheric temperatures and hydrocarbon distribution in the month following the impact. Results. Ethane spectra at 12. 25 μm could not be explained by a rise in temperature alone. Ethane was enhanced by 1. 7 - 3. 2 times the background abundance on July 26, implying production as the result of shock chemistry in a high C/O ratio environment, favouring an asteroidal origin for the 2009 impactor. Small enhancements in acetylene emission were also observed over the impact site. However, no excess methane emission was found over the impact longitude, either with broadband 7. 9 -μm imaging 21 h after the impact, or with center-to-limb scans of strong and weak methane lines between 7. 9 and 8. 1 μm in the ensuing days, indicating either extremely rapid cooling in the initial stages, or an absence of heating in the upper stratosphere (p 10 mbar), though this solution is highly dependent on the spectral properties of <b>stratospheric</b> <b>debris.</b> The enhanced ethane emission was localised over the impact streak, and was diluted in the ensuing weeks by redistribution of heated gases by zonal flow and mixing with the unperturbed jovian air. Conclusions. The different thermal energy deposition profiles, in addition to the highly reducing (C/O > 1) environment and shallow impactor angle, suggest that (a) the 2009 plume and shock-fronts did not reach the sub-microbar altitudes of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 plumes; and (b) models of a cometary impact are not directly applicable to the unique impact circumstances of July 2009. © 2010 ESO...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the HASP program to {{determine}} {{the role played by}} the stratosphere in the world-wide distribution of radioactive fall-out from nuclear weapons tests are presented. The program has operated since the fall of 1957. The sampling network using U- 2 aircraft collected 10 /sup 8 / scf of air from 57 S to 71 N up to 70, 000 ft. Ashcan data are used for upward extrapolation. IPC Paper 1478 of near 100 % efficiency is used. Stratospheric ruatter sampled is in the 0. 01 - mu range. Stratospheric inventories of Sr/sup 90 / were calculated for the periods Nov. 1957 to Dec. 1958, Jan. to Aug 1959, and Sept. to Nov. 1959 to be, respectively, 0. 95, 0. 81, and 0. 7 megacuries. Concentrations were greater in the Northern Hemisphere by a factor of 2 to 3 than in the Southern Hemisphere. The Sr/sup 90 / maximum cccurs in the equatorial regions around 90, 000 ft and slopes down to around 70, 000 ft in the polar regions. Little fractionation is noted in <b>stratospheric</b> <b>debris.</b> Cesium- 137 to strontium 90 ratios are 1. 8 to 0. 5. A semiempirical application of Gaussisn diffusion is described which suggests that hot clouds injected in the equatorial stratosphere spread in the North-South direction with mixing coefficients near 5 x 10 /sup 8 / cm/sup 2 // sec. Vertical mixing is slower with coefficients of 4 x 10 /sup 3 / and 2 x 10 /sup 4 / cm/sup 2 //sec suggested for tropical and polar regions, respectively. An Injection-Depletion model is offered which indicates that as much as 50 % of the material Produced in 1 -Mt ground-surface burst comes down in local fall-out. Removal from the stratosphere occurs at different rates, depending on altitude and latitude of injection and season of the year. Effective half-residence times of 5, 10, snd 20 months, respectively, for polar, lowequatorial and high- equatorial debris are suggested. Surface concentrations of Sr/sup 90 / are displayed as a function of latitude and time. The Northeru Hemisphere carries threefourths of the bunden. The maximum burden of Sr/sup 90 / is predicted to occur in 1961; however, concentrations in food have probably reached their maximum value. The radiation hazard from fall-out is summarized. Fall-out has increased the dose msn receives from the natural-radiation background by abcut 2 %. (auth...|$|E
40|$|An outline is {{presented}} {{of the present}} status of knowledge of <b>stratospheric</b> aerosols, meteoric <b>debris,</b> nacreous clouds, and noctilucent clouds.

40|$|In {{presenting}} {{an overview}} of the cirrus clouds comprehensively studied by ground based and airborne sensors from Coffeyville, Kansas, during the 5 - 6 December 1992 First ISCCP Regional Experiment (FIRE) intensive field observation (IFO) case study period, evidence is provided that volcanic aerosols from the June 1991 Pinatubo eruptions may have significantly influenced the formation and maintenance of the cirrus. Following the local appearance of a spur of <b>stratospheric</b> volcanic <b>debris</b> from the subtropics, a series of jet streaks subsequently conditioned the troposphere through tropopause foldings with sulfur based particles that became effective cloud forming nuclei in cirrus clouds. Aerosol and ozone measurements suggest a complicated history of stratospheric-tropospheric exchanges embedded with the upper level flow, and cirrus cloud formation was noted to occur locally at the boundaries of stratospheric aerosol enriched layers that became humidified through diffusion, precipitation, or advective processes. Apparent cirrus cloud alterations include abnormally high ice crystal concentrations (up to approximately 600 L(exp. 1)), complex radial ice crystal types, and relatively large haze particles in cirrus uncinus cell heads at temperatures between - 40 and - 50 degrees C. Implications for volcanic-cirrus cloud climate effects and unusual (nonvolcanic) aerosol jet stream cirrus cloud formation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn December 2000, the Cassini fly-by near Jupiter {{delivered}} high-resolution {{images of}} Jupiter’s clouds {{over the entire}} planet in a band between 50 °N and 50 °S. Three daily-averaged two-dimensional velocity snapshots extracted from these images are used to perform spectral analysis of jovian atmospheric macroturbulence. A similar analysis is also performed on alternative data documented by Choi and Showman (Choi, D., Showman, A. [2011]. Icarus 216, 597 – 609), based on a different method of image processing. The inter-comparison of the products of both analyses ensures a better constraint of the spectral estimates. Both analyses reveal strong anisotropy of the kinetic energy spectrum. The zonal spectrum is very steep {{and most of the}} kinetic energy resides in slowly evolving, alternating zonal (west–east) jets, while the non-zonal, or residual spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov–Kraichnan law specific to two-dimensional turbulence in the range of the inverse energy cascade. The spectral data is used to estimate the inverse cascade rate ∊ and the zonostrophy index Rβ for the first time. Although both datasets yield somewhat different values of ∊, it is estimated to be in the range 0. 5 – 1. 0 × 10 − 5 m 2 s− 3. The ensuing values of Rβ≳ 5 belong well in the range of zonostrophic turbulence whose threshold corresponds to Rβ≃ 2. 5. We infer that the large-scale circulation is maintained by an anisotropic inverse energy cascade. The removal of the Great Red Spot from both datasets has no significant effect upon either the spectra or the inverse cascade rate. The spectral data are used to compute the rate of the energy exchange, W, between the non-zonal structures and the large-scale zonal flow. It is found that instantaneous values of W may exceed ∊ by an order of magnitude. Previous numerical simulations with a barotropic model suggest that W and ∊ attain comparable values only after averaging of W over a sufficiently long time. Near-instantaneous values of W that have been routinely used to infer the rate of the kinetic energy supply to Jupiter’s zonal flow may therefore significantly overestimate ∊. This disparity between W and ∊ may resolve the long-standing conundrum of an unrealistically high rate of energy transfer to the zonal flow. The meridional diffusivity Kϕ in the regime of zonostrophic turbulence is given by an expression that depends on ∊. The value of Kϕ estimated from the spectra is compared against data from the dispersion of <b>stratospheric</b> gases and <b>debris</b> resulting from the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet and Wesley asteroid impacts in 1994 and 2009 respectively. Not only is Kϕ found to be consistent with estimates for both impacts, but the eddy diffusivity found from observations appears to be scale-independent. This behaviour could be a consequence of the interaction between anisotropic turbulence and Rossby waves specific to the regime of zonostrophic macroturbulence...|$|R
