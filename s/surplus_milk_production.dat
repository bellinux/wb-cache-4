The initiatives that followed included the launch in 1982 of Lymeswold cheese. The name was derived from public competition to name the new cheese. It was at first produced at Cannington creamery in Somerset. The cheese's creation was hailed by Peter Walker, then Agriculture Minister, who said it would improve the balance of payments by replacing imports and becoming [...] "one of our most successful cheese exports".|$|E
5000|$|A {{basing point}} is a {{geographical}} site used to establish minimum fluid milk prices for federal milk marketing orders. Generally, minimum fluid farm milk prices increase according to {{the distance from the}} basing point. When federal milk marketing orders began in the 1930s, Eau Claire, Wisconsin was viewed as the principal <b>surplus</b> <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> region in the nation and hence served as the basing point for most milk priced under federal milk marketing orders. Generally, the further a region is from the Upper Midwest, the higher that region’s minimum price for fluid farm milk. Some have argued that there currently are other surplus production regions in the country (e.g., in the northeast and southwest) which should serve as basing points. An attempt by USDA to establish a pricing structure using multiple basing points was thwarted by legislation in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} years of the century, milk was {{beginning}} to overtake cheese as the main dairy product, mainly to supply the large urban centres close to the county's borders. Milk production required more intensive farming practices; the introduction of tuberculin-tested milk in 1923 and the drive towards increased hygiene also led to changes, including the replacement of traditional shorthorn cattle with Ayrshires and later Friesians, and the gradual adoption of milking machines. <b>Surplus</b> <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> was a problem until the 1930s; it was a major concern of the local branch of the National Farmers Union, founded early in the century, until the creation of the Milk Marketing Board in 1933, which guaranteed a fair minimum price. Farm-based cheese production began to decline early in the century; in 1914 around 2,000 Cheshire farms still sold cheese, but this had fallen to 405 in 1939. In the mid-1920s, Cheshire cheese accounted for 30% of the non-imported domestic cheese market, second only to Cheddar, but competed poorly with imported cheese. In an attempt to improve its competitiveness with factory-made foreign cheeses, which were more uniform in quality, a grading scheme was introduced for Cheshire cheese towards the end of the 1920s; this voluntary scheme was superseded from the 1930s by various compulsory national grading schemes. During the Second World War all cheese production was transferred to factories termed [...] "creameries" [...] and rationing meant that Cheshire cheese had to be reformulated to reduce its tendency to crumble when cut. The county's cheese-producing farms never recovered; they numbered 44 in 1948 and as few as 12 by 1974. [...] Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in 1923-24, 1952, 1960-61, 1967-68 and 2001 caused substantial losses to dairy farmers in the county.|$|E

40|$|The study {{conducted}} during 1994 - 95 in Jalgaon and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra showed two differing scenarios {{insofar as the}} impact of <b>milk</b> cooperatives on <b>production</b> and marketed surplus is concerned. While milk cooperatives had positive and significant impact on both production and marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk</b> in Kolhapur district, such impact could not be ascertained in Jalgaon district. The study also showed lower production and marketed surplus during summer season followed by rainy and winter seasons. However, the percentage marketed surplus was the highest in summer season followed by winter and rainy seasons. The higher percentage of marketed surplus in summer season was due to lower <b>milk</b> <b>production,</b> higher demand and higher prices offered by various agencies compared to other seasons. On an average, nearly three-fourths of milk produced was sold in extension and two-thirds in control area of both the selected districts. However, this proportion differed in different seasons and herd size categories. An analysis drawn from Marketed Surplus Function (MSF) also showed that total <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> in the household was the single most significant factor contributing to marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk.</b> The next important variable positively affecting the marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk</b> was the education level {{of the head of}} the household, particularly in control area of both the districts. Further, the negative impact of family size on the marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk</b> could be ascertained only in Kolhapur district. In general, price of milk had very little influence on the marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk.</b> Relatively small variation in price of milk within a season {{could be one of the}} reasons for lack of impact of price on marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk.</b> Since in the short run there was no possibility of increasing <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> despite variation in prices, the MSF did not show significant influence of prices on marketed <b>surplus</b> of <b>milk.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Camels {{are known}} for their ability to produce milk, in {{comparison}} to other species of Camelidae. <b>Milk</b> <b>production</b> from camels is mainly practiced in pastoral migratory systems but the intensive camel dairy farming is increasing in many countries. Dairy camels can be classified into three groups, high, medium, and low, based on their <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> Only the high and medium milk-producing camels can be considered as true dairy camel types. Lactation length varies from 6 to 18 months. Infection by bacterial or mycotic pathogens is the main cause of mastitis.

The peak of lactation in camels tends to decline more steeply than in dairy cows; nevertheless, camels are much better providers of high-quality protein than cows, sheep, and goats to the people living in the arid and semiarid areas. The gross composition of camel milk {{is similar to that of}} cattle and goat milk but high differences were described in the fine composition (fatty acids, vitamins, type of proteins).

40|$|<b>Milk</b> <b>production</b> is a socio-economically {{relevant}} {{activity for}} many small-scale family farms in southern Brazil. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyse their production and marketing strategies. A questionnaire was administered to 199 farm households in Rio Grande do Sul State to collect information on farm assets and activities, and particularly on the contribution of milk sale to farm income. Through categorical principal component analysis and two-step clustering, farmers were classified into three types: farmers selling only milk (M); farmers selling cash crops and milk (CM); farmers selling cash crops and <b>surplus</b> <b>milk</b> (Cm). Cattle herd (heads) and size of pasture land were larger on M farms (114 [*]± 71. 9; 51 [*]± 49. 4 [*]ha) than on CM (31 [*]± 13. 4; 9 [*]± 8. 9 [*]ha) and Cm (12 [*]± 7. 5; 5 [*]± 8. 1 [*]ha) farms. Livestock husbandry contributed 71, 59 and 16 [*]% to family income on M, CM and Cm farms, respectively. Daily <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> of the individual cow depended on the area cultivated with fodder maize (ha per cow; p[*]≤[*] 0. 001), on sale of milk to cooperatives or to private companies (p[*]≤[*] 0. 01), on summer pasture area (ha per cow; p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and on daily amount of concentrates offered (kg per cow; p[*]≤[*] 0. 01). These results indicate that the area available for fodder cultivation is a key factor for <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> on small-scale dairy farms in southern Brazil, while concentrate feeding plays a less important role even for highly market-oriented farms. This must be accounted for when exploring options for strengthening the regional small-scale <b>milk</b> <b>production,</b> in which dairy cooperatives do play an important role...|$|R

Lessons were deducted from the Zimbabwe Smallholder Dairy Development Program (DDP). Secondary data was collected at Nyarungu DDP head Quarters and the NPC, DVS, DEES in Namibia. A structured questionnaire was also used to collect data to assess the potential for <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> in Otjinene. Descriptive statistics were computed using SPSS (version 16. 0). Economic viability of small-scale processing centre in Zimbabwe and Otjinene was done using the GMA and NPV tools. The potential for <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> in Otjinene was 12 716 l/day which was obtained from 748 households, each producing an average of 17 litres per day. It was concluded that Otjinene has potential to produce <b>surplus</b> <b>milk</b> that would sustain a processing centre. DDP processing centres had negative GM, indicating unvaiblity coupled to a horde of challenges. GM and NPV for Otjinene Projected centre were positive indicating viability and profitability. In conclusion, the smallholder dairy processing centres that are marginally viable or unviable in Zimbabwe are feasible and profitable options in Otjinene. The success of the Otjinene centre was attributed to the number of cattle for <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> and the processing of different high value products that increases the revenue bases.

(WDL). At WDL, members sell <b>surplus</b> <b>milk</b> to the dairy and, through nongovernmental organization (NGO) partnerships, receive training to enhance dairy farm productivity. As a result, higher <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> has been reported; however, data are lacking on sustainability and livelihood outcomes of dairy training for women farmers. To inform future projects and interventions, our study objectives were to determine the relationships between dairy group membership and duration of membership, sustainable livelihood assets, household income, and food security. We thus conducted a cross-sectional survey of 88 WDL members (among four membership duration groups) and 23 nonmember farmers. <b>Milk</b> <b>production</b> and herd size were higher for greater-than-three-year members compared to nonmembers and one-to-three-year members. The proportion of households with an income from dairy of greater than 5, 000 ksh/month (ranging from 0 to 40 percent), food security (ranging from 4 to 30 percent), and number of improved household characteristics (ranging from 1. 7 to 3. 3), were positively associated with longer membership duration. While the cross-sectional design does not allow attribution of causality, results suggested that WDL membership strengthened the livelihood assets of women farmers, particularly after three years, and that positive outcomes were sustained with longer membership duration. Anecdotally, women indicated that WDL's role in women's control of dairy income, regular payments, and food and services on credit, were important.

5000|$|A key goal of {{the capital}} {{structure}} changes was to stop {{large amounts of money}} washing in and out of Fonterra’s balance sheet each year as <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> fluctuates. Under the previous structure, farmers matched their shareholding with their <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> by owning one co-operative share for each kilogram of milksolids (kgMS) produced annually. [...] If their <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> dropped in any season, they could redeem shares back to the co-operative, which was required to buy the shares back off them. Consequently, Fonterra faced the risk of losing large amounts of share capital through redemptions during times of declining <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> [...] For instance, after <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> fell during the 2007/08 drought, Fonterra had to pay out $742 million of share capital to farmers via redemptions.|$|R

Lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> traits are pronouncedly variable. The life expectancy {{and the length of}} productive life of dairy cows are repeatedly limiting factors for improving lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> Lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> is greatly depended on age at first calving and the number of lactations during productive life. Previous researches have implied there are real chances for improving the lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> of high-yielding cows. The goal of this research was to investigate the significance of key systematic factors on the lifetime production of high-yielding Black-and-White cows. The animals included in the sample had different share of Holstein genes. The researchers determined systematic factors that caused some significant phenotypic variations of the investigated trait. The average lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> was 25, 002. 66 ± 7, 755. 39 kg. When observed by cow genotypes, the mean values of the lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> varied from 27, 061. 37 kg ( 73 % HF). The differences in lifetime <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> determined among the animals were due to a highly significant (p≤ 0. 01) impact of the bulls – the sires of the cows and the year of culling; the impact of the class of HF genes was significant (p≤ 0. 05), whereas the impact of the reason for culling was non-significant (p> 0. 05) ...|$|R

To increase of <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> nationally with used in dairy cattle business can assist to increase <b>milk</b> <b>production,</b> eighteen post lactating dairy cows in the highland Cipelang Bogor, {{were used to}} study the effect used of bovine somatotropin and lactating time. The experimental cows were assigned into a Randomized Block Design with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement. The first factor was using of somatotropin (bST) with three levels (non bST injection, biweekly injection and three weekly injection). The second factor was lactating time with two levels (4 th lactating time and 6 th lactating time) Parameters measured were heart rate, respiration frequency, rectal temperature, <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> efficiency, <b>milk</b> <b>production,</b> 4 % FCM (fat corrected milk.), Milk composition, weigh gain, milk quality consist of protein, fat, pH. Bovine somatotropin significantly increased heart rate and respiration rate. Also bovine somatotropin injection at 4 th lactating time significantly increased <b>milk</b> <b>production.</b> There were an interaction between bST dan lactating time on <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> and weight gain. Bovine somatotropin injection biweekly in cows on 4 th lactating time ration increased <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> by 16 - 26 %, but injection in cows 6 th lactating time increased <b>milk</b> <b>production</b> by 8 - 18 % combination with somatotropin doze 250 /ml/ 14 days. Somatothropine supplementation was injection biweekly and three weekly did significantly affect to <b>milk</b> <b>production,</b> body temperature, heart rate, and respiration rate however in normal physiology.

The results show the high selection of cows out of the herd. It result shows {{from a number of}} included heifers. Most frequent reasons of selection are health condition, low milk efficiency and fertility disorders. Average efficiency in control increases. On the other hand the protein contest in milk is weak. A breading aim 3, 3 % was achieved only in year 2003 (3, 32 %). <b>Milk</b> <b>production</b> increases from the first to the third lactation. <b>Milk</b> <b>production</b> is decreasing from the fourth lactation.
