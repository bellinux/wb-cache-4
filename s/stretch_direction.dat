Strain is the displacement (also a vector quantity) per unit length and is also a vector quantity. A vector quantity requires three numbers to define its direction. It can be represented then by a number with one subscript, Ui, where i takes the numbers 1 to 3. Such a quantity {{can be referred to}} as a tensor of rank 1. The rank refers to the number of subscripts. The strains e can be formally written as a differential or gradient. So that, if u1 was the extension in the x direction, we would write the strain as δu1/δx.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{orientation}} and relaxation behavior of segmented poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) zwitterionomers was studied under conditions where no strain-induced crystallization occurs, using polarization modulation infrared linear dichroism. Samples {{of three different}} PTMO segment lengths, designated Z 67, Z 52, and Z 20 for PTMO blocks with molar masses of 6700, 5200, and 2000 g/mol, respectively, were used. During deformation to a draw ratio of 3. 2, the PTMO chains progressively orient along the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction,</b> the maximum induced orientation decreasing with increase in temperature. In contrast, the orientation function of the sulfonate units increases only {{at the beginning of}} the deformation process, reaching a maximum of about 0. 015 at a draw ratio of about 1. 5, and then decreases to become negative before the end of the stretch period. During the subsequent relaxation period, the PTMO orientation decreases as a function of time and the negative orientation function of the ionic groups further decreases slightly with time. By analogy with segmented copolymers characterized by a crystalline hard phase and an elastomeric soft phase, the following model is proposed. Before deformation, the ionic aggregates, which have previously been shown to have lamellar (Z 20) or hexagonal (Z 52, Z 67) morphology, are like rigid anisotropic entities randomly oriented throughout the sample. Upon deformation to low draw ratios, the flexible PTMO chains orient along the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction</b> and the ionic rigid entities orient perpendicular to the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction,</b> the latter entailing orientation of the ionic side chains parallel to the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction.</b> At higher draw ratios, the applied stress causes progressive disruption of the ionic aggregates, resulting in a reorientation of the “freed ” ionic side chains perpendicular to the deformation direction...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{studies by}} {{synchrotron}} x-ray diffraction on two main-chain smectic-C elastomers reveal {{the presence of}} two different relaxation mechanisms in these systems at low and high strains. At low strains, the smectic layers are reoriented with layer-normals distributed in a plane perpendicular to the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction.</b> The system relaxes relatively slowly (time-constant ~ 45 minutes) which is attributed to the flow properties of the LC layers embedded in the elastomer network. At high strains, the equilibration time (~ 4 - 8 minutes) conforms to a faster relaxation and appears to have its origin in the polymer components of the system. Due to misaligned microdomains at small strains, the value of global orientational order parameter S for the mesogenic parts is initially small (~ 0. 15). With increasing strain, the local domain-directors, the mesogens, and the polymer chains, all tend to align parallel to the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction</b> giving rise to a higher measured value of S ~ 0. 83 at a strain of 4. 0. The siloxane segments remain less ordered, attaining a value of S ~ 0. 4 for a strain of 4. 0. The layers gradually become oblique to the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction</b> conforming to the structural property of the smectic-C phase. The system finally assumes a chevron-like optically monodomain structure. Both elastomers are locked-in this state even after removal of the external stress giving rise to strain retention and the shape memory effect. The presence of a transverse component in the main-chain leads to higher strain retention in the second elastomer. A preference for {{the orientation of the}} smectic layer-normals toward the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction</b> persists after removal of external stress. Upon thermal annealing, the chevron-like microstructure gradually melts via a different path to the initial polydomain structure. Comment: 23 pages, 16 figure...|$|E

The results obtained show that when the amorphous zwitterionomer is stretched at ambient temperature, the PTMO chains orient in the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction.</b> At a draw ratio of approximately 3, strain-induced crystallization occurs and increases with strain amplitude. The chain axis of the crystallized PTMO segments are almost perfectly oriented in the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction,</b> whereas {{the orientation of the}} amorphous segments is low and undergoes no further changes during crystallization. The degree of crystallization was also determined from the spectra (22 % for a draw ratio of 5. 6).

Orientation relaxation following deformation was also studied as a function of temperature at draw ratios and temperatures where strain-induced crystallization is avoided.

40|$|Investigation of {{material}} flow within transpressional orogens must involve integration of structural and metamorphic datasets. To illustrate {{the problems in}} documenting flow vectors we present integrated structural-metamorphic datasets from two transpressional systems; the Kaoko Belt in Namibia and the Kalinjala Shear Zone in South Australia. These orogens experienced widely differing metamorphic responses to transpressional deformation. Integration of kinematic and metamorphic datasets from the Kaoko Belt indicate shallow up-plunging extrusion trajectories in the orogen core, and show that the maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> pattern matches the inferred flow vectors. High-grade domains (800 – 840 °C and 7. 0 – 8. 0 kb) in the orogen core developed low-angle upward-verging maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> trajectories, whereas a low-grade domain (575 – 600 °C and 5. 0 – 5. 5 kb) in the orogen core has downward-verging lineation trajectories. The barometric differential between these high-grade and low-grade domains is entirely consistent with the angle of plunge of maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>directions</b> within the high-grade domains that were extruded obliquely, {{for the amount of}} lateral shear estimated for the orogen core. The Kalinjala Shear Zone in South Australia contrasts strongly with the Kaoko Belt. In this example, the high-grade and high-strain shear zone core of the orogen, experienced high-T/high-P metamorphism with low thermal gradients of 21 – 26 °C/km and steep decompressive P–T paths. The lower-grade external domains experienced lower-T/lower-P metamorphism with high thermal gradients of 35 – 37 °C/km. Sub-horizontal maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>directions</b> do not match the vertical extrusional flow in the high-grade core that is indicated by the metamorphic data. This comparison shows that in general and on a gross scale, maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>directions</b> do not necessarily correlate with the real flow vectors experienced during orogenesis. In some cases maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> recorded by deformation structures is to some degree decoupled from the vertical component {{of material}} flow. Consequently, information pertaining to flow is often partitioned into information derived from deformation structures and information derived from the metamorphic record. These two datasets must be used in concert to obtain realistic constraints on first-order material flow trajectories at orogenic scales. The horizontal component of flow is typically best recorded by structural fabrics (maximum <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> and sense of shear), whereas the vertical component is typically best recorded by metamorphic information, such as P–T paths, temperature over depth ratio (G) and metamorphic field gradients (i. e.

The effect of BPEF addition on the orientation birefringence of CAP films was analyzed and compared to the blend added with tricresyl phosphate (TCP), an LMC known to increase the orientation birefringence of cellulose esters. Contrary to TCP, BPEF addition is found to decrease the positive birefringence of CAP. Moreover, {{it is observed that}} stress-optical law is not applicable for the CAP/LMC blend. The different effect on the orientation birefringence shown by BPEF and TCP is due to the different polarizability anisotropy. The decrease in orientation birefringence indicates that the polarizability ellipsoid of BPEF molecules is aligned in a direction perpendicular to the <b>stretching</b> <b>direction,</b> as opposed to that of TCP molecules which is parallel to the <b>stretching</b> <b>direction.</b> This alignment is thought to be resulted from the so called nematic interaction, in which LMC molecules are forced to orient to the <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> by the alignment of polymer chains. Furthermore, it is found that the magnitude of orientation birefringence of BPEF is larger than that of TCP at the same stress value, i. e., the same degree of orientation of CAP molecules, despite having a smaller intrinsic birefringence.

Subjected to uni-axial stretching, dispersion of GPLs is described by an orientation distribution function (ODF) in terms of a stretching strain and two Euler angles.

These semiconducting materials can have high H/C ratio, wide bandgap, high resistivity and high dielectric strength, allowing high field operation with low leakage current and capacitance noise.

However, improvements in charge collection efficiency are {{necessary in order to}} achieve single particle detection with a reasonable sensitivity.

Proton beam exposure was used to verify particle sensitivity and radiation hardness to a total exposure of approximately 1 MRAD. Conductivity exhibited sensitivity to temperature and humidity. The effects of molecular ordering were investigated in stretched films, and FTIR was used to quantify the order in films using the Hermans orientation function. The photoconductive response approximately doubled for stretch-aligned films with the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction</b> parallel to the electric field direction, when compared to as-cast films. The response was decreased when the <b>stretch</b> <b>direction</b> was orthogonal to the electric field. Stretch-aligned films also exhibited a significant sensitivity to the polarization of the laser excitation, whereas drop-cast films showed none, indicating improved mobility along the backbone, but poor {pi}-overlap in the orthogonal direction.

Interestingly, stretch-aligned composite films showed a substantial decrease in photoresponse with increasing stretch ratio. Other additives examined, including small molecules and cosolvents, did not cause any significant increase in photoresponse. Finally, we discovered an inverse-geometric particle track effect wherein increased track lengths created by tilting the detector off normal incidence resulted in decreased signal collection. This is interpreted as a trap-filling effect, leading to increased carrier mobility along the particle track direction.

In particular, anisotropic particles approach almost perfect alignment with the strongest <b>stretching</b> <b>direction.</b> The alignment of vorticity with stretching is weaker, but still much stronger than previously observed alignment of vorticity with the eigenvectors of the Eulerian strain rate tensor. The alignment of strong vorticity is almost {{the same as that of}} rods that have experienced the same stretching. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Polybutene- 1 (PB- 1), {{a typical}} {{semicrystalline}} polymer, in its stable form I shows a peculiar temperature dependent strain-whitening behavior when being stretched at different temperatures where {{the extent of}} strain-whitening weakens with the increasing of stretching temperature reaching a minima value followed by an increase at higher stretching temperatures. Correspondingly, a stronger strain-hardening phenomenon was observed at higher stretching temperatures. The strain-whitening phenomenon in semicrystalline polymers has its origin of cavitation process during stretching. In this work, the effect of crystalline lamellar thickness and stretching temperature on the cavitation process in PB- 1 has been investigated by means of combined synchrotron ultrasmall-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering techniques. It was found that, {{with respect to the}} cavitation process, three modes of cavitation during the stretching process can be identified, namely no cavitation for sample with the thinnest lamellae where only shear yielding occurred, cavitation with reorientation for the samples stretched at lower temperatures and samples with thicker lamellae, and cavitation without reorientation for samples with thinner lamellae stretched at higher temperatures. The mode cavitation with reorientation occurs before yield point where the plate-like cavities start to be generated within the lamellar stacks with normal perpendicular to the <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> due to the blocky substructure of the crystalline lamellae and reorient gradually to the <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> after strain-hardening. The mode of cavitation without reorientation appears after yield point where ellipsoidal shaped cavities are generated in those lamellae stacks with normal parallel to the <b>stretching</b> <b>direction</b> followed by an improvement of their orientation at larger strains.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{structural}} and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) {{results from the}} Upper Miocene sediments of the Amantea basin, located on the Tyrrhenian coast of the Calabrian Arc (Southern Italy). The stratigraphic succession of the basin is organized in three depositional sequences, separated by two major angular unconformities. Detailed geologica 1 mapping and structural analysis demonstrate that the stratigraphic evolution of the Amantea basin is strongly controlled by a synsedimentary extensional tectonic regime. Severa 1 NNE-SSW-trending norma 1 fault arrays with large scatter in inclination values have been interpreted as due to a domino faulting mechanism, consistent with a WNW-ESE <b>stretching</b> <b>direction.</b> AMS data have been obtained for 13 sites, both in the not constrained in age first depositional sequence (3 sites), and in the upper Tortonian-lower Messinian clays from the second depositional sequence (10 sites). Al 1 the sites show a strong magnetic foliation parallel to the bedding planes, and a well defined magnetic lineation subparallel to the local bedding dip directions. The magnetic lineations cluster around a WNW-ESE trend and are parallel to the <b>stretching</b> <b>directions</b> inferred by fault-slip analysis and basin architecture. These new data then confirm the possibility to use the magnetic lineation to map the strain trajectory in weakly deformed extensional sedimentary basins. Paleomagnetic data (from previous studies) show that the whole Calabrian block underwent a 15 °- 20 ° clockwise rotation probably in the Pleistocene, postdating the extensional tectonic events which controlled the Amantea basin geometry. Therefore we suggest for the Amantea basin an original E-W-oriented <b>stretching</b> <b>direction,</b> which may be considered as the older extensional direction characterizing the Late Miocene evolution of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea domain...|$|R
