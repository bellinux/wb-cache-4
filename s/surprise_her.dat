5|$|Seventeen-year-old Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a sunny {{high school}} senior who loves cheerleading and is dating a {{football}} player, Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, {{her family and friends}} suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of ex-gay Mike (RuPaul), they <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp which uses a five-step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine <b>surprise,</b> <b>her</b> father refused {{to have anything to}} do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E
25|$|Dean, who {{is retired}} from running an asphalt road-paving {{business}} in Nashville, has always shunned publicity and rarely accompanies {{his wife to}} any events. According to Parton, he has seen her perform only once. However, she also has commented in interviews that, although it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> and sometimes even writes poems for her.|$|E

500|$|The trio {{travelled}} for six weeks, from 28 July to 13 September 1814, through France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands (which {{is referred}} to as [...] "Holland"); however, they were forced to return to England due to financial considerations. The situation upon their return was fraught with complications: Mary had become pregnant with a child who would soon die, she and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine <b>surprise,</b> <b>her</b> father refused {{to have anything to do}} with her.|$|E
500|$|In a B story, Ann's {{normally}} lazy boyfriend Andy (Chris Pratt) {{decides to}} <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> by cleaning up their messy house {{while she is}} gone. [...] He cleans up the house (although he throws their garbage into the pit). [...] After cleaning it, he bathes himself in a children's pool in the backyard and plays music on his boombox. [...] Angry neighbor Lawrence steals his boombox, prompting Andy (who has two broken legs) to chase the neighbor naked through the streets on his crutches.

500|$|A chance lunchtime {{meeting with}} a wartime {{colleague}} in 1958 led Arnold {{to apply for a}} position at the Ministry of Health. The Director of Establishments there asked if he might forward her details to his counterpart at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), which he knew was expanding due to the 1957 Windscale fire, there being multiple inquiries into the disaster. To her <b>surprise,</b> <b>her</b> secretariat skills in writing and coordinating reports and studies were exactly what the UKAEA was looking for, and she was hired. After a security background check, she commenced work on 2 January 1959, with the Authority Health and Safety Branch (AHSB). She worked on the Veale Committee on Training in Radiation Safety, and, after it wound up, as personal assistant to the director, Andrew MacLean.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, a French poet at Mary's court, Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, was {{apparently}} besotted by Mary. In early 1563, he was discovered during a security search hidden underneath her bed, apparently planning to <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> {{when she was}} alone and declare his love for her. Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland. He ignored the edict, and two days later he forced his way into her chamber {{as she was about}} to disrobe. She reacted with fury and fear, and when Moray rushed into the room, in reaction to her cries for help, she shouted, [...] "Thrust your dagger into the villain!", which Moray refused to do, as Chastelard was already under restraint. Chastelard was tried for treason, and beheaded. Maitland claimed that Chastelard's ardour was feigned, and that he was part of a Huguenot plot to discredit Mary by tarnishing her reputation.|$|E
500|$|... "Wishin' and Hopin'" [...] {{opens to}} a {{voice-over}} narration from Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) about extraordinary events.

Four of the hospital's attending surgeons, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) are all seen {{competing for the}} position of chief of surgery, after the current chief Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) announces his plans for retirement. Meredith arrives to the Alzheimer's support home that her ill mother Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton) is living at, and to her <b>surprise,</b> <b>her</b> mother has become lucid, but faints. Ellis is taken to Seattle Grace Hospital, her former source of employment.

Knight) walks in to announce his unexpected marriage with Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).|$|E
500|$|After {{they arrive}} in Arizona, Lucy finally meets her mother Caroline after {{eighteen}} years; however, Caroline {{is not happy}} to see Lucy. She reveals that she has remarried, and that she now has two sons ages seven and ten. She reveals to Lucy {{that she was an}} unintended pregnancy and that she wants nothing to do with her, and Lucy leaves the house heartbroken. Promptly arriving at the motel, Ben comforts her. The following day, Lucy rejoins the others and goes on to Los Angeles. When they arrive, Kit brings Mimi along to <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> fiance, Dylan. While alone in the hotel, Lucy gives her virginity to Ben and they fall in love with each other. When Kit and Mimi arrive to Dylan's place, it is revealed that he is cheating on Kit after they see another girl in his apartment. Already upset, Kit suddenly realizes that it was Dylan who raped Mimi and got her pregnant, and she punches him. Scared, Mimi runs away, and falls down the stairs. Consequently, she loses her baby. Because of this, Lucy decides to call her father to take her and the girls back home. However her father is still putting pressure on Lucy to do what he wants.

Now, none of us have any idea where life's gonna take us. 'Cause what we have is now, and right now... we have each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|The body, later named [...] "Caledonia Jane Doe" [...] or [...] "Cali Doe" [...] by investigators, {{was fully}} clothed and {{showed no signs}} of sexual assault. She had died from a severe {{hemorrhage}} caused by two gunshot wounds, one to the head over the right eye and one to the back. The wound to the head indicated she had apparently not turned or flinched, as is common when one is shot in the head. Instead, the entry wound suggested complete, if horrified, <b>surprise.</b> <b>Her</b> pockets had been turned inside out, suggesting that any identification she carried had been removed.|$|E
2500|$|Mame works {{a string}} of jobs. [...] One is in a {{department}} store, where she meets Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Robert Preston), to whom she attempts to sell a pair of roller skates. [...] She cannot write up a cash order and is fired. [...] Unable to remove the skates she has demonstrated, Mame roller skates home, dejected due to her inability to pay manservant Ito (George Chiang) or Agnes, who have loyally stayed with her. [...] Mame decides to lift everyone's spirits by decorating the house for Christmas and giving everyone their Christmas gifts early (We Need a Little Christmas), which include Patrick's first pair of long pants. Agnes and Ito <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> {{with the news that}} the butcher bill has been paid.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I have to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> too.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During 2006 {{and early}} 2007, Greig played Beatrice {{in a much}} {{acclaimed}} production of Much Ado About Nothing for which she won a Laurence Olivier Award, and Constance in King John, {{as part of the}} Royal Shakespeare Company's The Complete Works season. Whilst the win itself was a <b>surprise,</b> <b>her</b> acceptance speech was received very well as being highly entertaining, claiming that she was so excited that she had wet her dress. The speech was apparently completely improvised. Backstage, when told not to tell her mother about her wetting her dress, she told the host that her mum was dead before dedicating her award to her [...] "dead mum". She also won the Critics' Circle Theatre Award for [...] "Best Shakespearean Performance" [...] in Much Ado About Nothing, becoming the first woman to win the award, and was nominated for [...] "The FRANCO'S Best Actress in a Play" [...] in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers' Choice Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Fertility Hollis : A {{friend of}} Tender's. [...] She meets him at her dead brother Trevor's crypt. At first, Fertility {{says she is}} repulsed by him, but as the novel {{progresses}} the two grow close. [...] "Fertility" [...] is {{not her real name}} but a pseudonym she uses for her job, which is acting as a surrogate mother for couples who cannot conceive. Her job is fraudulent in that she is actually sterile and has never managed to carry a child for a client. Fertility has the psychic ability to predict the future; she knows when, where, how, and to whom everything is going to happen, which takes all the fun out of life for her. She strikes up a friendship with Tender and helps him throughout the novel because she believes he is the only person who can <b>surprise</b> <b>her.</b> It is Fertility who leads Tender to hijack the plane. She also tells him that there is a way for him to [...] "survive", but her meaning is ambiguous.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the rest}} of her game, Henin's serve was rather inconsistent. Her {{tendency}} to take risks on her second serve could sometimes result in a high number of double faults. When she first came onto the tour, Henin used a pinpoint stance (most common amongst the WTA) for serving, but later retooled her serve to use a platform stance, which is most common amongst male players. Nonetheless, despite her relatively small size, Henin was capable of producing powerful first serves, her fastest one being clocked at 196km/h (122mph) at the 2005 Family Circle Cup. Henin's single-handed backhand was the most powerful and accurate in the game. She could hit her backhand flat, with heavy topspin, or slice [...] Her backhand could also be used to <b>surprise</b> <b>her</b> opponents with drop shots, breaking up the pattern of a groundstroke rally. Her forehand was generally regarded as her most dangerous weapon, and the stroke that she normally used to dictate play in a match. It was underrated as most only spoke of her backhand, but particularly in her dominant years of 2003 and 2007, she would dominate the tone of matches with her huge and versatile forehand. Like her serve, her forehand was something retooled during her career and took inspiration from Andre Agassi's forehand.|$|E
