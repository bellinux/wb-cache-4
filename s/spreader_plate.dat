50|$|Spreader {{plates are}} thin steel plates with holes {{through which the}} arbor {{connecting}} rods pass. Spreader plates are lowered onto the counterweights in a distributed fashion as the counterweight stack is being built. Typically one <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> is placed on top of every two feet of counterweight in the stack. Finally, a locking plate is lowered onto the completed, interleaved stack of counterweights and spreader plates and secured in place with a thumbscrew.|$|E
50|$|The {{accidents}} {{occurred when}} the high-power electron beam was activated instead of the intended low power beam, and without the beam <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> rotated into place. Previous models had hardware interlocks in place to prevent this, but Therac-25 had removed them, depending instead on software interlocks for safety. The software interlock could fail due to a race condition. The defect was as follows: a one-byte counter in a testing routine frequently overflowed; if an operator provided manual input to the machine at the precise moment that this counter overflowed, the interlock would fail.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{as a form}} {{of energy}} that is {{transferred}} from one body to another results in a difference in temperature. This reduces surface tension and viscosity of the oil and thus assists in releasing gas that is hydraulically retained in the oil. The most effective method of heating crude oil is to pass it through a heated-water bath. A <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> that disperses the oil into small streams or rivulets increases the effectiveness of the heated-water bath. Upward flow of the oil through the water bath affords slight agitation, which is helpful in coalescing and separating entrained gas from the oil. A heated-water bath is probably the most effective method of removing foam bubbles from foaming crude oil. A heated-water bath is not practical in most oil and gas separators, but heat can be added to the oil by direct or indirect fired heaters and/or heat exchangers, or heated free-water knockouts or emulsion treaters can be used to obtain a heated-water bath.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} goes over a design {{methodology}} for thin, two-phase heat spreaders for space constrained cooling applications. The evaporator {{section of the}} heat spreader employs enhancement structures to improve the <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> performance. The thermal performances of two such spreader prototypes, with integrated fins for cooling, were studied under both natural convection as well as forced air-cooled conditions. The results show a significant improvement in performance of the <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> compared to a solid metal plate subjected to similar boundary conditions. A design constraint on the evaporator and the condenser sections of the heat spreader ensures the enhanced structure remains flooded under all orientations, resulting in an orientation insensitive heat spreader. A predictive thermal performance model of the <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> was developed based on a semi-analytical model for boiling from structured surfaces. The semi-analytical model was validated against measured quantities from flow visualization studies {{reported in the literature}} and was found to predict the bubble departure diameter within ± 20 %, bubble frequency within ± 35 % and heat fluxes within ± 30 %. 2 D numerical simulation, using level set formulation, was also carried out to understand the physics behind bubble departure from structured surfaces...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{advancement}} in technology of microprocessors has led electronics thermal system designers to pay increased {{attention to the}} folded fin heat sink. The advantages of using a folded fin heat sink are light weight, low profile, and small footprint. There are three manufacturing methods for bonding the folded fin {{to the base of}} heat sink: adhesive bonding, soldering, and brazing. Brazing is a high temperature process which takes place at around 550 °C. The major concern with using the brazing process to manufacture heat sinks is dimensional deformation. The adhesive process, on the other hand, requires only sub 200 °C or room temperature curing process. However, its thermal contact resistance at the joint is higher than others. Solder bonding is an alternative solution to the above problems. The soldering process requires much lower temperature, less than 200 °C, yet it gives excellent thermal contact and bond strength at the joint. This paper presents the theoretical study of thermal contact resistance at the joint between the folded fin base and the <b>spreader</b> <b>plate</b> of heat sink, and also presents the experimental results which support this theory...|$|E
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} high-performance thermal distribution panel (TDP) concept using high-conductivity (greater than 800 W/mK) macro composite skin with in situ heat pipes. The processing technologies proposed to build such a panel {{result in a}} one-piece, inseparable assembly with high conductance in both the X and Y planes. The TDP configuration {{can also be used}} to produce panels with high structural stiffness. The one-piece construction of the TDP eliminates the thermal interface between the cooling plenums and the heat spreader base, and obviates the need for bulky mounting flanges and thick heat spreaders used on baseline designs. The conductivity of the TDP can be configured to exceed 800 W/mK with a mass density below 2. 5 grams per cubic centimeter. This material can provide efficient conductive heat transfer between the in situ heat plenums, permitting the use of thinner panel thicknesses. The plenums may be used as heat pipes, loop heat pipes, or liquid cooling channels. The panel technology used in the TDP is a macro-composite comprised of aluminum-encapsulated annealed pyrolytic graphite (APG). APG is highly aligned crystalline graphite with an in-plane thermal conductivity of 1, 700 W/mK. APG has low shear strength and does not constrain the encapsulating material. The proposed concept has no thermal interfaces between the heat pipes and the <b>spreader</b> <b>plate,</b> further improving the overall conductance of the system. The in situ plenums can also be used for liquid cooling applications. The process can be used to fabricate structural panels by adding a second thin sheet...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the rare}} event that an {{unbalanced}} lineset gains so much momentum that the operator cannot stop it, a specified safety procedure is usually followed. Venues typically establish a standard call for this event, which might sound something like [...] "Runaway 47, upstage, heads." [...] Operators are trained not {{to attempt to}} stop a runaway lineset but rather to warn others and safely escape. The {{reason for this is}} that it is unlikely that they will be able to stop it, and very likely that they will burn their hands or be lifted by the lineset, potentially injuring themselves on structure above and/or from a subsequent fall. Furthermore, this might position the operator in the path of the batten, arbor, or sandbag as they accelerate downward. <b>Spreader</b> <b>plates</b> are used in counterweight arbors to keep the arbor's vertical rods from bending and releasing the counterweights in the event of a runaway, while the locking plate prevents the counterweights from bouncing out of the arbor.|$|R

European and Italian regulations consider nitrogen content in buffalo manure to be {{the same as that of}} cattle manure. This study aimed to assess whether this assumption is true. The first aim of the study was to assess nitrogen content in buffalo manure. Samples were taken from 35 farms to analyse nitrogen and phosphorous concentration in the manure.

40|$|Several {{protocols}} for bacterial {{isolation and}} techniques for aerobic plate counting {{rely on the}} use of a spiral plater to deposit concentration gradients of microbial suspensions onto a circular agar plate to isolate colony growth. The advantage of apply-ing a gradient of concentrations across the agar surface is that the original microbiological sample can be applied at a single concentration rather than as multiple serial dilutions. The spiral plater gradually dilutes the sample across a compact area and therefore saves time preparing dilutions and multiple agar plates. Commercial spiral platers are not automated and require manual sample loading. Dispensing of the sample volume and rate of gradients are often very limited in range. Furthermore, the spiral sample application cannot be used with rectangular microplates. Another limitation of commercial spiral platers is that they are useful only for dilute, filtered suspensions and cannot plate suspensions of coarse organic particles therefore precluding the use of many kinds of microorganism-containing substrata. An automated agar <b>plate</b> <b>spreader</b> capable of pro-cessing 99 rectangular microplates in unattended mode is described. This novel instrument is capable of dispensing discrete volumes of sample in a linear pattern.

Recent researches are devoted to the individuation of standard methods for reliable assessment, consequently many European countries are now building national emissions inventory. The main issue {{is a lack of}} data about ammonia losses from buffalo manure, under Mediterranean climate. Buffalo is reared mostly in South Italy, and even if well studied, there are not researches about ammonia emissions. Besides measurement method itself, meteorological conditions influence emissions too. In this paper, ammonia emissions assessment from buffalo manure application to the field under Mediterranean climate is proposed, with aim of giving first data for this animal species. Methods During summer period of 2016 an experimental trial combining the use of three wind tunnel (WT) and Micrometeorological method specifically Integrate Horizontal flux (IHF) in circular plot was carried out. Buffalo slurry was applied with splash <b>plate</b> <b>spreader</b> for IHF and manually under WT. Acid traps were used to assess ammonia fluxes from WT.
