40|$|Abstract: The rudder and <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the most}} widely used ship {{maneuvering}} equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, <b>steering</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem.

50|$|The side armor of 343 mm reached {{almost as}} {{high above the}} design {{waterline}} as it extended below. Two armored decks protected against plunging fire. The upper armored deck, 3 in thick, rested flat on the upper edge of the belt armor.

The bow and stern were generally not armored, although a narrower, weaker strip of side armor was extended aft to protect the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> <b>compartment.</b> Otherwise, their only protection was the lower armored deck, which extended as far as these areas. Although heavy, {{the weight of the}} armored decks was minimized by reducing the number of main turrets from five in the New Yorks to four; this meant accepting triple mounts to minimize armored length.|$|E
