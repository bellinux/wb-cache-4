The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A <b>second</b> <b>call</b> followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

British Army troops and the RUC were alerted and immediately began to evacuate the people into nearby Lower Donegall Street. The <b>second</b> <b>call</b> to the Irish News newspaper seven minutes later also gave Church Street as the location for the device. When a final call came at 11.55 advising the Unionist News Letter newspaper that the bomb was instead placed outside its offices in Lower Donegall Street to where the crowds were being sent, the warning arrived {{too late for the}} security forces to clear the street.

25|$|American author Thurston Clarke's {{analysis}} of the bombing gave timings for calls and for the explosion, which he said took place at 12:37. He stated {{that as part of}} the Irgun plan, a sixteen-year-old recruit, Adina Hay (alias Tehia), was to make three warning calls before the attack. At 12:22 the first call was made, in both Hebrew and English, to a telephone operator on the hotel's switchboard (the Secretariat and the military each had their own, separate, telephone exchanges). It was ignored. At 12:27, the second warning call was made to the French Consulate adjacent to the hotel to the north-east. This <b>second</b> <b>call</b> was taken seriously, and staff went through the building opening windows and closing curtains to lessen the impact of the blast. At 12:31 a third and final warning call to the Palestine Post newspaper was made. The telephone operator called the Palestine Police CID to report the message. She then called the hotel switchboard. The hotel operator reported the threat to one of the hotel managers. This warning resulted in the discovery of the milk cans in the basement, but by then it was too late.|$|E

500|$|Toronto rock {{promoters}} John Brower and Kenny Walker organised {{a festival}} held at Varsity Stadium on 13 September 1969, around {{the notion of}} a revival of rock and roll stars from the 1950s, booking Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, and Gene Vincent. They also booked more modern acts such as Alice Cooper, Chicago, and The Doors. On 12 September, Brower contacted Lennon to see if {{he would be willing to}} be the master of ceremonies. Lennon offered instead to perform at the festival, bringing his own band, the Plastic Ono Band." [...] Brower agreed, and Lennon quickly assembled a band. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison turned him down, so Eric Clapton (who had played guitar in Lennon's earlier live group, the Dirty Mac) was chosen instead. Lennon hastily assembled the rest of the band, consisting of Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White, as well as their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter, to accompany himself and Ono. White got a phone call from Lennon, and assumed it was a friend prank calling him, only realising it was actually Lennon after a <b>second</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

That's what I was told by someone who was in a {{position}} to know. I don't have any proof in writing, so I have to qualify it by saying someone told me." [...] Official sources stated that Paramount became involved, and that the company felt the story was inappropriate for younger viewers in the syndicated marketplace and that complaints would be received from parents. The script was given to Herbert Wright to re-write. Roddenberry gave Wright a number notes on the script, who accidentally handed over notes on the script to Gerrold which were written by Roddenberry's lawyer, Leonard Maizlish. Due to the workload on Wright at the time, Gerrold offered to make a first attempt at the re-write with the intention of removing the homosexual characters. However, after initially clearing that with Roddenberry, Wright later received a phone call from him telling Wright not to let Gerrold work on it. Shortly after, Wright received a <b>second</b> <b>call</b> from Maizlish to reinforce the message that Gerrold must not be allowed to work on the script.|$|E
