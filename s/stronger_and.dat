By 1983, overall economic growth was <b>stronger,</b> <b>and</b> inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E

5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America.

5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors.

5|$|The navies of Britain and France in 1794 were at very {{different}} stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger and <b>stronger,</b> <b>and</b> carried a heavier weight of shot.

5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{complexity}} of comparing pushdown automata (PDA) and context-free processes (BPA) to finite-state systems, w. r. t. <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> weak simulation preorder/equivalence <b>and</b> <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> weak bisimulation equivalence. We present a complete picture of {{the complexity of}} all these problems. In particular, we show that <b>strong</b> <b>and</b> weak simulation preorder (and hence simulation equivalence) is EXPTIME-complete between PDA/BPA and finite-state systems in both directions. For PDA the lower bound even holds if the finite-state system is fixed, while simulation-checking between BPA and any fixed finitestate system is already polynomial. Furthermore, we show that weak (<b>and</b> <b>strong)</b> bisimilarity between PDA and finite-state systems is PSPACE-complete, while <b>strong</b> (<b>and</b> weak) bisimilarity between two PDAs is EXPTIME-hard. ...|$|R

5|$|Between levels, the Kid {{visits the}} Bastion, where the player can use fragments—the game's form of currency—that they have accrued to buy {{materials}} and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add {{one of six}} structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> giving the player increased experience points and currency. Experience points are {{used to determine the}} Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> the threat of its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Charles {{apparently}} conquered {{his physical}} infirmity, {{which might have}} been caused by rickets. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry {{died at the age of}} 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft <b>stronger,</b> <b>and</b> thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence.

The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a <b>stronger</b> <b>and</b> larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E

He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
