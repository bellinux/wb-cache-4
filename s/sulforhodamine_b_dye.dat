The effects of (n- 3), (n- 6) and trans fatty acids on proliferation of subconfluent IEC- 6 cultures and restitution of wounded IEC- 6 monolayers were investigated. Incorporation of supplemented fatty acids into cellular phospholipid was also assessed. <b>Sulforhodamine</b> <b>B</b> protein <b>dye</b> binding assay was utilized to assess the proliferative effects of fatty acids on growth of IEC- 6 cultures. Incorporation of supplemental fatty acids into cellular phospholipid was examined by thin-layer chromatography combined with gas chromatography. The modulation of epithelial restitution was examined by razor blade wounding confluent IEC- 6 monolayers grown in media supplemented with various fatty acids. Inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis by indomethacin during the wounding assay was also assessed. Both (n- 3) and (n- 6) fatty acids significantly inhibited growth of this intestinal epithelial cell model at concentrations above 125 mmol/L. The trans fatty acid, linoelaidate 18 : 2 (n- 6) trans, inhibited growth of IEC- 6 cells at concentrations above 250 mmol/L.

The assays are based on the identification of the RNA of the IS 900 element of MAP. For the assay, RNA was extracted from fecal samples spiked with a known quantity of (101 to 106) MAP cells and amplified using RT-PCR and identified by the LF biosensor and the microtiter plate assay. While the LF biosensor assay requires only 30 min of assay time, the overall process took 10 h for the detection of 10 viable cells. The assays are based on an oligonucleotide sandwich hybridization assay format and use either a membrane flow through system with an immobilized DNA probe that hybridizes with the target sequence or a microtiter plate well.

Two orders of magnitude concentration was achieved after applying the electric field for only 2 min.

We describe a new optical technique for quantifying extravasation in the cortex of the living mouse and for imaging intraparenchymal tissue. Leakiness of the BBB was induced by microbeam x-irradiation. Two fluorescent dyes were simultaneously infused intravenously, one of high molecular weight (fluorescein-labeled dextran, 70 kDa, green fluorescence) and one of low molecular weight (<b>sulforhodamine</b> <b>B,</b> 559 Da, red fluorescence).

No distinct correlation was found between flow rates (1, 5, and 8 mL/min) and SB release, possibly because of competing factors controlling release rate at different flow rates. A highly similar SB release rate into two fat content fluids (2. 9 and 4. 2 wt%) was observed for identical flow conditions.

High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography –mass spectrometry analyses confirmed that both SBP and CPO transformed the SRB dye into low molecular weight intermediates. While most of the intermediates produced by the two enzymes were the same, the CPO treatment produced at least one different intermediate. Furthermore, toxicological evaluation using lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seeds demonstrated that the SBP-based treatment was able to eliminate the phytotoxicity of SRB dye, but the CPO-based treatment did not.

Here, {{the effect of the}} molecular weight of a monovalent PEG-carboxylate capping ligand (MWPEG) was investigated in a newly developed one-step, stoichiometric procedure that aims at functionalizing MIL- 88 A particles and achieving size control at the same time. The bulk of the MIL- 88 A particles is composed of iron(III) oxide metal clusters connected by fumaric acid as the organic ligand. The surface is functionalized with monovalent PEG-carboxylate capping ligands of different lengths. The size of the PEG-functionalized MIL- 88 A decreased with increasing MWPEG, and nanoMOFs were obtained for long (≥ 2 kDa) PEG chains. For lower MWPEG, higher concentrations of PEG were needed to obtain the maximum size effect, but the resulting sizes were still larger than for long PEGs.

Uptake and release experiments with <b>sulforhodamine</b> <b>B</b> <b>dye</b> (as a model drug) showed a higher and faster uptake and release for MIL- 88 A functionalized with PEG (20 kDa) than for native MIL- 88 A, which is attributed to a larger surface-to-volume ratio for the PEG-covered particles, and to the well-hydrated and accessible nature of the PEG layer in an aqueous medium.

This free radical abstracts an electron from conjugated and weaker site of the Rhodamine <b>B</b> <b>dye.</b> As a result Rhodamine <b>B</b> <b>dye</b> is broken down into fragments. Scavenger study has proved the participation of free radical in the reaction. Finally, various degraded products such as NO 2, CO 2, H 2 O, etc. may take place in the process.|$|R

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to monitor VEGF secretion from breast cancer cells. Progestin-dependent xenograft tumor growth {{was used to determine}} LU effects in vivo. CD 31 immunohistochemistry was used to determine blood-vessel density in xenograft tumors. CD 44 expression, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and mammosphere-formation assays were used to monitor stem cell-like characteristics of breast cancer cells.|$|R

40|$|Single fibres were {{dissected}} from mouse flexor digitorum brevis {{muscles and}} subjected to a protocol of eccentric stretches consisting of ten tetani each with a 40 % stretch. Ten minutes later the fibres showed a reduced force, {{a shift in the}} peak of the force-length relation and a steepening of the force-frequency relation. Addition of the fluorescent <b>dye</b> <b>sulforhodamine</b> <b>B</b> to the extracellular space enabled the T-tubular system to be visualized. In unstimulated fibres and fibres subjected to 10 isometric tetani, the T-tubules were clearly delineated. <b>Sulforhodamine</b> <b>B</b> diffused out of the T-tubules with a half-time of 18 ± 1 s. Following the eccentric protocol, vacuoles connected to the T-tubules were detected in six out of seven fibres. <b>Sulforhodamine</b> <b>B</b> diffused out of the vacuoles of eccentrically damaged fibres extremely slowly with a half-time of 6. 3 ± 2. 4 min and diffused out of the T-tubules with a half-time of 39 ± 4 s. Vacuole production was eliminated by application of 1 mm ouabain to the muscle during the eccentric protocol. On removal of the ouabain, vacuoles appeared over a period of 1 h and were more numerous and more widely distributed than in the absence of ouabain. We propose that T-tubules are liable to rupture during eccentric contraction probably because of the relative movement associated with the inhomogeneity of sarcomere lengths. Such rupture raises intracellular sodium and when the sodium is pumped from the cell by the sodium pump, the volume load of Na+ and water exceeds the capacity of the T-tubules and causes vacuole production. The damage to the T-tubules may underlie a number of the functional changes that occur in eccentrically damaged muscle fibres. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

In brief, breast cancer cells in 100  µl DMEM/F 12 / 10  % FBS medium were seeded into each well of a 96 -well plate and {{incubated}} at 37  °C overnight in 5  % CO 2. Cells were treated (in six replicates) with either LU or DMSO (controls) in DMEM/ 5  % FBS for periods up to 48  h, then subjected to SRB assays.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn in vitro {{simulation}} {{system was}} developed to study the effect of an infant's peristaltic tongue motion during breastfeeding on oral rapidly disintegrating tablets in the mouth, for use in rapid product candidate screening. These tablets are being designed for use inside a modified nipple shield worn by a mother during breastfeeding, a proposed novel platform technology to administer drugs and nutrients to breastfeeding infants. In this study, {{the release of a}} model compound, <b>sulforhodamine</b> <b>B,</b> from tablet formulations was studied under physiologically relevant forces induced by compression and rotation of a tongue mimic. The release profiles of the <b>sulforhodamine</b> <b>B</b> in flowing deionized water were found to be statistically different using 2 -way ANOVA with matching, when tongue mimic rotation was introduced for 2 compression levels representing 2 tongue strengths (p = 0. 0013 and p < 0. 0001 for the lower and higher compression settings, respectively). Compression level was found to be a significant factor for increasing model compound release at rotational rates representing nonnutritive breastfeeding (p = 0. 0162). This novel apparatus is the first to simulate the motion and pressures applied by the tongue and could be used in future infant oral product development...|$|R
