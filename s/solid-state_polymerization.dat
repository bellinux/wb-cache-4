H 2 O catalyst at a temperature between the glass transition temperature and the melting point. When the prepolymers (14, 000 g/mol) in micro-layers of a thickness range from 5 μm to 35 μm were solid-state polymerized at 230 °C, the polymer molecular weight increased rapidly to above 100, 000 g/mol, exceeding the highest molecular weight obtainable by the conventional <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> in micro-particles. It has also been observed that the final molecular weight reached as high as 600, 000 g/mol even in presence of significant stoichiometric imbalances of end group mole ratios when the prepolymer having 21, 000 g/mol is used at 230 °C under low pressure (10 mmHg). Most notably, amorphous prepolymer micro-layers showed significantly higher increase in molecular weight than partially crystallized prepolymer micro-layers. The chain branching and partially cross-linked structures in high molecular weight polycarbonates have been confirmed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopic analysis as well as pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). 13 C-NMR analysis and SSP theoretical model simulation have shown that conventional linear step-growth polymerization is {{not responsible for the}} additional increase in molecular weight beyond 50, 000 g/mol of polycarbonate MW. The ultra-high molecular weight is contributed to the formation of branched and partially cross-linked structures via Fries or Kolbe-Schmitt rearrangement reactions and radical recombination reaction, respectively. Micro-radical polycarbonate species can be produced via chain scission reaction and hydrogen abstraction at the <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> temperature. The formation of cross-linked polymers by radical recombination reactions was attributed to the near complete removal of phenol (i. e. radical scavenger) from the micro-layers during the solid state polymerization. Branched structure polycarbonate was also confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The presence of branched and cross-linked polymers contributed to the insolubility of the polymer in solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and methlylene chloride. As SSP m process extends for a long reaction time at 230 °C, about 95 % of the polymer was insoluble with excellent transparency (90 - 93 % light transmission). Properties of ultra-high molecular weight nonlinear polycarbonates (SSP m PCs) have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and rheometer. The development of Multi-Layer Deposit and Reaction (MLDR) technique has shown that the SSP m process is not limited to 5 - 35 μm scale.

C- 13 NMR sequence distribution {{analysis showed that}} Dianol was randomly incorporated in the PBT-Dianol copolymers obtained by MP. However, the used C- 13 NMR sequence distribution analysis method was based on solution NMR. As a consequence, the obtained chemical microstructure reflects both the crystalline and amorphous part. For PBT-Dianol copolymers obtained by SSP, the modification only {{took place in the}} amorphous phase of PBT. Hence, knowledge of the chemical microstructure of the amorphous phase is important for tailoring the final properties of these copolymers obtained by SSP. Therefore, a calculation method was developed to adjust the solution C- 13 NMR peak integral values of the dyad sequences {{in such a way that}} only the amorphous fraction, which participates in the transesterification process, was taken into consideration for calculating the degree of randomness. The semicrystalline PBT-Dianol copolymers as obtained by SSP were initially represented by the often-used two-phase (crystalline/amorphous) model. The resulting chemical microstructure of the amorphous phase gave a strong indication that part of the amorphous phase was not accessible for incorporation of Dianol by SSP. Therefore, a three-phase (crystalline, rigid amorphous and mobile amorphous) model was used to represent the morphology of the PBT-Dianol copolymers. Crystalline, mobile amorphous, and rigid amorphous fractions were determined by DSC. Using this three-phase model, the calculation method showed that only the mobile amorphous fraction was accessible for incorporation of Dianol by SSP. At the used <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> temperature of 180 degrees C, the PBT chains in the rigid amorphous and crystalline phase are not mobile enough to participate in the transesterification reaction.

Polymers end-capped by the corresponding noninterlocked macrocycle {{as well as}} a copolymer with a rigid fluorene monomer unit were also prepared as reference systems. Size exclusion chromatography and H- 1 NMR indicate that the catenane is quantitatively incorporated during synthesis but that a small fraction ring-opens to form noninterlocked macrocycles, incorporated as either chain ends or branching points. Catenanes induce a smaller increase in the glass transition temperature than the macrocycle at the same weight content. This is probably due to the suppression of interchain hydrogen bonds upon interlocking and points to a specific effect of the mechanical linkage on properties. The crystallization and melting temperatures of catenane copolymers are only slightly depressed compared to those of PET homopolymer, further demonstrating significant flexibility of the catenane rings.

Mixtures consisting of 85 mol % PBT and 15 mol % Dianol were isothermally polymerized in the solid-state at 180 °C while the polymerization time was varied. Combining HPLC and 1 H NMR spectroscopy results showed that Dianol monomer reacts with PBT via two consecutive first-order reactions, the Dianol monoester being an intermediate and fully incorporated Dianol as the final product. The two corresponding reaction rate constants were determined by fitting the first-order equations with experimental data, revealing that free Dianol monomer is more reactive toward transesterification with PBT than its monoester. Dianol was fully incorporated in PBT after a reaction time of 4 h. This result was confirmed by 13 C NMR sequence distribution analysis. SEC measurements showed that the molecular weight and polydispersity first decrease during the SSP reaction due to chain scission of PBT.

The results reveal more delamination of organoclay platelets in PET-C 30 B nanocomposites processed at low feeding rate compared to those processed at high feeding rate. Enhanced mechanical and barrier properties were observed in PET nanocomposites after SSP compared to the nanocomposites prepared by conventional melt-mixing. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 54 : 1723 - 1736, 2014.

40|$|Grafting of vinyl {{monomers}} onto {{isotactic polypropylene}} (iPP) in the solid state represents a convenient route to chemically modify iPP and, consequently, its properties. Solid-state modification {{can be carried}} out on iPP powder directly from the polymerization reactor. The modified powder is then processed in the melt, usually with the addition of fillers and/or additives, to obtain the final product. In this work we have studied the effect of melt processing on the morphology of solid-state polymerized PP/polystyrene (PS) blends, i. e., of a iPP powder previously modified in the solid-state with styrene (St) and optionally in the presence of divinylbenzene (DVB). A series of samples containing different amounts of PS and displaying different grafting efficiencies were investigated before and after processing in the melt. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and solid-state NMR were used to investigate the morphology on different length scales. It was shown that PS coalescence during processing can be hindered, thereby stabilizing the initially polymerized iPP/PS blends morphology. Indeed, reducing the PS amount in the blend or increasing the grafting efficiency resulted in less coalescence of the PS domains. Crosslinking of the PS phase during the <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> resulted also in a very fine but heterogeneous morphology. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) /Cloisite 30 B (C 30 B) nanocomposites of {{different}} organoclay concentrations were prepared using a water-assisted extrusion process. The {{reduction of the}} molecular weight (Mw) of the PET matrix, caused by hydrolysis during water-assisted extrusion, was compensated by subsequent <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> (SSP). Viscometry, titration, rheological, and dynamic scanning calorimetry measurements were {{used to analyze the}} samples from SSP. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of PET increased significantly through SSP. PET nanocomposites exhibited solid-like rheological behavior, and the complex viscosity at high frequencies was scaled with the Mw of PET. The Maron-Pierce model was used to evaluate the Mw of PET in the nanocomposites before and after SSP. It was found that the extent and the rate of the SSP reaction in nanocomposites were lower than those for the neat PETs, due to the barrier effect of clay platelets. Consequently, the SSP rate of PET increased with decreasing particle size for the neat PET and PET nanocomposites. The effect of the Mw of PET on the crystallization temperature, crystallinity, and the half-time, t 1 / 2, of nonisothermal crystallization was also investigated. With increasing Mw of PET, t 1 / 2 increased, whereas Tc and Xc decreased. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} of poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF), catalyzed by three different catalysts, namely, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TIS), tetrabutyltitanate (TBT), and dibutyltin (IV) oxide (DBTO), via the two-stage melt polycondensation method. <b>Solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> (SSP) was conducted at different reaction times (1, 2, 3. 5, and 5 h) and temperatures 190, 200, and 205 °C, under vacuum. The resultant polymers were analyzed according to their intrinsic viscosity (IV), end groups (–COOH), and thermal properties, via differential scanning calorimetry. DSC {{results showed that the}} post polymerization process was favorable to enhance the melting point of the prepared PEF samples. As was expected, the intrinsic viscosity and the average molecular weight of PEF increased with the SSP time and temperature, whereas the number of carboxyl end-groups was decreased. A simple kinetic model was also developed and used to predict the time evolution of polymers IV, as well as the carboxyl and hydroxyl content of PEF during the SSP. From both the experimental measurements and the theoretical simulation results it was proved that the presence of the TIS catalyst resulted in higher transesterification kinetic rate constants and higher reaction rates. The activation energies were not much affected by the presence of different catalysts. Finally, using DBTO as a catalyst, the polyesters produced have higher crystallinity, and as a consequence, higher number of inactive carboxyl and hydroxyl groups...|$|E
40|$|The postcondensation of nylon 6 in {{the solid}} state was studied. The {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} on fine powder in a fluidized bed reactor in a stream of dry nitrogen in the temperature range 110 - 205 °C and during 1 - 24 h. The <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> (SSP) did not follow melt kinetics, but {{was found to be}} limited by the diffusion of the autocatalyzing acid chain end group. Factors thought to influence SSP were studied, e. g., heat treatment, starting molecular weight, and remelting. Surprisningly, heat treatment had little effect, but the starting molecular weight had a strong effect on the reaction rate. The higher the starting molecular weight, the faster the reaction. This could be explained as a changing concentration distribution of the reactive groups in the solid state on SSP. The kinetics of the SSP had more than one region, and the rate of reaction for conversions of over 30 % could be expressed as - dc/dt = k(c/t), where k is a dimensionless constant independent of temperature with a value of 0. 28. The integrated form has the form - In(c/co) = k In(t/), where co is the acid end-group concentration at the start, t is the reaction time, and is the induction time. The value of is both dependent on the starting concentration co and the reaction temperature and has an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{available}} radiochromic {{films are}} primarily designed for clinical X-ray dosimetry. These films change color upon exposures to radiation {{as a result}} of <b>solid-state</b> <b>polymerization</b> (SSP). Built on a previous model developed for SSP upon exposures to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a new model was developed in the present work for X-ray-induced coloration in Gafchromic EBT 3 films. Monte Carlo simulations using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code were employed to model the transport and interaction of photons and the generated secondary electrons within the film active layer. The films were exposed to continuous-energy photon beams. The dose DE in the external radiation detector (i. e., ionization chamber) was determined and the realistic dose DA in the film active layer was then obtained using the calibration coefficient R (=DA/DE). The finite element method (FEM) was used to solve the classical steady-state Helmholtz equation using the multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver (MUMPS). An extensive grid independence test was carried out and the numerical stability of the present model was ensured. The reflected light intensity from the film surface was used to theoretically obtain the net reflective optical density of the film exposed to X-ray. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental and theoretical results of the net reflective optical density of the film. For X-ray doses >~ 600 cGy, due to the already formed densely cross-linked structure in the active layer of the EBT 3 film so further bond formation was less likely, the reflected light intensity from the film surface increased at a relatively lower rate when compared to those for dose values <~ 600 cGy...|$|E
