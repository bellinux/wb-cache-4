During this process, transplant engraftment is characterized and defined by interactions between transplanted cells with local and recruited inflammatory cells. The outcome of these interactions determines donor cell fate. Here, we provide evidence that lineage-committed embryonic stem cell (ESC) -derived vascular progenitor cells are the target of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated elimination in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with interferon c was found to significantly upregulate MHC class I expression on ESC-derived vascular progenitor cells, rendering them less susceptible to syngeneic NK cell-mediated killing in vitro and enhancing their survival and differentiation potential in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo ablation of NK cells led to enhanced progenitor cell survival after transplantation into a syngeneic murine ischemic hindlimb model, providing additional evidence that NK cells mediate ESC-derived progenitor cell transplant rejection.

Also, the maximum tumour challenge totally rejected in this way was of the order of 106 cells, and with this rapidly growing tumour, treatment had to be initiated within 4 days of tumour injection. These observations are relevant to current proposals for adjuvant immunotherapy of human malignant disease where conditions of minimal residual disease are not being fulfilled. IMMUNOTHERAPY is now being viewed as a feasible component of the treatment of human malignant disease. This is based firstly upon the evidence that many cancer patients elicit an immune response against neoantigens associated with their own tumours as demonstrated by the in vitro cytotoxicity of peripheral lymphocytes for cultured tumour cells (Hellstr 6 m et al., 1971).

Since almost 50 % of the transplanted patients are conditioned with cytostatics without irradiation, we developed and characterized a GVHD mouse model following conditioning with busulphan and cyclophosphamide. Recipient Balb/c female mice were treated with busulphan (20 mg/kg/day for 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg/day for two days). After one day of rest, recipient mice were transplanted with 2 × 107 bone marrow and 3 × 107 spleen cells from male C 57 BL/ 6 (allogeneic group) or female Balb/c (syngeneic/control group) mice.

METHODS: We investigated two common stem cell transplant mouse models: an immune competent, <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> model and an immune compromised, xenograft transplant model. 19 F labelled stem cells were implanted intramuscularly into the hindlimb of healthy mice. The transplant was then monitored for up to 17 days using 19 F-MRI, after which the tissue was excised for fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemisty. RESULTS: Immediately following transplantation, 19 F-MRI quantification correlated very well with the expected cell number in both models. The 19 F signal decreased over time in both models, with a more rapid decrease in the syngeneic model. By endpoint, only 2 / 7 syngeneic mice had any detectable 19 F signal. In the xenograft model, all mice had detectable signal at endpoint.

As such, central clock dysfunction can alter systemic homeostasis to consequently impair peripheral physiology {{in a manner that}} is secondary to circadian malfunction. To determine the impact of circadian clock function in organ transplantation and dissect the influence of intrinsic tissue clocks versus extrinsic clocks, we implemented a blood vessel grafting approach to surgically assemble a chimeric mouse that was part wild-type (WT) and part circadian clock mutant. Arterial isografts from donor WT mice that had been anastamosed to common carotid arteries of recipient WT mice (WT:WT) exhibited no pathology in this <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> strategy. Similarly, when WT grafts were anastamosed to mice with disrupted circadian clocks, the structural features of the WT grafts immersed in the milieu of circadian malfunction were normal and absent of lesions, comparable to WT:WT grafts. In contrast, aortic grafts from Bmal 1 knockout (KO) or Period- 2, 3 double-KO mice transplanted into littermate control WT mice developed robust arteriosclerotic disease. These lesions observed in donor grafts of Bmal 1 -KO were associated with up-regulation in T-cell receptors, macrophages, and infiltrating cells in the vascular grafts, but were independent of hemodynamics and B and T cell-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate the significance of intrinsic tissue clocks as an autonomous influence in experimental models of arteriosclerotic disease, which may have implications with regard to the influence of circadian clock function in organ transplantation...|$|E

Methods: For our magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we have developed a new rat model of heterotopic lung transplantation to the inguinal region. Allogeneic transplants (DA to Brown Norway) were performed with and without cyclosporine A (INN: ciclosporin) treatment, with <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplants</b> (Brown Norway to Brown Norway) serving as controls (n = 6 per group). Magnetic resonance images were obtained with a gradient echo method before and after injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. Results: At day 5, allogeneic transplants without cyclosporine A treatment showed a grade 4 rejection histologically. A significantly lower magnetic resonance signal was seen 24 hours after injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles compared with the preinjection image (346 ± 7. 6 vs 839 ± 43. 4 arbitrary units; P <. 05). <b>Syngeneic</b> <b>transplants</b> showed no evidence of rejection histologically and no differences in magnetic resonance imaging signals between the images before and after injection of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (863 ± 18. 8 vs 880 ± 22. 5). Allotransplants treated with cyclosporine A showed a grade 2 rejection histologically. The change in magnetic resonance signals in that group was small but showed {{a significant decrease in}} signal intensity after injection (646 ± 10. 5 vs 889 ± 23. 5, P <. 05).

However, few data exist thus far on the molecular signals governing leukocyte trafficking during the disease. We therefore investigated the sequential pattern of distinct adhesion, costimulatory, and apoptosis-related molecules in GVHD organs (ileum, colon, skin, and liver) after transplantation across minor histocompatibility barriers (B 10. D 2 → BALB/c, both H- 2 d). To distinguish changes {{induced by the}} conditioning regimen from effects achieved by allogeneic cell transfer, <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> recipients (BALB/c → BALB/c) and irradiated nontransplanted mice were added as controls. Irradiation upregulated the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) - 1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) -l, and B 7 - 2 in ileum, as well as VCAM- 1 and B 7 - 2 in colon, on day 3 in all animals. Whereas in syngeneic mice these effects were reversed from day 9 on, allogeneic recipients showed further upregulation of VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1, B 7 - 1, and B 7 - 2 in these organs on day 22, when GVHD became clinically evident. Infiltration of CD 4 + and CD 8 + donor T cells was noted on day 9 in skin and liver and on day 22 in ileum and colon. Surprisingly, the expression of several other adhesion molecules, such as ICAM- 2, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, E-selectin, and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1, did not change. Proapoptotic and antiapoptotic markers were balanced in GVHD organs {{with the exception of}} spleen, in which a preferential expression of the proapoptotic Bax could be noted. Our results indicate that irradiation-induced upregulation of VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1, and B 7 - 2 provides early costimulatory signals to incoming donor T cells in the intestine, followed by a cascade of proinflammatory signals in other organs once the alloresponse is established...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently, the {{inducible}} isoform of {{nitric oxide}} synthase {{has been shown to}} be an important immunomodulation molecule in allograft rejection. We have observed the production of nitric oxide during rejection and the effect of {{nitric oxide synthase}} inhibition on allograft rejection in a rat lung transplant model. Rat left lung allotransplants were performed in two strain combinations: brown Norway–to–F 344 (major histocompatibility complex incompatible); and Lewis-to-F 344 (minor loci incompatible) as severe and mild rejection models respectively. Syngeneic F 344 -to-F 344 transplants were performed as a negative control. Nitric oxide production during rejection was determined by measuring the recipient's serum nitrite/nitrate levels as a stable end product of nitric oxide. The progression of rejection was evaluated radiographically and the grade of rejection was determined histologically. After operation, recipients of allotransplantation were randomly divided into two groups and received either aminoguanidine (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal every 6 hours), a potent inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, or normal saline treatment. The levels of serum nitrite and nitrate in recipients increased in the early phase of rejection in both allotransplant combinations. However, in the terminal phase of rejection, the serum nitrite/nitrate level decreased significantly compared with the peak level in the brown Norway–to–F 344 recipients. The serum nitrite/nitrate levels in the <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> recipients were normal during the entire observation period. In aminoguanidine-treated animals, serum nitrite/nitrate levels remained normal in both allograft combinations. Significant suppression of rejection in aminoguanidine-treated recipients was observed histologically and radiographically in comparison with untreated recipients in the brown Norway–to–F 344 combination. In the Lewis-to-F 344 combination, aminoguanidine treatment significantly ameliorated histologic rejection but did not affect radiologic appearance. We therefore conclude nitric oxide is produced during early allograft rejection and may prove to be a marker and mediator of early rejection. The inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase results in significant reduction in rat lung allograft rejection. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1995; 110 : 1449 - 60...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Podocalyxin (gene name PODXL) is a CD 34 -related sialomucin {{implicated in}} the {{regulation}} of cell adhesion, migration and polarity. Upregulated expression of podocalyxin is linked to poor patient survival in epithelial cancers. However, {{it is not known}} if podocalyxin has a functional role in tumor progression. METHODS: We silenced podocalyxin expression in the aggressive basal-like human (MDA-MB- 231) and mouse (4 T 1) breast cancer cell lines and also overexpressed podocalyxin in the more benign human breast cancer cell line, MCF 7. We evaluated how podocalyxin affects tumorsphere formation in vitro and compared the ability of podocalyxin-deficient and podocalyxin-replete cell lines to form tumors and metastasize using xenogenic or <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> models in mice. Finally, in an effort to develop therapeutic treatments for systemic cancers, we generated a series of antihuman podocalyxin antibodies and screened these for their ability to inhibit tumor progression in xenografted mice. RESULTS: Although deletion of podocalyxin does not alter gross cell morphology and growth under standard (adherent) culture conditions, expression of PODXL is required for efficient formation of tumorspheres in vitro. Correspondingly, silencing podocalyxin resulted in attenuated primary tumor growth and invasiveness in mice and severely impaired the formation of distant metastases. Likewise, in competitive tumor engraftment assays where we injected a 50 : 50 mixture of control and shPODXL (short-hairpin RNA targeting PODXL) -expressing cells, we found that podocalyxin-deficient cells exhibited a striking decrease in the ability to form clonal tumors in the lung, liver and bone marrow. Finally, to validate podocalyxin as a viable target for immunotherapy, we screened a series of novel antihuman podocalyxin antibodies for their ability to inhibit tumor progression in vivo. One of these antibodies, PODOC 1, potently blocked tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: We show that podocalyxin {{plays a key role in}} the formation of primary tumors and distant tumor metastasis. In addition, we validate podocalyxin as potential target for monoclonal antibody therapy to inhibit primary tumor growth and systemic dissemination.

We found that the non-canonical NF-&# 954;B pathway was activated in islets from diet-induced obese (DIO) mice compared to chow controls, as evidenced by accumulation of NF-&# 954;B-inducing kinase (NIK), IKK&# 945; phosphorylation, p 100 to p 52 processing and RelB accumulation. To examine the effect of NIK accumulation in &# 946; cells, we generated a genetic &# 946; cell-specific mouse model of constitutive NIK activation. The TRAF 2 /TRAF 3 /BIRC 2 / 3 E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex tightly controls activation of NIK. Deletion of either component (&# 946;TRAF or &# 946;BIRC) promotes &# 946; cell-intrinsic NIK activation. &# 946;TRAF 2 mice showed exacerbated glucose intolerance and impaired first-phase insulin secretion in a DIO model. &# 946; cell mass was increased in &# 946;TRAF 2 mice, indicating severely impaired insulin secretory capacity. &# 946;TRAF 2 islets exhibited dysregulated TNF&# 945;-stimulated canonical NF-&# 954;B and MAPK signalling. To dissect out whether NIK activation was promoting &# 946; cell dysfunction, we next utilized a &# 946; cell-specific deletion of TRAF 3. &# 946;TRAF 3 mice phenocopied &# 946;TRAF 2 mice showing defective first-phase insulin secretion and increased &# 946; cell mass. &# 946;TRAF 3 islets exhibited hyper-activation of NIK but normal TNF&# 945;-stimulated canonical NF-&# 954;B and MAPK signalling. Next, we set out to determine whether increased &# 946; cell expansion in NIK ON mice per se might trigger &# 946; cell dysfunction or whether acute NIK activation would also alter &# 946; cell function. Using a drug-based approach, we examined function in islets treated with a BIRC-inhibitor (MV 1; Smac-mimetic). Ex vivo, MV 1 -treated mouse islets showed impaired GSIS. In vivo, MV 1 disrupted glucose homeostasis as MV 1 -treated islets failed to provide normal metabolic control in <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> recipients, and MV 1 -injected zebrafish larvae exhibited hyper-glycosuria. In summary, we have discovered that the diabetic milieu triggers &# 946; cell-intrinsic NIK activation. Constitutive as well as acute activation of NIK precipitates &# 946; cell secretory defects in mice and fish. Thus, NIK is a critical signalling node regulating glucose homeostasis in diabetes...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} pathological {{types and}} influential factors of chronic graft dysfunction (CGD) following liver transplantation (LT) in rats. METHODS: The whole experiment {{was divided into}} three groups: (1) normal group (n = 12) : normal BN rats without any drug or operation; (2) <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant</b> group (SGT of BN-BN, n = 12) : both donors and recipients were BN rats; and (3) allogeneic transplant group (AGT of LEW-BN, n = 12) : Donors were Lewis and recipients were BN rats. In the AGT group, all recipients were subcutaneously injected by Cyclosporin A after LT. Survival time was observed for 1 year. All the dying rats were sampled, biliary tract tissues were performed bacterial culture and liver tissues for histological study. Twenty-one day after LT, 8 rats were selected randomly in each group for sampling. Blood samples from caudal veins were collected for measurements of plasma endotoxin, cytokines and metabonomic analysis, and faeces were analyzed for intestinal microflora. RESULTS: During the surgery of LT, no complications of blood vessels or bile duct happened, and all rats in each group were still alive in the next 2 wk. The long term observation revealed that a total of 8 rats in the SGT and AGT groups died of hepatic graft diseases, 5 rats in which died of chronic bile duct hyperplasia. Compared to the SGT and normal groups, survival ratio of rats significantly decreased in the AGT group (P < 0. 01). Moreover, liver necrosis, liver infection, and severe chronic bile duct hyperplasia were observed in the AGT group by H and E stain. On 21 d after LT, compared with the normal group (25. 38 1; 7. 09 ng/L) and SGT group (33. 12 1; 10. 26 ng/L), plasma endotoxin in the AGT group was remarkably increased (142. 86 1; 30. 85 ng/L) (both P < 0. 01). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-&#x 3 B 1; and interleukin- 6 were also significantly elevated in the AGT group (593. 6 1; 171. 67 pg/mL, 323. 8 1; 68. 30 pg/mL) vs the normal (225. 5 1; 72. 07 pg/mL, 114. 6 1; 36. 67 pg/mL) and SGT groups (321. 3 1; 88. 47 pg/mL, 205. 2 1; 53. 06 pg/mL) (P < 0. 01). Furthermore, Bacterial cultures of bile duct tissues revealed that the rats close to death from the SGT and AGT groups were strongly positive, while those from the normal group were negative. The analysis of intestinal microflora was performed. Compared to the normal group (7. 98 1; 0. 92, 8. 90 1; 1. 44) and SGT group (8. 51 1; 0. 46, 9. 43 1; 0. 69), the numbers of Enterococcus and Enterobacteria in the AGT group (8. 76 1; 1. 93, 10. 18 1; 1. 64) were significantly increased (both P < 0. 01). Meanwhile, compared to the normal group (9. 62 1; 1. 60, 9. 93 1; 1. 10) and SGT group (8. 95 1; 0. 04, 9. 02 1; 1. 14), the numbers of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the AGT group (7. 83 1; 0. 72, 8. 87 1; 0. 13) were remarkably reduced (both P < 0. 01). In addition, metabonomics analysis showed that metabolic profiles of plasma in rats in the AGT group were severe deviated from the normal and SGT groups. CONCLUSION: Chronic bile duct hyperplasia is a pathological type of CGD following LT in rats. The mechanism {{of this kind of}} CGD is associated with the alterations of inflammation, intestinal barrier function and microflora as well as plasma metabolic profiles...|$|E

We developed a model of breast cancer in which the administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to BALB/c female mice induces mammary ductal carcinomas with a mean latency of 52 weeks and an incidence of about 80 %.

40|$|Trials of {{high dose}} {{immunosuppression}} and peripheral blood stein cell transplantation (PBSCT) {{in patients with}} severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have now commenced based on encouraging data from case reports of patients with coexistent malignancy and animal transplant models. Early case reports in Australia documented the potential for cure of RA in most patients receiving allogeneic or <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplants.</b> However, the relatively high morbidity and mortality of these procedures has necessitated the use of autologous PBSCT, in accordance with international guidelines released by the EBMT/EULAR working party.

Recurrence of disease occurs in most patients usually within 2 years; however, the use of disease modifying agents after recurrence results in substantial amelioration of the disease, again suggesting a form of "immunomodulation.

Other modifications of the procedure are discussed, including T cell depletion of the graft, currently the subject of a randomized trial...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{failure is}} the most {{frequent}} cause of hospitalization among patients older than 65 years. Current techniques of treatment, {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} and coronary artery bypass grafting, are aimed at the revascularization of the remaining viable myocardium and have no effect on contractile mass lost. In the last years efforts have been performed to promote cardiac tissue regeneration. Stem cell transplantation offers a potential therapeutic approach to the repair and regeneration of the damaged heart after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Among different types of stem cells currently being considered for cardiac regeneration, ckit+ cardiac stem cells (ckit+ CSCs) represent a good candidate. These cells are able to stimulate cardiac repair in the infarcted heart by replacing damaged myocardium and/or by the paracrine release of growth factors. The regenerative effects of cardiac ckit+ cells in acute MI have been studied extensively, but little is known about how these cells confer a protective effect to cardiomyocytes. Growing evidences suggest that injury triggers in adult stem cells inflammatory signaling pathways which control tissue repair and regeneration. First, we investigated ¬the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects of ckit+ CSCs following transplantation in a murine model of MI. We used an in vivo murine model of MI and an in vitro colture of murine ckit+ CSCs. Following isolation and in vitro expansion, ckit+ CSCs were subjected to normoxic and hypoxic conditions for different time points. Both q-RT PCR and WB analysis showed that these cells adapted to hypoxia and activated an inflammatory and reparative response (IRR). Specifically, adaptation of these cells to hypoxia occurred through the activation of HIF- 1 a and the expression of a number of genes, such as VEGF, GLUT 1, EPO, HK 2, CAR 9 and, importantly, alarmin receptors, such as RAGE, P 2 X 7 and Toll-like receptors (TLR 2 and TLR 4). Activation of these receptors determined a NFkB-dependent inflammatory and reparative gene response. Importantly, following IRR activation, hypoxic ckit+ CSCs increased the secretion of two survival growth factors, i. e. insulin-like growth factor- 1 and hepatocyte growth factor, detected by ELISA assay. To verify whether activation of the IRR in a hypoxic microenvironment could exert a beneficial effect in vivo, autologous ckit+ CSCs were transplanted into the damaged heart of an ischemic mouse. Interestingly, transplantation of ckit+ CSCs lowered apoptotic rates and induced autophagy in the peri-infarct area; further, it determined a shift in myosin heavy chain isoform content from beta to alpha and an increase in the expression level of the Muscle Lim Protein (MLP, also known as cysteine rich protein 3 -CSRP 3). Using a LUMINEX assay, reduced levels of the pro-fibrotic TGF b 1 were detected following MI and ckit+ CSC transplantation. Accordingly, a decreased protein expression of collagen I was observed in infarcted transplanted hearts compared to controls. These results were also supported by an increase in MMP 9 mRNA and a decrease in TIMP 4 mRNA in hypoxic ckit+ CSCs. Second, we investigated whether, in an in vivo murine model of myocardial infarction (MI), allogeneic transplantation of CSCs was able to stimulate endogenous reparative mechanisms without inducing an immune response. Currently, two general approaches are followed to promote cardiac tissue regeneration: transplantation of regeneration-competent stem cells (CSCs) and stimulation of endogenous cardiovascular progenitors (CSCs). The first procedure is affected by several problems related to the time necessary to prepare CSCs once isolated from a patient and their potential to proliferate and differentiate. For this reason, the possibility to use allogeneic CSCs to repair infarcted hearts would be an alternative of paramount importance to autologous procedures. This possibility has been already demonstrated for cardiospheres, another source of CSCs, but not for ckit+ CSCs. For this study we decided to isolate and expand ckit+CSCs from Balb C murine hearts and then to transplant them into the hearts of Balb C mice (to have a <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplant)</b> or in the hearts of C 57 BL 6 mice (to have an allogeneic transplant). At three different time points (3, 7 and 21 days) hearts were collected from the same mice and used for immunohistochemistry and WB analysis. Specifically, using these techniques, we detected and quantified different markers of primary and secondary inflammation among the different groups of mice to verify the presence of an immune response: CD 45 RA to identify B monocytes, CD 3 for lymphocytes and CD 68 for macrophages. Results showed the lack of difference immune response comparing the syngeneic group to the allogeneic group both by WB analysis and by immunofluorescence. Specifically, the presence of monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages was similar in the two groups at 3, 7 and 21 days following infarction and transplantation. Blood was collected in all animals just before sacrifice to determine the levels of circulating cytokines using the LUMINEX Assay. Plasma quantification of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines at 3, 7 and 21 days following MI and transplantation, showed that the differences between the syngeneic and allogeneic groups are not statistically significant, thus confirming the data obtained by WB analysis and immunofluorescence. Moreover, in our experimental conditions, we detected lower expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in infarcted hearts transplanted with CSCs compared to infarcted hearts used as controls. In conclusion, we demonstrated the feasibility of an allogeneic transplantation using CSCs as demonstrated by comparable expression levels of inflammatory cytokines between the syngeneic and allogeneic groups both in the cardiac tissue, following MI and transplantation, and in the bloodstream...|$|E

40|$|Non-obese {{diabetic}} (NOD) mice develop autoimmunity that destroys {{their native}} beta cells causing diabetes. Their autoimmunity will also destroy <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplanted</b> islets and transfer both autoimmunity and diabetes via spleen cells to non-diabetic mice. In this report, we studied {{the effects of}} streptozotocin (STZ) on the autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. We transplanted NOD. SCID islets into three groups of NOD mice: (1) spontaneously diabetic NOD mice (NOD-sp.); (2) prediabetic NOD mice made diabetic by streptozotocin (NOD-stz); and (3) diabetic NOD mice also treated with streptozotocin (NOD-sp. /stz). In the first group, the transplants were rejected within 3 weeks. In {{the second and third}} groups, the transplants survived indefinitely. Alloxan, a drug similar to streptozotocin, did not have the same effect as streptozotocin. The ability of streptozotocin to prevent diabetes in young NOD mice was reversed by anti-CD 8 antibody treatment but not by anti-CD 4 treatment. Streptozotocin also made spleen cells from diabetic NOD mice less effective transferring diabetes. These results indicate that streptozotocin treatment both prevents and reverses the islet destructive autoimmunity in NOD mice. We postulate that the effects of streptozotocin treatment may be mediated in part by regulatory T cells...|$|R
40|$|H- 2 I-region encoded {{determinants}} {{are thought}} to be expressed on very few tissues including lymphocytes, macrophages, sperm, epidermal, and endothelial cells. Yet, I-region disparate allografts are rejected; not only skin (1), the epidermal ceils of which are known to express Ia antigens, but other organs (2) as well. Suqh data have been used to argue indirectly (2) that I-region encoded determinants, which are capable of serving as targets in allograft rejection, may be present on organ parenchymal cells. A critical examination of this question is important because in allografl systems in which donor and recipient differ for the entire major histocompatibility complex, the fact that allografts are rejected does not necessarily prove the presence of parenchymal cell targets. Evidence obtained,using other transplant models has shown that the presence of allogeneic passenger leukocytes in otherwise presumably <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplants,</b> i. e., where there are no parenchymal cell target determinants foreign to the recipient, can result in graft rejection (3 - 6).

40|$|Summary. -The {{effect of}} the growth of two <b>syngeneic</b> <b>transplanted</b> sarcomata of widely differing {{biological}} properties on the number of monocytes in the blood of rats was measured (1) by binding of a specific antimacrophage serum to leuco-cytes, and (2) by sedimenting in a density gradient rosettes between mononuclear cells and antibody-coated sheep red cells under conditions in which B-cells are not brought down. For the 4 syngeneic sarcomata studied there was a progressive {{increase in the number of}} monocytes with tumour growth and the values returned to normal a few days after their surgical removal. The extent of monocytosis was related to the immunogenicity of the tumour and was most pronounced for the HSBPA sarcoma, which is highly immunogenic, has a low rate of spontaneous metastasis and contains many macrophages, and least for the MC- 3 sarcoma which is essentially non-immunogenic, invariably gives rise to distant metastases and contains only about 8 % macrophages. The growth of sarcomata had previously been found to reduce the number of monocytes which enter inflammatory lesions, both non-specific and due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
