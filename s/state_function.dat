25|$|Once the {{characteristic}} <b>state</b> <b>function</b> for an ensemble has been calculated {{for a given}} system, that system is 'solved' (macroscopic observables can be extracted from {{the characteristic}} <b>state</b> <b>function).</b> Calculating the characteristic <b>state</b> <b>function</b> of a thermodynamic ensemble {{is not necessarily a}} simple task, however, since it involves considering every possible state of the system. While some hypothetical systems have been exactly solved, the most general (and realistic) case is too complex for an exact solution. Various approaches exist to approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation of average quantities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the latter}} is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their {{difference}} would be a <b>state</b> <b>function</b> that would vanish {{upon completion of the}} cycle. The <b>state</b> <b>function</b> was called the internal energy and it became the first law of thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|When {{viewed in}} terms of {{information}} theory, the entropy <b>state</b> <b>function</b> is simply {{the amount of information}} (in the Shannon sense) that would be needed to specify the full microstate of the system. This is left unspecified by the macroscopic description.|$|E
25|$|To {{find the}} entropy {{difference}} between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states. Since entropy is a <b>state</b> <b>function,</b> the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path {{is the same as}} for a reversible path between the same two states. However, the entropy change of the surroundings will be different.|$|E
25|$|This {{implies that}} there is a {{function}} of state which is conserved over a complete cycle of the Carnot cycle. Clausius called this <b>state</b> <b>function</b> entropy. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.|$|E

25|$|In other words, maximum {{efficiency}} is achieved if {{and only if}} no new entropy is created in the cycle, which would be the case if e.g. friction leads to dissipation of work into heat. In that case the cycle is not reversible and the Clausius theorem becomes an inequality rather than an equality. Otherwise, since entropy is a <b>state</b> <b>function,</b> the required dumping of heat into the environment to dispose of excess entropy leads to a (minimal) reduction in efficiency. So Equation 3 gives the efficiency of any reversible heat engine.|$|E
25|$|Miles was re-elected in 1858. In January 1859 {{he spoke}} in support of fellow fire-eater William Lowndes Yancey in advocating the repeal of federal laws banning the African slave trade. Miles felt that the {{regulation}} of the trade should be a <b>state</b> <b>function</b> and that the national ban was an insult to Southern honor. This stance was considered too radical even by his friends, such as Trescott, who felt, since it could never be supported {{by the majority of}} the nation, that Miles' stance was simply a guise to force disunion.|$|E

Brâncoveanu's first born, Constantin II, also had a son who survived exile and rose to be a mare ban (foremost <b>state</b> <b>function</b> in Wallachian {{political}} hierarchy, except for the ruler). The male line of the Brâncoveanu family became extinguished in 1932, when Grigore Brâncoveanu died without having any children of his own.

25|$|From a {{macroscopic}} perspective, {{in classical}} thermodynamics the entropy is {{interpreted as a}} <b>state</b> <b>function</b> of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on {{the current state of}} the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy ΔE, and its entropy falls by ΔS, a quantity at least TR ΔS of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (TR is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} energy is a <b>state</b> <b>function</b> of a system, because its value depends {{only on the}} current state of the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an extensive quantity. It is the one and only cardinal thermodynamic potential. Through it, by use of Legendre transforms, are mathematically constructed the other thermodynamic potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their conjugate intensive variables. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to thermodynamic potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.|$|E
25|$|Uruk {{went through}} several phases of growth, from the Early Uruk period (4000–3500BC) to the Late Uruk period (3500–3100BC). The city was formed when two smaller Ubaid {{settlements}} merged. The temple complexes at their cores became the Eanna District and the Anu District dedicated to Inanna and Anu, respectively. The Anu District was originally called 'Kullaba' (Kulab or Unug-Kulaba) prior to merging with the Eanna District. Kullaba {{dates to the}} Eridu period when {{it was one of}} the oldest and most important cities of Sumer. There are different interpretations about the purposes of the temples. However, it is generally believed they were a unifying feature of the city. It also seems clear that temples served both an important religious function and <b>state</b> <b>function.</b> The surviving temple archive of the Neo-Babylonian period documents the social function of the temple as a redistribution center.|$|E
