The Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189AD) ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipe</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|Two millennia ago, {{the ancient}} Romans {{made use of}} large aqueducts to {{transport}} water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination. Hundreds of these were built throughout Europe and elsewhere, and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the Roman Empire. The ancient Chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works. The famous Han Dynasty court eunuch Zhang Rang (d. 189 AD) once ordered the engineer Bi Lan to construct a series of square-pallet chain pumps outside {{the capital city of}} Luoyang. [...] These chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipe</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, the Briggs and Philipson (Phillipson) {{families}} dominated {{this area}} of northwest Kendal, which was under the parish of Kirkbie. A Christofer Philipson of Hollin Hall, near Crook (several miles to the northwest of Kentrigg), is documented in a will dated 20 May 1566 to have given Rolland Phillipson and his male heirs [...] "lands I purchased of Mr. Heskett" [...] in this area. Around 1581, the son of Robert Philipson married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Briggs of Helsfell Hall and subsequently had five sons and two daughters. During the English Civil War in the 1640s, the Briggs family, who were Parliamentarians (Colonel Edward Briggs was a magistrate), clashed with their cousins, The Philipsons, who were strict Royalists. During the Siege of Carlisle, Colonel Briggs besieged Robert Philipson's Belle Isle on Lake Windermere for eight to ten days. Robert Philipson is documented as having searched Kendal Church for his cousin Edward Briggs {{while he was at}} prayers on a Sunday morning with [...] "the object of killing his cousin" [...] in retaliation. The dominance of the area by the Briggs family ended after the civil war when the Philipsons stripped the family of their possessions, Robert Philipson taking ownership of the Colonel Brigg's seat at Helsfell Hall. The hall is mentioned in Cornelia Nicholson's The Annals of Kendal who documents that the seat of the Briggs family was [...] "once a place of considerable importance."In 1936, 1380 yards of cast-iron and <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipe</b> sewers were built in Kentrigg. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Kentrigg and Burneside became a part of the South Lakeland district, its capital at Kendal.|$|E

After {{the restoration of}} Poland in 1920 and the Peace of Riga with USSR, the edifice housed displaced Polish families from the Eastern Borderlands, such as Mrs Korybut-Daszkiewiczów, wife of Michał Kolankowski, wealthy owner of a factory producing <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipes</b> near Novgorod.|$|R
50|$|Bangalore's {{original}} {{sewerage system}} {{was built in}} 1922, {{a time when the}} city was much smaller than it is today; the original system served only the heart of the city. In 1950, with the city greatly expanding, a project was initiated to greatly expand the sewerage system. After the BWSSB was formed in the 1960s, programs were again implemented to expand the system to unsewered areas. The current sewer system utilizes <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipes</b> up to 300 mm in diameter, and RCC hume pipes for the mains and outfalls up to 2100 mm in diameter.|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of zeolite in forms suitable for industrial applications {{is of great}} importance, mainly as ion exchange material, molecular sieves, adsorbents and catalyst. In the present investigation an effort {{has been made to}} synthesize zeolite from glaze free ceramic (inorganic) wastes (porcelain bodies) such as broken <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipe</b> and washbasin. Porcelain mainly is composed of amorphous glass phase and crystalline phases such as quartz and mullite. Most of the amorphous and crystalline phases are converted into soluble phases by alkali fusion and transformed into zeolite crystals with high specific area and unique micro-pores. The synthesized zeolites were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} artificial {{habitat for}} spiny lobsters {{was created in}} the sea off Vellapatti, a fishing village near Tuticorin in the Gulf of Mannar during June 1997. A total of 49 modules fabricated out of 147 <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipes</b> were used to create the artificial habitat which covered a floor area of approximately 1000 sq. m. Inhabitation of lobsters in the artificial habitat was recordedfor the first time three months after the installation of the modules. Both Panulirus ornatus and P. homarus were encountered in bottom set gill net catches operated {{in the vicinity of the}} artificial habitat...|$|R
50|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{was constructed}} during {{the governance of}} the Ottoman Empire, in the 16th century, and included a bridge across a valley. It served as the water supply for Stari Bar, bringing water 3 km from a spring on Mount Rumija. The structure of the aqueduct bridge, consists of seventeen large arches of varying widths, which are supported on eighteen massive pillars. The water channel is formed on the upper surface of the aqueduct, where jointly connected <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipes</b> were placed, each being about 12 cm in diameter and 30 cm long. The entire construction is made of broken and roughly hewn stone.|$|R
40|$|High {{chromium}} {{cast steel}} alloys {{are being used}} extensively in many industrial services where dry or wet abrasion resistance is required. Such steel castings are demanded for cement, <b>stoneware</b> <b>pipes,</b> and earth moving industries. In this research, five steel heats were prepared in 100 [*]kg and one-ton medium frequency induction furnaces and then sand cast in both Y-block and final impact arm spare parts, respectively. Vanadium (0. 5 – 2. 5 %) and boron (120 – 150 [*]ppm) {{were added to the}} 18 Cr- 1. 9 C- 0. 5 Mo steel heats to examine their effects on the steel microstructure, mechanical properties especially impact, fracture toughness and abrasion resistance. Changes in the phase transformation after heat treatment were examined using inverted, SEM-EDX microscopy; however, the abrasion resistance was measured in dry basis using the real tonnage of crushed and milled stoneware clay to less than 0. 1 [*]mm size distribution...|$|R
50|$|Not unlike dump diggers privy diggers {{may also}} {{encounter}} miscellaneous tableware (banded ware, redware, mocha, and other slipwares), <b>stoneware,</b> occasionally clay <b>pipes,</b> doll parts, tea set pieces, marbles, buttons, chamber pots, decorative porcelain pot lids and bases used for pomades and skin creams, bone or ivory toothbrush handles, hard-rubber combs and hair picks, ambrotypes, {{and other objects}} which are usually broken or damaged.|$|R
50|$|The city of Akron {{was laid}} out in 1825 and was first settled by Irish laborers and others working on the Ohio and Erie Canal. Once the canal was completed, the town flourished. Several {{important}} industries brought prosperity to the area including <b>stoneware</b> potteries, sewer <b>pipe</b> manufacturing, the match industry and, most recently, the tire and rubber industry. At one time, the Blue Diamond Match Company in Akron used three million board feet (7,000 m³) of white pine lumber per year for the manufacture of its matches.|$|R
50|$|In 1815, {{soon after}} John Doulton had {{completed}} his apprenticeship as a potter, he invested his life savings of £100 in the Vauxhall Walk pottery of Martha Jones, Lambeth. Her foreman, John Watts, was also taken into partnership {{and the firm}} became known as Jones, Watts and Doulton. It specialized in industrial ware, brown <b>stoneware,</b> drain <b>pipes</b> as well as stoneware bottles for chemicals, beer, and other industrial liquids among others. Martha Jones withdrew from the partnership in 1820 and the company moved to new premises in Lambeth High Street in 1826. In 1835 John's 15-year-old son Henry Doulton was taken on as an apprentice. By 1846, Henry had set up an independent Lambeth Pottery which had become the leader in industrial products, particularly sanitation products. Following the retirement of John Watts in 1853, Doulton and Watts merged with Henry's company to become Doulton and Company and was highly recognised for its lines of hand decorated figurines, vases and dinnerware.|$|R
5000|$|Because of Eliakim Crosby's {{founding}} of [...] "North Akron" [...] (Cascade) in the Northern portion {{of what is}} now Downtown Akron in the year 1833, [...] "South" [...] was added to Akron's name up until about 3 years later when the two were merged and became an incorporated village in 1836. In 1840 Summit County formed from portions of Portage, Medina, and Stark counties. Akron replaced Cuyahoga Falls as its county seat a year later and opened a canal connecting to Beaver, Pennsylvania, helping give birth to the <b>stoneware,</b> sewer <b>pipe,</b> fishing tackle, and farming equipment industries. In 1844, abolitionist John Brown moved into the John Brown House across the street from business partner Colonel Simon Perkins who lived in the Perkins Stone Mansion. The Akron School Law of 1847 began the K-12 grade school system, which currently is used in every U.S. state. Also in 1847 the Akron Public Schools was founded, and also the very first School was built which is now a museum located on Broadway Street near the Corner with Exchange in what would have been original Akron prior to the 1836 merger.|$|R
5000|$|Dump digging {{can yield}} {{different}} items and artifacts in each location. A town dump can be somewhat {{different than a}} farm dump or a railroad dump but in each case there could be industrial age pottery, <b>stoneware,</b> china, tobacco <b>pipes,</b> military relics like bayonets and gun barrels, musket balls, uniform buttons and other buttons, marbles {{and an assortment of}} other things. A high percentage of these dump discoveries are routinely found in severe states of decay, damaged or broken altogether. In many cases even the things which have {{stood the test of time}} remarkably well have little if any monetary value. There are many exceptions to this general rule that keep dump diggers busy searching and occasionally they are surprised by what they unearth working their sites.|$|R
5000|$|Notable {{historical}} {{events that occurred}} in the city includes the Akron School Law of 1847 creating the K-12 system, and Sojourner Truth giving her Ain't I A Woman? speech in 1851. Resident Ferdinand Schumacher supplied the Union Army with quaker oats during the American Civil War. The popularization of the church architectural Akron Plan, the goiter prevention iodized salt Akron Experiment, City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, and portions of the 2014 Gay Games also occurred. Akron is known for the rubber, tire, and airship industries among others, including the trucking, <b>stoneware,</b> sewer <b>pipe,</b> fishing tackle, farming equipment, mining, match, zipper, and toy industries. With a population increase of 201.8% during the 1910s, it became the country's fastest-growing city. Three major civil unrest events took place during the riot of 1900, rubber strike of 1936, and the Wooster Avenue riots of 1968. Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois (1920) and President Bill Clinton (1997) gave speeches on race relations in the city. While visiting during August 1914, Marcus Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). [...] In 1971, James R. Williams founded Alpha Phi Alpha Homes Inc. to build the Channelwood Village area of Akron. In 2008, 91-year-old resident, Addie Polk became the poster child of the financial crisis of 2007-2010 after shooting herself moments before law enforcement were going to remove her from the foreclosed house. During a 2016 march on West Market Street, purple heart Vietnam War veteran, Kenn Gilchrist set himself on fire in protest of Donald Trump's presidential election victory.|$|R
50|$|Wrecked in 1656 {{south of}} Ledge Point, Western Australia, the Vergulde Draeck (or Gilt Dragon, {{as it is}} more {{commonly}} known) {{was the first to}} be relocated during the 1950-1960s. However, Alan Robinson, who claimed to have discovered the vessel, could not remember where the wreck was originally located. Artefacts were then collected on 14 April 1963 when a spear fishing group stumbled across them. James, Alan, Graeme Henderson, and John Cowan, members of the spear fishing group that discovered site, offered their rights to the site to the WAM. However the last member of the group, Alan Robinson, did not. WAM accepted the rights. However, looters used explosives to breach the vessel and search for valuable artefacts, mainly coins. Due to looting, the nature of the seabed and occasional severe storms, the site is spread over a 40x50 m area on a reef and is very difficult to locate. Jeremy Green and staff from WAM recovered artefacts from the wreck in archaeological seasons between 1972 and 1983. The ANCODS collection currently includes large numbers of ballast bricks, clay <b>pipes,</b> <b>stoneware,</b> wooden and metal fragments as well as elephant tusks, leather shoes and coin-, eight hundred of which are in the custody of the Money Museum in Utrecht.|$|R
