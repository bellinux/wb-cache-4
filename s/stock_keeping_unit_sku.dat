A systematic procedure based on the application of different patterns has been developed and illustrated.

The typical approach utilized in practice, and suggested in academic textbooks, is to set the individual service levels equal to the targeted performance required across an entire stock base or a certain class of SKUs (e. g., in ABC classification). In this paper it is argued that this approach is far from optimal and a simple methodology is proposed that is shown (on real life datasets) to be associated with reductions in stock investments.

40|$|This paper investigates <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>SKU)</b> {{proliferation}} {{and its impact}} on a health care supply chain. There are two types of proliferation: acceptance and adoption. The acceptance case occurs when a hospital requests a SKU and the SKU is not carried by the system. The adoption case occurs when the SKU is not carried by the requesting hospital, but is carried by some other hospital within the system. A multi-item, multi-echelon supply chain model with load building and delivery de-tails was constructed to examine cost and performance tradeoffs. Object-oriented modeling and implementation techniques for the SKU proliferation simulation are described. The results indicate that the acceptance and adoption jointly affect the performance of the supply chain in terms of the service level (demand fill rate) and the cost. The models and results provide a test bed for addressing and mitigating the effect of proliferation within healthcare supply chains. ...|$|E

It is quite common for companies with exceptional inventory accuracy to use a technique called cycle counting. For many organizations, the time and resources to complete cycle counting are limited or not available. In this work, we promote statistical process control (SPC) to monitor inventory accuracy. Specifically, we model the complex underlying environments with mixture distributions to demonstrate sampling from a mixed but stationary process. For our particular application, we concern ourselves with data that result from inventory adjustments at the <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>SKU)</b> level when a given SKU {{is found to be}} inaccurate.

40|$|Segmenting large supply chains into {{lean and}} agile {{segments}} {{has become a}} powerful strategy allowing companies to manage different market demands effectively. A current stream of research into supply chain segmentation proposes demand volume and variability as the key segmentation criteria. This literature adequately justifies these criteria and analyses the benefits of segmentation. However, current work fails to provide approaches for allocating products to segments which go beyond simple rules of thumb, such as 80 - 20 Pareto rules. We propose a joint network and safety stock optimisation model which optimally allocates <b>Stock</b> <b>Keeping</b> <b>Units</b> (<b>SKUs)</b> to segments. We use this model, populated both with synthetic data and data from a real case study and demonstrate that this approach significantly improves cost when compared to using simple rules of thumb alone...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} argues that {{increasing}} the number of private labels products in grocery stores is not always an efficient strategy for a retailer wishing to enhance her unit sales. Although private labels can be effective for providing higher margins or developing customer loyalty program, their increased number of <b>Stock</b> <b>Keeping</b> <b>Unit</b> (<b>SKU)</b> assumes item deletions for other types of brand - especially national brands. For this study, we choose to focus on the composition of the whole brand assortment rather than the competitive advantage of this or that brand type. This paper proposes an econometric approach to this assortment reshaping issue. Using data drawn from a retailer panel (provided by IRI Inc), we construct a Multiple Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) model to investigate the relation between both private label's and national brand's SKU and store-level unit sales. Results are given with respect to store size. We find that only in biggest stores higher levels of private labels leads to enhanced sales...|$|E

40|$|Forecasting at the <b>Stock</b> <b>Keeping</b> <b>Unit</b> (<b>SKU)</b> disaggregate {{level in}} order to support {{operations}} management has proved a very difficult task. The levels of accuracy achieved have major consequences for companies at all levels in the supply chain; errors at each stage are amplified resulting in poor service and overly high inventory levels. In most companies, the size and complexity of the forecasting task necessitates the use of Forecasting Support Systems (FSS). The present study examines monthly demand data and forecasts for 44 fast moving, A-class, durable SKUs, collected from a major U. K. supplier. The company relies upon a FSS to produce baseline forecasts per SKU for each period. Final forecasts are produced at a later stage through the superimposition of judgments based on marketing intelligence gathered by the company forecasters. The benefits of the intervention are evaluated by comparing the actual sales both to system and final forecasts. The findings support the case that adjustments do improve accuracy, particularly under the condition that the adjustment is conservative, in the right direction, but does not overshoot. The question is how best to meet these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The food {{processing}} and packaging industries worldwide are constantly investigating and researching options to introduce cost effective solutions for plant and equipment. The {{introduction of new}} technology to create productivity gains is a very attractive proposition to company stakeholders, especially if the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is attractive.

This paper analyses current availability and costs of available machinery versus {{the cost of the}} new proposed technology. Total costs of the plant and equipment, including manufacture, operations, quality, maintenance and servicing costs are discussed. An increase in quality using this technology helps the food product company to market its brand as sound product with good ethics behind the brand.

We generalize the CLR problem by allowing each entity {{to have more than}} one observation, and refer to it as generalized CLR. We propose an exact mathematical programming based approach relying on column generation, a column generation based heuristic algorithm that clusters predefined groups of entities, a metaheuristic genetic algorithm with adapted Lloyd's algorithm for K-means clustering, a two-stage approach, and a modified algorithm of Späth Spath 1979 for solving generalized CLR. We examine the performance of our algorithms on a <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (<b>SKU)</b> clustering problem employed in forecasting halo and cannibalization effects in promotions using real-world retail data from a large supermarket chain. In the SKU clustering problem, the retailer needs to cluster SKUs based on their seasonal effects in response to promotions.

The standard approach in ABC applications is to set the same service level for all <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>units</b> (<b>SKUs)</b> in a class. In this paper, we show (for three large real life datasets) that the application of both demand value and demand volume as ABC ranking criteria, with fixed service levels per class, leads to solutions that are far from cost optimal. An alternative criterion proposed by Zhang et al. performs much better, but is still considerably outperformed by a new criterion proposed in this paper. The new criterion is also more general in that it can take criticality of SKUs into account.

For that reason, this paper’s core proposal is to investigate the relation between distribution and market share variables in the Brazilian market, specifically in the beverage sector, comparing two important types of consumer market channels: big and small supermarkets. For such, an empirical study was conducted based on a database with more than 180 <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>units</b> (<b>SKUs)</b> sold by three manufacturers in the southeast of Brazil.
