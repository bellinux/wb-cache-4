Recording details can be found in Pouzat, Mazor and Laurent (2002) Using noise signature to optimize spike-sorting and to assess neuronal classification quality. Journal of Neuroscience Methods 122 : 43 - 57 (a pre-print version is available: [URL] Each data file is subdivided in Groups corresponding the type of acquisition performed: one or several epochs of spontaneous activity recording; repetitive stimulation with a given odor. Each group is made of one (if say a single epoch <b>of</b> 60 <b>seconds</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous recording was made) or several (if say 100 stimulation with Citral were made) (sub-) groups containing the data of all the channels that were recorded during that epoch. Each of these sub-groups is made of 4 to 16 data sets: 1 dimensional arrays containing the raw data recorded from one of the 16 channels of our probe (made of 4 tetrodes) during a single acquisition epoch. All channels were sampled at 15 kHz. Each data file has attributes (metadata) README and LabBook. The first, README contains a shortened version of the present text; the second, LabBook contains a transcript of the lab book corresponding to the experiment. Most groups have a log_file_content attribute. This attribute contains a copy a text file that was automatically generated during data acquisition. Some recording details can be found there as well as the precise time and data of each recorded epoch. The data were kept for 14 years on CDs and {{about a third of the}} recordings got lost because of CD corruption! What's left still make 15 GBytes of data after compression: a substantial amount. This CD corruption explains why some groups don't have a log_file_content attribute: it was on a corrupted CD. Of the 14 experiments, 12 contain antennal lobe (the first olfactory relay of insects) recordings, 1 contains antennal lobe and alpha lobe recordings and 1 contains only alpha lobe recordings. Here the alpha lobe location should be taken with a little bit of caution since the latter is not as easy to locate as the antennal lobe in the locust.
