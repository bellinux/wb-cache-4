The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value.

These problems include radiation and scattering from isolated circular patches, mutual coupling between circular patches and input impedance of circular patches in the infinite array environment.

Initially, the probe feed is modeled as a short electric line current which excites current on the patch. This idealized probe feed model approach ignores the probe <b>self-impedance</b> as well as the rapidly-varying patch current {{in the vicinity of the}} feed connection point.

A simplified PDN design approach with power-ground planes was proposed to overcome resonance challenges from (a) added parasitic inductance in the lateral {{power delivery}} path from the printed wiring board (PWB), due to die placement on the bottom side of the interposer, and (b) the low-loss property of the glass substrate.

Differential circuit topology is proliferating throughout design laboratories {{with the goal of}} enhancing the data carrying capable of the physical layer. Simple impedance and delay measurements of copper transmission lines on backplanes are not sufficient to ensure accurate analysis of gigabit interconnects. The challenge to push design rules to the limit now requires the use of concurrent time and frequency domain measurements. This paper will discuss methods to achieve proper measurement techniques using a time domain reflectometer (TDR) oscilloscope and vector network analyzer (VNA) to assure accurate models are produced for simulation. Error correction techniques will be discussed for both time domain and frequency domain instrumentation. It will be demonstrated that accurate 4 -port frequency dependent models can closely simulate performance of a differential channel. Signal Integrity Challenges With the increase in speed of digital system design into the gigahertz region, frequency dependent effects become a more prominent challenge than in the past. Yesterday’s interconnects could be easily characterized by measuring the <b>self-impedance</b> and propagation delay of the single-ended transmission line. This was true for printed circuit board stripline, microstrip, backplanes, cables and connectors. However, the proliferation of high-speed serial data formats in today’s digital standards demand differential circuit topology.

40|$|Multiple-InputMultiple-Output (MIMO) systems promise higher {{data rates}} and {{better quality of}} service for {{wireless}} communications, by using multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver. However, applying MIMO technology at small portable wireless devices is faced {{with the problem of}} mutual coupling between antenna elements due to the limited space to put multiple antennas. It is shown in the literature that the mutual coupling degrades the MIMO performance. For a given channel matrix and a known mutual coupling model, using antenna impedance matching network(s) between the coupled antenna array and its load or source network is proposed by recent studies to counteract the mutual coupling effects and maximise the MIMO performance. There are two issues with the existing matching techniques. First, they employ a model based on open-circuit voltages that separates the channel matrix and the mutual coupling model. This model is not valid except for a limited types of antennas (e. g. half-wavelength dipoles). Secondly, there is no solution among existing approaches that are capable of adapting to variations of the channel matrix. This thesis focuses on the mutual coupling problem at the receiver. We first examine the most common approaches to model the mutual coupling. For instance, we compare various definitions of coupling matrix available in the literature, analyse their relationship and clarify when we can use them. The mutual coupling effects on MIMO performance metrics and impedance matching are also investigated using the conventional open-circuit voltage based model and a new method called receiving mutual impedances. Then we propose the idea of having an adaptive uncoupled impedance matching technique which tunes the antenna impedance loads to compensate the effects of the propagation channel and mutual coupling together by directly dealing with the received signals. The mutual coupling model is unknown, but it is included implicitly by using the voltages across the real parts of the antenna load impedances to estimate the total effects. Assuming identical impedance loads for all receive antennas, several optimisation techniques such as Gradient-based, Newton-Raphson, and random search methods are investigated to implement such an adaptive impedance match. We found the random search method to be a simple and robust solution in comparison to other approaches. Finally, we extend this adaptive matching technique to non-identical termination case, in which all load impedances are tuned individually. The performance of the adaptive matching networks are compared with the conventional termination scenarios such as: characteristic impedance match, and <b>self-impedance</b> conjugate match. Simulation results for a 3 × 3 MIMO system under different propagation scenarios show that both identical and non-identical adaptive impedance matching networks are capable of optimising the performance in the presence of strong mutual coupling and time variations of the channel. The adaptive non-identical match gives a significant improvement in the mean capacity (more than 20...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{two aspects of}} {{research}} interest: moment method analysis of antennas on cylindrical structures by using G 2 DMULT, and design of hat fed reflector antennas. Both of them are two-dimensional (2 D) structure problems, one being cylindrical and the other rotationally symmetric. Many antennas consist of three-dimensional (3 D) elements, such as dipoles, slots or patches, {{in the vicinity of}} 2 D structures, such as cylinders of arbitrary cross section or rotationally symmetric bodies. When dealing with these electromagnetic problems, it is very efficient to find the radiation characteristics of the 3 D elements and the mutual couplings between them by using a spectrum of 2 D solutions (S 2 DS). We refer to the 3 D elements as excitation elements, as they determine the spectral variation of the solutions. G 2 DMULT is a general algorithm based on the S 2 DS technique. The associated FORTRAN program G 2 DMULT calculates the spectral Green's functions of 2 D MULTiregion structures by using the method of moment (MoM). In this thesis the implementation and applications of G 2 DMULT for cylindrical multiregion structures are presented. The spectral electric and magnetic field integral equations (EFIE and MFIE) and their moment method solution formulations are derived. In order to speed up the convergence and increase the accuracy, three pulse-approximated triangular basis and test functions are implemented in G 2 DMULT. The boundary conditions at different material interfaces are treated carefully. The <b>self-impedance</b> and the radiation efficiency of a dipole near a lossy dielectric cylinder with arbitrary cross section are calculated and verified against measurements. As applications of G 2 DMULT, base station antennas such as Allgon's Metro-III antenna have been analyzed. Several other application cases, including the scattering from dielectric coated cylinders, are also simulated and compared with simulations and measurements done by others. The other type of 2 D structures - the rotationally symmetric structures, also referred to as bodies of revolution (BOR) - has not yet been implemented in G 2 DMULT. Therefore, a commercial code called V 2 D based on the FDTD method was chosen as an analysis tool. The hat-fed reflector antenna is a BOR structure consisting of a rotationally symmetric and almost-parabolic reflector and a waveguide-fed rear-radiating feed, referred to as the hat feed. This thesis presents the procedure of designing hat-fed reflector antennas. This was applied in two industrial projects, to design millimeter wave radio link antennas for Ericsson Microwave System AB (EMW) and a level gauging antenna for Saab Marine Electronics AB (SME). In such designs it is important to locate the feed correctly relative to the reflector. The location is determined by the phase center of the feed, which for the hat feed is ring shaped. Therefore, we derived a formula to calculate the location of the ring-shaped phase center of feeds which radiate around a support tube such as the hat feed. The aperture efficiency can be improved up to 0. 5 dB by using this formula. Primary-fed reflectors of these types are often provided with a vertex plate to reduce the return loss of the feed. In order to reduce the effect of the vertex plate on the far-out sidelobes, a new type of vertex plate with Gaussian thickness profile is introduced and the formula to determine the dimensions of this vertex plate is derived. A new version of the hat feed, the Chinese hat feed, is also presented in this thesis. The Chinese hat feed provides an opportunity to control the beamwidth of the radiation pattern that makes it suitable for use in a shallow reflector. A hybrid method, which combines the MoM program G 1 DMULT with the V 2 D code, is used to analyze the increased sidelobes due to scattering from screw heads in reflector antennas. Several ways to reduce this scattering are presented...|$|E
