6000|$|And now, by {{glancing back}} to Plate X. Vol. II, {{the reader will}} see in a moment the kind of {{evidence}} which is found of the date of capitals in their profiles merely. Observe: {{we have seen that}} the treatment of the leaves in the Madonnetta House seemed [...] "indicative of a tendency to transition." [...] Note their profile, 1a, and its close correspondence with 1 h, which is actually of a transitional capital from the upper arcade of second order windows in the Apostoli Palace; yet both shown to be very close to the Byzantine period, if not belonging to it, by their fellowship with the profile i, from the Fondaco de' Turchi. Then note the close correspondence of all the other profiles in that line, which belong to the concave capitals or plinths of the Byzantine palaces, and note their composition, the abacus being, in idea, merely an echo or reduplication of the capital itself; as seen in perfect simplicity in the profile f, which is a roll under a tall concave curve forming the bell of the capital, with a roll and short concave curve for its abacus. This peculiar abacus is an unfailing test of early date; and our finding this <b>simple</b> <b>profile</b> used for the Ducal Palace (f), is strongly confirmatory of all our former conclusions.|$|E

Looking back, the upper traceries of the {{magnificent}} apse are seen towering above the irregular roofs and chimneys of the little square; and our lost Prout was enabled to bring the whole subject into an exquisitely picturesque composition, by the fortunate occurrence of four quaint trefoiled windows in one of the houses on the right. Those trefoils are among the most ancient efforts of Gothic art in Venice. I have given a rude sketch of them in Fig. XXXIII. They are built entirely of brick, except the central shaft and capital, which are of Istrian stone. Their structure is the simplest possible; the trefoils being cut out of the radiating bricks which form the pointed arch, and the edge or upper limit of that pointed arch indicated by a roll moulding formed of cast bricks, in length of about a foot, and ground at the bottom so as to meet in one, as in Fig. XXXIV. The capital of the shaft is one of the earliest transitional forms;[89] and observe the curious following out, even in this minor instance, of the great law of centralization above explained with respect to the Byzantine palaces. There is a central shaft, a pilaster on each side, and then the wall. The pilaster has, by way of capital, a square flat brick, projecting a little, and cast, at the edge, into the form of the first type of all cornices (a, p. 63, Vol. I.; the reader ought to glance back at this passage, if he has forgotten it); and the shafts and pilasters all stand, without any added bases, on a projecting plinth of the same <b>simple</b> <b>profile.</b> These windows have been much defaced; but I have not the least doubt that their plinths are the original ones: and the whole group {{is one of the most}} valuable in Venice, as showing the way in which the humblest houses, in the noble times, followed out the system of the larger palaces, as far as they could, in their rude materials. It is not often that the dwellings of the lower orders are preserved to us from the thirteenth century.|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{studies using}} well-logging, refraction, and {{reflection}} methods {{were carried out}} in 1965 {{in conjunction with a}} core-sample drilling project in the Ewa Coastal Plain, Oahu, Hawaii. The seismic well-logging technique gave a complicated velocity-depth profile, with higher velocities associated with reef limestone and lower velocities associated with mud deposits. The seismic refraction method showed a <b>simpler</b> velocity-depth <b>profile</b> with only a few distinct layers. The seismic reflection method corroborated the <b>simpler</b> <b>profile</b> obtained with the refraction method. The two profiles were reconciled, as the complicated profile can be averaged out into the <b>simpler</b> <b>profile.</b> The averaging-out process {{can be applied to the}} whole sedimentary column so that a P-wave velocity value may represent the sedimentary layer at any given locality. However, no single value can be assigned as typical for sedimentary layers for the entire Hawaiian area. The velocity values depend upon the composition of the layer, which is made up of varying proportions of mud, reef limestone, and weathered basalt. Layer 2 of the oceanic crust in the Hawaiian area has a rather uniform character, with seismic velocities ranging from 4. 8 to 5. 1 km/sec, and thicknesses from 4 to 8 km...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{studies on}} linear shear instabilities often use simple {{velocity}} and density profiles (e. g. constant, piecewise) for obtaining good {{qualitative and quantitative}} predictions of the initial disturbances. Furthermore, such <b>simple</b> <b>profiles</b> provide a minimal model for obtaining a mechanistic understanding of otherwise elusive shear instabilities. However, except a few specific cases, the efficacy of <b>simple</b> <b>profiles</b> has remained limited to the linear stability paradigm. In this work we have proposed a general framework that can simulate the fully nonlinear evolution {{of a variety of}} stratified shear instabilities as well as wave-wave and wave-topography interaction problems having <b>simple</b> <b>profiles.</b> To this effect, we have modified the classical vortex method by extending the Birkhoff-Rott equation to multiple interfaces, and furthermore, have incorporated background shear across a density interface. The latter is more subtle, and originates from the understanding that Bernoulli's equation is not just limited to irrotational flows, but can be modified to make it applicable for piecewise velocity profiles. We have solved diverse problems that can be essentially reduced to the multiple interacting interfaces paradigm, e. g. spilling and plunging breakers, stratified shear instabilities like Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield, jet flows, and even wave-topography interaction problem like Bragg resonance. Free-slip boundary being a vortex sheet, its effect can also be effectively captured using vortex method. We found that the minimal models capture key nonlinear features, e. g. wave breaking features like cusp formation and roll-ups, which are observed in experiments and/or extensive simulations with smooth, realistic profiles...|$|R

Thus, the <b>simple</b> linear <b>profile</b> gauge studies can be considered as a two-response (slope and intercept) problem.
