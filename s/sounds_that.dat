5|$|Sinhala {{alphabet}} {{differs from}} other Indo-Aryan alphabets {{in that it}} contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it. These are the two vowel <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> {{are similar to the}} two vowel <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> occur {{at the beginning of the}} English words at (ඇ) and ant (ඈ).|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{represent}} {{the sounds of the}} world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the International Phonetic Alphabet, designed to represent all of the discrete <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. <b>Sounds</b> <b>that</b> would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
50|$|Speed metal's sound {{varied between}} various {{regional}} scenes. European bands leaned towards {{the sound of}} bands like Venom and Motörhead. Japanese bands had a more melodic <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> resembled power metal. North American bands had a faster, more aggressive <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> would later influence the thrash metal movement.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Gestalt {{principle}} of good continuation (see: principles of grouping), <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> changes smoothly or remain constant are often {{produced by the}} same source. Sound with the same frequency, even when interrupted by other noise, is perceived as continuous. Highly variable <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> is interrupted is perceived as separate.|$|R
50|$|The band are {{considered}} one of the three biggest Teutonic thrash metal acts, the other two being Kreator and Destruction. While the other two bands developed a <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> has influenced death metal, Sodom created a <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> has influenced many black metal bands that formed in the late 1980s and the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Ethnic Cleansing was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> would {{be perceived as}} musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of other methods to reduce {{mosquito}} bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations. Electronic mosquito repellent devices which make very high-frequency <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, do not have supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Gustavo Santaolalla {{kicked off}} his solo career in 1982 with his debut album Santaolalla, which once again proved he {{was ahead of}} the curve. The album {{featured}} a <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> was far more lively, rocking, and frivolous, which predicted the New Democracy <b>Sound</b> <b>that</b> would explode in 1983 and 1984 and eventually lead to the Argentine Invasion overseas.|$|R
5000|$|A vowel sound whose quality {{does not}} change over the {{duration}} of the vowel is called a monophthong. Monophthongs are sometimes called [...] "pure" [...] or [...] "stable" [...] vowels. A vowel <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> glides from one quality to another is called a diphthong, and a vowel <b>sound</b> <b>that</b> glides successively through three qualities is a triphthong.|$|R

5|$|By the Early Dynastic Period in {{the late}} 4th {{millennium}} BC, Egyptian hieroglyphs and their cursive form hieratic were well-established written scripts. Egyptian hieroglyphs are small artistic pictures of natural objects. For example, the hieroglyph for door-bolt, pronounced se, produced the s sound; when this hieroglyph was combined with another or multiple hieroglyphs, it produced a combination of <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> could represent abstract concepts like sorrow, happiness, beauty, and evil. The Narmer Palette, dated c. 3100 BC during the last phase of Predynastic Egypt, combines the hieroglyphs for catfish and chisel to produce the name of King Narmer.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Emeka Ogboh (born 1977) is a Nigerian {{sound and}} {{installation}} artist {{best known for}} his soundscapes of life in Lagos. Trained as an artist, he began working with <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> characterize cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. He presents unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones and speakers. His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen Böttcherstraße Art Award. His work has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, American National Museum of African Art, Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.|$|E

5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E
5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of {{blue and}} fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept {{infrasonic}} pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> most humans can hear falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected {{hundreds of miles from}} their source.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Planula larvae exhibit {{positive}} phototaxis, swimming towards {{light to}} reach surface waters, where they drift and grow before descending {{to seek a}} hard surface to which they can attach and begin a new colony. They also exhibit positive sonotaxis, moving towards <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> emanate from the reef and away from open water. High failure rates afflict many stages of this process, and even though millions of gametes are released by each colony, few new colonies form. The time from spawning to settling is usually two to three days, but can be up to two months. The larva grows into a polyp and eventually becomes a coral head by asexual budding and growth.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{related to}} {{vocabulary}} development show that children's language competence depends upon {{their ability to}} hear sounds during infancy. Infants' perception of speech is distinct. Between six and ten months of age, infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world. By 10 to 12 months, infants can no longer discriminate between speech <b>sounds</b> <b>that</b> are not used in the language(s) {{to which they are}} exposed. Among six-month-old infants, seen articulations (i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds, and may also contribute to infants' ability to learn phonemic boundaries. Infants' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years.|$|E
