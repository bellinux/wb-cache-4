The women see Belvile, Blunt, and Frederick approach, but the fact that Willmore is not with them causes the women to hide and to eavesdrop on the men. Belvile, Blunt and Frederick have come to retrieve Willmore from Angellica because he has been inside with her for two hours.

25|$|While {{reading the}} book Paul gave her, Connie finds his phone number inside. Connie calls Paul from Grand Central Station for his address, but he invites her over for coffee instead. Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is thrilled by the sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{had begun}} writing [...] "World of Stone", [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] and the soul-pop love song [...] "Can't <b>Stop</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> You" [...] in 1973. He started [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)" [...] in Hawaii over Christmas 1974, while holidaying {{with his new}} girlfriend (later his wife), Olivia Arias, a {{secretary}} at Dark Horse's LA office. The song is a sequel to Harrison's popular Beatles track [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", and the lyrics serve as a rebuttal to his critics, particularly Rolling Stone, whose savaging of the tour he would never forgive.|$|E

That day, {{instruments}} {{were added to}} the 1971 basic track for [...] "You", including a saxophone solo (played by Horn), extra keyboards and a second drum part. Over 2–3 June, Scott and Findley overdubbed horns on [...] "Ooh Baby" [...] and [...] "His Name Is Legs".

Thomas began creating a vague idea of bass and AM/FM radio improvisations. The improvisations/compositions are based on radio art. Some of the bass and radio improvisations/compositions can be heard on his album entitled, Introspection of PolyNeon.

Lee and Columbia wanted Thompson herself, now a [...] "big-deal movie star" [...] after her critically successful {{role in the}} 1992 film Howards End, to play Elinor. The actress replied that {{at the age of}} thirty-five, she was too old for the nineteen-year-old character. Lee suggested Elinor's age be changed to twenty-seven, which would also have made the difficult reality of spinsterhood easier for modern audiences to understand. Thompson agreed, later stating that she was [...] "desperate to get into a corset and act it and <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it as a script." ...|$|E

[...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally.

Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found that she did not contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would be going through everything together".|$|E

When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst for advice.

In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.|$|E
500|$|The song {{served as}} both the opener for Extra Texture as well as, {{in the form of}} a 45-second {{instrumental}} portion titled [...] "A Bit More of You", the first track on side two of the original LP. Harrison biographer Dale Allison dismisses this reprise with the words [...] "It's filler", while Leng suggests its purpose was to [...] "fashion a soul mood" [...] for the song that follows, the pop-soul ballad [...] "Can't <b>Stop</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> You". The full version of [...] "You" [...] appears on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as one of only six selections from Harrison's solo career up to the end of 1975.

[...] In school, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in Kingston, Ontario, where he often played bass.

[...] Even Harrison's loyal [...] "disciples", Schaffner continued, tended to view the album as [...] "plodding and aimless". Rolling Stones reviewer, Dave Marsh, highlighted [...] "You" [...] as a return to All Things Must Pass-style grandeur, and [...] "Can't <b>Stop</b> <b>Thinking</b> <b>About</b> You" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as [...] "the most effective nine minutes of music" [...] the artist had made since 1970. Generally, on an album that was [...] "sketchy at best", however, Marsh bemoaned the over-reliance on [...] "merely competent" [...] keyboards and Harrison's [...] "affectingly feeble voice", before concluding: [...] "Harrison {{is no longer a}} Beatle, as he has reminded us more than we have asked. But if he learned nothing else from his experience in that organization, it ought to have been that a good guitar player isn't worth much without a band." ...|$|E

So after that, we came home and wrote about 20 songs." [...] Ashworth described Dempsey's guitar work: [...] "Paul was a really percussive guitarist: he's a drummer, first and foremost and he actually taught Clint to play the drums. So he comes from playing the guitar from a really percussive perspective; from a very Fugazi-type of world, creating every aspect of a song on the guitar instead of just melodies." ...|$|R

500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item".

Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t <b>stop</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it.
