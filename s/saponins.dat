Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous.

Herein we investigated the effect of <b>saponin</b> 1 in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) U 251 MG and U 87 MG cells. <b>Saponin</b> 1 induced significant growth inhibition in both glioblastoma cell lines, with a 50 % inhibitory concentration at 24 h of 7. 4 µg/ml in U 251 MG cells and 8. 6 µg/ml in U 87 MG cells, respectively. Nuclear fluorescent staining and electron microscopy showed that <b>saponin</b> 1 caused characteristic apoptotic morphological changes in the GBM cell lines. <b>Saponin</b> 1 -induced apoptosis was also verified by DNA ladder electrophoresis and flow cytometry. Additionally, immunocytochemistry and western blotting analyses revealed a time-dependent decrease in the expression and nuclear location of NF-κB following <b>saponin</b> 1 treatment. Western blotting data indicated a significant decreased expression of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family members,(e. g., survivin and XIAP) by <b>saponin</b> 1.

After the cooking, the <b>saponins</b> in the soup of taro stems and leaves reduce to the level the trained hogs can eat. Nowadays, this practice is no longer widely popular in Vietnam agriculture. These taro plants are commonly called as khoai ngứa which literally means itchy potato.|$|E
50|$|Starfish are characterised {{by having}} <b>saponins</b> known as asterosaponins in their tissues. They contain {{a mix of}} these <b>saponins,</b> and at least 15 {{chemical}} {{studies have been conducted}} seeking to characterise these <b>saponins.</b> The <b>saponins</b> have detergent-like properties, and keeping starfish in limited water volumes with aeration results in large amounts of foam at the surface.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the mechanism underlying the hypolipidemic action of karaya <b>saponin</b> or Rhodobacter (R.) capsulatus. A total of 40 laying hens (20 -week-old) were assigned into four dietary treatment groups and fed a basal diet (as a control) or basal diets supplemented with either karaya <b>saponin,</b> R. capsulatus, or both for 60 days. The level of serum low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the serum, liver, and egg yolk were reduced by all the supplementations (<. 05). Liver bile acid concentration and fecal concentrations of cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and bile acid were simultaneously increased by the supplementation of karaya <b>saponin,</b> R. capsulatus, and the combination of karaya <b>saponin</b> and R. capsulatus (<. 05). The supplementation of karaya <b>saponin,</b> R. capsulatus, and the combination of karaya <b>saponin</b> and R. capsulatus suppressed the incorporation of 14 C from 1 - 14 C-palmitic acid into the fractions of total lipids, phospholipids, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol in the liver in vitro (<. 05). These findings suggest that the hypocholesterolemic effects of karaya <b>saponin</b> and R. capsulatus are caused by the suppression of the cholesterol synthesis and the promotion of cholesterol catabolism in the liver...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>saponin</b> from Ginseng Radix rubra on {{extracellular}} matrix metabolism, the activation and synthesis of TGF-β 1, and the modification of TGF-β receptor in fibroblasts were examined to elucidate {{the contribution of}} the TGF-β pathway to the mechanism of wound healing by <b>saponin.</b> Fibronectin synthesis was analysed by the immunoprecipitation method. Activation and synthesis of TGF-β 1 were measured by ELISA. The expressions of TGF-β receptors in fibroblasts were examined at protein and mRNA levels by the cross-linking method and Northern blot analysis, respectively. The fibronectin synthesis increased 2. 3 - and 3. 9 -fold at fibroblasts treated with 1 and 10 [*]μg[*]ml− 1 of <b>saponin,</b> respectively, compared with that in non-treated cells. Fibronectin synthesis stimulated with 10 [*]μg[*]ml− 1 of <b>saponin</b> was inhibited with 69 % by 5 [*]μg[*]ml− 1 of an anti-TGF-β 1 antibody. mRNA of TGF-β type I receptor increased 4. 8 - and 4. 4 -fold at fibroblasts treated with 1 and 10 [*]μg[*]ml− 1 of <b>saponin,</b> respectively, and that of TGF-β type II receptor also increased 3. 4 - and 3. 2 -fold at fibroblasts treated with 1 and 10 [*]μg[*]ml− 1 of <b>saponin,</b> respectively. The significant increases of TGF-β type I and II receptors and of fibronectin synthesis were observed at the same concentrations of <b>saponin.</b> TGF-β 1 content increased 1. 74 - and 1. 87 -fold at conditioned medium of fibroblasts treated with 100 and 250 [*]μg[*]ml− 1 of <b>saponin,</b> respectively, higher concentrations than those which accelerated fibronectin synthesis. Furthermore, the active TGF-β 1 content was below 10 % of total TGF-β 1 at each concentration of <b>saponin.</b> These results indicate that <b>saponin</b> stimulates fibronectin synthesis through the changes of TGF-β receptor expressions in fibroblasts...|$|R
50|$|<b>Saponin</b> {{extraction}} can {{be executed}} in many ways. One {{of the most}} common soapberry processing method begins by crushing the berries, then soaking them in water, followed by treating the soapberry liquid with an aerated floating process which produces bubbles. Finally, the bubbles may be collected and left to set to form <b>saponin</b> extract. This <b>saponin</b> extract can then be used for many additional purposes.|$|R
