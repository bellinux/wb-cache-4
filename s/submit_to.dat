5|$|Although Alcuin had scorn for Æthelhard for fleeing Canterbury, {{the papacy}} saw it differently. Pope Leo III praised Æthelhard for fleeing {{and refusing to}} <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> Eadberht, whom Leo {{compared}} to the later Roman emperor Julian the Apostate. There are indications, though, that the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while Æthelhard was in exile.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{measurements}} of contrast sensitivity {{at a distance}} in patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> penetrating keratoplasty versus patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty for keratoconus treatment. METHODS: Contrast sensitivity of 15 subjects <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> penetrating keratoplasty and 15 subjects <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty have been analyzed through the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (F.

CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity was similar among the subjects <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> penetrating keratoplasty and to deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty for keratoconus treatment...|$|R

5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.

5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to <b>submit</b> <b>to</b> testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} results between {{recession}} of the lateral recti and monocular recess-resect procedure for the correction {{of the basic}} type of intermittent exotropia. METHODS: 115 patients with intermittent exotropia were <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> surgery. The patients were divided into 4 groups, according to the magnitude of preoperative deviation and the surgical procedure was subsequently performed. Well compensated orthophoria or exo-or esophoria were considered surgical success, with minimum of 1 year follow-up after the operation. RESULTS: Success was obtained in 69 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> recession of the lateral recti, and in 77 % <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> monocular recess-resect. In the groups with deviations between 12 PD and 25 PD, surgical success was observed in 74 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> recession of the lateral recti and in 78 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> monocular recess-resect. (p= 0. 564). In the group with deviations between 26 PD and 35 PD, surgical success was observed in 65 % out of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> recession of the lateral recti and in 75 % of the patients <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> monocular recess-resect.

CONCLUSION: recession of lateral recti and monocular recess-resect were equally effective in correcting basic type intermittent exotropia according to its preoperative deviation in primary position...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the dimensional changes of denture bases made from different resins after different storage periods. For this purpose, 25 sets of plaster models/resin bases were prepared using 4 acrylic resins <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> two types of polymerization: 1 - QC- 20 <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> polymerization by microwave energy; 2 - QC- 20 <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> polymerization by water hot bath; 3 - Vipi Cril <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> polymerization by water hot bath; 4 - Vipi Wave <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> polymerization by microwave energy; and 5 - Onda Cryl <b>submitted</b> <b>to</b> polymerization by microwave energy.
