40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the suitability of packaging aspirin tablets in one thousand tablet packs that require reclosure after dispensing each dose. The reclosure efficiency of the push-fit type closure of a plastic container in preventing moisture entry was determined and compared to a control container. Aspirin tablets used in this study were shown to be susceptible to moisture degradation leading to significant losses of potency (p 0. 05). It can, therefore, be concluded that the proper use of push-fit closures on containers for packaging aspirin tablets provides effective protection and the use of more expensive single unit <b>strip</b> <b>packaging,</b> for example, is therefore not necessary...|$|R

30|$|Manufacturing and {{production}} industries very often {{come across the}} problem where a given stock material must be cut into a smaller set of shapes. In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional orthogonal rectangular strip packing problem (SPP) NP-hard in nature (Garey and Johnson 1979; Bortfeldt 2013). This class of combinatorial optimization finds significant relevance in different domains of operation research. In industries like paper and pulp, wood and textile, the problem is {{to determine how the}} arbitrary rectangular block set would be cut from the available stock. The problem variant like arrangement of articles, reports and advertisement is considered in the newspaper field. In pharmaceutical packing industry, many <b>strip</b> <b>packaging</b> approach seems ideal for high-speed sealing of coated or uncoated tablets, capsules or lozenges of any shape or size in aluminum foils, polythene, cellophane, etc. It is an interesting real-world industrial problem where the objective is to provide the best arrangement with the aim of waste minimization. There are two broad categories of the solution approach, namely exact and inexact. The major bottleneck with the exact approaches are that as the problem size grow and become complex, the computation time also grows exponentially. Thus, the researchers focus more on the inexact approach in comparison to exact.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a metaheuristic algorithm, namely genetic algorithm-based placement approach (GPA) for solving orthogonal <b>strip</b> <b>packaging</b> problem. The approach modifies the complex placement strategies by proposing simple ones, whereas in the genetic algorithm we have modified the stages of initial population generation, crossover and mutation to achieve our objective. The paper presents a novel fitness function to evaluate the design layout, which facilitates {{the selection of a}} best design layout for population evolution. The evolution process of forwarding the best individual to the next generation is maintained by the appropriate selection pressure. In placement approach, we have considered the creation of empty rectangular blocks to place the next rectangular block in a sequence. As the problem grows, the number of such blocks is likely to increase. However, this problem of stacking of empty rectangle, i.e., it controls the growth in number is tackled in our approach by using rectangle merging routines. In comparison to other approaches, the computation task of fitness evaluation for the placed rectangle is effectively reduced. We have designed the fitness function for the overall layout pattern by considering two crucial parameters, height and area utilization factor. The algorithm finds the most optimal solution in numerous cases and results illustrates that it compete well with the existing heuristic and metaheuristic approaches. The experimental result obtained confirms the applicability on large-scale instances.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the impact of}} excipients, {{packaging}} systems and storage conditions on acetylsalicylic acid stability in different 75 mg aspirin tablets, 2 3 and 3 2 full factorial designs were adopted for the development of acetylsalicylic acid chewable and effervescent tablets, respectively. The study revealed that most of excipients have a profound influence in physicochemical behaviors of aspirin tablets. Due to their hygroscopicity, PVP, starch, sodium bicarbonate and sorbitol were shown to affect the hardness, weight variation, friability, free salicylic acid and content percent of aspirin in both chewable tablets and effervescent tablets. Using combination of mannitol and sorbitol in different ratios, as filler in chewable tablets has resulted in lowering the cost of the formulations with enhanced product stability. Both blister and <b>strip</b> <b>packaging</b> systems showed no significant difference (cp ≥ 0. 05) with regard to dosage form protection in case ofchewable tablets where no added moisture protection was observed with PVC blister pack. It has been shown that effervescent tablets manufacturing process involves some critical steps which need to be addressed carefully during formulations and factory design. The conventional aspirin tablets formulated with starch, saccharin sodium and talc where found tohave undesirable physical characteristics. Among the three tablet dosage forms ofaspirin 75 mg, the chewable tablets were found to be the best. From this, one formula was selected, modified by using a combination of mannitol and sorbitol as filler and finally upgraded by the study of the particle size range, powder flow, mixing process and selection of a suitable manufacturing process.

Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study is based on data of sales of glucometer strips to noninstitutionalized persons in Norway in 2008. The data included gender, age group, month of purchase, sales place, type of <b>strips,</b> number of <b>packages</b> dispensed, and cost of strips. Additionally, statistics on sales of insulin and oral antidiabetes medications were obtained from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Results: A total of 96, 999 persons purchased strips, a prevalence of 2 %. Approximately 70 % of diabetes patients practiced SMBG. An average patient used 1. 7 strips per day, and younger patients purchased more strips than older patients. Fewer than 50 % of patients performed glucose measurements daily. One percent of patients used more than 10 strips daily and was accountable for 8 % of total costs. Most patients used only one type of strips, but the number of strips purchased increased with the number of different strips. The average annual cost of strips was 446 € per person. Conclusions: Two percent of all non-institutionalized inhabitants and an estimated 70 % of patients using diabetes medication purchased SMBG strips. A small percentage of the patients incurred a substantial proportion of the costs. This, along with the fact that over half of the patients monitor less than once per day, calls for tighter follow-up of diabetes patients...|$|R

During the electrochemical measurement, the carrier is positioned in or at the sample chamber. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with a gel strip serving as the carrier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{determination of}} the microbiological state of a sample, comprises placing the biological material from the sample on a carrier, positioning the carrier with respect to a sample chamber with two electrodes, setting a specified temperature in the sample chamber and carrying out an electrochemical measurement using the electrodes. During the electrochemical measurement, the carrier is positioned in or at the sample chamber. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with a gel strip serving as the carrier. The positioning of the carrier comprises an insertion of the gel strip into the sample chamber. The insertion of the gel strip takes place in such a manner that the gel strip contacts the two electrodes. The determination further comprises an opening of a sterile packaging of the gel strip before the contacting of the sample with the gel <b>strip.</b> The sterile <b>packaging</b> of the gel strip is opened or partially removed, so that a handling region is covered by a remaining part of the sterile packaging after opening or partial removal of the sterile packaging. The placement of the biological material on the gel strip takes place using the opening in the sterile packaging. The positioning of the gel strip in the sample chamber comprises a positioning the gel strip including a remaining section of the sterile packaging, in such a manner that the gel strip contacts the two electrodes. The positioning of the gel strip takes place in such a manner that the remaining portion of the sterile packaging does not contact the electrodes. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with an adhesive strip or non-woven fiber material serving as a carrier. The positioning of the carrier comprises a positioning of the adhesive strip in the sample chamber. The adhesive strip or the non-woven fiber material is attached to a lid for closing the sample chamber that the adhesive strips or the non-woven fiber material, is after closing positioned within the sample chamber. The determination further comprises a closing step of the sample chamber with the lid, so that the adhesive strip or the non-woven fiber material is positioned within the sample chamber after closing. The placement of the biological material comprises an insertion of a micro-filter serving as the carrier in a gas or liquid flow. The positioning of the carrier comprises a positioning of the micro-filter in the sample chamber. The micro-filter is attached to a lid for closing the sample chamber and partially comprises an area, in which the lid consists of an opening, so that the gas or the liquid flow flows through the opening in the lid through the micro-filter. The determination further comprises the closing step of the opening in the lid and the closing of the sample chamber with the lid, so that the micro-filter is positioned within the sample chamber after closing. The insertion comprises a pumping of the liquid growth medium from a storage tank into the sample chamber. The pumping of the liquid growth medium comprises an exertion of force on an elastic region of the storage tank, so that the liquid growth medium flows into the sample chamber, over a liquid connection with a valve. The pumping of the liquid growth medium comprises the exertion of force on an elastic region of the sample chamber or the lid of the sample chamber, so that the volume of the sample chamber reduces and a fluid present in the closed sample chamber flows out of the chamber. The pumping also comprises a releasing of the stress of the elastic region, so that the volume of the sample chamber increases. The determination further comprises reading of a temperature/time-integration unit to obtain a temperature/time-integral between a point of time before the implementation of the electrochemical measurement and the reading of the temperature/time-integration unit, evaluating the electrochemical measurement to get a quantity or concentration of the biological material at a point of time of the implementation of the electrochemical measurement, and calculating the amount or concentration of the biological material at the point of time before the implementation of the electrochemical measurement, using the temperature/time-integral.
