40|$|Abstract — Recently spatial {{crowdsourcing}} {{was introduced}} {{as a natural}} extension to traditional crowdsourcing allowing for tasks to have a geospatial component, i. e., a task can only be performed if a worker is physically present {{at the location of}} the task. The problem of assigning <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> to workers in a spatial crowdsourcing system can be formulated as a weighted bipartite b-matching graph problem that can be solved optimally by existing methods for the minimum cost maximum flow problem. However, these methods are still too complex to run repeatedly for an online system, especially when the number of incoming workers and tasks increases. Hence, we propose a class of approaches that utilizes an online partitioning method to reduce the problem space across a set of cloud servers to construct independent bipartite graphs and solve the assignment problem in parallel. Our approaches solve the <b>spatial</b> <b>task</b> assignment approximately but competitive to the exact solution. We experimentally verify that our approximate approaches outperform the centralized and MapReduce version of the exact approach with acceptable accuracy and thus suitable for online spatial crowdsourcing at scale.

In this paper, we consider an important spatial crowdsourcing problem, namely reliable diversity-based spatial crowdsourcing (RDB-SC), in which <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> (such as taking videos/photos of a landmark or firework shows, and checking whether or not parking spaces are available) are time-constrained, and workers are moving towards some directions. Our RDB-SC problem is to assign workers to <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> such that the completion reliability and the spatial/temporal diversities of <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> are maximized. We prove that the RDB-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable. Thus, we propose three effective approximation approaches, including greedy, sampling, and divide-and-conquer algorithms. In order to improve the efficiency, we also design an effective cost-model-based index, which can dynamically maintain moving workers and <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> with low cost, and efficiently facilitate the retrieval of RDB-SC answers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches over both real and synthetic data sets. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

This study had two aims: (1) to determine if spatial ability is a learned or inherent facet in learning anatomy and (2) to ascertain if there is any difference in spatial ability between experts and novices in anatomy. Fifty participants were identified: 10 controls, 10 novices, 10 intermediates, and 20 experts. Participants completed four computerized <b>spatial</b> ability <b>tasks,</b> a visual mental rotation <b>task,</b> categorical <b>spatial</b> judgment <b>task,</b> metric <b>spatial</b> <b>task,</b> and an image-scanning task.

40|$|With the {{abundance}} and ubiquity of mobile devices, {{a new class}} of applications, called spatial crowdsourcing, is emerging, which enables <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> (i. e., tasks related to a location) assigned to and performed by human workers. However, one of the major challenges with spatial crowdsourcing is how to verify the validity of the results provided by workers, when the workers are not trusted equally. To tackle this problem, we assume every worker has a reputation score, which states the probability that the worker performs a task correctly. Moreover, we define a confidence level for every <b>spatial</b> <b>task,</b> which states that the answer to the given <b>spatial</b> <b>task</b> is only accepted if its confidence is higher than a certain threshold. Thus, the problem we are trying to solve is to maximize the number of <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> that are assigned to a set of workers while satisfying the confidence levels of those tasks. Note that a unique aspect of our problem is that the optimal assignment of tasks heavily depends on the geographical locations of workers and tasks. This means that every <b>spatial</b> <b>task</b> should be assigned to enough number of workers such that their aggregate reputation satisfies the confidence of the task. Consequently, an exhaustive approach needs to compute the aggregate reputation score (using a typical decision fusion aggregation mechanism, such as voting) for all possible subsets of the workers, which renders the problem complex (we show it is NP-hard). Subsequently, we propose a number of heuristics and utilizing realworld and synthetic data in extensive sets of experiments we show that we can achieve close to optimal performance with the cost of a greedy approach, by exploiting our problem’s unique characteristics...|$|R

40|$|When {{navigating}} large information spaces on mobile devices, {{the small}} size of the display often causes relevant content to shift off-screen, greatly increasing the difficulty of <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks</b> such as planning routes or finding points of interest on a map.

In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of two different Contextual Cues techniques, Wedge (Gustafson et al., 2008) and Scaled Arrows (Burigat et al., 2006), and a classical Overview + Detail visualization that highlights the location of objects of interest in the overview.

We address the hypothesis that slalom-prism walking could interfere specifically with concurrent <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks.</b> Methods: Subjects (16 men, 16 women) sat for 30 s then slalom walked through 5 aligned batons. This exercise was performed with normal vision and with prisms deviating gaze laterally by 15 °. Both conditions were done without any tasks, with a verbal task (matching the sex of male and female names uttered by male and female voices), and a <b>spatial</b> <b>task</b> (matching laterality of the words 'right' and `left' delivered to the right or left ear). Conditions were balanced with instructions to perform rapidly and accurately. Results: Time to walk the slalom was extended by the prisms from 16 s to 33 s, but unaffected by tasks. Slalom increased error rates on the <b>spatial</b> <b>task</b> by 8 % above baseline, but verbal task errors remained unchanged. Prisms did not affect task errors. The rates of processing cognitive task items were slowed by approximately 0. 5 s by slalom and by 1 s slalom walking with prisms. Prisms increased task reaction times by 340 ms during slalom. Contact with the poles occurred when multitasking, with men making three times more contacts than women.

Boys from middle-and high-SES backgrounds outperformed their female counterparts on both <b>spatial</b> <b>tasks,</b> whereas boys and girls from a low-SES group did not differ in their performance level on these tasks.
