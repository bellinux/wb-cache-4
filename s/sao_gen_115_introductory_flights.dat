50|$|When the Romans {{arrived in}} the region, the {{settlement}} was concentrated into two areas. The larger, older and principal agglomeration was situated {{in the area of}} the main church and Rua de Viriato, fortified with a wall and palisade. The second group, in the Bairro de São Ginês, were some small homes constructed on the rocky promintory, which were later appropriated by the Visigoths in order to construct a chapel. The 1st century Roman road and two bridges (the second was destroyed in the 17th century after flooding) connected the outpost of Lorica to the rest of their Lusitanian province.

40|$|International audienceHuman beings {{automatically}} discriminate human {{faces at}} the individual level. Infants aged 3 months implicitly recognise monkey faces, but this capacity disappears as recognition skills mature. Expertise is known to affect recognition capacities for different categories of stimuli that are not even face-like in their configuration. We have explored the capacity of adult experts and nonexperts in primatology to recognise monkey faces in both explicit and implicit recognition tasks. In the explicit task, where subjects received the instruction to recognise a face seen previously, experts {{proved to be more}} accurate than non-experts. Experts were more affected by inversion than non-experts, suggesting that the processing of those faces is based on their configuration, as is generally observed for human faces. This replicates findings from Diamond and Carey (J Exp Psychol <b>Gen</b> <b>115</b> : 107 - 117, 1986) in dog experts. In the implicit recognition task, assessed by a visual paired comparison task where no instruction of recognition was given, automatic discrimination was observed for human faces but not for monkey faces. These results suggest that experience acquired by the time of adulthood did not lead the experts to develop recognition skills to the point of matching those exhibited for human faces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{is a brief}} {{survey and}} {{interpretation}} of {{the text of the}} only two heraclitean fragments that connect explicitly psuche and logos, B 45 and B <b>115.</b> <b>Introductory</b> pages deal with the traditional significance of the word psuche, and the meaning and philosophical importance of the complex term of logos, which appears in several other genuine texts. Part I is concerned with B 45 : “If you go to the soul’s limits, you wouldn’t find them, even if you traveled every path: so deep is its logos”. It is mainly an exploration of its many different resonances and its paradoxical rationality. The focal points of attention are the ideas of “limits” and “searching”, which are then linked to mortality. The second section includes brief discussion on B 36, and concludes that its relevancy to the interpretation of B 45 is questionable and unclear. The third section tries to recover the general outlines of Heraclitus conception of [human] soul as the home of knowledge and speech (as a quick glimpse of B 107 reveals [“Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for those who have barbarous souls”]), which strongly suggests the idea of self-knowledge as the background of B 45. The last section deals with the more difficult B 115 (“It belongs to the soul a logos that increases itself”), recognizing first the problem of authenticity, and especially the objection of inconsistency between the idea of a logos that “increases itself” and Heraclitus’ theory of “measures”, venturing a conjectural interpretation that draws attention to the main, common point of both fragments: the inner character of logos, its immanency in psuche, and its most suggestive implication, an idea of self-conciousness, a fundamental philosophical notion that could be thus much more ancient than what is usually thought...|$|R

40|$|Type and {{frequency}} of systemic and neurologic manifestations of Beh double dagger et's disease (BD) vary with ethnicity. in Brazil, BD occurs as sporadic cases. We describe clinical and radiological features of 36 Brazilian patients of mixed ethnicity with neuro-Beh double dagger et's disease (NBD). Medical records of 178 BD patients were reviewed and 36 (20 %) NBD patients were identified. Twenty-one NBD patients (58. 3 %) were female and 27 (75 %) presented with parenchymal manifestations. Brainstem involvement {{was the most common}} neurologic syndrome (41. 7 %). Seizures (27. 8 %), isolated aseptic meningitis (16. 7 %), optic neuropathy (ON) (16. 7 %), cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) (8. 3 %), peripheral neuropathy (2. 8 %), and spinal cord involvement (5. 6 %) were other neurologic manifestations observed among Brazilian NBD patients. Eighteen (50 %) had at least one relapse, and isolated aseptic meningitis was the most common relapsing manifestation. No significant differences concerning the number of relapses between parenchymal and non-parenchymal groups were found. A multivariate model including disease duration, cell count in spinal fluid, cyclosporine use, immunosuppressive use at disease onset, age at NBD onset, and ON did not reveal any significant associations with NBD relapse. There was a low frequency of CVT and an unexpected higher number of isolated aseptic meningitis. Brazilian NBD patients present more parenchymal and atypical manifestations, and relapse more often than NBD patients from other populations.

40|$|Neuro-Behcet's disease (NBD) {{presents}} {{cognitive and}} behavioral symptoms possibly explained by secondary dysfunction of frontal and temporal cortices due to subcortical damage, as NBD commonly involves the brainstem and basal ganglia. Nonetheless, {{there are reports of}} cognitive impairment in patients without neurological manifestations. Objective: To evaluate cognitive function in Behcet's disease (BD) patients with and without neurological manifestations and to analyze clinical variables associated with cognitive deficits. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that compared healthy controls, BD patients without neurological manifestations and NBD patients. Each group comprised 24 participants. All participants underwent neuropsychological evaluation, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) application and brain MRI. Cumulative prednisone dose, years of education, and presence of white-matter lesions in brain MRI were recorded. Results: 41. 6 % of BD and 41. 6 % of NBD patients showed impaired language and executive function, whereas visual memory was impaired only in NBD patients. Multiple logistic regression revealed that anxiety (OR 1. 09 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 16, p = 0. 003) and lower educational level (OR 0. 62 95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 80, p< 0. 0001) were independently associated with cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Cognitive impairment occurs frequently in patients with BD independently of neurological manifestation. Low educational level and anxiety are risk factors for cognitive impairment in BD.

40|$|Ever since Diamond and Carey (1986. J. Exp. Psychol. : <b>Gen.,</b> vol. <b>115,</b> pp. 107 – 117) seminal work, {{the main}} model for {{studying}} expertise in visual object recognition (“visual expertise”) has been face perception. The underlying {{assumption was that}} since faces may be considered the ultimate domain of visual expertise, any face-processing signature might actually be a general characteristic of visual expertise. However, while humans are clearly experts in face recognition, visual expertise is not restricted to faces and {{can be observed in}} a variety of domains. This {{raises the question of whether}} face recognition is in fact the right model to study visual expertise, and if not, what are the common cognitive and neural characteristics of visual expertise. The current perspective article addresses this question by revisiting past and recent neuroimaging and behavioural works on visual expertise. The view of visual expertise that emerges from these works is that expertise is a unique phenomenon, with distinctive neural and cognitive characteristics. Specifically, visual expertise is a controlled, interactive process that develops from the reciprocal interactions between the visual system and multiple top-down factors, including semantic knowledge, top-down attentional control, and task relevance. These interactions enable the ability to flexibly access domain-specific information at multiple scales and levels guided by multiple recognition goals. Extensive visual experience with a given object category culminates in the recruitment of these multiple systems, and is reflected in widespread neural activity, extending well beyond visual cortex, to include higher-level cortical areas...|$|R

40|$|Background {{the orbital}} region is of vital {{importance}} to facial expression. Brow ptosis, besides {{having an impact}} on facial harmony, is a sign of aging. Various surgical techniques have been developed to increase the efficacy of brow-lift surgery. However, no consensus method exists for an objective measurement of the eyebrow position due to the curvature of the face. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a method for measuring the eyebrow position using computerized photogrammetry. Methods for this study, 20 orbital regions of 10 volunteers were measured by direct anthropometry using a digital caliper and by indirect anthropometry (computerized photogrammetry) using standardized digital photographs. Lines, points, and distances were defined based on the position of the anthropometric landmarks endocanthion and exocanthion and then used to calculate the brow position index (BPI). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with a significance level of 5 %. Results the BPI values obtained by computerized photogrammetric measurements did not differ significantly from those obtained by direct anthropometric measurements (p > 0. 05). the mean BPI was 84. 89 +/- A 10. 30 for the computerized photogrammetric measurements and 85. 27 +/- A 10. 67 for the direct anthropometric measurements. Conclusion the BPI defined in this study and obtained by computerized photogrammetry is a reproducible and efficient method for measuring the eyebrow position.

40|$|A {{classical}} voltage-sensitive {{channel is}} tension sensitive—the kinetics of Shaker and S 3 –S 4 linker deletion mutants change with membrane stretch (Tabarean, I. V., and C. E. Morris. 2002. Biophys. J. 82 : 2982 – 2994.). Does stretch distort the channel protein, producing novel channel states, or, more interestingly, are existing transitions inherently tension sensitive? We examined stretch and voltage dependence of mutant 5 aa, whose ultra-simple activation (Gonzalez, C., E. Rosenman, F. Bezanilla, O. Alvarez, and R. Latorre. 2000. J. <b>Gen.</b> Physiol. <b>115</b> : 193 – 208.) and temporally matched activation and slow inactivation were ideal for these studies. We focused on macroscopic patch current parameters related to elementary channel transitions: maximum slope and delay of current rise, and time constant of current decline. Stretch altered {{the magnitude of}} these parameters, but not, or minimally, their voltage dependence. Maximum slope and delay versus voltage with and without stretch as well as current rising phases were well described by expressions derived for an irreversible four-step activation model, indicating there is no separate stretch-activated opening pathway. This model, with slow inactivation added, explains most of our data. From this we infer that the voltage-dependent activation path is inherently stretch sensitive. Simulated currents for schemes with additional activation steps were compared against datasets; this showed that generally, additional complexity was not called for. Because the voltage sensitivities of activation and inactivation differ, {{it was not possible}} to substitute depolarization for stretch so as to produce the same overall PO time course. What we found, however, was that at a given voltage, stretch-accelerated current rise and decline almost identically—normalized current traces with and without stretch could be matched by a rescaling of time. Rate-limitation of the current falling phase by activation was ruled out. We hypothesize, therefore, that stretch-induced bilayer decompression facilitates an in-plane expansion of the protein in both activation and inactivation. Dynamic structural models of this class of channels will need to take into account the inherent mechanosensitivity of voltage-dependent gating...|$|R
40|$|Mutants of Salmonella typhimurium {{that lack}} the biosynthetic sulfite reductase (cysI and cysJ mutants) retain {{the ability to}} reduce sulfite for growth under {{anaerobic}} conditions (E. L. Barrett and G. W. Chang, J. <b>Gen.</b> Microbiol., <b>115</b> : 513 - 516, 1979). Here we report studies of sulfite reduction by a cysI mutant of S. typhimurium and purification of the associated anaerobic sulfite reductase. Sulfite reduction for anaerobic growth did not require a reducing atmosphere but was prevented by an argon atmosphere contaminated with air (less than 0. 33 %). It was also prevented {{by the presence of}} 0. 1 mM nitrate, which argues against a strictly biosynthetic role for anaerobic sulfite reduction. Anaerobic growth in liquid minimal medium, but not on agar, was found to require additions of trace amounts (10 (- 7) M) of cysteine. Spontaneous mutants that grew under the argon contaminated with air also lost the requirement for 10 (- 7) M cysteine for anaerobic growth in liquid. A role for sulfite reduction in anaerobic energy generation was contraindicated by the findings that sulfite reduction did not improve cell yields, and anaerobic sulfite reductase activity was greatest during the stationary phase of growth. Sulfite reductase was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of the anaerobically grown cysI mutant and was purified 190 -fold. The most effective donor in crude extracts was NADH. NADPH and methyl viologen were, respectively, 40 and 30 % as effective as NADH. Oxygen reversibly inhibited the enzyme. Two high-molecular-weight proteins separated by gel filtration (Mr 360, 000 and 490, 000, respectively) were required for maximal activity with NADH. Indirect evidence, including in vitro complementation experiments with a cysG mutant extract, suggested that the 360, 000 -Mr component contains siroheme and is the terminal reductase. This component was further purified to near homogeneity and was found to consist of a single subunit of molecular weight 67, 500.

Patients and methods Sixty-five hypertensive individuals (aged 66. 3 +/- 5. 3 years) received amlodipine 2. 5 mg per day for 12 weeks before and after two periods of 4 weeks of placebo. At weeks 0, 12 and 16, patients were submitted to office, 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure measurement. Results Office systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed decreases at weeks 8 (153 +/- 17, 90 +/- 9 mmHg) and 12 (152 +/- 16, 90 +/- 9 mmHg) compared with weeks 0 (164 +/- 16, 99 +/- 6 mmHg) and 16 (162 +/- 19, 95 +/- 9 mmHg). During ambulatory monitoring, a decrease was observed in the average 24 h systolic and diastolic pressure at week 12 (143 +/- 13, 86 +/- 7 mmHg) compared with weeks 0 (155 +/- 15, 93 +/- 6 mmHg) and 16 (152 +/- 16, 92 +/- 8 mmHg). A daytime and night-time reduction in systolic and diastolic pressure was observed on home blood pressure monitoring at week 12 (146 +/- 16 / 88 +/- 8, 144 +/- 16 / 93 +/- 8 mmHg) compared with weeks 0 (1159 +/- 17 / 94 +/- 8, 161 +/- 19 / 93 +/- 8 mmHg) and 16 (153 +/- 16 / 93 +/- 8, 154 +/- 17 / 92 +/- 8 mmHg).

40|$|AbstractElevation of {{external}} [K+] potentiates outward K+ current through several voltage-gated K+ channels. This increase in current magnitude is paradoxical {{in that it}} occurs despite {{a significant decrease in}} driving force. We have investigated the mechanisms involved in K+-dependent current potentiation in the Kv 2. 1 K+ channel. With holding potentials of − 120 to − 150 mV, which completely removed channels from the voltage-sensitive inactivated state, elevation {{of external}} [K+] up to 10 mM produced a concentration-dependent increase in outward current magnitude. In the absence of inactivation, currents were maximally potentiated by 38 %. At more positive holding potentials, which produced steady-state inactivation, K+-dependent potentiation was enhanced. The additional K+-dependent potentiation (above 38 %) at more positive holding potentials was precisely equal to a K+-dependent reduction in steady-state inactivation. Mutation of two lysine residues in the outer vestibule of Kv 2. 1 (K 356 and K 382), to smaller, uncharged residues (glycine and valine, respectively), completely abolished K+-dependent potentiation that was not associated with inactivation. These mutations did not influence steady-state inactivation or the K+-dependent potentiation due to reduction in steady-state inactivation. These results demonstrate that K+-dependent potentiation can be completely accounted for by two independent mechanisms: one that involved the outer vestibule lysines and one that involved K+-dependent removal of channels from the inactivated state. Previous studies demonstrated that the outer vestibule of Kv 2. 1 can be in at least two conformations, depending on the occupancy of the selectivity filter by K+ (Immke, D., M. Wood, L. Kiss, and S. J. Korn. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 113 : 819 – 836; Immke, D., and S. J. Korn. 2000. J. <b>Gen.</b> Physiol. <b>115</b> : 509 – 518). This change in conformation was functionally defined by a change in TEA sensitivity. Similar to the K+-dependent change in TEA sensitivity, the lysine-dependent potentiation depended primarily (> 90 %) on Lys- 356 and was enhanced by lowering initial K+ occupancy of the pore. Furthermore, the K+-dependent changes in current magnitude and TEA sensitivity were highly correlated. These results suggest that the previously described K+-dependent change in outer vestibule conformation underlies the lysine-sensitive, K+-dependent potentiation mechanism...|$|R

Two eag-specific acidic residues and three acidic residues found in the S 2 and S 3 segments of all voltage-dependent K+ channels were individually mutated in Drosophila eag, mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the effect of Mg 2 + on ionic current kinetics was measured using a two electrode voltage clamp. Neutralization of eag-specific residues D 278 in S 2 and D 327 in S 3 eliminated Mg 2 +-sensitivity and mimicked the slowing of activation kinetics caused by Mg 2 + binding to the wild-type channel. These results suggest that Mg 2 + modulates activation kinetics in wild-type eag by screening the negatively charged side chains of D 278 and D 327. Therefore, these residues are likely to coordinate the bound ion. In contrast, neutralization of the widely conserved residues D 284 in S 2 and D 319 in S 3 preserved the fast kinetics seen in wild-type eag in the absence of Mg 2 +, indicating that D 284 and D 319 do not mediate the slowing of activation caused by Mg 2 + binding. Mutations at D 284 affected the eag gating pathway, shifting the voltage dependence of Mg 2 +-sensitive, rate limiting transitions in the hyperpolarized direction. Another widely conserved residue, D 274 in S 2, is not required for Mg 2 + sensitivity but is {{in the vicinity of the}} binding site. We conclude that Mg 2 + binds in a water-filled pocket between S 2 and S 3 and thereby modulates voltage-dependent gating. The identification of this site constrains the packing of transmembrane segments in the voltage sensor of K+ channels, and suggests a molecular mechanism by which extracellular cations modulate eag activation kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Elevation of {{external}} [K(+) ] potentiates outward K(+) current through several voltage-gated K(+) channels. This increase in current magnitude is paradoxical {{in that it}} occurs despite {{a significant decrease in}} driving force. We have investigated the mechanisms involved in K(+) -dependent current potentiation in the Kv 2. 1 K(+) channel. With holding potentials of - 120 to - 150 mV, which completely removed channels from the voltage-sensitive inactivated state, elevation {{of external}} [K(+) ] up to 10 mM produced a concentration-dependent increase in outward current magnitude. In the absence of inactivation, currents were maximally potentiated by 38 %. At more positive holding potentials, which produced steady-state inactivation, K(+) -dependent potentiation was enhanced. The additional K(+) -dependent potentiation (above 38 %) at more positive holding potentials was precisely equal to a K(+) -dependent reduction in steady-state inactivation. Mutation of two lysine residues in the outer vestibule of Kv 2. 1 (K 356 and K 382), to smaller, uncharged residues (glycine and valine, respectively), completely abolished K(+) -dependent potentiation that was not associated with inactivation. These mutations did not influence steady-state inactivation or the K(+) -dependent potentiation due to reduction in steady-state inactivation. These results demonstrate that K(+) -dependent potentiation can be completely accounted for by two independent mechanisms: one that involved the outer vestibule lysines and one that involved K(+) -dependent removal of channels from the inactivated state. Previous studies demonstrated that the outer vestibule of Kv 2. 1 can be in at least two conformations, depending on the occupancy of the selectivity filter by K(+) (Immke, D., M. Wood, L. Kiss, and S. J. Korn. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 113 : 819 - 836; Immke, D., and S. J. Korn. 2000. J. <b>Gen.</b> Physiol. <b>115</b> : 509 - 518). This change in conformation was functionally defined by a change in TEA sensitivity. Similar to the K(+) -dependent change in TEA sensitivity, the lysine-dependent potentiation depended primarily (> 90 %) on Lys- 356 and was enhanced by lowering initial K(+) occupancy of the pore. Furthermore, the K(+) -dependent changes in current magnitude and TEA sensitivity were highly correlated. These results suggest that the previously described K(+) -dependent change in outer vestibule conformation underlies the lysine-sensitive, K(+) -dependent potentiation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Subjective memory {{complaints}} (SMC) and cerebral white-matter lesions (WML) {{are very}} prevalent among elderly subjects, but their clinical significance is controversial. the authors {{sought to determine}} whether SMCs are related to WML, independently {{of the presence of}} depressive symptoms, which are known to be associated with both. the relationship between SMC and cognition was also examined. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study on 60 elderly subjects without dementia. All subjects underwent FLAIR and T- 2 -weighted axial MRI scans, a memory-complaint questionnaire, a geriatric depression scale, and a comprehensive cognitive assessment. Results: Multiple linear regression showed that although the best correlate of SMC was the severity of depressive symptoms, SMC and WML were strongly correlated. Objective cognitive performance was not significantly associated with SMC after adjusting for WML and mood. the presence of a history of late-onset depression was a strong correlate of WML severity, even after adjusting for age, gender, and education. Conclusions: Complaints of cognitive decline are significantly associated with the severity of WML, independently of level of cognition and depression.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} abnormalities at thin-section computed tomography (CT) and indexes of pulmonary gas exchange impairment at rest and during moderate exercise in workers exposed to asbestos. MATERIALS and METHODS: Eighty-two workers with long-term exposure to asbestos and abnormal thin-section CT findings underwent respiratory physiologic measurements at rest (lung diffusing capacity, DLCO) and during exercise (oxygen uptake-corrected alveolar-arterial pressure difference for oxygen, DeltaP[A-a]O- 2 /VO 2). CT results were compared with physiologic measurements of impairment in gas exchange (DLCO 20 mm Hg (.) L (.) min(- 1)). the CT findings were divided into five categories by using a previously described method. Odds ratios and 95 % Cls for gas exchange defects were calculated for patients grouped according to CT findings. Logistic regression analysis was performed with gas exchange as the dependent response and CT abnormalities as independent variables. RESULTS: A significant association was found between extent of disease at CT and impairment of gas exchange (P. 05). CONCLUSION: Thin-section CT grading of interstitial lung disease is useful in assessing the likelihood of pulmonary gas exchange impairment at rest (DLCO) and during exercise (DeltaP[A-a]O- 2 /VO 2) in workers with long-term asbestos exposure.
