40|$|Abstract. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of an engine system. It fits in between the crosshead and the crankshaft and converts the piston’s reciprocating motion to rotary motion with the crankshaft. The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is subjected to a complex state of loading. High compressive loads and high tensile loads are due to combustion and <b>connecting</b> <b>rod’s</b> mass of inertia, respectively. This is why the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is the most stressed part of an engine system. If the engine is operating, <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> fails, this could cause a critical situation. Therefore, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> should be able to withstand tremendous load and transmit a great deal of power smoothly. In general, the failure occurs at the big <b>end</b> of <b>connecting</b> <b>rod.</b> Hence, the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod’s</b> big <b>end</b> corner radius was taken as a design variable.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> {{is a major}} link {{inside of}} a {{combustion}} engine. It connects the piston to the crankshaft and is responsible for transferring power from the piston to the crankshaft and sending it to the transmission.

50|$|The sun and {{planet gear}} {{converted}} the vertical motion of a beam, {{driven by a}} steam engine, into circular motion using a 'planet', a cogwheel fixed at the <b>end</b> of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> (<b>connected</b> to the beam) of the engine. With the motion of the beam, this revolved around, and turned, the 'sun', a second rotating cog fixed to the drive shaft, thus generating rotary motion. An interesting feature of this arrangement, when compared to that of a simple crank, is that when both sun and planet have the same number of teeth, the drive shaft completes two revolutions for each double stroke of the beam instead of one. The planet gear is fixed to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> and thus does not rotate around its own axis.|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} of the cylinders is also unusual.

The forward bank of cylinders is conversely set outboard of the rear bank, with the big end journals mounted on the outer sides of the crank journals. This design allows for a much narrower engine at the rear, which makes the bike slimmer where it contacts the rider, and allows an easier reach to the ground from the seat.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{is sealed}} {{at the bottom}} with a sump that collects the falling oil during normal operation to be cycled again. The cavity created between the cylinder block and the sump houses a crankshaft that converts the reciprocating motion of the pistons to rotational motion. The crankshaft is held in place relative to the engine block by main bearings, which allow it to rotate. Bulkheads in the crankcase form a half of every main bearing; the other half is a detachable cap. In some cases a single main bearing deck is used rather than several smaller caps. A <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> is <b>connected</b> to offset sections of the crankshaft (the crankpins) in one end and to the piston in the other end through the gudgeon pin and thus transfers the force and translates the reciprocating motion of the pistons to the circular motion of the crankshaft. The <b>end</b> of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> attached to the gudgeon pin is called its <b>small</b> <b>end,</b> and the other end, where it {{is connected to the}} crankshaft, the big end.

5000|$|In 1986, Isuzu {{introduced}} the 4ZD1 four-cylinder [...] 2.3-liter petrol engine. Apart from higher power, {{changes to the}} previous engine included a Kevlar timing belt replacing the previous chain, and a larger two-barrel carburetor. This engine eventually proved somewhat problematic with {{a high incidence of}} burned valves due to poor coolant flow design of the overhead cam/valve head with mechanical lifters. A later head casting improvement by an Italian firm corrected this problem through improved coolant flow. Also available only for 1986 in the US was the [...] 2.2-liter C223T turbocharged diesel engine, using a Garrett turbocharger. It was not a popular option because of the low power generated, and furthermore is notorious for a weak bottom <b>end,</b> the <b>connecting</b> <b>rods</b> not originally designed for the increased thermal and mechanical stress of forced induction. Because of those problems, Isuzu changed the 4ZE1 for 1988 and used the standard 2.8-liter GM V6 for 1989 until their own new V6 engines could be manufactured.|$|R
50|$|The sun and {{planet gear}} {{is a simple}} {{epicyclic}} gear. The planet is attached rigidly to the <b>end</b> of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod,</b> hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional gearwheels, this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.|$|R
5000|$|The trunk {{engine was}} largely {{replaced}} by the double piston-rod engine. [...] This was a return <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and cylinder. Four piston rods were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to {{each side of the}} crank, as the crank throw was wider than the vertical spacing of the piston rods. As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two piston rods would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. Double piston rods could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the double piston rod engine over the trunk was that both <b>ends</b> of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|In {{machines}} and mechanisms, {{most of the}} clearance joints are designed to operate with lubricant fluid, which is an effective way of ensuring better performance of the mechanical systems.

This approach couples the dynamics model of the multibody system with the lubrication models of translational and revolute clearance joints.

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing requires a bearing surface, if any.

The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the <b>connecting</b> <b>rod</b> instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R
50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train.

The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver {{it to the big}} end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way.
