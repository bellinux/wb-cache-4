5|$|KC-767 Tanker Transport – the 767-200ER-based aerial {{refueling}} platform {{operated by the}} Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare), and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Modifications conducted by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems include {{the addition of a}} fly-by-wire refueling boom, strengthened flaps, and optional auxiliary fuel tanks, as well as <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and modified avionics. The four KC-767Js ordered by Japan have been delivered. The Aeronautica Militare received the first of its four KC-767As in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone. Due to the fragile sandstone exterior, the damage on the rotunda was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion of the project and finished the <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroc missile used {{liquid oxygen}} as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile {{did not have}} {{separate}} tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by a bulkhead. The frame of the rocket {{was supported by the}} pressure of the gas inside the tank, which would be either propellant when used, or inert gasses when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> but made the missile very fragile because it required continuous pressurization.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After AD 700 {{the pyramid}} served an {{important}} funerary function. Three elite burials have been excavated from the pyramid, two males and a female, accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings. The offerings include polychrome ceramics and objects crafted from shell, conch {{and mother of}} pearl that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. These associated finds are of sufficient quality {{that it is possible}} that the deceased were members of the royal family. The burials have been dated to the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII, who ruled from AD 769 to 794. During the Terminal Classic some minor changes were made to the temple chambers and there may have been <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the front of the temple. Although it is poorly preserved, the inside of the temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E

5|$|While sharing broadly the blended {{wing-body}} {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version {{by the addition of}} canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.|$|E
5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. <b>Structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in the window in the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E
25|$|The castle {{has been}} {{extensively}} restored since it was purchased by the Comune of Pacentro in 1957.

50|$|The {{new body}} shop now allows the {{aluminum}} frame {{to be produced}} in-house. The new shop also was designed to have the advancements {{to make the most}} complex frame design in Corvette's history. This new frame is 99 pounds lighter and 40% stiffer than the C6 frame. With the chassis being so strong, the C7 convertible will not need any additional <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcements</b> to the frame which is very rare.|$|R
25|$|The 787's cabin {{windows are}} larger than any other civil air {{transport}} in-service or in development, with dimensions of , and a higher eye level so passengers can maintain {{a view of the}} horizon. The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism-based smart glass (supplied by PPG Industries) allowing flight attendants and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking, reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world, but the most opaque setting still has some transparency. The lavatory, however, has a traditional sunshade.|$|E
25|$|Before any troop {{transportation}} {{could be}} undertaken, {{all of the}} ships had to be hastily refitted—in {{little more than two}} weeks in the case of Lenape. Of the fourteen ships, ten, including Lenape, were designated to carry human passengers; the other four were designated as animal ships. The ten ships designated to carry troops had to have all of their second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard. <b>Structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> below the platforms was required before the ships could outfit for guns at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the USAF began a <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{program to}} extend the aircraft's service life from the {{designed}} 3,000 flying hours to 7,000. The USAF alone lost 500 F-100Ds, predominantly in accidents. After one aircraft suffered wing failure, particular {{attention was paid to}} lining the wings with external bracing strips. During the Vietnam War, combat losses constituted as many as 50 aircraft per year. On 7 June 1957, an F-100D fitted with an Astrodyne booster rocket making 150,000lbf (667.2kN) of thrust successfully performed a zero length launch (ZeLL). This was accomplished {{with the addition of a}} large canister to the underside of the aircraft. This canister contained a black powder compound and was ignited electro-mechanically, driving the jet engine to minimal ignition point. The capability was incorporated into late-production aircraft. After a major accident, the USAF Thunderbirds reverted from F-105 Thunderchiefs to the F-100D which they operated from 1964 until it was replaced by the F-4 Phantom II in 1968.|$|E

25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E

500|$|The Pinto's design {{positioned}} its {{fuel tank}} between the rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time. The Pinto's vulnerability to fuel leakage and {{fire in a}} rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear [...] "crush space", a lack of <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in the rear, and an [...] "essentially ornamental" [...] rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers). [...] Crash testing, conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks, {{as part of a}} response to NHTSA proposed regulations, demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds. [...] Design changes were made, but post launch tests showed similar results. These tests were conducted to develop crash testing standards rather than specifically investigating fuel system integrity.

2500|$|Due {{to rising}} levels of metal fatigue, a major <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcement</b> program {{was carried out}} to extend the {{operational}} life of Finland's Hawks during the 1990s. Due to lifespan limitations, 41 out of 67 in Finland's total Hawk fleet were taken out of service between 2012–2016; the remaining aircraft are younger and thus {{are expected to be}} flying into the 2030s. [...] In 2011, Finnish Mk. 51s and Mk. 66s underwent a series of upgrades performed by Patria, these included the adoption of a new Cockpit 4000 glass cockpit, new software, and other life-extending modifications.

40|$|Preformed <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcements</b> {{have shown}} good {{performance}} in crash tests, where the great advantage is their weight. These reinforcements {{are designed with}} the aim of increasing the rigidity of regions with large deformations, thus stabilising sections of the vehicle that work as load path during impact. The objective of this work is to show the application of <b>structural</b> <b>reinforcements</b> made of polymeric material PA 66 in the field of vehicle safety, through finite element simulations. Simulations of frontal impact at 50 km/h and in ODB (offset deformable barrier) at 57 km/h configurations (standards such as ECE R- 94 and ECE R- 12) were performed in the software LS-DYNA R (R) and MADYMO (R). The simulations showed that the use of polymeric reinforcements leads to a 70 % reduction in A-pillar intrusion, a 65 % reduction in the displacement of the steering column and a 59 % reduction in the deformation in the region of the occupant legs and feet. The level of occupant injuries was analysed by MADYMO (R) software, and a reduction of 23. 5 % in the chest compression and 80 % in the tibia compression were verified. According to the standard, such conditions lead to an improvement in the occupant safety in a vehicle collision event...|$|R
