40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the controlling design parameters of large-format Li-ion batteries on safety while undergoing nail penetration. We have identified three critical design parameters {{that control the}} safety during the nail penetration process: nail diameter, single <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> area, and cell capacity. Using commercial AutoLion software, we have investigated two typical design problems related to the selection of cell thickness and aspect ratio, namely: (1) the safety ramifications of increasing cell capacity via greater cell thickness for a fixed footprint, and (2) the effect of aspect ratio, or single <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> size, on safety at a given capacity. For a fixed footprint, our {{results indicate that the}} safety of the cell can be predicted by (Qcell Dnail^- 0. 5). For a given cell capacity, our results indicate that typically a larger single <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> area leads to a greater likelihood for thermal runaway due to its effect of making the heating more local in nature; however, for small cells (~ 5 Ah) and large nails (~ 20 mm), the greater aspect ratio can lead to a safer cell, as the greater surface area strongly cools the global heating of the cell...|$|E

In comparison to other back-contact module approaches (e. g. conductive back <b>sheet</b> <b>foil)</b> the conventional module fabrication process needs only little adaptions of the stringing process, which leads to exceptionally low investment costs.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{unloading}} springback of sheet metal foils after micro-bending process, a constitutive model is proposed {{based on the}} surface layer model by which the <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> is divided into surface layer and inner portions. For the inner portion, each grain is envisaged as a composite, comprised of grain interior and grain boundary work-hardened layer. The classical composite model is then used to calculate its flow stress. For the surface layer portion, a model without grain boundary strengthening is constructed to represent the flow stress in this zone. The developed method is verified through the comparison of the calculated strain-stress curves with the tensile test results of four kinds of pure copper sheet foils with different thicknesses ranging from 0. 1 mm to 0. 6 mm. To investigate the effect of thickness and grain size on the springback of pure copper sheet foils, three-point bending tests are carried out. A finite element (FE) model for predicting the springback in micro-bending process is further developed, which {{takes into account the}} deformation behavior and orientation of each grain. The influences of grain size and thickness on the springback of sheet foils are investigated. The research results show that the decrease of <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> thickness or the increase of grain size results in a big springback. The scatter of springback angle is mainly attributed to the elastic anisotropy of surface grains and increases with the reduction of grains along the thickness direction. A good agreement between the experimental results and the analytical calculations shows that the developed FE model can predict the springback of sheet metal foils well in micro-bending process.

40|$|Compact recuperators/heat-exchangers are {{essential}} hardware for microturbines, {{and are also}} desirable for increased efficiency of small industrial gas turbines. Most commercial recuperators today are made from 347 stainless steel <b>sheet</b> or <b>foil.</b> Larger engine sizes, higher exhaust temperatures and alternate fuels will all require materials with better performance (strength, corrosion resistance) and reliability than typically found in 347 steel, especially as recuperator temperatures approach or exceed 700 - 750 oC. To meet these needs, the Department of Energy (DOE) has sponsored programs at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to generate data that enables selection of commercial <b>sheet</b> and <b>foil</b> materials, to analyze recuperator components, and to identify or develop more cost effective materials with improved performance and reliability. This paper summarizes data on the high-temperature creep behavior of both standard, commercial 347 steel <b>sheet</b> and <b>foils</b> typically used for commercial recuperators and as well as commercial HR 120 foil as a higher performance alternative.

40|$|As {{a result}} of their unique, but well-behaved structure-property relationships, {{porosity}} free nanostructured electrodeposits in the form of thin and thick coatings, free-standing <b>sheet,</b> <b>foil</b> or wire, and complex shapes, are rapidly finding applications in many different areas. Because of the large driving force for grain growth in these materials, however, their thermal stability may be a critical issue for some applications. This paper reviews previous grain growth studies of nanostructured electrodeposits. Thermal stability has been evaluated using several different experimental approaches. Calorimetric studies of nanocrystalline nickel based electrodeposits have shown a general trend of increasing thermal stability by alloying with either P or Fe. There is, however, little agreement between the various studies in terms of suggested growth mechanisms. Indeed, because of the large range of annealed structures obtained from different annealing treatments, several distinct growth mechanisms have been suggested. Recent grain growth studies of nanostructured Ni electrodeposits, covering a much broader range of annealing conditions than used before, have shown that the multiple types of previously reported annealed structures are in fact the product of a multi-staged growth process...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafine grained {{materials}} {{produced by}} severe plastic deformation methods possess attractive mechanical properties {{such as high}} strength compared with traditional coarse grained counterparts and reasonable ductility. Between existing severe plastic deformation methods the Equal Channel Angular Pressing is the most promising for future industrial applications and can produce a variety of ultrafine grained microstructures in materials depending on route, temperature and number of passes during processing. Driven by a rising trend of miniaturisation of parts these materials are promising candidates for microforming processes. Considering that bi-axial deformation of <b>sheet</b> (<b>foil)</b> is the major operation in microforming, {{the investigation of the}} influence of the number of ECAP passes on the bi-axial ductility in micro deep drawing test has been examined by experiments and FE simulation in this study. The experiments have showed that high force was required for drawing of the samples processed by ECAP compare to coarse grained materials. The limit drawing ratio of ultrafine grained samples was in the range of 1. 9 – 2. 0 with ECAP pass number changing from 1 to 16, while a higher value of 2. 2 was obtained for coarse grained copper. However, the notable decrease in tensile ductility with increase in strength was not as pronounced for bi-axial ductility.

40|$|Abstract: This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the numerical simulation of a reverse roller-coating process, which involves the computation of Newtonian viscous incompressible flows with free-surfaces. A numerical scheme is applied of a transient finite element form, a semiimplicit Taylor-Galerkin/pressure-correction algorithm. For free-surface prediction, we use kinematic boundary adjustment with a mesh-stretching algorithm. In the present work, an alloy <b>sheet</b> (<b>foil)</b> passes over a large roller and then a smaller applicator roller, which provides the in-feed. In combination, the applicator roller, the foil and the fluid form part of the underside coating mechanism. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate fundamental aspects of the process, to ultimately address typical coating instabilities. These may take the form of chatter and starvation. A uniform coating thickness is the desired objective. A mathematical model is derived to describe the solvent coating applied to the underside of the sheet, assuming that the lacquer is a Newtonian fluid. In particular, the work has concentrated on the flow patterns that result and a parameter sensitivity analysis covering the appropriate operating windows of applied conditions. Effects of independent variation in roll-speed and foil-speed are investigated, to find that maxima in pressure, lift and drag arise at the nip and are influenced in a linear fashion. These quantities decrease linearly with increasing rollspeed, and increase linearly with increasing foil-speed...|$|E
40|$|After {{several months}} of operation, many {{photovoltaic}} (PV) modules develop a discolouration defect called snail trails which appear as irregular dark traces across the cells.

We can show that certain additive compositions within the encapsulation and back <b>sheet</b> <b>foils</b> are critical for the formation of the discolouring silver nanoparticles. We suggest a reaction model explaining the formation of snail trails from a chemical point of view. This fundamental understanding allows the rapid testing of foils for their snail trail sensitivity as well as the special design of resistant foils...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the short}} period that some {{photovoltaic}} technologies have taken part on the solar energy market, {{it is crucial to}} evaluate the long term stability of solar cells belonging to those technologies in order to ensure a minimum lifetime of their performance. Accelerated degradation tests are thus carried out to achieve such goals. The present study analyzes the encapsulation effects on co-evaporated manufactured Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) solar cells under damp heat conditions, consisting in 85 °C and 85 % relative humidity, during an approximated period of 1000 hours. The experimental procedure has been carried out at Solliance Solar Research facilities. Since the encapsulation packages play a critical role as a protection to achieve long term stability of the solar cells and modules, several packaging structures and materials has been taken into study. Thus, eighteen types of mini modules were manufactured including different combinations of encapsulants, front sheet foils, thin film protective barriers and CIGS cells from different manufacturers. The design of these mini modules and the manufacturing process to obtain them is also presented in this work. Various characterization techniques were carried out in order to acquire the required information about the solar cells and encapsulants performance along the damp heat degradation process. The results exposed that encapsulation packages including thin film barriers between the encapsulant and the front <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> allowed a longer solar cell lifetime due to their remarkable protection against moisture ingress. Moreover, the degradation of the molybdenum layer included in the CIGS cells was found as principal cause of efficiency decrement and end of performance of solar cells protected by regular encapsulant and front sheet foils.

40|$|Large Strain Extrusion Machining (LSEM), a {{constrained}} {{chip formation}} process, is proposed and demonstrated {{as a method}} of Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) for metals and alloys. It is shown that SPD parameters such as deformation strain, macro-texture and strain rate can be controlled by varying the tool rake angle and chip compression (thickness) ratio, while imposing large strains in the chip in a single step of deformation. This level of parameter control is not achievable in any of the conventional SPD processes. By controlling the geometry of the chip (extrudate) a priori using a constraining tool, production of bulk material in foil, sheet and bar forms, and with nanostructured and ultrafine grained (UFG) microstructures, is demonstrated using commercially pure copper and aluminum 6061 -T 6 as model systems. The effects of secondary deformation arising from friction at the tool-chip contact and of the incipient (transient) stage of chip formation on the foil/sheet microstructure are characterized. ^ A characterization of the deformation field is carried out using the method of slip line fields (SLFs). Unlike upper-bound models, it is possible to estimate strain profiles, hydrostatic pressure and modes of deformation using an SLF model. By using an SLF model, estimates are made of SPD parameters such as strain, machining force and hydrostatic pressure, and their dependence on controllable input variables of tool rake angle and chip compression ratio. This analysis provides a theoretical framework for the use of LSEM {{as a method of}} SPD, and for its implementation as a process for making bulk nanostructured materials. ^ The experimental results and the SLF model suggest a number of exciting possibilities for the LSEM. These include creation of bulk nanostructured and UFG alloys from a variety of materials, scaling of the process to make <b>sheet,</b> <b>foil,</b> wire and bar, study and control of material texture, and the possibility of a new method for consolidation of particulates and foils. ...|$|E
