50|$|Riedel studied {{mechanical}} engineering {{and worked in}} the 1930s, first with Ardie and then at Victoria. During the Second World War, he developed a starter engine ("Riedel starter") for the first German jet engine-powered combat aircraft's powerplants. The starter system, which consisted of a Riedel 10 hp (7.5 kW) two-stroke flat engine hidden in the intake, essentially functioned as a pioneering example of an auxiliary power unit (APU) for starting a jet engine. A hole in the extreme nose of the centrebody contained a manual pull-handle (except for the BMW 003 engine) which started the piston engine, which in turn rotated the compressor. Two small petrol tanks were fitted in the annular intake. The engine was considered an extreme short stroke (bore / stroke: 70 mm / 35 mm = 2:1) design so it could fit in the hub of the turbine compressor. For reduction it had an integrated planetary gear. It was produced in Victoria in Nuremberg and served as a starter for the operational German Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003 jet engines, placed on the centreline of each of these, and was also meant for use on the Heinkel HeS 011 experimental jet engine, but relocated above the intake passage within a Heinkel-designed prefabricated <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>component</b> instead. In 1947, he founded the Riedel Motoren AG in Immenstadt, where he designed the light motorcycle Imme R100 which was manufactured in series. By the end of 1951 12,000 units were built. In December 1949, Riedel began design work for the scooter Till Riedel, however due to the insolvency of Riedel Motoren AG did not go into production in October 1951. In development was also an Imme with a two-cylinder engine.|$|E

The components are fixed to each other where a minimum relative movement takes place during deforming. The adhesive surface of the components is coated with the adhesive before joining. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises joining two sheet metal components with one another under interposition of an adhesive layer on two adhesive surfaces that lie on each other and then deforming such as deep-drawing, bending or pressing the fabricated composite body. An adhesive that is thermally activatable at 20 degrees C is used as adhesive, which is finally hardened by heating after deforming. The components are fixed to each other where a minimum relative movement takes place during deforming. The adhesive surface of the components is coated with the adhesive before joining. The adhesive is solidified but not hardened before the joining, so that the free surface of the component does not exhibit adhesive properties. The adhesive layer is made of adhesive film {{in the form of}} a glass fiber non-woven soaked with the adhesive. The adhesive is a two-component adhesive consisting of epoxide resin component and a hardener. A liquid mixture of the components is introduced on the adhesive surface of the sheet metal components at a mixing temperature, which is less than the reaction temperature of the components and the sheet metal components are joined and fixed with cooled adhesive. The adhesive is aqueous epoxide resin dispersion with hardeners, blocked polyurethane dispersion and/or dual-cure-system. The sheet metal components are fixed to each other in another way by using a welding point than over the adhesive layer before the plastic deformation, and are fixed to each other by locally partially hardening of the adhesive layer. The adhesive softens at a softening temperature, which is lower than the reaction temperature, and has a melt-adhesive property in the softened condition. The fixing step takes place by locally or completely heating over the softening temperature. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>component</b> is initially punched and then the adhesive surface of the punched component is coated with the thermally activatable adhesive. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>component</b> consists of a semi-finished product coated with the thermally activatable adhesive. The semi-finished product is a sheet metal wound to a coil.

40|$|Abstract — Sheet hydro forming (SHF) {{process is}} found to be special for {{different}} kind of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing. Commercially pure titanium grade 1 (CP Ti) is paid much attention due to its lightness, high specific ratio of strength to weight and property of anti-rust. CP Ti shows low ductility at room temperature, and requires thermal activation to increase its ductility and formability. Studying the behavior of the process by finite element-computer aided engineering process has now become very popular and therefore symmetric and nonsymmetric shaped products have been taken to study the forming behavior of CP Ti metal under SHF using FEM solver DEFORM- 3 D. The finite element result is used to investigate the effective stress distribution, maximum forming load and thickness distribution under various process parameter conditions and at different temperatures. Furthermore the SHF process has been optimized {{in order to get the}} uniform thickness and defect free product. Based on several parametric studies and simulation result, a generative process planning system for sheet hydroforming has been proposed to help engineers.

To design such a tooling, {{it is essential to}} figure out how many intermediate drawing steps are needed to produce the final part without deformation defect. First of all, a four-stage drawing process and a set of four-station tooling are designed. This pre-designed process is then analyzed by simulation, and the deformation behavior and formability in each stage is revealed. Based on the revealed deformation behavior and formability, the design of the process and tooling is confirmed. The reasonable drawing ratio and drawing depth in each drawing operation are determined. The size, clearance, and the corner radii of punch and die in each stage are also identified. The designed process and tooling are finally implemented. Through experiment, the "right design in the first time" is realized, and the simulation and experiment are found to have a good agreement.

40|$|Collar forming is a {{tractive}} compressive forming {{technique to}} turn up a closed component border, often a circular hole in a sheet metal or <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>component.</b> Today, high-strength steel materials with a reduced deformation capability compared to a smoother deep drawing grade are used increasingly in collar forming due to developments in lightweight body production. This is {{at the expense of}} the constructive claim for preferably high collar heights. In many applications collar shapes requiring an expansion close to the maximum expansion possibility of the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>component</b> are produced. Negative influences on material ductility caused by batch deviations and further process deviations while handling the components can cause undesirable and irregularly appearing cracking during the collar forming process. Visual supervision by the staff at the outfeed conveyor is a limited possibility depending on the cracking type and size and further circumstances in the processing environment. If crack-containing components are not identified and sorted out early in the process chain, they can be joined to the shell or even be delivered to the customer in the corresponding assembly. The project's objective was to develop and validate a non-destructive test method to detect cracks in collar forming respectively components containing a collar automatically. The suitability of the considered test methods has been evaluated in terms of this application. Non-destructive post-process methods and an in-process method were used. Besides inductive thermal imaging, eddy current testing and electromagnetic ultrasound, noise emission analysis has been performed. Laboratory samples containing a collar of high-strength steel materials and an aluminium alloy have been consulted as objects of investigation. Samples with a wide range of both natural and artificial cracks were used to validate the test methods. Parts from serial processes have also been included. Two test concepts based on the investigations realized were created with regards to the process accompanying and integrated application of crack detection. The first concept uses an EMUS test system whose sensory components can be integrated into the transfer press' space. In the simple case, the EMUS test can be integrated into the transfer press as an own test step at the end of the process chain. The integration of the EMUS sensors directly to the collar forming tool is basically possible. In every case the sensors have to be tailored to the height and diameter of the collar geometry. The collar geometry testable with EMUS brings specific requirements. In the second test concept based on inductive thermal imaging any collar geometry can be tested if optically accessible. The necessary demand of space for mounting such a test system is significantly higher than with EMUS. Therefore this test concept cannot be integrated into the transfer press or even into the tool. The thermal imaging test system can be installed at the conveyor as a continuous inline test method. The objective of the project was achieved...|$|E
