40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the factors affecting portfolio equity flows into India using monthly data. Flows to India are {{small compared to}} other emerging markets, but seem to be relatively less volatile. They also seem to be quite resilient. The paper shows that portfolio flows are determined by both external and domestic factors. Among external factors, LIBOR and emerging market stock returns are important, while the primary domestic determinants are the lagged stock return and changes in credit ratings. In quantitative terms, both external and domestic factors {{are found to be}} about equally important.

40|$|We {{construct}} a gold valuation theory based on viewing gold {{as a global}} real store of wealth. We show that the real price of gold varies inversely to the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> P/E and thus is a direct function of a global yield required to achieve a constant real after-tax return equal to long-term global real GDP per-capita growth. We introduce a new exchange rate parity rule based on the equalization of inverse <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> P/Es (required <b>yields)</b> across nations. Foreign exchange affects {{the price of gold}} to the extent that required yields and purchasing parity equalizations do not take place across nations in the short run. A quarterly valuation model is constructed using concurrent economic data that is within 12 % mean percentage tracking error from real U. S. gold prices from 1979 - 2002.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} 2007 - 08 demonstrated how severe the impact of financial markets’ stress on real economic activity can be. In {{the wake of the}} financial crisis policy-makers and decision-makers across the world identified the critical need for a better understanding of financial conditions, and more importantly, their impact on the real economy. To this end, we have constructed a financial conditions index (FCI) for the South African economy, to enable the gauging of financial conditions and to better understand the macro-financial linkages in the country. The FCI is constructed using monthly data over the period 1966 to 2011, and is based on a set of sixteen financial variables, which include variables that define the state of international financial markets, asset prices, interest rate spreads, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>yields</b> and volatility, bond market volatility and monetary aggregates. We explore different methodologies for constructing the FCI, and find that recursive principal components analysis (PCA) yields the best result. We furthermore investigate whether it is beneficial to purge the FCI of the real effects of inflation, economic growth and interest rates, and use the identified FCI in causality testing with three macroeconomic variables.

40|$|Using a {{recently}} introduced method {{to quantify the}} time varying lead-lag dependencies between pairs of economic time series (the thermal optimal path method), we test two fundamental tenets {{of the theory of}} fixed income: (i) the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> variations and the yield changes should be anti-correlated; (ii) the change in central bank rates, as a proxy of the monetary policy of the central bank, should be a predictor of the future <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> direction. Using both monthly and weekly data, we found very similar lead-lag dependence between the S&P 500 <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> index and the yields of bonds inside two groups: bond yields of short-term maturities (Federal funds rate (FFR), 3 M, 6 M, 1 Y, 2 Y, and 3 Y) and bond yields of long-term maturities (5 Y, 7 Y, 10 Y, and 20 Y). In all cases, we observe the opposite of (i) and (ii). First, the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and <b>yields</b> move in the same direction. Second, the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> leads the <b>yields,</b> including and especially the FFR. Moreover, we find that the short-term yields in the first group lead the long-term yields in the second group before the financial crisis that started mid- 2007 and the inverse relationship holds afterwards. These results suggest that the Federal Reserve is increasingly mindful of the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> behavior, seen at key to the recovery and health of the economy. Long-term investors seem also to have been more reactive and mindful of the signals provided by the financial <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> than the Federal Reserve itself after the start of the financial crisis. The lead of the S&P 500 <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> index over the bond yields of all maturities is confirmed by the traditional lagged cross-correlation analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{critically}} re-examines {{theory and}} {{evidence on the}} relation- ship between interest rates and inflation. It concludes {{that there is no}} evidence that interest rates respond to inflation in the way that classical or Keynesian theories suggest, For the period 1860 - 1940, it does not appear that inflationary expectations had any significant impact on rates of inflation in the short or long run. During the post-war period interest rates do appear to be affected by inflation. However, the effect is much smaller than any theory which recognizes tax effects would predict. Further- more, all the power in the inflation interest rate relationship comes from the 1965 - 1971 period. Within the 1950 's or 1970 's, the relationship is both statistically and substantively insignificant. Various explanations for the failure of the theoretically predicted relationship to hold are considered. The relationship between inflation and interest rates remains weak at the even low frequencies. This is taken as evidence that cyclical factors or errors in measuring inflation expectations cannot account for the failure of the results to bear out Fisher's theoretical prediction. Rather, comparison of real interest rates and <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>yields</b> suggests that Fisher was correct in pointing to money illusion as the cause of the imperfect adjustment of interest rates to expected inflation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in North American stock prices in 1999 and early 2000 has generated {{interest in the}} valuation assumptions that would make these price levels sustainable. Here, commonly used valuation techniques are applied to <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> in Canada and the United States. For the comparative yield approach, real interest rates (rather than nominal rates) are preferred as the comparator of choice to <b>yields</b> on <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indexes. The spreads between real interest rates and <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>yields</b> have generally increased {{over the last two}} years. The dividend-discount model (DDM) approach provides an analytic linkage between the equity-risk premium and the expected growth of dividends. It suggests that market values (measured at the end of February 2000) could be sustained only by rapid growth of dividends in the future or by the continued assumption of an uncharacteristically low risk premium on equity. The spectacular rise in the value of technology stocks in 1999 is noted (Chart 4), and then the valuation measures for the Canadian <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> excluding the technology sector are examined. When this is done with the comparative yield approach, yield spreads are slightly lower, and for the DDM approach, one does not need to assume as high a growth of dividends or as low a risk premium to validate market valuations. Two effects of the “new economy” on the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> are noted. One is the lowering of dividend yields, as new-economy technology companies tend to have a high reinvestment rate and a low dividend payout rate. Another relates to the potential for a higher track for the economy's productivity growth, which would mean that higher-than-historical assumptions about future earnings growth would be more plausible. Several explanations for the decline in risk premiums on equity are considered. While short-term volatility in the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> has, if anything, increased in recent years, low inflation and improved economic performance, along with demographics and investor preferences, may have contributed to a decline in the risk premium demanded by investors. A scenario of rapid growth of dividends in the near term slowing to historical norms in the longer term is examined. While this approach can go partway towards explaining high <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> valuations, it requires assumptions that are outside historical experience. ...|$|R

We construct a new measure of risk sharing based on a term structure model, which allows identification of realized stochastic discount factors. Risk sharing is low in Asia, and varies across time and countries, whereas contagion risks are more significant intra-regionally, and relatively stable over the past decade. An overall tradeoff exists between risk sharing and contagion, but the terms of tradeoffs vary across countries, depending on relative economic fluctuations and inflation differentials. Asia, therefore, can potentially enhance risk sharing without raising contagion risk.

S. subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007. Using daily stock and bond returns on emerging and developed markets from 1998 to 2007, the empirical results show that {{financial crises}} are indeed alike, as all linkages are statistically important across all crises. However, the strength of these linkages does vary across crises.

40|$|In recent years, the {{dynamics}} of M 3 in the euro area have been driven by two factors: a strong preference for liquidity, observed between 2001 and 2003, followed by a normalisation, at a relatively moderate pace, of portfolio behaviour; as regards the counterparts, changes in M 3 and net external assets were of comparable magnitude. These factors highlight the role of national and international portfolio shifts in monetary developments. Furthermore, the traditional specifications of the money demand function sometimes yield unsatisfactory results: instability of short and long-term coefficients, relatively large differences between the estimated and actual value of monetary aggregates, and {{significant changes in the}} number of long-run relations. Hence the idea of constructing a money demand function that excludes the external counterpart of M 3 or, alternatively, introducing financial asset prices in the demand function of M 3, as suggested by Friedman (1988). First, the basic equation, based on the quantitative equation of money, was reestimated in order to verify, for example, whether extending the estimation period or revising certain variables would not result in a major change, notably in terms of the stability of the parameters or the number of structural relations. Indeed, this equation exhibits two instabilities (parameters and the number of long-run relations). Similar results are obtained when the external counterpart of M 3 is not taken into account. However, by including European share prices, we obtain a substitution effect (significantly negative coefficient) of this variable and a better adjustment, without affecting the two long-run relations (money demand and the Fisher relation) discussed in the article published in Banque de France Monthly Digest No. 113. So, all other things being equal, a decline in European <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>yields</b> would result in a rise in real money holdings and a decrease in the velocity of circulation of money. Equity market developments therefore appear to be a significant explanatory factor for {{the dynamics}} of M 3 in the euro area. Lastly, estimates of the real money gap, based on the money demand equation factoring in the substitution effect associated with European stock price developments, point to moderate but persistent excess liquidity in the euro area.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the information available}} through leading indicators for modelling and forecasting the UK quarterly index of production (seasonally adjusted). The emphasis is on one-quarter ahead prediction, especially over the 1990 s recession. Linear specifications considered are univariate autoregressive models together with dynamic single indicator and multiple indicator models. Both univariate and leading indicator versions of nonlinear Markov switching specifications are also examined. In the latter case, the transition probabilities are modelled as logistic functions of the leading indicators, allowing the lead times to differ for the expansion to expansion and recession to recession probabilities. Despite general evidence that the term structure of interest rates helps regime classification in the Markov switching models, these models perform relatively poorly in forecasting the 1990 s production recession. It is suggested that this poor performance {{may be due to}} the nature of that recession, which differed from previous major UK postwar recessions in having no single quarter where industrial production declined substantially. However, a three indicator linear specification does well. The leading indicator variables in this latter model are a short-term interest rate, the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> dividend <b>yield</b> and the optimism balance from the quarterly survey conducted by the Confederation of British Industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{tests the}} efficiency hypothesis {{on data from}} the housing market in Oslo and Stavanger, covering the period 2002 - 2014. We utilize the Case-Shiller time structure test on a repeated sales house price index and examine the excess return time series for housing investments for each city. This paper is mainly a replication of the research carried out by Røed Larsen and Weum in 2008, 1 it does, however, offer some modifications and extensions. We conclude that both the repeated sales house price index and the excess return to housing does not contain time structure {{in any of the}} cities, and hence the housing markets are characterized as efficient. This is in contrast to the previously concluded inefficiency in Oslo from 1991 - 2002 by Røed Larsen and Weum. It is quite interesting that the housing market in Oslo has evolved from inefficient to efficient when comparing the last two decades. This paper does not provide an in-depth analysis of outside factors that may have contributed to these changes, as we leave that to further research. It gives, however, a solid conclusion of efficiency in the Oslo and Stavanger housing market for the relevant period. We demonstrate that the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> consistently <b>yields</b> higher appreciation and higher volatility than both the housing markets in the period of 2002 - 2014, which is a contrast to the previous research. The housing <b>markets</b> appear to <b>yield</b> the highest risk-adjusted return...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} impact of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> developments on lending behaviour from different perspectives. First we scrutinize the impact of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> movements on the banks' and on the borrowers' balance sheets. Subsequently we estimate aggregate credit supply and demand functions including a <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indicator as explanatory variable. The analysis reveals no major importance of the bank balance sheet channel for the relationship between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> volatility and corporate financing possibilities of non-financial companies. A possible impact of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> movements on banks' lending behaviour might be rooted in their impact on the balance sheets of corporate borrowers. The empirical results of the credit <b>market</b> analysis <b>yield</b> some confirming evidence for an impact of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> developments. However, the results are not very stable and depend on the specification of the model and on the time period under observation. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Even though stock {{returns are}} not highly autocorrelated, {{there is a}} {{spurious}} regression bias in predictive regressions for stock returns related to the classic studies of Yule (1926) and Granger and Newbold (1974). Data mining for predictor variables interacts with spurious regression bias. The two e¡ects reinforce each other, because more highly persistent series {{are more likely to}} be found signi¢cant in the search for predictor variables. Our simulations suggest that many of the regressions in the literature, based on individual predictor variables, may be spurious. PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR COMMON STOCK RETURNS have long been a staple of ¢nancial economics. Early studies, reviewed by Fama (1970), used such models to examine <b>market</b> e⁄ciency. <b>Stock</b> returns are assumed to be predictable, based on lagged instrumental variables, in the current conditional asset pricing literature. Standard lagged variables include the levels of short-term interest rates, payout-toprice ratios for <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indexes, and <b>yield</b> spreads between low-grade an...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of financial instruments related to indices that track global financial conditions and risk appetite can potentially offer countries alternative options to insure against external shocks. This paper shows that while these instruments can explain {{much of the}} in-sample variation in borrowing spreads, this fails to materialize in hedging strategies that work well out-of-sample during tranquil times. However, positions on instruments such as those tracking the US High Yield Spread, the VIX, and especially other emerging market CDS spreads can substantially offset adverse movements in own spreads during times of systemic crises. Moreover, high risk countries seem to gain more, as their underlying weaknesses makes them more vulnerable to external shocks. Overall, the limited value in tranquil times, coupled with political economy arguments and innovation costs could justify the limited interest {{for this type of}} hedging in practiceEconomic models;Emerging markets;External shocks;Financial instruments;Risk management;hedging, probability, hedge, minimization, hedge ratios, bond, hedging strategies, standard deviation, hedge ratio, standard deviations, bond spreads, government bond, bonds, probability density, correlation, hedging instruments, correlations, <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> corporate bond, probability density function, regression analysis, equation, financial innovation, bond spread, high yield bond, stock returns, explanatory power, international capital, credit derivatives, bond yield, hedges, cointegration, statistics, derivatives <b>markets,</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> indices, international interest rates, international financial markets, derivative, corporate bonds, bond rate, functional form, international finance, probabilities, hedging instrument, random sample, emerging market bond, high-yield corporate bonds, global <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> government bond <b>yield,</b> corporate bond <b>market,</b> skewness, portfolio hedging, financial markets, commodity derivatives, bond market, financial economics, international reserves, futures contracts, data analysis, market bond...|$|R

40|$|The {{metals and}} mining sector {{is driving the}} world economy like never before. Concentration of {{industry}} at a particular level of the global value chain decides how an economy {{will be affected by}} rising metal prices seen recently. <b>Stock</b> <b>markets</b> are bound to reflect the broader effect on an economy. This leads to the question – are <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and metal markets correlated, and can metal markets be used to predict <b>stock</b> <b>markets?</b> Taking the LME as a proxy for metal markets and the S&P 500 as a representative <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> returns are regressed onto notional returns on metal <b>markets</b> and convenience <b>yields</b> in metal prices.

40|$|Large {{fundamental}} imbalances {{persist in}} the global economy, with potential exchange rate implications. This paper assesses whether exchange rate risk is priced across G- 7 <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Given the multitude of hedging instruments available, theory suggests that <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> investors should not be compensated for currency risk. However, data covering 33 industry portfolios across seven major <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> suggest {{that not only is}} exchange rate risk priced in many markets, but that it is time-varying and sensitive to currency-specific shocks. With <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> investors typically exhibiting "home bias," this suggests that investors are using equity asset proxies to hedge the exchange rate risks to consumption.

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} 16 {{emerging}} markets, the paper finds a small but statistically significant effect of <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> developments on private consumption spending. In the short run, a 10 percent decline in the annual real <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> return {{is associated with a}} reduction in real private consumption by around 0. 1 - 0. 3 percent on average. There is evidence that the link between <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> fluctuations and private consumption has become stronger during the 1990 s as <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> in emerging economies have broadened and deepened. However, there is no significant evidence that the influence is asymmetric. Stock price declines do not have a different impact on consumption than stock price increases.
