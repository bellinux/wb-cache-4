5|$|Multifactorial <b>sex</b> <b>determination</b> {{occurs in}} {{numerous}} Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems.

The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which {{play a role in}} determining sex. Environment-dependent <b>sex</b> <b>determination</b> has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost.

5|$|Overall, the {{evidence}} {{provided by the}} embryo suggests that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous, making it the first viviparous archosauromorph asides from possibly metriorhynchids.

While the otherwise absence of viviparous archosaurs has been historically attributed to common attributes inherited from the archosaurian stem-lineage, the discovery that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous suggests that this phenomenon is due to lineage-specific lifestyle restrictions. Although the sex-determination systems among living archosauromorphs are diverse, with crocodilians and turtles using temperature-dependent <b>sex</b> <b>determination,</b> phylogenetic modelling suggests that Dinocephalosaurus retained the basal condition of genotypic <b>sex</b> <b>determination</b> from early diapsids, and that this system facilitated its transition to an obligately marine lifestyle alongside viviparity.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{effectiveness}} of a DNA repair protocol in improving genetic testing in compromised samples, frequently encountered in Forensic Medicine. Methods: In order to stretch the experiment conditions to the limits, as far as quality of samples and DNA is concerned, we tried the repair protocol on ten ancient human teeth obtained from an equal number of skeletons from a burial site in Lerna, Middle Helladic Greece (2100 - 1700 BC). For these samples, sex was previously determined morphologically, serving as a reference to compare our molecular data with. The samples were analysed using the DNA amelogenin sex test assay prior and after DNA polymerase repair. For every individual, two molecular <b>sex</b> <b>determinations</b> were obtained by visualising PCR products on an agarose gel. Results: DNA repair enabled genetic testing in these samples. Successful amplification of the amelogenin gene was obtained only from the repaired DNA in eight out of ten samples. Prior to the repair treatment, none of these samples yielded any PCR products, thus attesting to the authenticity of the amplified sequence. The concordance between morphological and molecular analysis was in reasonable agreement (71 %). Conclusions: These results reveal the impact of the repair process in studying single copy genes from low quality DNA. This protocol could facilitate molecular analysis in compromised samples, encountered in forensic medicine, as well as enable genetic studies in ancient remnants.

The questions this essay is if it is possible to see the structure of the community the people behind the burial ground at Vindförberg had. This will be achieved with the help of age and <b>sex</b> <b>determinations</b> to study the relationship between the different graves at Vindförberg. In excess of previous question, it was also of interest to compare the result from Vindförberg with four other contemporary burial grounds to inquire similarities and differences. Of the 43 graves on the burial ground, ten were analyzed in this essay. A total weight and volume of nine kilograms and twelve liters was analyzed. Human, dog, bear, elk, beaver, and fish were the identified species from Vindförberg. Because of the very fragmented material, the determinations of age and sex proved difficult to estimate.

5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch.

In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a <b>sex</b> <b>determination</b> unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} known wasps, such as yellowjackets and hornets, {{are in the}} family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of <b>sex</b> <b>determination</b> in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Many of the solitary wasps are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult). Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly in tomatoes and other crops.|$|E

Many methods exist and are generally applied to skeletons from all time periods and geographic locations, despite studies suggesting that there are differences in the expression of traits characteristic of males and females and that ageing rates vary within and between populations. The aim of this project was to study variation in ageing and sexual dimorphism in six documented collections from different geographic locations and/or time periods. Age and sex methods were tested on adult skeletal remains dating from the 17 th to 20 th century from Canada, England, South Africa, and Portugal. Ageing methods used were focused on the fourth rib’s sternal end, cranial sutures, pubic symphysis and auricular surface. A more subjective age estimate for each individual was also produced, using informal skeletal age indicators alongside formal methods. <b>Sex</b> <b>determinations</b> were based on pelvic and skull morphology, and metrical analysis.

40|$|While {{many details}} of the {{character}} of early Anglo-Saxon political organization remain elusive, historical records afford little disagreement about the development of polities by the later seventh century A. D. During the preceding period of political coalescence, from the fifth to early seventh centuries, stylistic variation may have assumed an important role in identifying, negotiating, and maintaining sociopolitical relationships. In this study, mortuary treatment and gravegoods from the area traditionally associated with one ethnic group—the Angles—was considered. Data for analysis were drawn from ten cemeteries in the historically-documented “kingdoms” of Lindsey and East Anglia. Details of mortuary treatment were recorded for 748 inhumations. A second data set of the gravegoods furnishing 436 undisturbed single inhumations was drawn from this sample. Significance tests were applied to identify relationships between the frequencies of specific mortuary treatments and gravegoods at four levels: between the ten study sites, within each polity, between the two polities, and within the entire study area. At the seven sites for which both age and <b>sex</b> <b>determinations</b> were based on osteological analysis, cluster analysis was used to explore the composition of age- and sex-associated sets of artifacts. Variability was recognized at three levels: “kingdom”, local community, and individual. Mortuary treatments were found to be located in community practices; gravegoods appeared to have addressed wider regional concerns. A model of kingdom-formation grounded in the extended family accounts not only for the stylistic variability identified in this study, but also for wider trends recognized in the archaeological record of the fifth through seventh centuries. During the early Anglo-Saxon period, the contribution of lineage relationships to political success is attested by the prominence, at least in burial, of female kin.
