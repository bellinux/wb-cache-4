40|$|BACKGROUND: Endothelial cell {{co-culture}} assays are differentiation assays which simulate {{the formation of}} capillary-like tubules {{with the aid of}} a <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> layer. Different cell types have been employed as a <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> layer, including human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and human mammary fibroblasts. However, these sources of human tissue-derived cells are limited, and more readily accessible human or animal tissue-derived cell sources would simplify the endothelial {{cell co-culture}} assay. In the present study, we investigated the potential use of alternative, accessible supportive cells for endothelial cell co-culture assay, including human umbilical cord and ovine carotid artery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human umbilical artery SMCs (HUASMCs) and ovine carotid artery-derived cells were seeded into 96 -well plates, followed by addition of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Nine days after co-culture, cells were fixed, immunostained and analysed using an in vitro angiogenesis quantification tool. Capillary-like structures were detected on ovine carotid artery-derived <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> layers. The initial cell number, as well as pro- and anti-angiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF-BB and Bevacizumab), had a positive or negative influence on the number of capillary-like structures. Furthermore, HUVECs from different donors showed distinct levels of VEGF receptor- 2, which correlated with the amount of capillary-like structures. In the case of HUASMC <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> layers, HUVECs detached almost completely from the surface. CONCLUSIONS: Cells of different origin have a varying applicability regarding the endothelial cell co-culture assay: under the conditions described here, ovine carotid artery-derived cells seem to be more suitable than HUASMCs for an endothelial co-culture assay. Furthermore, the ovine carotid artery-derived cells are easier to obtain and are in more abundant supply than the currently used dermal or breast tissue cells. The use of ovine carotid artery-derived cells simplifies the endothelial co-culture assay with respect to testing large amounts of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors...|$|E

The structure conforms to a multilayer quarter wavelength reflector which is adapted to low light intensities. By contrast with most other endoparasites, the eyes of P. americanus and N. scaphiopodis do not degenerate after host invasion but persist throughout life.

40|$|The endoderm-inducing {{effect of}} the mesoderm-derived <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> line M 15 on {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells is partly mediated through the extracellular matrix, of which laminin a 5 is a crucial component. Mouse ES or {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} cultured on a synthesized basement membrane (sBM) substratum, using an HEK 293 cell line (rLN 10 - 293 cell) stably expressing laminin- 511, could differentiate into definitive endoderm and subsequently into pancreatic lineages. In this study, we investigated the differentiation on sBM of mouse and human ES cells into hepatic lineages. The results indicated that the BM components {{played an important role in}} supporting the regional-specific differentiation of ES cells into hepatic endoderm. We show here that knockdown of integrin b 1 (Itgb 1) in ES cells reduced their differentiation into hepatic lineages and that this is mediated through Akt signaling activation. Moreover, under optimal conditions, human ES cells differentiated to express mature hepatocyte markers and secreted high levels of albumin. This novel procedure for inducing hepatic differentiation will be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling lineage-specific fates during gut regionalization.

40|$|Approximately {{one-quarter of}} all {{cells in the}} adult human body are blood cells. The haematopoietic system is {{therefore}} massive in scale and requires exquisite regulation to be maintained under homeostatic conditions. It must {{also be able to}} respond when needed, such as during infection or following blood loss, to produce more blood cells. Supporting cells serve to maintain haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during homeostatic and pathological conditions. This coalition of <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> types, organised in specific tissues, is termed the haematopoietic niche. Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are generated in a number of distinct locations during mammalian embryogenesis. These stem and progenitor cells migrate to a variety of anatomical locations through the conceptus until finally homing to the bone marrow shortly before birth. Under stress, extramedullary haematopoiesis can take place in regions that are typically lacking in blood-producing activity. Our aim in this review is to examine blood production throughout the embryo and adult, under normal and pathological conditions, to identify commonalities and distinctions between each niche.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that the adult human brain contains 100 billion neurons with 5 – 10 times as many astrocytes.

The compact pineal {{organ of the}} goby was mainly composed of photoreceptor, <b>supportive,</b> and ganglion <b>cells.</b> Besides these cell types, phago-cytic and degenerating cells existed in the pineal end-vesicle. Some photoreceptor cells appeared darker than others due to an abundance of free ribosomes {{and the development of}} Golgi apparatus, without showing noticeable regional differences in distribution in the pineal organ. The greater part of the cytoplasm of <b>supportive</b> <b>cells</b> was occupied by the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Although none of the cell types showed distinct morphological features suggestive of secretory activity of the pineal organ, numerous pinocytotic vesicles were found within endothelial cells of the blood capillaries surrounding the pineal organ.

We show here that the endoderm-inducing activity of M 15 cells is in part mediated through the extracellular matrices, and that laminin α 5 {{is one of the}} crucial components. In an attempt to establish a feeder-free ES-cell procedure for pancreatic differentiation, we used a synthesized basement membrane (sBM) substratum using an HEK 293 cell line stably expressing laminin- 511. On the sBM, mouse ES or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells sequentially differentiated into the definitive endoderm, pancreatic progenitor cells, and then insulin-expressing pancreatic β-cells in vitro. Knockdown of ES cells with integrin β 1 (Itgb 1) reduces differentiation towards pancreatic cells. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG 2) knockdown and heparitinase treatment synergistically decreased the number of Pdx 1 -expressing cells. These findings indicate that components of the basement membrane have {{an important role in the}} differentiation of definitive endoderm lineages.

40|$|Injection of (stem) {{cells into}} the damaged heart has a {{positive}} effect on cardiac function. In this thesis two strategies for improving myocardial regeneration over classical cell therapy were investigated. The first is to induce cardiomyogenic differentiation by genetically engineering cells to express the transcription factor myocardin (a regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiation). We found that overexpression of myocardin induces {{a large part of the}} cardiac muscle gene expression program in various non-muscle cells. Forced expression of myocardin enables cardiac infarction scar fibroblasts to conduct a cardiac action potential, and injection of myocardin-transduced MSCs resulted in greater preservation of cardiac function and reduced detrimental remodeling compared to untreated MSCs in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. Indicating that overexpression of myocardin endows cells with several beneficial properties of cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that myocardial regeneration might be enhanced by including novel cell types with supportive functions in cell therapy strategies. We found that the mesothelial cells of the human epicardium, like embryonic epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs) can form fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.

Current cell-based therapies, such as myoblast transplantation, have significant drawbacks of low survival rates and engraftment efficacy, mainly due {{to the absence of}} <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> microenvironment. Scaffolds that mimic the natural cell microenvironment provide a robust platform to support cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Electrospinning is a versatile technology platform used for fabricating the fiber scaffold that mimics the extracellular matrix. Thus, we aim to reconstitute the cell microenvironment through development of aligned fiber scaffolds by electrospinning as oriented muscle fibers create natural microenvironment of myogenic cells. In particular, aligned fiber scaffolds will be optimized in term of mechanical properties and fiber diameters as fiber curvature and mechanical stiffness provide significant physical cues for myogenic cell behaviors. Here, we fabricated and characterized electrospun polyester fiber scaffolds with different diameters from micro-scale to nano-scale. The mechanical properties of the fabricated nanofibers were found to be in the range of contractile muscles as evidenced from atomic force microscopy measurements. With these scaffolds, C 2 C 12 myoblasts were seeded and analyzed for the initial attachment. It was shown that aligned fibers with varying diameters resulted in different responses in cell attachment, indicating the role of cell topography sensing in cell-biomaterial interactions.

Each ampullary organ consists of a long canal (0. 2 - 1. 75 mm) passing perpendicular to the basement membrane, through the epidermis into underlying dermal connective tissues, curving thereafter to run roughly parallel to the epidermis. Histochemical staining techniques (Alcian blue and Lillie 2 ̆ 7 s allochrome) indicate that the canals contain a neutral to acidic glycoprotein-based mucopolysaccharide gel that varies in composition {{along the length of the}} canal. Collagen fibers, arranged in a sheath, surround a layer of squamous epithelium that lines each ampullary canal. At the proximal end of the canal, squamous cells are replaced by cuboidal epithelial cells that protrude into the lumen, thus constricting the lumen to form a small pore into the ampulla.

40|$|Pluripotential hematopoietic {{stem cells}} grow in close {{association}} with bone marrow stromal cells, which {{play a critical}} role in sustaining hematopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures. The mechanisms through which stromal cells act to support pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells are largely unknown. This study demonstrates that growth arrest-specific gene- 6 (GAS 6) plays an important role in this process. GAS 6 is a ligand for the Axl (Ufo/Ark), Sky (Dtk/Tyro 3 /Rse/Brt/Tif), and Mer (Eyk) family of tyrosine kinase receptors and binds to these receptors via tandem G domains at its C terminus. After translation, GAS 6 moves to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is extensively γ-carboxylated. The carboxylation process is vitamin K dependent, and current evidence suggests that GAS 6 must be γ-carboxylated to bind and activate any of the cognate tyrosine kinase receptors. Here, we show that expression of GAS 6 is highly correlated with the capacity of bone marrow stromal cells to support hematopoiesis in culture. Nonsupportive stromal cell lines express little to no GAS 6, whereas <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> lines express high levels of GAS 6. Transfection of the cDNA encoding GAS 6 into 3 T 3 fibroblasts is sufficient to render this previously nonsupportive cell line capable of supporting long-term hematopoietic cultures. 3 T 3 cells, genetically engineered to stably express GAS 6 (GAS 6 - 3 T 3), produce a stromal layer that supports the generation of colony-forming units in culture (CFU-c) for up to 6 wk. Hematopoietic support by genetically engineered 3 T 3 is not vitamin K dependent, and soluble recombinant GAS 6 does not substitute for coculturing the hematopoietic progenitors with genetically modified 3 T 3 cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: Free-living flatworms, in both {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, {{are able to}} adhere to and release from a substrate several times within a second. This reversible adhesion relies on adhesive organs comprised of three cell types: an adhesive gland cell, a releasing gland cell, and an anchor cell, which is a modified epidermal cell responsible for structural support. However, nothing is currently known about the molecules {{that are involved in}} this adhesion process. Results: In this study we present the detailed morphology of the adhesive organs of the free-living marine flatworm Macrostomum lignano. About 130 adhesive organs are located in a horse-shoe-shaped arc along the ventral side of the tail plate. Each organ consists of exactly three cells, an adhesive gland cell, a releasing gland cell, and an anchor cell. The necks of the two gland cells penetrate the anchor cell through a common pore. Modified microvilli of the anchor cell form a collar surrounding the necks of the adhesive- and releasing glands, jointly forming the papilla, the outer visible part of the adhesive organs. Next, we identified an intermediate filament (IF) gene, macif 1, which is expressed in the anchor cells. RNA interference mediated knock-down resulted in the first experimentally induced non-adhesion phenotype in any marine animal. Specifically, the absence of intermediate filaments in the anchor cells led to papillae with open tips, a reduction of the cytoskeleton network, a decline in hemidesmosomal connections, and to shortened microvilli containing less actin. Conclusion: Our findings reveal an elaborate biological adhesion system in a free-living flatworm, which permits impressively rapid temporary adhesion-release performance in the marine environment. We demonstrate that the structural integrity of the <b>supportive</b> <b>cell,</b> the anchor cell, is essential for this adhesion process: the knock-down of the anchor cell-specific intermediate filament gene resulted in the inability of the animals to adhere. The RNAi mediated changes of the anchor cell morphology are comparable to situations observed in human gut epithelia. Therefore, our current findings and future investigations using this powerful flatworm model system might contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the function of intermediate filaments and their associated human diseases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The cancer {{stem cell}} (CSC) theory implies that CSCs are {{surrounded}} by supportive stromal cells, which are known as the CSC niche. Stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) shows a multitude of functional effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, including migration and polarization. Therefore, the SDF- 1 -CXCR 4 axis {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of the progression, recurrence and metastasis of malignant diseases of the head and neck. In the present study, the CD 44 + HNSCC UM-SCC- 11 A cell line was used as a model for CSCs. The interaction between the UM-SCC- 11 A cells and the supportive microenvironmental cells, including fibrocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human microvascular vein endothelial cells (HMVECs) was evaluated. All the cell types that were tested were shown to secrete different concentrations of SDF- 1 into the surrounding culture medium [mean (m) fibro, 1243. 3 ± 156. 2 pg/ml; mHMVEC, 1061. 4 ± 23. 2 pg/ml; mHUVEC, 849. 6 ± 110. 9 pg/ml]. The migration of the UM-SCC- 11 A cells towards the supportive cells was increased by a higher supply of SDF- 1 (contrfibro, 315. 23 ± 61. 55 µm; mfibro, 477. 73 ± 143. 7 µm; Pfibro= 0. 003; contrHMVEC, 123. 41 ± 66. 68 µm; mHMVEC, 249. 04 ± 111. 95 µm; PHMVEC= 0. 004; contrHUVEC, 189. 7 ± 93. 26 µm; mHUVEC, 260. 82 ± 161. 58 µm). The amount of the UM-SCC- 11 A cells that migrated towards the differentiated fibrocytes was significantly higher than that which migrated towards the HMVECs or HUVECs (Pfibro/HMVEC= 2. 12 E- 11; Pfibro/HUVEC= 2. 28 E- 5). Cell-cell interaction by podia formation of the UM-SCC- 11 A cells was observed in all the <b>supportive</b> <b>cell</b> types that were tested. Broadly based cell-cell contacts were observed. By contrast, digitiform podia formations presented by the UM-SCC- 11 A cells were determined using fluorescence microscopy. The SDF‑ 1 ‑CXCR 4 axis is postu-lated to be a crucial pathway in the interaction between CSCs and their surrounding supportive cells. Understanding the cell-cell interactions in the CSC niche using in vitro models may aid in gaining further insight into these mechanisms and finding new strategies of therapy in this field...|$|E

In the derivation of human {{embryonic stem cell}} lines, embryos left over from in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures are used. The fact that the blastocyst is destroyed during the process has raised controversy and ethical concerns.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of ampullary organs in Plicofollis argyropleuron, {{collected from}} a southeast Queensland estuary, was examined by light and electron microscopy {{to assess the}} morphological characteristics of teleost ampullary organs in environments with fluctuating salinities. This catfish possesses both macroampullae and microampullae. Both have the typical teleost arrangement of an ampullary pore linked by a canal to a single ampulla that is lined with receptor and <b>supportive</b> <b>cells.</b> The canal wall of macroampullae consists of a collagen sheath, a basement membrane, and two layers of squamous epithelial cells adjacent to the lumen, joined by desmosomes and tight junctions near {{the surface of the}} epithelium. Ampullary pore diameters are similar in range for both the macroampullae and the microampullae, with microampullae always arising from the larger pores within a single region of the head. Canal length of the macroampullae is longer than those of the microampullae. Macroampullae also contain approximately 10 times as many receptor cells compared with the microampullae. In both organs, these pear-shaped receptor <b>cells</b> alternate with <b>supportive</b> <b>cells</b> along the entire luminal surface of the ampulla. The apical region of receptor cells extends into the lumen and bears numerous microvilli. The basal region of receptor cells adjoins to either individual or multiple unmyelinated neural terminals. The coexistence of two markedly different ampullary organ morphologies within a single species support theories concerning the possible multifunctionality of these sensory organs.

40|$|Background. Although astrocytes {{represent}} 50 % {{of cells}} in {{the central nervous system}} they were recognized as passive, <b>supportive</b> <b>cells</b> regulating homeostasis and creating the microenvironment suitable for neuronal cells to function. But lately, it was proven that astrocytes possess a unique feature – they are capable of changing their morphology and function throughout life in response to changes in brain microenvironment. Conclusions. They have important functions during development, adulthood and after the brain injury, when they actively participate in the regeneration process or form a scar after excessive neuron loss. Recently discovered functions of astrocytes are: equal partnership in tripartite synapse and active regulation of generation and maintenance of synapses in central nervous system. </em...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{neural crest}} is first recognizable {{at the onset}} of neurulation as the neural folds appose to form the neural tube. Neural crest cells emigrate from the dorsal neural tube shortly after tube closure. From this site of origin, they migrate extensively and differentiate into a wide variety of derivatives. Neural crest-derived cell types include neurons and <b>supportive</b> <b>cells</b> of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, several neurosecretory cell types, bone and car tilage of the face, and adrenal chromaffin cells. Because of the migratory ability of neural crest cells and the diversity of crest derivatives, this transient embryonic structure provides an important model system for studying interactions involved in cell movement and differentiation...|$|R
50|$|Gliosarcoma {{is a rare}} type of glioma, {{a cancer}} {{of the brain that}} comes from glial, or <b>supportive,</b> brain <b>cells,</b> as opposed to the neural brain cells. Gliosarcoma is a {{malignant}} cancer, and is defined as a glioblastoma consisting of gliomatous and sarcomatous components.|$|R

New work shows how manipulation of <b>supportive</b> stromal <b>cells</b> to provide essential Delta-Notch interactions allows embryonic stem cells to develop into functional T lymphocytes during in vitro culture...|$|R
40|$|Although {{autologous}} nerve grafting is {{the gold}} standard treatment of peripheral nerve injuries, several alternative methods have been developed, including nerve conduits that use <b>supportive</b> <b>cells.</b> However, the seeding efficacy and viability of <b>supportive</b> <b>cells</b> injected in nerve grafts remain unclear. Here, we focused on a novel completely biological, tissue-engineered, scaffold-free conduit. We developed six scaffold-free conduits from human normal dermal fibroblasts using a Bio 3 D Printer. Twelve adult male rats with immune deficiency underwent mid-thigh-level transection of the right sciatic nerve. The resulting 5 -mm nerve gap was bridged using 8 -mm Bio 3 D conduits (Bio 3 D group, n = 6) and silicone tube (silicone group, n = 6). Several assessments were conducted to examine nerve regeneration eight weeks post-surgery. Kinematic analysis revealed that the toe angle to the metatarsal bone at the final segment of the swing phase was significantly higher in the Bio 3 D group than the silicone group (- 35. 78 ± 10. 68 versus - 62. 48 ± 6. 15, respectively; p < 0. 01). Electrophysiological studies revealed significantly higher compound muscle action potential in the Bio 3 D group than the silicone group (53. 60 ± 26. 36 % versus 2. 93 ± 1. 84 %; p < 0. 01). Histological and morphological studies revealed neural cell expression in all regions of the regenerated nerves {{and the presence of}} many well-myelinated axons in the Bio 3 D group. The wet muscle weight of the tibialis anterior muscle was significantly higher in the Bio 3 D group than the silicone group (0. 544 ± 0. 063 versus 0. 396 ± 0. 031, respectively; p < 0. 01). We confirmed that scaffold-free Bio 3 D conduits composed entirely of fibroblast cells promote nerve regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve model...|$|R
