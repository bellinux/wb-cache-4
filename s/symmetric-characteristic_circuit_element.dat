40|$|Abstract—To {{judge whether}} the memristor can be {{interpreted}} as the fourth fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> we propose a variable-relation criterion of fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>elements.</b> According to the criterion, we investigate the nature of three fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> and the memristor. From the perspective of variables relation, the memristor builds a direct relation between the voltage across it and the current through it, instead of a direct relation between the magnetic flux and the charge. Thus, it is better to characterize the memristor and the resistor as two special cases of the same fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> which is the memristive system in Chua’s new framework. Finally, the definition of memristor is refined according to the difference between the magnetic flux and the flux linkage...|$|R

30|$|In circuit quantum electrodynamics, the {{controllable}} {{interaction of}} <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> {{is a highly}} desirable resource for quantum computation and quantum simulation experiments. The most common method is a static capacitive or inductive coupling between cavities and/or qubits. In such a system, exchange of excitations can be controlled by either tuning the <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> {{in and out of}} resonance or using sideband transitions [1 – 4]. While this approach has proven to be useful for few coupled <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> it seems impracticable for larger systems, where it is hard to provide sufficient detunings between all <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> [5]. Therefore, one may alternatively use tunable coupling elements such as qubits [6 – 9] or SQUIDs [10 – 15]. One particular example for an interesting application of such actively coupled <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> are quantum simulations of bosonic many-body Hamiltonians [16 – 20]. In such a scenario, the bosonic degrees of freedom can be represented by networks of (possibly nonlinear) superconducting resonators. For this quantum simulator, a tunable coupler would constitute an important control knob. A more general scope of this device is the controllable routing of photonic states on a chip, which is interesting for quantum information as well as quantum simulation experiments.|$|R
