40|$|BACKGROUND: Congenital {{heart disease}} is present in 44 - 56 % of fetuses with Down {{syndrome}} (DS). There are, however, signs that hearts in DS without apparent structural heart defects also differ {{from those in the}} normal population. We aimed to compare the atrioventricular (AV) <b>septum</b> and <b>valves</b> in 3 groups: DS without AV septal defect (DS no-AVSD), DS with AVSD (DS AVSD) and control hearts. METHODS: The ventricular septum, membranous <b>septum</b> and AV <b>valves</b> were examined and measured in histological sections of 15 DS no-AVSD, 8 DS AVSD and 34 control hearts. In addition, the ventricular septum length was measured on ultrasound images of fetal (6 DS AVSD, 9 controls) and infant (10 DS no-AVSD, 10 DS AVSD, 10 controls) hearts. RESULTS: The membranous septum was 3 times larger in DS no-AVSD fetuses compared to control fetuses, and valve dysplasia was frequently (64 %) observed. The ventricular septum was shorter in patients with DS both with and without AVSD, as compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: DS no-AVSD hearts are not normal as they have a larger membranous septum, shorter ventricular septum and dysplasia of the AV valves as compared to control hearts...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Primary cardiac sarcomas are {{extremely}} rare, but aggressive, tumours. The median survival with conventional treatment is 6 – 12 months. Recent {{data suggest that}} a radical multidisciplinary approach may improve patient outcome. We sought to evaluate our institutional experience with these tumours. METHODS: A multidisciplinary cardiac tumour programme was established 3 years ago based on the experience and support of our collaborating institution. Treatment consisted of pre- and postoperative chemotherapy, complete (R 0) resection of the tumour with structural reconstruction and radiation therapy in selected cases. Left atrial tumours were resected using the cardiac autotransplantation technique. Bovine pericardium was used to reconstruct free-chamber walls or the <b>septum.</b> <b>Valves</b> were replaced by bioprostheses. A variety of autologous, allogeneic and synthetic vascular grafts were used to reconstruct the aorta, pulmonary arteries (PAs) and coronary arteries. RESULTS: Seven patients (3 males), age 51 ± 11 years (35 – 63), underwent eight operations. Tumour sites were PAs in 2 patients, left atrium in 3, right atrium in 2 and both great vessels in 1. Complete resection was achieved in all cases. There was no operative mortal-ity. Two patients required implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Median survival was 24 months. Three patients died of metastatic disease and 1 sudden death 7, 23, 31 and 33 months after diagnosis. Three patients are alive at 2, 8 and 33 months, in functional Class I or II.

40|$|AbstractThe {{heart is}} divided into four {{chambers}} by membranous septa and valves. Although evidence suggests that formation of the membranous septa requires migration of neural crest cells into the developing heart, the functional significance of these neural crest cells {{in the development of}} the endocardial cushion, an embryonic tissue that gives rise to the membranous appendages, is largely unknown. Mice defective in the protease region of Meltrin β/ADAM 19 show ventricular septal defects and defects in valve formation. In this study, by expressing Meltrin β in either endothelial or neural crest cell lineages, we showed that Meltrin β expressed in neural crest cells but not in endothelial cells was required for formation of the ventricular <b>septum</b> and <b>valves.</b> Although Meltrin β-deficient neural crest cells migrated into the heart normally, they could not properly fuse the right and left ridges of the cushion tissues in the proximal outflow tract (OT), and this led to defects in the assembly of the OT and AV cushions forming the ventricular septum. These results genetically demonstrated a critical role of cardiac neural crest cells expressing Meltrin β in triggering fusion of the proximal OT cushions and in formation of the ventricular septum...|$|R

Any of these three mechanisms may be operative during paradoxic embolism in the absence of elevation of right ventricular pressures...|$|R

40|$|Congenital heart defects affect almost 1 % {{of human}} newborns. Recently, {{mutations}} in Notch ligands and receptors {{have been found}} to cause a variety of heart defects in rodents and humans. However, the molecular effects downstream of Notch are still poorly understood. Here we report that combined inactivation of Hey 1 and HeyL, two primary target genes of Notch, causes severe heart malformations, including membranous ventricular septal defects and dysplastic atrioventricular and pulmonary valves. These defects lead to congestive cardiac failure with high lethality. We found both genes to be coexpressed with Notch 1, Notch 2 and the Notch ligand Jagged 1 in the endocardium of the atrioventricular canal, representing the primary source of mesenchymal cells forming membraneous <b>septum</b> and <b>valves.</b> Atrioventricular explants from Hey 1 /HeyL deficient mice exhibited impaired epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Although epithelial to mesenchymal transition was initiated regularly, full transformation into mesenchymal cells failed. This was accompanied by reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 expression and reduced cell density in endocardial cushions in vivo. We further show that loss of Hey 2 leads to very similar deficiencies, whereas a Notch 1 null mutation completely abolishes epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Thus, the Hey gene family shows overlap in controlling Notch induced endocardial epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process critical for <b>valve</b> and <b>septum</b> formation...|$|R

At operation, the myxoma was completely excised from its attachment to the atrial <b>septum.</b> The mitral <b>valve</b> looked anatomically normal but the mitral annulus was dilated. The intraoperative Trans Oesophageal Echocardiogram (TOE) on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass confirmed a dilated mitral annulus with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). We elected not to place an annuloplasty ring in anticipation of improvement with postoperative remodelling. However, mitral regurgitation worsened after discharge becoming moderately severe and remains so after 1 year follow-up despite optimal medical treatment. This case suggests that annular dilatation can result from mechanical dilatation by a large left atrial myxoma. Intraoperative mitral valve annuloplasty should be considered in the presence of moderate MR as postoperative remodelling does not occur...|$|R

The mechanisms of CHD induction in the offspring of women with pregestational diabetes remain elusive. With an ever-increasing rate of diabetes in young adults, there is a pressing need to understand the underlying mechanisms and initiate effective preventative strategies. The aim of this thesis is to study the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling in heart morphogenesis, unravel molecular mechanisms of CHDs induced by pregestational diabetes and provide new insights on potential therapeutic strategies. To this end, a mouse model of pregestational diabetes induced by streptozotocin was employed. A spectrum of septal, conotruncal and coronary artery malformation were identified in the offspring of mice with pregestational diabetes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated and glutathione levels were diminished in the fetal hearts of diabetic female mice. Oral treatment with an antioxidant, N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), significantly diminished the incidence of CHDs and prevented coronary artery malformation in the offspring of pregestational diabetic mice. Furthermore, pregestational diabetes reduced cell proliferation, altered transcript levels, and disrupted epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the fetal heart of pregestational diabetic mice, which were all prevented by NAC treatment. To further study the role of basal ROS production in embryonic heart development, a NADPH oxidase Nox 2 knockout mouse was utilized. We demonstrated that loss of Nox 2 expression decreased ROS production, and impaired TGF-β/BMP signalling and endocardial EMT in embryonic hearts. This ultimately resulted in cardiac <b>septum</b> and <b>valve</b> defects. Thus, under normal physiological conditions ROS production promotes heart development whereas excess ROS levels during pregestational diabetes induce CHDs. These studies show maintaining a balance of ROS levels is essential for normal embryonic heart development in mice. Furthermore, NAC may have a therapeutic potential in preventing the development of CHDs during pregestational diabetes...|$|R
30|$|We found a {{systematic}} underestimation of EDV and ESV by QGS and cREPO compared to CMR, {{which is consistent}} with previous studies comparing gated SPECT and CMR [16 – 18]. There could be several underlying mechanisms why gated SPECT underestimates LV volumes. CMR has higher spatial resolution compared to SPECT, which affects delineation of the endocardial border resulting in larger endocardial volumes with CMR. According to general practice of CMR, epicardial and endocardial borders in the ED and ES phase of the cardiac cycle are manually drawn for LV quantification. Here, the manual tracing of the endocardial borders usually includes the papillary and trabecular muscles in the blood volume [13]. In cardiac SPECT, however, trabecular and papillary muscles are avid to perfusion tracers and can be inevitably excluded from the blood volume. CMR allows inclusion of the membranous part of the ventricular <b>septum,</b> the atrioventricular <b>valve</b> plane, and LV outflow tract as a part of LV cavity, which are not part of LV volume acquisition with gated SPECT [17, 18]. Taken together, these factors may contribute to underestimation of the basal LV volume with gated SPECT.|$|R

To examine this hypothesis, we performed {{a detailed analysis of}} the developing cardiac conduction system using the recently described CCS-lacZ transgenic mouse strain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Transgenic embryos (E 9. 5 - 15. 5) were stained for beta-galactosidase activity and co-stained with the myocardial marker HHF 35. Results were reconstructed three dimensionally. CCS-lacZ expression was observed in the sinoatrial node, left and right venous <b>valves,</b> <b>septum</b> spurium, right and left atrioventricular ring, His bundle, bundle branches, and right ventricular moderator band. Furthermore, lacZ-positive cells could be demonstrated {{for the first time in}} the left atrium, in the posterior wall surrounding the pulmonary venous orifice. and, in later stages, surrounding the pulmonary venous wall. These cells were continuous with the left venous valve in the right atrium. LacZ-positive tissue also could be identified in Bachmann's bundle, running retro-aortically between the right atrium and left atrium. CONCLUSION: Known arrhythmogenic areas including Bachmann's bundle, the pulmonary veins, and sinus venosus derived internodal structures, demonstrate lacZ expression.

40|$|Alveolar {{rhabdomyosarcoma}} is {{a pediatric}} disease {{specified by the}} recurrent chromosome translocations t(2; 13) and t(1; 13). These translocations result {{in the formation of}} the PAX 3 -FKHR and PAX 7 -FKHR fusion genes, which are thought to play a causal role in the genesis of this disease. Although PAX 3 -FKHR exhibits transforming activity in immortalized fibroblast cell lines, a direct role of this fusion protein in tumorigenesis in vivo has not been shown. We determined whether expression of Pax 3 -FKHR in the mouse germ line would render these animals prone to the development of rhabdomyosarcomas. By targeting FKHR cDNA sequences into the Pax 3 locus of embryonic stem cells, we used these cells to generate mice carrying a Pax 3 -FKHR knock-in allele. Despite low expression of the knock-in allele, heterozygous offspring of Pax 3 -FKHR chimeric mice showed developmental abnormalities. These included intraventricular <b>septum</b> defects, tricuspid <b>valve</b> insufficiency, and diaphragm defects, which caused congestive heart failure leading to perinatal death. In addition, Pax 3 -FKHR heterozygous offspring displayed malformations of some but not all hypaxial muscles. However, neither newborn heterozygous pups nor their chimeric parents showed any signs of malignancy. We conclude that the Pax 3 -FKHR allele causes lethal developmental defects in knock-in mice but might be insufficient to cause muscle tumors...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to review the current {{knowledge}} on atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) (Part 1), to study the pathogenesis of AVSD (Part 2) and finally to analyze cardiac outcome long-term after AVSD correction (Part 3).

40|$|International audienceRationale: Cardiac {{neural crest}} cells (NCs) {{contribute}} to heart morphogenesis by {{giving rise to}} a variety of cell types from mesenchyme of the outflow tract, ventricular <b>septum,</b> and semilunar <b>valves</b> to neurons of the cardiac ganglia and smooth muscles of the great arteries. Failure in cardiac NC development results in outflow and ventricular septation defects commonly observed in congenital heart diseases. Cardiac NCs derive from the vagal neural tube, which also gives rise to enteric NCs that colonize the gut; however, so far, molecular mechanisms segregating these 2 populations and driving cardiac NC migration toward the heart have remained elusive. Objective: Stromal-derived factor- 1 (SDF 1) is a chemokine that mediates oriented migration of multiple embryonic cells and mice deficient for Sdf 1 or its receptors, Cxcr 4 and Cxcr 7, exhibit ventricular septum defects, raising the possibility that SDF 1 might selectively drive cardiac NC migration toward the heart via a chemotactic mechanism. Methods and Results: We show in the chick embryo that Sdf 1 expression is tightly coordinated with the progression of cardiac NCs expressing Cxcr 4. Cxcr 4 loss-of-function causes delayed migration and enhanced death of cardiac NCs, whereas Sdf 1 misexpression results in their diversion from their normal pathway, indicating that SDF 1 acts as a chemoattractant for cardiac NCs. These alterations of SDF 1 signaling result in severe cardiovascular defects. Conclusions: These data identify Sdf 1 and its receptor Cxcr 4 as candidate genes responsible for cardiac congenital pathologies in human...|$|R

Five important hemodynamic and anatomic features considered to be components or successful reconstructive surgery were specifically addressed. 1) Interatrialcommunication: Only two patients had a measured pressure difference of > 4 mm Hg across the atrial <b>septum.</b> 2) Tricuspid <b>valve</b> function:Angiography demonstrated significant tricuspid valve regurgitation in only five patients (moderate in two and severe in three). 3) Aortic arch:Pressure tracings from the right ventricle to the descending aorta revealed a gradient > 25 mm Hg in only two patients. 4) Pulmonary vasculatare:Ten patients had a calculated pulmonary vascular resistance > 4 U · m 2; 51 (86 %) of the 59 patients had no evidence of distortion (stenosis or hypoplasia) of either the left or the right pulmonary artery. 5) Right ventricular function:Five patients had an end-diastolic pressure in the right ventricle > 12 mm Hg and two patients had qualitative assessment of decreased ventricular function. Comparison of catheterization data between survivors and nonsurvivors of the subsequent modified Fontan procedure showed that only significant tricuspid regurgitation is a possible predictor of poor outcome.

40|$|Data on the {{morphogenesis}} of atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) in Down syndrome {{are lacking}} to support molecular studies on Down syndrome heart critical region. Therefore, we studied {{the development of}} complete AVSD in human embryos and fetuses with trisomy 21 using 3 -dimensional graphic reconstructions and immunohistochemical markers. Eight trisomic hearts with AVSD and 10 normal hearts, ranging from 5 to 16 weeks' gestation, were examined. In AVSD, the muscular septum primum and venous valves develop normally, and the size and histology of the nonfused endocardial cushions also appear normal. However, the mass of extracardiac mesenchyme (vestibular spine), located at the dorsal mesocardium, is reduced and does not protrude ventrally along the right wall of the common pulmonary vein. As a result of this, the muscular septum primum and the right pulmonary ridge are seen as 2 separate septa that attach to the inferior endocardial cushion. Both the muscular septum primum and the superiorly fused venous <b>valves</b> (<b>septum</b> spurium) converge and are capped by a small rim of mesenchyme, which forms {{the roof of the}} persisting ostium primum and connects to cushions and the reduced vestibular spine. At 7 weeks, ventricular septation in AVSD is comparable to 5 to 6 weeks of normal cardiac development. At later stages, the septum spurium forms the anterosuperior limbus of the septum secundum and the mesenchymal cap becomes the bridging tendon that connects the bridging leaflets. Therefore, reduced expansion of the vestibular spine derived from the dorsal mesocardium appears {{to play an important role}} in the development of AVSD in Down syndrom...|$|R

In this study, {{for the first time we}} obtained a SERT-knockout (KO) mouse model which reproduces SIDS phenotype. SERT-KO mice were generated by mating SERT(Cre/+) heterozygous mice. The SERT-KO mouse embryos at the pre-natal stage E 18. 5 were lacking of SERT mRNA and protein expression in the heart. A premature death of 75 % of SERT-KO mice occurred in the first week after birth. LacZ staining of whole mounts and tissue sections of the heart from SERT(Cre/+);ROSA 26 R adult mice and E 18. 5 embryos demonstrated a marked localized expression of SERT in the right ventricle, the conal region, the vasculature, the atrial <b>septum,</b> the ventricular <b>valves,</b> and the sinoatrial node of the conduction system. These data suggest a cardiac phenotype for the sudden death of SERT-KO mice. Histological analysis of heart sections showed that SERT-KO mice develop cardiac fibrosis. Increased collagen accumulation in the myocardium and the valvular and perivascular regions, and enhanced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin were detected in the heart of SERT-KO mice versus wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, higher expression levels of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor and increased levels of phospho-SMAD 2 / 3 and phospho-ERK 1 / 2 were detected in SERT-KO mouse heart versus WT mice.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} nature and pathogenesis of malformations of the atrioventricular canal in relation to normal cardiogenesis. Serial histologic sections of normal human embryos and fetuses were made, from which three-dimensional images were reconstructed to show {{the relationship between the}} developing heart and its surrounding structures, and the course of development of the atrial <b>septum</b> and atrioventricular <b>valves.</b> Based on these reconstructions and on examination of the hearts of 59 patients with atrioventricular canal malformations, it is suggested that the spectrum of atrioventricular malformations may arise as a result of reduced compression of the developing atria by surrounding structures during embryonic Stages 13 through 18. Comparison of hearts with atrioventricular canal defects with normal embryos indicated that the malformations may be classified as primitive canals, complete canals, or partial canals, corresponding to failure of completion of normal development in Stages 14 through 18. In primitive canal the atrial septum was absent or had only a portion of septum primum. In complete canal both atrial septums were present, but the atrioventricular valve material was not subdivided and the four chambers were in communication. In partial canal, the atrioventricular valve was divided, but atrial and ventricular septal defects and valve clefts were present in varying degrees of severity. It is proposed that the spectrum of cardiac abnormalities which constitutes atrioventricular canal malformations may be understood as arising from varying degrees of lack of normal compression of the developing heart by surrounding structures.

The left and right coronary arteries are of equal size, forming a balanced circulation. Numerous homocoronary and intercoronary anastomoses are present. The venous drainage of the ostrich heart corresponds in the main to that of the fowl. Four major systems of veins are seen with multiple anastomoses between them.

The intra-atrial openings of the left cardiac, left cardiac circumflex and dorsal cardiac veins lie near to but separate from each other in a sinus below the intra-atrial opening of the left cranial vena cava. The dorsal cardiac vein consists of two branches.

40|$|Specific {{types and}} subtypes of cardiac defects have been {{described}} in children with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome {{as well as in}} other genetic syndromes. The conotruncal heart defects occurring in patients with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome include tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch, isolated anomalies of the aortic arch, and ventricular septal defect. These conotruncal heart defects are frequently associated in this syndrome with additional cardiovascular anomalies of the aortic arch, pulmonary arteries, infundibular <b>septum,</b> and semilunar <b>valves</b> complicating cardiac anatomy and surgical treatment. In this review we describe the surgical anatomy, the operative treatment, and the prognostic results of the cardiac defects associated with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome. According to the current literature, in patients with tetralogy of Fallot with/without pulmonary atresia and truncus arteriosus, in spite of the complex cardiac anatomy, the presence of 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome does not worsen the surgical prognosis. On the contrary in children with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and probably in those with interrupted aortic arch the association with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome is probably a risk factor for the operative treatment. The complex cardiovascular anatomy in association with depressed immunological status, pulmonary vascular reactivity, neonatal hypocalcemia, bronchomalacia and broncospasm, laryngeal web, and tendency to airway bleeding must be considered at the time of diagnosis and surgical procedure. Specific diagnostic, surgical, and perioperative protocols should be applied in order to provide appropriate treatment and to reduce surgical mortality and morbidity. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesHypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} is a rare, {{autosomal dominant}} cardiac disorder characterized by hypertrophy of the interventricular <b>septum</b> and mitral <b>valve</b> abnormalities. Case reportA 25 -year old female, second gestation, with {{a diagnosis of}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy {{for four years and}} history of mild intermittent asthma controlled with sporadical use of corticosteroids. On physical exam, the patient had a IV/VI systolic and plurifocal heart murmur and accentuated scoliosis with palpable intervertebral spaces. She complained of occasional palpitations during pregnancy, and was treated with 100 mg of atenolol a day. Complete blood count, creatinine, and electrolytes were within normal limits; echocardiogram showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy predominantly septal and ejection fraction of 0. 76 %. The patient underwent emergency labor giving birth to a live female fetus, Apgar 9 / 9, without maternal and fetal hemodynamic complications. The patient was scheduled for bilateral partial salpingectomy. During the interview, the patient refused general anesthesia for the procedure. A decision was made for combined regional blockade. The surgical procedure lasted 20 minutes during which changes in blood pressure and heart rate were up to 10 % lower than baseline levels without immediate hemodynamic or surgical complications. ConclusionsAbsolute maternal mortality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is very low and it is usually seen in patients with high risk factors. Evidence does not show an increased risk of regional blocks in females with HC when it is used for vaginal delivery. Both general anesthesia and regional blocks were successfully used without complication for cesarean sections in patients with HC...|$|R
40|$|Nasal airway {{obstruction}} can {{be associated}} to a deviated <b>septum</b> or nasal <b>valve</b> collapse {{with or without}} anatomical obstructions (polyps). Furthermore, the architectural defect can involve the aesthetics of the nasal dorsum and tip. The purpose of the Author is a new technique of simultaneous spreader grafting of the nasal vault and {{the rotation of the}} tip in the desired position. 10 patients affected by light (4) to severe (6) nasal obstruction were treated from 2001 to 2003 with a new technique of nasal spreading. This technique is performed with an open approach. The upper part of the lateral crus is splitted androtated medially and therefore inserted in a precise pocket between thenasal septum and the upper lateral. The cartilages are fixed pulling upthe nasal domes and tip with PDS 5 - 0. The dorsal part of the lateralcrus can be adjusted with a scalpel creating a supratip break and tipsupport. Also the spreading gives an anatomically related quantity ofcartilage and dorsal enlargement. There is no scarring and no need ofcartilage harvesting, all 10 patients had an improvement in nasal airway (scale 1 to 10), 6 patients with a clinical score of 7 and 4 patients with a clinical score of 10. Nobody complained for the open approach scarring and all had a good aesthetic result, with a stable upward rotation of the tip after 2 years. Nor displacement of the sutured cartilagen neither infections or hematoma was observed in 100 % of patients, we propose a new technique of nasal spreading that cannot substitute the conventional use of dorsal spreaders, but can be an aid in cases of thi...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe tricuspid annulus (TA) is {{a complex}} {{structure}} that has been rarely evaluated. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3 D-TEE) gives us the unique opportunity to evaluate TA shape and dimensions. Methods 3 D dynamic volumetric datas of the TA were acquired by TEE using a matrix array transducer (X 7 - 2 t, Philips) in 184 patients. Multiplanar reconstructions were performed offline using a dedicated software (QLab 7, Philips). Long-axis (LA) diameter, short-axis (SA) diameter and {{the area of the}} TA {{at the time of its}} maximal opening were measured. The eccentricity index (EI) of the TA was defined as LA/SA and TA orientation as the angle between the interatrial <b>septum</b> axis (aortic <b>valve</b> on the top at 0 °) and the LA in the surgical view. ResultsMorphology of TA was more often oval (EI= 1. 35 ± 0. 22) but shapes were significantly different among indivuals, from circular to oval (EI values from 1 to 2. 15). TA dilatation occurred homogeneously in all the directions of the right ventricle free wall as attested by the very good correlation between the TA area and both LA (r= 0. 89, p< 0. 0001) and SA (r= 0. 88, p< 0. 0001). TA dilatation, as shown by increase in TA area, was associated with a small decrease of EI (r=- 0. 21, p< 0. 0001), thus a trend to a more circular TA. All orientations of TA were observed, from 5 to 175 ° (mean= 87 °± 57 °) with a bimodal distribution (most frequently at 40 ° and 150 °). Conclusion 3 D-TEE allowed a good assessment of the TA shape and orientation, which is significantly different among individuals. This method could be interesting to improve assessment of TA dilatation before left-heart valve surgery. Abstract 0402 – Figur...|$|R
