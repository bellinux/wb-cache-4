5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music.

Some of the countess' jointure manors lay in the castle's vicinity, while at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had been assigned to the younger Dudley's inheritance by the overseers of Leicester's will.

5|$|The icon of fearless {{and noble}} Dacians as {{predecessors}} to modern Romanians was augmented and impressed by nationalist {{movements in the}} late 1920s and 1930s.

This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E

5|$|The new Form of Government {{was much}} more {{acceptable}} to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
