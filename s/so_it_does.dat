5|$|The rotor of the Wankel {{engine is}} shaped as a {{curvilinear}} triangle {{that is often}} cited {{as an example of}} a Reuleaux triangle. However, its curved sides are somewhat flatter than those of a Reuleaux triangle and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have constant width.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle between life and death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles latch onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E

25|$|The {{area has}} a {{maritime}} climate {{like most of}} the UK. The area rarely sees substantial snowfall and temperatures rarely fall below –5°C <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have frequent frosts. Banks generally has moderate precipitation, unlike the rest of western UK.|$|E

25|$|Formaldehyde {{does not}} {{accumulate}} in the environment, {{because it is}} broken down {{within a few hours}} by sunlight or by bacteria present in soil or water. Humans metabolize formaldehyde quickly, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not accumulate, converting it to formic acid in the body.|$|E
25|$|Immunity to {{electromagnetic}} interference: Light transmission through {{optical fibers}} is unaffected by other electromagnetic radiation nearby. The optical fiber is electrically non-conductive, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not {{act as an}} antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals.

25|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from their one blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh {{air into the}} lungs. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification. The spout only forms when warm air from the lungs meets cold air, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not form in warmer climates, as with river dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Waxing is a {{mechanical}} {{process that is}} performed {{with the intention of}} plucking the hair, which also functions as {{a mechanical}} exfoliant. It can be done every two to eight weeks. It is not carried out as frequently as many exfoliate. <b>So,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not fully substitute for a regimen, but may substitute for a normal session in a regimen.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other. This means that one experiences {{the presence of}} God through one’s relation to other people. To know God is to know what must be done, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not make sense to speak of God as what God is, but rather what God commands.|$|E

25|$|Veggie Crunch Burger - The {{vegetarian}} burger {{was launched}} in the Singapore market on 6 September 2016. Its patty is made {{with a mixture of}} unto 7 types of vegetables, including green peas, carrots, tomatoes, capsicum, beans etc. However, its dressings contain garlic and eggs. The patty is fried in the same oil used for frying apple pies <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not come in contact with meat products. The burger has received good reviews.|$|E
25|$|A different, {{and more}} {{recently}} developed, statistic which {{is also used to}} gauge the effectiveness of batsmen is the strike rate. It measures a different concept however – how quickly the batsman scores (number of runs from 100 balls) – <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not supplant the role of batting average. It is used particularly in limited overs matches, where the speed at which a batsman scores is more important than it is in first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not get killed by the sweetness of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by {{the sweetness of the}} dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E

25|$|Cooling air is airflow that is {{injected}} through small {{holes in the}} liner to generate a layer (film) of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of cooling air has to be carefully designed <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as cooling air. There are several different methods of injecting this cooling air, and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to (see Liner, above).|$|E
25|$|Off-axis or offset feed– The {{reflector}} is an asymmetrical {{segment of}} a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, are located {{to one side}} of the dish. The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the beam path, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, below.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} {{emphasize that}} the system is not a performance enhancement nor a replacement for safe driving practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available traction between the tyres and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe hydroplaning scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be in contact with the road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|E
