5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black <b>stork</b> may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black <b>stork</b> wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white <b>stork,</b> woolly-necked <b>stork</b> (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black <b>stork</b> also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|Because of Billingsley's long-standing {{friendship}} with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the <b>Stork</b> Club was bugged. During {{his work on}} the <b>Stork</b> Club book, author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein's FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the <b>Stork</b> Club incident was overblown.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Storks</b> of Oettingen: <b>Storks</b> {{have been}} nesting in Oettingen {{at least since}} the time of Count Ludwig XVI (more than 400 years ago), and Ludwig was {{supposedly}} a friend of the <b>storks.</b> According to legend, when the Count left the town after the Schmalkaldic War, the <b>storks</b> also moved away and did not come back. It was not until much later, in 1563 when the count came back that the <b>storks,</b> too, returned to the town and have remained there to this day.|$|R

5|$|Hunters {{threaten}} the black <b>stork</b> {{in some countries}} of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black <b>stork</b> vanished from the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the Parco Lombardo del Ticino {{in an attempt to}} re-establish the species there.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Stork</b> Club {{was also}} {{featured}} in several movies, including The <b>Stork</b> Club (1945), Executive Suite (1954), Artists and Models (1955), and My Favorite Year (1982). Billingsley received $100,000 {{for the use}} of the club's name in the 1945 film. In All About Eve (1950), the characters played by Bette Davis, Gary Merrill, Anne Baxter and George Sanders are shown in the Cub Room of the <b>Stork</b> Club. The Alfred Hitchcock film The Wrong Man (1957) starred Henry Fonda as real-life <b>Stork</b> Club bassist Christopher Emanuel Balestrero ("Manny"), who was falsely accused of committing robberies around New York City. Scenes involving Balestrero playing the bass were actually shot at the club. The film's screenplay, written by Maxwell Anderson, was based on a true story originally published in Life.|$|E

50|$|Emmy of <b>Stork's</b> Nest is a 1915 silent film {{directed}} by William Nigh. The film {{is based on}} the novel <b>Stork's</b> Nest by J. Breckenridge Ellis and was shot on location.|$|R
5|$|The black <b>stork</b> hosts {{more than}} 12 species of helminth, with Cathaemasia hians and Dicheilonema ciconiae {{reported}} {{to be the most}} dominant. The juvenile black <b>stork,</b> although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A new species of Corynebacterium—C. ciconiae—has been isolated from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought {{to be part of the}} natural flora of the species. A diverse array of predatory mesostigmatid mites—particularly the genera Dendrolaelaps and Macrocheles—have been recovered from black <b>stork</b> nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>stork</b> is {{a member}} of the genus Ciconia, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by {{straight}} bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black <b>stork</b> was long thought to be most closely related to the white <b>stork</b> (C. ciconia). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus Ciconia. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>stork</b> prefers more wooded areas {{than the}} better-known white <b>stork,</b> and breeds in large marshy {{wetlands}} with interspersed coniferous or broadleaved woodlands, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of creeks. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The black <b>stork</b> does inhabit more agricultural {{areas in the}} Caspian lowlands, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered on dry land.|$|E
50|$|Ed Hoet also {{pitched in}} the second match of the day giving away only two base hits. <b>Storks</b> {{themselves}} created eleven base hits. <b>Storks</b> took an early lead and scored four runs {{in the very first}} inning. They added another three runs {{in the second}} inning, securing their third consecutive title. The match eventually ended in an 11-1 win by <b>Storks,</b> taking only 4½ inning.|$|R

50|$|<b>Storks</b> {{dwell in}} many regions and tend to live in drier {{habitats}} than the closely related herons, spoonbills and ibises; they also lack the powder down that those groups use to clean off fish slime. Bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Many species are migratory. Most <b>storks</b> eat frogs, fish, insects, earthworms, small birds and small mammals. There are nineteen living species of <b>storks</b> in six genera.|$|R

50|$|She {{declared}} that in 1984, {{during the first}} camp, they counted about 3,100 raptors and <b>storks,</b> and 1,100 shots — and in 2000, {{just a little bit}} less than 35,000 raptors and <b>storks,</b> and 5 shots.|$|R
50|$|The lagoons are {{a feeding}} area for {{hundreds}} of waterfowl including wood <b>storks,</b> endangered jabiru <b>storks,</b> black-bellied whistling ducks, sandpipers, and others. Many of the birds use the sanctuary as a transmigration point during their seasonal journeys.|$|R
5000|$|Kaggaladu Heronry: This {{is located}} in Tumkur {{district}} {{and is one of}} the largest painted <b>storks</b> sanctuary in South India. Some of the birds that nest here are painted <b>storks,</b> grey herons, pelicans, black stilts and ducks.|$|R
5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white <b>stork,</b> black <b>stork,</b> Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
5|$|The black <b>stork</b> has a {{wider range}} of calls than the white <b>stork,</b> its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} adult {{remains in the}} nest {{for two to three}} weeks after {{hatching}} to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black <b>stork</b> parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. <b>Stork</b> nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|The Ituri Forest, a later {{addition}} to the Safari Africa section, brought {{in the concept of}} a washed-out African river bank. The area includes a wide array of species, including greater flamingos, pygmy hippopotamuses, saddle-billed <b>storks</b> and shoebill <b>storks.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Storks</b> are large, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long, stout bills. <b>Storks</b> are mute, but bill-clattering is an {{important}} mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory.|$|R
5000|$|New World {{vultures}} were {{traditionally placed}} {{in a family of}} their own in the Falconiformes. [...] However, in the late 20th century some ornithologists argued that they are more closely related to <b>storks</b> on the basis of karyotype, morphological, and behavioral data. Thus some authorities placed them in the Ciconiiformes with <b>storks</b> and herons; Sibley and Monroe (1990) even considered them a subfamily of the <b>storks.</b> This was criticized, and an early DNA sequence study was based on erroneous data and subsequently retracted. There was then an attempt to raise the New World vultures to the rank of an independent order, Cathartiformes not closely associated with either the birds of prey or the <b>storks</b> and herons.|$|R
5|$|Dark-plumaged {{immature}} birds may {{be confused}} with turkey vultures, but soar with flat wings, while the pale plumaged adults could feasibly {{be confused with}} the wood <b>stork,</b> although the latter's long neck and legs allow for easy recognition from afar.|$|E

5|$|The black <b>stork</b> is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its actual status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the black <b>stork,</b> like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by Wetlands International. It is also covered under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.|$|E
5|$|<b>Storks</b> are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills and ibises use to clean off fish slime. <b>Storks</b> lack a pharynx and are mute.|$|R
5|$|<b>Storks</b> are large, long-legged, long-necked, {{wading birds}} with long, stout bills. <b>Storks</b> are {{virtually}} mute, but bill-clattering {{is an important}} mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory.|$|R
25|$|Black-necked <b>storks</b> {{are largely}} non-social {{and are usually}} seen as single birds, pairs and family groups. Flocks of up to 15 <b>storks</b> have been {{observed}} in Australia and India, and form due to local habitat conditions such as drying out of wetlands.|$|R
