In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by <b>shackling</b> a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E

25|$|Deck and his {{attorneys}} also argued about {{the burden of}} proof. Deck’s counsel believed that the bias created by the shackles put {{the burden of proof}} on Deck and not the state. The defense argued that the state could not prove that the shackles did no harm. Ultimately, the defense felt that the <b>shackling</b> of Deck was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning <b>shackling</b> made a difference in the decision that the jury made. The defense argued that this alone was a violation against the constitution and due process.|$|E

25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for <b>shackling</b> Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of <b>shackling</b> Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the people who wanted to sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of {{slaves in the}} United States varied widely depending on conditions, times and places. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, <b>shackling,</b> hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert {{the dominance of the}} master or overseer of the slave. Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to analyze {{the effect of a}} short audiovisual training on the <b>shackled</b> technique efficiency in three different stress situations. Technical <b>shackle</b> techniques procedures in 3 different situations of 26 male soldiers were analyzed after an audiovisual session. The situations were normal, alert and danger. <b>Shackle</b> maneuver was divided in approach to the subject, subject control, placing the first <b>shackle,</b> limb immobilization, placing the second <b>shackle,</b> frisk and transfer actions. The audiovisual training was composed by a video of <b>shackled</b> technique in normal, alert and danger situation that soldiers could watch a maximum of three time previous to the realization of the evaluation test. A decrease on <b>shackled</b> maneuver efficiency was measured with the stress. Limb immobilization presented the lowest values in alert and danger situations, a fact that has to be improved. <b>Shackled</b> maneuver time was twice in danger than in normal and alert situations, fact related to the stress of the situations. With these results we can conclude that a short audiovisual training was a useful technique to learn the <b>shackled</b> procedure in non experimented soldiers in normal situations, but no in alert and danger situations.

25|$|According to {{the police}} timeline, Gray {{was placed in a}} {{transport}} van within 11 minutes of his arrest, and within 30 minutes, paramedics were summoned to take Gray to a hospital. The van made four confirmed stops while Gray was detained. At 8:46a.m., Gray was unloaded in order to be placed in leg irons because police said he was acting irate. Gray's <b>shackling</b> was recorded on a cellphone, which exhibited a motionless Gray surrounded by several officers as he was restrained. A later stop, recorded by a private security camera, shows the van stopped at a grocery store. At 8:59a.m., a second prisoner was placed in the vehicle while officers checked on Gray's condition. At 9:24a.m., the transport van arrived at its final stop, the West District police station.

2500|$|The Court {{then made}} it clear that the opinion of the Missouri Supreme Court did not meet the Constitutional {{requirements}} for permitting the <b>shackling</b> of Deck. The Supreme Court said this because they determined that the jury was aware of the shackles, that the trial judge did not permit the <b>shackling</b> of Deck because he was a security risk but because he had been previously convicted, and that the <b>shackling</b> created “prejudice” towards the defendant. [...] All of these factors were not recognized by the Missouri Supreme Court on Deck’s initial appeal. The Court concluded by saying there is one exception to <b>shackling</b> a defendant. The opinion of the Court permits a judge to use discretion to shackle a defendant under certain circumstances, including protecting people in the courtroom. Breyer also wrote that the determination of whether a defendant should be shackled “must be case specific”. [...] Breyer said that if that is not the case, the <b>shackling</b> violates due process as it did in Deck’s case.|$|E

The Supreme Court held that unless the <b>shackling</b> pertains to a specific defendant for specific state interests, the Constitution forbids the <b>shackling</b> of a defendant in the sentencing phase (as well as the guilt phase) of a trial.|$|E

Thomas stated, “in recent years, more of a consensus {{regarding the use of}} <b>shackling</b> has developed, with many courts concluding that <b>shackling</b> is inherently prejudicial. But rather than being firmly grounded in deeply rooted principles, that consensus stems from a series of ill-considered dicta…the current consensus that the court describes is one of its own making. It depends almost exclusively on the dicta in the Courts’ opinions in Holbrook, Estelle and Allen.” [...] In Deck's case, Thomas believes that due process does not “place limits” on <b>shackling</b> because {{there is a difference between}} an accused man and a convicted man. Ultimately, Thomas believes that limits on <b>shackling</b> do not extend to the sentencing phase of a trial.|$|E

2500|$|The court {{established}} {{that in fact}} the due process clause of the 5th and 14th amendments prohibits the <b>shackling</b> of a defendant during the sentencing phase of a trial. The court made this determination by looking at important facts or legal standards. The court noted that <b>shackling</b> a defendant undermines the presumption of innocence, since <b>shackling</b> tells jurors that the person being shackled is dangerous {{and needs to be}} restrained. Breyer also noted that <b>shackling</b> a defendant hurts his ability to interact with his attorneys, and prevents a defendant from taking the witness stand. The principle of court dignity also came up in the opinion of the court. The court stated, “The routine use of shackles in the presence of juries would undermine these symbolic yet concrete objectives.” [...] By making these conclusions about <b>shackling</b> a defendant, the court ruled “the considerations that militate against the routine use of visible shackles during the guilt phase of a criminal trial apply with like force to penalty proceedings in capital cases.” This deals with the fact the in these cases, the jury is still deciding between life and death and that this is a decision of equal importance compared to the question of innocence and guilt. The decision of life or death in the sentencing phase is serious which requires reliable sentencing. According to Justice Breyer, the court has “stressed the ‘acute need’ for reliable decision making when the death penalty is at issue.” [...] Breyer stated that in Deck’s case his right to reliable sentencing was infringed upon (a right derived from the Eight Amendment).|$|E

2500|$|Deck {{specifically}} {{claimed that}} his rights to due process, prescribed by the 5th and 14th Amendments, were violated. Deck’s counsel {{made it clear}} that there was no reason such as a court disturbance to permit such <b>shackling.</b> In Deck’s argument to the Supreme Court, it was also argued that Deck’s 6th Amendment rights had been violated {{on the grounds of the}} Confrontation Clause. Deck’s <b>shackling</b> told the jury that Deck was a dangerous person and was shackled to protect the people in the courtroom. Therefore, the jury had a picture in their mind that Deck was an awful person. Deck’s attorneys referred to this idea as prejudice towards Deck. Deck’s counsel argued that this meant that the jury was influenced by arbitrary details in deciding Deck’s sentence, not just the presented facts. [...] It was made clear that Deck could not cross-examine or defend against the idea of bias and prejudice against him. As a result his right to confront witnesses as stated in the 6th Amendment (as well as idea of an impartial jury) was violated by the shackles. Also, Deck’s counsel argued that the shackles violated the defendant's rights that “give meaning to the defendant’s right to be present at his trial.” [...] It was argued that the shackles limited Deck from freely conversing with his counsel, and that they prevented him from taking the stand to defend himself. The defense wrote that this would increase the chances of Deck being sentenced to death by the jury which made the <b>shackling</b> unconstitutional.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, a snap <b>shackle</b> is a fast action {{fastener}} {{which can be}} implemented single-handedly.
