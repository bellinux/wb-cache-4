5|$|Following the uptake of <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing,</b> the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (then {{known as}} The Sanger Centre) had begun {{cataloguing}} sequence reads along with quality {{information in a}} database called The Trace Archive. The Trace Archive grew substantially with the commercialisation of high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies by companies such as Roche and Illumina.|$|E
5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E
5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E

The dataset includes high-quality exome sequence data from 142 samples together with <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequence</b> data at 730 sites; 409 sites with variants and 321 sites at which variants were called by an NGS analysis tool, but no variant {{is present in}} the corresponding <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequence.</b> The dataset includes 286 indel variants and 275 negative indel sites, and thus the ICR 142 validation dataset is of particular utility in evaluating indel calling performance.

25|$|<b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> and {{pyrosequencing}} are {{two methods}} {{that have been}} used to detect frameshift mutations, however, it is likely that data generated will not be of the highest quality. Even still, 1.96 million indels have been identified through <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> that do not overlap with other databases. When a frameshift mutation is observed it is compared against the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) to determine if the mutation has a damaging effect. This is done by looking at four features. First, the ratio between the affected and conserved DNA, second the location of the mutation relative to the transcript, third the ratio of conserved and affected amino acids and finally the distance of the indel {{to the end of the}} exon.|$|E
25|$|The word “Transcriptome” {{was first}} used in the 1990s. In 1995, one of the {{earliest}} sequencing-based transcriptomic methods was developed, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), which worked by <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> of concatenated random transcript fragments. Transcripts were quantified by matching the fragments to known genes. A variant of SAGE using high-throughput sequencing techniques, called digital gene expression analysis, was also briefly used. However, these methods were largely overtaken by high throughput sequencing of entire transcripts, which provided additional information on transcript structure e.g. splice variants.|$|E
25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic {{dyskinesia}} {{has been}} shown to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 2011, the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16 was identified as the cause of the disease. The researchers looked at the genetics of eight families with strong histories of PKD. They employed whole genome sequencing, along with <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> to identify the gene that was mutated in these families. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{for many}} {{clinical}} practices in which EGFR-expressed cells {{account for a}} small portion of the whole cell population, this study provides a new method for accurately detecting disease-related EGFR multi-mutations by employing a simple microfluidic chip and the cost-effective <b>Sanger’s</b> <b>sequencing,</b> as an economically affordable alternative to the expensive NGS or ARMS analysis of the whole cell population.|$|R

40|$|Until now, the {{potential}} of NGS {{for the construction of}} barcode libraries or integrative taxonomy has been seldom realised. Here, we amplified (two-step PCR) and simultaneously sequenced (MiSeq) multiple markers from hundreds of fig wasp specimens. We also developed a workflow for quality control of the data. Illumina and <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequences</b> accumulated in the past years were compared. Interestingly, primers and PCR conditions used for the Sanger approach did not require optimisation to construct the MiSeq library. After quality controls, 87 % of the species (76 % of the specimens) had a valid MiSeq sequence for each marker. Importantly, major clusters did not always correspond to the targeted loci. Nine specimens exhibited two divergent sequences (up to 10 %). In 95 % of the species, MiSeq and <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequences</b> obtained from the same sampling were similar. For the remaining 5 %, species were paraphyletic or the sequences clustered into divergent groups on the Sanger + MiSeq trees (> 7 %). These problematic cases may represent coding NUMTS or heteroplasms. Our results illustrate that Illumina approaches are not artefact-free and confirm that Sanger databases can contain non-target genes. This highlights the importance of quality controls, working with taxonomists and using multiple markers for DNA-taxonomy or species diversity assessment...|$|R
25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{a disease}} based on mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. There are over 1500 mutations identified, but not all cause the disease. Most cases of cystic fibrosis {{are a result of}} the ∆F508 mutation, which deletes the entire amino acid. Two frameshift mutations are of interest in diagnosing CF, CF1213delT and CF1154-insTC. Both of these mutations commonly occur in tandem with at least one other mutation. They both lead to a small decrease in the function of the lungs and occur in about 1% of patients tested. These mutations were identified through <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{applications}} of PCR include DNA sequencing to determine unknown PCR-amplified sequences {{in which one}} of the amplification primers may be used in <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing,</b> isolation of a DNA sequence to expedite recombinant DNA technologies involving the insertion of a DNA sequence into a plasmid, phage, or cosmid (depending on size) or the genetic material of another organism. Bacterial colonies (such as E. coli) can be rapidly screened by PCR for correct DNA vector constructs. PCR may also be used for genetic fingerprinting; a forensic technique used to identify a person or organism by comparing experimental DNAs through different PCR-based methods.|$|E
25|$|Massively Parallel Sequencing is a newer {{method that}} can be used to detect mutations. Using this method, up to 17 gigabases can be sequenced at once, as opposed to limited ranges for <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> of only about 1 kilobase. Several {{technologies}} are available to perform this test and it is being looked at to be used in clinical applications. When testing for different carcinomas, current methods only allow for looking at one gene at a time. Massively Parallel Sequencing can test for a variety of cancer causing mutations at once as opposed to several specific tests. An experiment to determine the accuracy of this newer sequencing method tested for 21 genes and had no false positive calls for frameshift mutations.|$|E

30|$|Direct (<b>Sanger)</b> DNA <b>sequencing</b> (<b>Sanger</b> et al. 1977) is a {{relatively}} inexpensive and routine procedure in molecular biology. DNA sequence data are used to identify or compare organisms, genes or mutations, or to confirm laboratory procedures. Comparing sequence data from one or more samples {{to each other and}} to a known “reference” alignment is a standard procedure. Evolutionary relationships between samples are elucidated by phylogenetic analyses, which typically involve DNA sequences from many organisms of interest, and from many related samples for comparison.|$|R
25|$|Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was a {{development}} of EST methodology {{to increase the}} throughput of the tags generated and allow some quantitation of transcript abundance. cDNA is generated from the RNA but is then digested into 11bp ‘tag’ fragments using restriction enzymes that cut at a specific sequence, and 11base pairs along from that sequence. These cDNA tags are then concatenated head-to-tail into long strands (>500bp) and sequenced using low-throughput, but long read length methods such as <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Once the sequences are deconvoluted into their original 11 bp tags. If a reference genome is available, these tags can sometimes be aligned to identify their corresponding gene. If a reference genome is unavailable, the tags can simply be directly used as diagnostic markers if found to be differentially expressed in a disease state.|$|E
25|$|By 2004 / 2005, {{pyrosequencing}} {{had been}} brought to commercial viability by 454 Life Sciences. This new sequencing method generated reads much shorter than those of Sanger sequencing: initially about 100 bases, now 400-500 bases. Its much higher throughput and lower cost (compared to <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing)</b> pushed the adoption of this technology by genome centers, which in turn pushed development of sequence assemblers that could efficiently handle the read sets. The sheer amount of data coupled with technology-specific error patterns in the reads delayed development of assemblers; at the beginning in 2004 only the Newbler assembler from 454 was available. Released in mid-2007, the hybrid version of the MIRA assembler by Chevreux et al. was the first freely available assembler that could assemble 454 reads as well as mixtures of 454 reads and Sanger reads. Assembling sequences from different sequencing technologies was subsequently coined hybrid assembly.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{individual}} transcripts were being performed several decades before any transcriptomics approaches were available. Libraries of silkmoth mRNAs were collected and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) for storage using reverse transcriptase {{in the late}} 1970s. In the 1980s, low-throughput <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequencing</b> began {{to be used to}} sequence random individual transcripts from these libraries, called Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). ESTs came to prominence during the 1990s as an efficient method to determine the gene content of an organism without sequencing the entire genome. Quantification {{of individual}} transcripts by Northern blotting, nylon membrane arrays, and later Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were also popular, but these methods are laborious and can only capture a tiny subsection of a transcriptome. Consequently, the manner in which a transcriptome as a whole is expressed and regulated remained unknown until higher-throughput techniques were developed.|$|E

This algorithm is more computationally intensive than de Bruijn graphs, and most effective in assembling fewer reads {{with a high degree}} of overlap.De Bruijn graphs align k-mers (usually 25-50 bp) based on k-1 sequence conservation to create contigs. The use of k-mers - which are shorter than the read lengths - in de Bruijn graphs reduces the computational intensity of this method.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} impact of {{analysis}} software and of reference sequence divergence on the recovery of minority variants with Illumina deep sequencing applied to highly variable HCV populations. Four HCV 1 b full genomes were <b>sequenced</b> by <b>Sanger</b> population and Illumina deep sequencing, starting from the same PCR fragments. Reads were mapped to a published HCV 1 b reference sequence, to the sample-specific <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequence</b> and to an in silico reconstructed data-specific reference sequence (VICUNA). Of the four tested software packages (MAQ, Bowtie, BWA and Segminator II), Segminator II consistently mapped {{the largest number of}} reads, recovering respectively 77. 3 % (± 2. 4), 80. 6 % (± 3. 0) and 82. 1 % (± 4. 0) of reads whereas this was between 29 % and 77 % for the other methods. For all packages, the number of mapped reads increased when a sample-specific sequence was used instead of a more distantly related HCV 1 b reference sequence. For Segminator II, the concordance between the three NGS consensus sequences (representing the three mapping strategies) and the obtained <b>Sanger</b> <b>sequence,</b> was > 99 % when neglecting ambiguities. When using a 5 % threshold, for one sample 184 differences in ambiguities between the NGS analysis with a data-specific and HCV 1 b published reference sequence were all located in or near a divergent area, and therefore most probably represented true minority variants. To conclude, for deep sequencing of highly variable viral sequences, we recommend the use of a sample-/data-specific reference sequence and of tailored mapping software in order to map the maximum number of reads and recover as much as possible minority variants. status: accepte...|$|R
