50|$|Recent {{excavations}} in the palazzo's basement have found, around 7m below street level, a <b>small</b> <b>baths</b> complex, probably part of {{an adjacent}} residential complex already found in 1902 during surveys {{for the construction of}} Palazzo delle Assicurazioni di Venezia.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Truscott was, in line with House of Lords rules, classifying his <b>small</b> <b>Bath</b> flat as his main residence, thus entitling him to claim a £28,000 per year public subsidy of his £700,000 Mayfair flat.|$|R
50|$|To {{the north}} of the <b>smaller</b> <b>bath</b> stood a palaestra. Also near the baths are the remains of a Byzantine church, temple and what is {{believed}} to have been the agora (The market place). The latter is located across the road from the theatre.|$|R
5000|$|Public baths {{have existed}} in Sofia {{since at least}} the 16th century. During Hans Dernschwam visit to Sofia in 1553-1555, the Bohemian {{traveller}} noted the presence of 1 large <b>bath</b> and 2 <b>smaller</b> <b>baths</b> {{on either side of the}} city.

50|$|This {{butterfly}} {{is common}} in central and southern Europe, Asia Minor, Persia and Afghanistan, migrating northwards in the summer. In Central Asia, the <b>Bath</b> <b>white</b> ranges from Baluchistan, Peshawar, Chitral, Kashmir and along the Himalayas right across the Central Himalayas up to Darjeeling. The butterfly appears to be extending its range westwards along the Himalayas. It is usually found on dry slopes and rough ground with little vegetation.|$|R
40|$|A very {{important}} parameter of <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> helium cryopump is minimal heat input to its cold parts. Therefore, we simulated both the molecular flow and the thermal radiation heat transfer {{in the real}} pump geometry.

25|$|Cottage <b>baths</b> were <b>small</b> <b>baths</b> off streets {{which were}} {{sometimes}} built in converted buildings. Experiments {{of this in}} Manchester, Liverpool and Bradford were unsuccessful, and results from the experiment in Brighton were varied. In 1905, {{a member of the}} Health Committee published a report which strongly recommended the construction of cottage baths. This prompted the council to look into providing cottage baths.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} of Municipium DD experienced a revival in the 3rd century AD, {{at the time}} of the rule of Diocletian, when he redesigned the Forum, build the basilica, erected a <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> and a range of other facilities, but the life settlement did not last long - a hundred years later Municipium DD loses its significance and disappears from the historical stage.|$|R
40|$|Thermal Markovian {{dynamics}} {{is typically}} obtained by coupling {{a system to}} a sufficiently hot bath with a large heat capacity. Here we present a scheme for inducing Markovian dynamics using an arbitrarily small and cold heat bath. The scheme is based on injecting phase noise to the <b>small</b> <b>bath.</b> Several unique signatures of <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> are studied. We discuss realizations in ion traps and superconducting qubits and show {{that it is possible}} to create an ideal setting where the system dynamics is indifferent to the internal bath dynamics. Comment: V 2 contains new contributions by the new authors SG and RO about experimental realization in superconducting circuits and ion traps. In addition, the discussion on system-bath correlation in V 2 was extended. The study of generalized Gibbs states was omitted in V 2, but can still be found in V 1. More generally, V 2 is a clearer and more concise versio...|$|R
40|$|Bleached wool {{is rapidly}} yellowed by {{exposure}} to the UV radiation present in sunlight. The conventional application of a water-soluble hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole UV absorber (such as UVFast W) to bleached wool reduces its rate of photoyellowing but has {{a negative impact on}} the whiteness of the bleached wool, largely cancelling out the improvements in whiteness achieved during bleaching. However, if the UV absorber is applied to peroxide-bleached wool from a reductive bleach <b>bath,</b> <b>white</b> wool with improved photostability to sunlight and UV radiation can be obtained...|$|R
50|$|Among the {{historic}} buildings destroyed were several schools and hotels, {{as well as}} the State Printing House, the Regional Court, the <b>Small</b> <b>Baths</b> and the National Library. These were not restored to their original appearance. The Bulgarian National Theatre, the Bulgarian Agricultural Bank, the Theological Faculty of Sofia University, the Museum of Natural History, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and other buildings were damaged but subsequently reconstructed.|$|R
2500|$|Emin's monoprints {{are rarely}} {{displayed}} alone in exhibitions, they're particularly effective as collective fragments of intense emotional confrontation. Emin has made several works documenting painful moments {{of sadness and}} loneliness experienced when travelling to foreign cities for various exhibitions such as Thinking of You (2005) and <b>Bath</b> <b>White</b> I (2005) which were {{from a series of}} monoprints drawn directly onto the USA Mondrian hotel stationery. Emin herself has said, [...] "Being an artist isn't just about making nice things, or people patting you on the back; it's some kind of communication, a message.|$|R
50|$|After a major {{restoration}} the excavations under Palazzo Valentini {{have now}} {{opened to the}} public on a permanent basis. A <b>small</b> <b>baths</b> complex dating from the 2nd century AD was discovered seven metres below street level under the basement of the building. It is believed {{to be part of a}} nearby residential scheme found over 100 years ago prior to the 1907 construction of Palazzo delle Assicurazioni in Piazza Venezia.|$|R
5000|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the barracks today. The palace was {{probably}} the local governor's residence as well. Its best-preserved part is the southern façade of alternating bands of basalt black and brick yellow. There are remains of stables {{in the northern part}} of the site and a <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> complex at the eastern part of the palace with a central courtyard. The function of each room was indicated by a carved stone.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s (possibly prior & afterwards) it {{was named}} the Tuscony Apartment Hotel. Mostly small apartments with two rooms of approx 8 ft wide (1-window each) by 10 ft long and a <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> room approx 6 x 7 ft and a small window between the two rooms. A short {{connecting}} corridor of approx 3 x 6 ft. One room had a kitchenette {{and the other was}} a setting/sleeping room. This is from my observation whilst looking for an apartment in 1965.|$|R

50|$|The Bagnaccio baths {{are located}} {{directly}} {{on what was}} the ancient via Cassia {{on the road to}} Montefiascone while the via Cassia now runs about 1 km east of the baths. The site was and is still marked by the ancient Roman ruins of Bacucco, a <b>small</b> <b>baths</b> complex on the same narrow unpaved road 'strada bianca' and these baths were recorded in designs by Michelangelo (Lille). Regular bathers at Bagnaccio pay dues of 12 to 18 euros to keep the pools clean, although day passes are also available.|$|R
50|$|The early post-war period {{continued}} {{to be dominated by}} war damage reconstruction in Bath, but the business gradually extended to new build and to the counties around Bath. Reflecting the increased size of the business, C H Beazer (Construction) was incorporated in 1956; Cyril’s eldest son, Ralph, joined as a director and the younger brother Brian became a director in 1960. In the event it was Brian Beazer who took over as managing director in 1968 and it was he who turned this <b>small</b> <b>Bath</b> company into an international construction group.|$|R
25|$|Despite its arid climate, {{the island}} {{is also home to}} a {{surprisingly}} large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow (Colias hyale) and the <b>bath</b> <b>white</b> (Pontia daplidice) which feeds on xerophytic cruciferae. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its close African relative Danaus chrysippus. Around holiday developments such as Caleta de Fuste, water is relatively abundant, and dragonfly species including the blue emperor, Anax imperator and the scarlet darter, Crocothemis erythraea can be found. The islands sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of bee and wasp species including the large Eumenid caterpillar hunting wasp, Delta dimidiatipenne and the striking blue banded bee, (Amegilla canifrons).|$|R

The reference electrode was immersed into a <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> filled with the solution for Cu deposition. The bath {{was connected to the}} electrolytic cell by a flexible polymer tube with a 2 -mm inner diameter, with a Luggin glass capillary of 200 -μm aperture at its end. Both the Luggin capillary and polymer tube were filled with the solution for Cu deposition. The Luggin capillary was placed on Si or PS, and it defined a clear small sensing point for the reference electrode near the sample surface.|$|R
50|$|Around 150 {{the small}} house was {{demolished}} {{for a larger}} building. The new house was a larger row-house consisting of an important middle room with smaller rooms {{to the north and}} south of it. The house was aligned with the older work-hall, but kept apart from it. This {{was the beginning of the}} west wing. Later in the century a <b>small</b> <b>bath</b> suite was added to this west house. The most unusual feature of this west bath suite is that the pilae in the underfloor hypocaust heating system were built from curved roof tiles (imbrices) rather than from stacks of bricks.|$|R
