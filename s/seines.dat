5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse <b>seines,</b> other <b>seines,</b> trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse <b>seines</b> and bottom trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse <b>seines,</b> though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Seine</b> ( [...] ) fishing (or seine-haul fishing) is {{a method}} of fishing that employs a <b>seine</b> or dragnet.

5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse <b>seines</b> and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including <b>seines</b> and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray fights strongly on hook-and-line {{and is thus}} {{popular with}} recreational anglers, who usually release it alive. This species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean, using bottom trawls, gillnets and tangle nets, beach <b>seines,</b> and longlines. In particular, it is caught in substantial numbers by an Indonesian trawl fishery targeting wedgefishes in the Arafura Sea. The meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized, though this species is not a highly valued food fish. It also has applications in Chinese medicine, and its tail may be sold as a curio.|$|E

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna <b>seines</b> are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, <b>seines,</b> stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach <b>seines.</b> Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by {{how difficult it is to}} handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Reported {{to be more}} {{aggressive}} than other stingarees, the sparsely-spotted stingaree readily employs its venomous sting if disturbed and can inflict a painful injury on a human. It is edible, but seldom brought to market. Fishing pressure is insignificant across large portions of this ray's range, including in the Great Australian Bight, though substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries off southeastern and southwestern Australia in beach <b>seines</b> and bottom trawls. The sparsely-spotted stingaree generally survives being captured, sorted, and discarded, though the process often causes it to abort any unborn young. Nevertheless, losses to fisheries appear to be sustainable at present, and thus the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern. There are a number of small Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within its range, and it would potentially benefit from the implementation of the 2004 Australian National Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse <b>seines,</b> longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E

40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{applying}} two long <b>seine</b> ropes and a <b>seine</b> net. Demersal seining relies on fish responding to the <b>seine</b> rope as it moves during the fishing process. The <b>seine</b> ropes and net are deployed in a specific pattern encircling an area on the seabed. In some variants of demersal seining the haul-in procedure includes a towing phase where the fishing vessel moves forward before starting to winch in the <b>seine</b> ropes. The initial <b>seine</b> rope encircled area, the gradual change in it during the haul-in process and the fish's reaction to the moving <b>seine</b> ropes {{play an important role}} in the catch performance of demersal <b>seine</b> fishing. The current study investigates this subject by applying computer simulation models for demersal <b>seine</b> fishing. The demersal <b>seine</b> fishing is dynamic in nature and therefore a dynamic model, SeineSolver is applied for simulating the physical behaviour of the <b>seine</b> ropes during the fishing process. Information about the <b>seine</b> rope behaviour is used as input to another simulation tool, SeineFish that predicts the catch performance of the demersal <b>seine</b> fishing process. SeineFish implements a simple model for how fish at the seabed reacts to an approaching <b>seine</b> rope. Here, the SeineSolver and SeineFish tools are applied to investigate catching performance for a Norwegian demersal <b>seine</b> fishery targeting cod (Gadus morhua) in the coastal zone. The effect of <b>seine</b> rope layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase are investigated. Among the four different layout patterns investigated, the square layout pattern was predicted to perform best; catching 69 %- 86 % more fish than would be obtained with the rectangular layout pattern. Inclusion of a towing phase in the fishing process was found to increase the catch performance for all layout patterns. For the square layout pattern, inclusion of a towing phase of 15 or 35 minutes increased the catch performance by respectively 37 % and 48 % compared to fishing without a towing phase. These results highlights the importance of the selected <b>seine</b> rope layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase when fishermen try to maximize the catch performance of their fishery. To our knowledge this is the first time the combination of models for the physical behaviour of <b>seine</b> ropes and for fish behaviour in response to <b>seine</b> rope movements have been applied to predict catch performance for demersal seining...|$|R

25|$|While gillweed nets are a {{principal}} concern, {{other types of}} nets also pose a problem: trawl nets, purse <b>seines,</b> beach <b>seines,</b> longline gear, and driftnets. Driftnets are known for high rates of bycatch and they affect all cetaceans and other marine species.

40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{which is based on}} <b>seine</b> ropes and a <b>seine</b> net. The <b>seine</b> ropes and net are laid out on the fishing ground {{in a way that they}} {{encircle}} an aggregation of fish. Because the area the <b>seine</b> ropes encircle is much larger than area swept by the <b>seine</b> net during the hauling process, the catching efficiency of a demersal <b>seine</b> depends to a large extent on the herding efficiency of the <b>seine</b> ropes. During the fishing operation, the fish is gradually herded by the <b>seine</b> ropes into the path of the net. Knowledge about how the size and shape of the area encircled by the <b>seine</b> ropes gradually change during the fishing process is important for an efficient fishery. The purpose of the project ‚ÄùDanish Seine: Computer based Development and Operation‚Äù (MAROFF- 2 project no. 225193 / FHF 900861), funded by Research Council of Norway (RCN) and Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF), is to develop software tools to investigate Danish <b>Seine</b> fishing.
