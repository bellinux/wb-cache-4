40|$|The {{advantages}} of using cold-formed steel are high strength-to-weight ratio, flexibility in fabricating different cross-section shapes, easy for construction and so on. Cold-formed steel sheets are usually manufactured into open sectional profiles by cold-rolling and brake-pressing methods. Doubly symmetric built-up sections, with {{the advantage of}} having larger torsional rigidity compared to traditional singly symmetric open sections, have great potential to extend the application of cold-formed steel to structural members with larger scale. The doubly symmetric built-up open and closed sections {{can be made by}} connecting two channel sections using self-tapping screws, which are also convenient for industrialized production. In this study, the structural performance of cold-formed steel built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> with intermediate stiffeners and built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> with web perforations was examined through experimental and numerical investigations. The impact of different screw arrangements on the moment capacities of built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> was also studied. A total of 113 beam tests that include simply supported beam tests of 16 pairs of channel sections with stiffened webs, 19 built-up sections with intermediate stiffeners, 43 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 35 built-up sections with different screw arrangements was conducted. The material properties of the test specimens were also obtained by tensile coupon tests. The main objective of the experimental investigation is to obtain the section moment capacities and understand the structural behaviour of the built-up sections under bending. Finite element (FE) models of the beam specimens were also developed and numerical analysis that includes material nonlinearity, geometric nonlinearity and contact nonlinearity (for built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> only) was performed and the results were verified against the test results. The validated FE models were employed for extensive parametric studies of 382 numerical simulations that include 101 channel sections with stiffened webs, 113 built-up sections with intermediate stiffeners, 80 built-up sections with web perforations, as well as 88 built-up sections having different screw arrangements. A wide range of section slenderness was considered in the built-up sections and different failure modes of beams were investigated. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the influence of stiffener features, different sizes of web holes, and various screw arrangements on the structural performance of cold-formed steel built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> was carried out. The results obtained from the experimental and numerical studies were employed for evaluating the design rules of cold-formed steel built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams.</b> It should be mentioned that the existing direct strength method (DSM) for cold-formed steel members does not cover the design of built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams.</b> Hence, suitable design rules based on DSM have been proposed for cold-formed steel built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> with intermediate stiffeners and built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> with web perforations under bending. The design equations for considering the screw spacings of built-up closed <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> have also proposed. Furthermore, the suitability of the modified design rules, as well as the existing DSM for cold-formed steel built-up <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> was also evaluated through a reliability analysis. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

This research deals with agricultural waste of fly ash in terms of partial cement replacement in hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam.</b> Concrete is both dominant as a construction material and contributor to greenhouse gas emissions due to cement manufacturing. Therefore, replacing Portland cement with fly ash reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In this research, reinforced hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> in rectangular with size 250 mm x 300 mm with 2000 mm length is designed to resist a point load of 50 kN. The percentage proportion testing and curing test is fixed with 30 % of fly ash by weight of with 7, 14, and 28 days respectively. Three types of reinforced hollow section beams were constructed in this research which has three different size of the cavity of Bi (40 mm x 100 mm), B 2 (50 mm x 100 mm) and 133 (60 mm x 100 mm) along together with one solid beam without hollow part. From this research, the highest ultimate load achieved is specimen 131.

Refer to the research and study shown that is possible to use recycled materials to replace some material in concrete product. Rubber tire particles are recycled and currently use in concrete application. This study determines the use of rubber tire particles as partial coarse aggregate replacement for the mixture design of the concrete. There are three hollow section beams with different cavity sizes as specimens for this study {{to determine the effect}} of cavity sizes to the hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam.</b> There are three different cavity sizes for hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam,</b> 40 mmxlOOmm, 50 mmxlOOmm and óOmmxlOOmm.

The beam made with the rubber tire particles were testing for its flexural strength. The result showed that hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> with cavity size 60 mmxlOOmm had the higher flexural strength compare with all specimens.

40|$|Concrete is a {{most widely}} used {{material}} in the construction line. There were many modifications made in the concrete materials. The lightweight aggregate concrete containing palm oil clinkers were introduced as a method {{to reduce the amount}} of gravel aggregates in order to produce concrete with sufficient strength. The palm oil clinker was used as the coarse and fine aggregate replacement. Hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> with palm oil clinker as a partial coarse aggregate replacement was introduced. Concrete can withstand compression force but weak in resisting the tensile force. Therefore, we reduce the consumption of concrete at the tensile region. Thus after we reduce the concrete at the tensile region it is called a hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam.</b> The objective of the study is to determine the ultimate strength and deflection of the hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> and also to determine the effect of cavity size in the hollow section beams. Three beams with cavity size 100 mm x 40 mm, lOOmm x SOmm and 100 mmx 60 mm were produced. The cross sectional area of the hollow beam is 250 mm x 300 mm with a length of 2000 mm. In order to construct the beam, searching and collecting information regarding hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> and palm oil clinker were carried out. The palm oil clinker was crushed into the form of coarse aggregate in the preparation of the raw material. Besides that, the formwork and reinforcement steelwork were carried out. The flexural tests for the beam were conducted by using Magnus Frame. The graph load against deflection, load against time, deflection against time and the bar chart for loaddeflection ratio was analysed. The beam with hollow cavity 100 mmx 60 mm gives the best result. The beam able to withstand the highest ultimate load which is 145. 55 kN and with a deflection of 25. 72 mm which is lowest. The loaddeflection ratio of the hollow beam of 100 mm x 60 mm has the highest load- deflection ratio which is 5. 67 kN/mm. This means 5. 67 kN of load is required to produce 1 mm deflection. In conclusion the results obtained from the research fulfill the objective of the study. The ultimate strength of the palm oil clinker as a partial coarse aggregate replacement in hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> is 145. 55 kN with a deflection of 25. 72 mm. Besides that, 100 mm x 60 mm is the largest cavity size among the three beams. Thus, it fulfills the criteria as saving more concrete materials and having the lowest self weight...|$|E

40|$|Simplified {{modeling}} {{generates a}} great deal of interest in the area of crashworthiness analysis. Modeling methods used to create simplified computer models for crashworthiness have been well developed. In advanced simplified models, researchers develop simplified elements that can correctly predict structure 2 ̆ 7 s crash behavior based on the existing collapse theories. These developed simplified elements then are applied to develop the simplified models. Nevertheless, most of the exiting collapse theories are regarding the thin-walled box <b>section</b> <b>beams.</b> However, in addition to the box section member, the channel section member is another popular member and is widely used in engineering for architectural structures, vehicles, and etc. Therefore, to simplify the thin-walled channel <b>section</b> <b>beams,</b> new collapse theory is required to predict the crash behavior for such beams. This topic is the focus of this dissertation. This dissertation develops a mathematical model to predict the crash behavior of the thin-walled channel <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> based on their real collapse mechanisms. The derived math formulae are verified through several basic applications. After that, both the existing collapse theories and the developed collapse theory regarding the thin-walled channel <b>section</b> <b>beams</b> are applied to simplify the detailed truck chassis model. The developed simplified model is used for crashworthiness analysis and the results are compared to those from the detailed model. The developed theory and the modeling method are then validated through the comparison. Additionally, in developing the simplified truck chassis model, the cross members that were modeled using coarse shell elements in previous simplified models are remodeled using simple elements. Two of the simplified modeling methods, the superelement method and the equivalent beam method, are utilized to generate the simplified models for the cross members of the truck chassis model. The principle of both methods is to use simple elements to transfer the original members 2 ̆ 7 mass and stiffness matrices.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{deformation}} of a metal hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> under a uniform blast loading is developed {{in order to}} reveal the characteristic features of deformation and energy absorption of hollow section beams under such loading. It is established that as a typical structural component a hollow section distinguishes itself from its solid counterpart with two characteristic features of the response. First, a considerably larger kinetic energy is generated in the hollow <b>section</b> <b>beam</b> as the impulsive load is imparted on the upper flange of the beam having a significantly lower mass than the member. Second, a considerable proportion of the blast energy can be absorbed by the local collapse of the section. A two-phase analytical model is proposed. In the first phase, the local collapse of the thin-walled cross-section is determined by using an upper bound approach; and in the subsequent second phase, the global bending of the beam with the distorted section is analyzed by {{taking into account the}} effect of axial force. It is demonstrated that mass distribution in the hollow section {{is an important factor in}} determining the energy partitioning between the local deformation phase and global bending of the hollow beam. Reasonable agreement is obtained with the experimental data published in the literature [Jama HH, Nurick GN, Bambach MR, Grzebieta RH, Zhao XL, Steel square hollow sections subjected to transverse blast loads, Thin-Walled Structures 2012; 53 : 109 - 122]...|$|E

In this paper, a new theory is presented in which no kinematical assumption is applied, rather the properties are derived from the accurate (three dimensional) equations of beams using limit transition. The theory includes both the in-plane and the torsional-warping shear deformations.
