40|$|The {{effects of}} stage {{absorption}} on reverberation times in opera houses were investigated using computer simulations and scale model measurements. The reverberation time (RT) {{was measured in}} stalls seating with and without variable <b>stage</b> <b>elements</b> (e. g., fly curtains, side curtains, cycloramas, and <b>stage</b> <b>sets).</b> The absorption coefficients of {{the walls and ceiling}} of the stage houses were varied accordingly. It was found that variable <b>stage</b> <b>elements</b> have a significant influence on reverberation times in seating areas, particularly for a reverberant stage house, due to the low absorption of the walls and ceiling in the stage house. It was also found that the absorption coefficients of the walls and ceiling should be over 0. 5 to avoid RT decreases of over 10 % due to the absorption of the variable <b>stage</b> <b>elements.</b> In addition, coupled room effects were investigated both with and without variable <b>stage</b> <b>elements</b> and the results show that double slope was not found in the opera houses investigated in this study.

A completely randomized design was used (CRD). Sampling was done on two stages at flowering and seed setting in selected locations (2 km 2). Within each stage 60 goats randomly selected, randomly collected samples of blood serum. Stages had significant (P< 0. 0001) effect on blood serum of goats was highly K (5. 10 - 3. 88 mmol/L) concentration at flowering stage and least during the seed <b>setting</b> <b>stage</b> respectively.

Although a clean-sheet upper stage design inherently carries more risk than a modified design, it does offer many advantages: a design for increased reliability; built-in extensibility to allow for commonality/growth without major redesign; and incorporation of state-of-the-art materials, hardware, and design, fabrication, and test techniques and processes to facilitate a potentially better, more reliable system...|$|R
