40|$|Theories {{of stellar}} spiral arms in disk galaxies can be grouped into two classes {{based on the}} {{longevity}} of a spiral arm. Although the quasi-stationary density wave theory supposes that spirals are rigidly-rotating, long-lived patterns, the dynamic spiral theory predicts that spirals are differentially-rotating, transient, recurrent patterns. In order {{to distinguish between the}} two <b>spiral</b> <b>models</b> from observations, we performed hydrodynamic simulations with steady and dynamic <b>spiral</b> <b>models.</b> Hydrodynamics simulations in steady <b>spiral</b> <b>models</b> demonstrated that the dust lane locations relative to the stellar spiral arms (hereafter, arm-gas offsets) depend on radius, regardless of the strength and pitch angle of the <b>spiral</b> and the <b>model</b> of the inter-stellar medium (ISM). In contrast, we found that the dynamic <b>spiral</b> <b>models</b> show no systematic radial dependence of the arm-gas offsets. The arm-gas offset radial profile method, together with the other test methods, will help us to distinguish between the two <b>spiral</b> <b>models</b> in observed <b>spiral</b> galaxies.

5000|$|These early papers use {{the term}} [...] "process model" [...] {{to refer to the}} <b>spiral</b> <b>model</b> as well as to incremental, waterfall, prototyping, and other approaches. However, the spiral model's {{characteristic}} risk-driven blending of other process models' features is already present: [...] Risk-driven subsetting of the <b>spiral</b> <b>model</b> steps allows the model to accommodate any appropriate mixture of a specification-oriented, prototype-oriented, simulation-oriented, automatic transformation-oriented, or other approach to software development. In later publications, Boehm describes the <b>spiral</b> <b>model</b> as a [...] "process model generator", where choices based on a project's risks generate an appropriate process model for the project. Thus, the incremental, waterfall, prototyping, and other process models are special cases of the <b>spiral</b> <b>model</b> that fit the risk patterns of certain projects.|$|E

30|$|The {{findings}} from person-oriented and variable-oriented approaches support proposed Motivational <b>Spiral</b> <b>Models,</b> and suggest extending MSM to vary the time intervals in other contexts. There are clear applications to differential rather than one-size-fits-all programmes in clinical and community settings. It is therefore reasonable {{to conclude that}} common and distinct features of MSM advance theories of developing motivation {{for participation in the}} activities that support general health and well-being.|$|R
30|$|The third {{condition}} in Motivational <b>Spiral</b> <b>Models</b> considers multi-construct and cross-linked spirals from Time 1 to Time 2. For instance, multi-constructs link feelings with other motivations and behaviours, in particular contexts (e.g., Bornholt et al. 2005). MSM are characterised by spiralling cross-links among self concepts and participation. Results clearly show that self concepts motivate and justify participation, and the spiral effects {{are common to}} developing motivations for literacy, social and physical activities.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a geometric {{interpretation of the}} <b>Spiral</b> Array <b>model</b> and its comparison to Lerdahl's Tonal Pitch Space and Krumhansl's spatial representation of pitch relations. The <b>Spiral</b> Array <b>model</b> is derived from a three-dimensional configuration of the Harmonic Network. The fundamental idea underlying the model is the representing of higher-level objects in the spiral's interior as convex combinations of the representations of the lower level components. By using {{the interior of the}} spiral, the original discrete space is relaxed to one that is continuous. Geometric mappings are demonstrated among Lerdahl's Tonal Pitch Space, Krumhansl's and Krumhansl & Kessler’s spatial representations of pitch class and key relations, and the <b>Spiral</b> Array <b>model.</b> The interior-point approach of the <b>Spiral</b> Array <b>model</b> is shown to generate higher-level structures that are consistent with the results of these other approaches. The advantages of the interior-point approach are that it facilitates comparisons across different hierarchical levels, and problems that were previously combinatorial in nature can be modeled more efficiently and robustly, mathematically and computationally, using the continuous space in the interior.

30|$|The {{results support}} the main {{proposal}} in identifying the common and distinct features of children’s developing motivations for literacy, social and physical activities. In particular, the common features of MSM developing motivations are evident across contexts. These include proposed variations among MSM components in the stability and openness to experience, and the cross-linked spirals that characterize Motivational <b>Spiral</b> <b>Models.</b> As expected, the features of MSM that are distinct to each context are connected with children’s positive and negative feelings about these everyday activities.|$|R

50|$|It {{was only}} in 1998, after the {{development}} of the ICM that Barry Boehm along with A Winsor Brown started to focus on reconciling it with the WinWin <b>Spiral</b> <b>Model</b> and its incarnation in MBASE and the follow-on Lean MBASE, and working towards an Incremental Commitment Model for Software (ICMS) by adapting the existing WinWin <b>Spiral</b> <b>Model</b> support tools.In 2008, the evolving ICM for Software with its risk-driven anchor point decisions, proved very useful to several projects which ended up having unusual life cycle phase sequences.|$|E
30|$|Findings {{provided}} ample {{support for}} common and distinct features of Motivational <b>Spiral</b> <b>Models.</b> It {{is clear that}} self concepts are important in motivations for alternative and standard paths to participation in activities. MSM advance traditions of research on social-cognitive processes that support participation in activities, and renews our interest in the justifications of participation that support developing self concepts. It is important to notice the common links in MSM as uni-construct models of stability to highlight the openness to experience. This is where intervention programmes would be effective.|$|R

30|$|The {{models in}} Figure  1 are {{described}} as ‘uni-construct’[*], ‘multi-construct’ and ‘cross-linked spiral effects’. Children’s developing motivations to engage in physical exercise provide prime examples. For instance, a uni-construct effect would show children’s self concepts of physical exercise as moderately stable over time; remaining somewhat open to experience. A multi-construct effect would show children’s self concepts influencing subsequent participation in activities, and cross-linked spiral effects would also show that participation in physical activities support developing self concepts of physical activities. Motivational <b>Spiral</b> <b>Models</b> expand on these models to consider initial and developing links over time among children’s self concepts, positive and negative feelings, strategies, skills and participation in everyday activities.|$|R

In particular, under given circumstances of the security dilemma, what steps might a threatened state take to derive advantage by attacking first. In other words, the <b>spiral</b> <b>model</b> seeks to explain war. In the <b>spiral</b> <b>model</b> of Jervis, there are two reasons why a state might end up in war. [...] "Preventive war" [...] might take place as one state might decide to attack first when it perceives the balance of power shifting to the other side creating an advantage in attacking sooner rather than later as conditions may not be as favorable in the future as in the present. [...] "Preemptive war" [...] might take place as a state might decide to attack another state first to prevent the other state from attacking or to obstruct the other state's attack because it fears the other state is preparing to attack.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since {{different}} systems have different success-critical stakeholders, and these stakeholders {{depend on the}} system in different ways, using traditional one-size-fits-all dependability metrics to drive the system and software development process is {{likely to lead to}} delivered systems that are unsatisfactory to some stakeholders. This paper proposes a Value-Based Software Dependability Achievement (VBSDA) process generated from the WinWin <b>Spiral</b> <b>Model’s</b> risk-driven approach coupled with a set of value-based dependability analysis frameworks, methods, and models for reasoning about software and system dependability. It helps project success-critical stakeholders define, negotiate and develop mission-specific combinations of dependability attributes. The NASA/USC Inspector SCRover (ISCR) project is used as a case study to elaborate the process. ...|$|R
