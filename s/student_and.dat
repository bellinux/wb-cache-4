40|$|In this {{empirical}} {{paper we}} consider the problem of communication <b>and</b> interaction between <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers in the classroom, {{looking at it from}} the aspect of the position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers in everyday teaching practice.

The sample on which the study was conducted was made of third grade secondary vocational schools and high schools and their teachers. Dependent variable is descriptive: the position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers as a factor of conflict in communication between <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers, divided in to two groups of indicators (first: indicators that help to prevent conflicts-objective subjective position of <b>students,</b> <b>and</b> other: indicators that initiate the sole objective position of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> subjective position of the teacher). Research results to some extent, we should give a clearer picture of which segments are different perceptions of <b>students</b> <b>and</b> teachers related to the position as a factor in any conflict and misunderstanding in communication between the direct participants in the teaching process...|$|R
