40|$|Synopsis [...] The heat of {{hydration}} {{in massive}} concrete structures can raise the temperature to a level where thermal cracks etc can pose a problem. Hardening retarders are admixtures that lower the rate of hydration, distribute the heat release over time and lower maximum temperature in concrete. Such admixtures will inherently lead to lower early strength, but should lead to comparable 28 days strength to reference concrete. Relative large amounts of urea works, in particular when the additional retardation of setting (not hardening) is counteracted by the set accelerator calcium nitrate. However, these dosages are high, and urea will also slowly decompose to ammonia that may limit the urea application to outdoor use, if any. The latest potential admixtures are combinations of minor amounts of strong setting retarders like organic acids (0. 1 - 0. 3 %) with the <b>setting</b> <b>accelerator</b> calcium nitrate (1 - 3 %), where a true synergy between the two leads to hardening retardation. Key-words: Admixtures, hardening retarder, {{heat of hydration}}, set accelerator, se...|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} {{a type of}} low-alkali liquid state <b>setting</b> <b>accelerator,</b> named HLSA; it was environmentally friendly product. To investigate the temperature adaptation and cement flexibilities of HLSA, the setting time and strength development properties of cement with HLSA were discussed in this paper. The effects of HLSA on hydration process, hydration products, and microstructure were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results show that four typical 42. 5 -grade ordinary Portland cement types with 6 – 8 % HLSA could satisfy the first-grade requirements according to JC 477 - 2005 even at a lower temperature (e. g., 10 °C). Further, the percentage ratio of 28 [*]d compressive strength of cement with 6 – 8 % HLSA was over 90 %; the XRD diffraction peak of AFt integrated area of cement with 7 % HLSA was 3818 at 5 [*]min of hydration; SEM observation revealed that AFt crystals were filled in the pore of cement at 28 [*]d of hydration; the temperature adaptation and cement flexibilities of HLSA were excellent; the cement with HLSA coagulating {{in a short time}} attributed to promoting the formation of abundant AFt and the hydration of C 3 S...|$|E

Compressive strength test along with thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were undertaken to study the effect of various elements on the physico-chemical behaviour of the blended composites. The results show that silica fume when used in combination with the <b>set</b> <b>accelerator</b> and hydrated lime in HV-UFFA cement mortar, improves its 7 and 28  day strength by 273 and 413  %, respectively, compared to the binary blended cement fly ash mortar. On the contrary, when nano silica is used in combination with <b>set</b> <b>accelerator</b> and hydrated lime in HV-UFFA cement mortar, the disjoining pressure in conjunction with the self-desiccation effect induces high early age micro cracking, resulting in hindering the development of compressive strength. However, when nano silica is used without the additives, it improves the 7 and 28  day strengths of HV-UFFA cement mortar by 918 and 567  %, respectively and the compressive strengths are comparable to that of OPC.|$|R

The addition of 5 % nano silica improved the 7 day strength of the blended sample by 76 % and by further increasing the nano silica content to 7. 5 %, the 7 day strength increased by 94 %.

40|$|Particle packing {{is one of}} {{important}} parameters, which dictates physical and thermo-mechanical properties of refractories. Fillers play a substantial role in the packing behaviour of low cement castable. Fine filler particles fill the voids of the castable aggregate leading to a high packing density of the castable and thereby decrease the cement as well as water requirement of the castable. Micro-silica and calcined alumina are normally used as filler materials {{in the development of}} low cement castable. It has been established that these fine fillers particles are responsible to provide ceramic bond and the intermediate temperature and provides high strength at high temperature due to formation of secondary mullite. In the present work an attempt has been made to develop low cement castable with suitable filler addition. Effect of particle size and particle size distribution of calcined alumina filler has been studied in order to achieve high flow behaviour in low cement 70 % alumina based vibratable castable formulation. This alumina filler particle has further been used to optimize and develop a suitable self-flow castable, wherein the amount of micro-silica and calcined alumina amount has been optimized.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the capability to modify cement by mechanical activation of sodium silicate water solution. Admixtures or blends of binding agents were employed for modifying concrete properties. The liquid glass is applied to protect from chemically or physically unfavorable environmental impacts, such as acidic medium and high temperature. The sodium silicate is a high-capacity <b>setting</b> <b>accelerator.</b> The increasing of the liquid glass proportion in the mix leads to the degradation of the cement paste plasticity and for this reason it is necessary {{to reduce the amount of}} liquid glass in the cement paste. The activation of dilute water solution of sodium silicate into rotary pulsating apparatus directly before tempering of the cement paste is an effective way to decrease mass fraction of liquid glass in the cement paste. The results of the combined influence of liquid glass and mechanical activation on physicochemical processes taking place in cement stone are represented in this research. Thermogravimetric analysis was used in order to study cement blends. Thermogravimetric analysis of modified cement stone assays was performed by thermo analyzer SETARAM TGA 92 - 24. The results of the analysis of phase transition taking place under high-temperature heating of cement stone modified by the mechanical activation of the water solution of the sodium silicate were introduced. Thermograms of cement stone assays were obtained at different hardening age. The comparison of these thermograms allows us to come to a conclusion on the formation and the retention during long time of a more dense structure of the composite matrix mixed by the mechanical activation of sodium silicate water solution. The relation between the concrete composition and its strength properties was stated.

30|$|Figure  2 b {{demonstrates}} {{the effect of}} nano silica, <b>set</b> <b>accelerator</b> and hydrated lime on HV-UFFA mortar. By partially replacing UFFA with nS, {{there was a significant}} improvement in 1  day strength of mix N 1 compared to that of CF and the 7 and 28  day strengths increased by 918 and 567  % respectively. This significant improvement in strength is attributed to the amorphous character and very high surface area of nano silica, which readily reacts with the available Ca(OH) 2 to form additional calcium silicate hydrate. Comparing the effect of silica fume in S 1 to that of nano silica in N 1, nano silica performed significantly better than silica fume in improving the compressive strength. Though, both SF and nS are amorphous in nature but the particle size of nano silica is approximately 425 times smaller than the average particle size of SF. This extremely small particle size of nano silica provides a very high surface area, that accelerates the pozzolanic reaction resulting in much higher compressive strength than that with SF. When <b>set</b> <b>accelerator</b> was combined with nano silica in Mix N 2, there was a further 30  % improvement in one day strength, but the 7 and 28  day strengths decreased by approximately 14 and 11  % respectively, compared to N 1. This shows that though <b>set</b> <b>accelerator</b> improves the pozzolanic reaction, which results in higher 1  day strength, it has a negative impact at 7 and 28  day strengths. In comparison, the <b>set</b> <b>accelerator</b> had positive impact on silica fume modified HV-UFFA at all ages. By combining nano silica and hydrated lime in mix N 3, the strength improvement was approximately {{the same as that of}} N 2. Similarly, no difference on the treatment of SA and HL was observed on silica fume modified HV-UFFA mixes S 2 and S 3. When both SA and HL were added to the nano silica modified HV-UFFA in Mix S 4, though the 1  day strength improved by 48  %, the 7 and 28  day strengths decreased by 34 and 18  % respectively. The combined effect of SA and HL was positive at 1  day and was higher than that of their individual effects. But at 7 and 28  days the combination of SA and HL proved detrimental to the strength development of HV-UFFA modified with nS and was worse than that of their individual effects.|$|R

Although the sprayed concrete technology advanced significantly over the past years, questions continue to arise regarding its performance, efficient use and optimized design. One of the main subjects that requires further research is the behavior of sprayed cement matrices containing accelerators at low temperature, since the application of sprayed concrete may be hindered in regions with cold weather due to the difficulties {{to fulfill the requirements}} of fast setting and early age strength development under such conditions.

40|$|This paper aims {{to review}} the {{biological}} and physicochemical properties of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) with respect to its ability to induce reparative dentinogenesis, which involves complex cellular and molecular events leading to hard-tissue repair by newly differentiated odontoblast-like cells. Compared with that of calcium hydroxide-based materials, MTA is more efficient at inducing reparative dentinogenesis in vivo. The available literature suggests that the action of MTA is attributable to the natural wound healing process of exposed pulps, although MTA can stimulate hard-tissue-forming cells to induce matrix formation and mineralization in vitro. Physicochemical analyses have revealed that MTA not only acts as a &# 8220;calcium hydroxide-releasing&# 8221; material, but also interacts with phosphate-containing fluids to form apatite precipitates.

Experimental results show significant performance (on average 51 X) and energy improvement (on average 17 X) compared to approaches using OS-based accelerator management...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a new {{analysis}} of neutrino oscillations in MINOS using the complete <b>set</b> of <b>accelerator</b> and atmospheric data. The analysis combines the nu(mu) disappearance and nu(e) appearance data using the three-flavor formalism. We measure vertical bar Delta m(32) (2) vertical bar = [2. 28 - 2. 46] x 10 (- 3) eV(2) (68 % C. L.) and sin(2) theta(23) = 0. 35 - 0. 65 (90 % C. L.) in the normal hierarchy, and vertical bar Delta m(32) (2) vertical bar = [2. 32 - 2. 53] x 10 (- 3) eV(2) (68 % C. L.) and sin(2) theta(23) = 0. 34 - 0. 67 (90 % C. L.) in the inverted hierarchy. The data also constrain delta(CP), the theta(23) octant degeneracy and the mass hierarchy; we disfavor 36 % (11 %) of this three-parameter space at 68 % (90 %) C. L...|$|R
40|$|For {{a complex}} {{accelerator}} {{such as the}} Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), a transfer matrix based online model might not be sufficient for the entire machine. On the other hand, if introducing another modelling tool, physics applications using modelling tools have to be rewritten. A platform that can host multiple modelling tools would be ideal for such scenario. Furthermore, the model platform along with infrastructure support can be used not only for online applications but also for offline purposes, for example multi-particle tracking simulation. In order to achieve such a platform, a set of common physics data structures has to be <b>set.</b> XAL's <b>accelerator</b> hierarchy based data structure {{is a good choice}} as the common structure for various models. Application Programming Interface (API) for physics applications should also be defined within a model data provider. A preliminary platform design and prototype is discussed...|$|R
