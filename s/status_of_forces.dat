5|$|The case {{received}} extensive {{attention in}} the Japanese media, especially in Okinawa, and the crime sparked a public debate over the U.S. military presence in Japan, the privileges of extraterritoriality, {{as well as the}} fair trial practices of Japanese legal system and the Japanese police.

5|$|As Japan {{began to}} re-establish itself diplomatically, the Hinomaru {{was used as}} a {{political}} weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor Hirohito and the Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the Hinomaru was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that either he be sent home to Japan or tried for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forces</b> Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comparative review {{on the existing}} legislation which regulates the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> heirs in legal systems on the territory of former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Srpska). The paper gives {{an overview of the}} persons that are eligible for forced heirship, conditions for being recognized as <b>forced</b> heir, size <b>of</b> the <b>forced</b> share, as well as influence {{of the size of the}} legal shares on the position <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> heirs. Special attention is given to the analysis of the influence of possible changes in the size of legal shares of inheritance on the size of shares belonging to forced heirs. In this context it is concluded that legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> heirs in most countries which belong to this group, is up to a certain extent specific compared to the one in most other contemporary European legal systems, primarily because of its volatile character. Simultaneously, it is observed that, regardless of a common legal background and inherited similarities dating from the former joint state, there are significant differences between the analyzed legal systems concerning the legal <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> heirs. Through this comparative review, the author strives to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the legal provisions existing in legislation of these countries. In this aspect, the author expresses the opinion whether there is a need for modification in national legislation regarding the analyzed aspects <b>of</b> the regulated <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> heirs...|$|R

Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton {{played a key role in}} the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forces</b> Agreement failed).|$|E

25|$|Roh was {{perceived}} as an anti-American before the presidential race, which was not a handicap during the presidential campaign. Public antipathy to the United States was prevalent in 2002, particularly evoked by the Yangju highway incident, where two South Korean middle school girls were crushed to death by a U.S. Army armored bridge-laying vehicle. The American soldiers involved were tried by a U.S. Army court martial, but the Roh administration continued to demand a South Korean trial, although the incident occurred 'on duty' (as part of a convoy) and thus was an American responsibility under the <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forces</b> Agreement between the United States and South Korea.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, the American and Iraqi governments {{signed the}} U.S.–Iraq <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forces</b> Agreement, which covered only American troops. It {{allowed them to}} remain in the country until 2011, but changed the status on several issues. Iraq regains {{sovereignty}} of its airspace, gains sovereignty over American contractors U.S. forces who commit crimes, if they are both off-duty and off base. The U.S. were given until July 31, 2009 to withdraw from Iraqi cities and the whole agreement was subject to a referendum of Iraqi voters held prior to June 30, 2009. If the referendum failed to approve the agreement, the Iraqi government would have given the U.S. until July 31, 2010 to withdraw completely.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, the Australian Army {{deployed}} a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) {{of approximately}} 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates {{in preparation for}} operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces.

The majority of the initial rotation of the SOTG was made up of Charlie Company, 2nd Commando Regiment. The SOTG began moving into Iraq in early November. As the Iraqi Government would not agree to sign a <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> agreement to prevent the soldiers from being prosecuted, they entered the country using diplomatic passports instead. Iraq has agreed to grant the soldiers immunity from local laws under this arrangement, though they will be prosecuted in Australia in the event of any misconduct.|$|E

25|$|In 1955 the British Control Commission was {{wound up}} as {{sovereignty}} was {{passed from the}} Western Allies to the West German state. The BFS underwent drastic changes, passing from {{the jurisdiction of the}} British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to that of the War Office, later the Ministry of Defence (although it remained a civilian organisation). Its staff was reduced from around 300 personnel to 38, and it lost many of its executive responsibilities. A limited number of its staff worked on the eastern border but the majority worked at transit points as liaison with the German border authorities. They assisted with the movements of members of the British armed forces in Germany and their dependents, under the <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forces</b> Agreement with West Germany. The headquarters of the BFS was moved to Wahner Heide near Bonn – now Cologne Bonn Airport – where it was administered as part of the Joint Services Liaison Organization. Its operations along the eastern border were administered from a regional headquarters at Hannover. Additional regional liaison offices were located in Berlin, Düsseldorf and Helmstedt, near the main border crossing (Checkpoint Alpha) on the Hamburg-Berlin autobahn.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 presidential election, Obama {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} Iraq War, and Obama withdrew {{the vast majority}} of U.S. soldiers in Iraq by late 2011. On taking office, Obama announced that U.S. combat forces would leave Iraq by August 2010, with 35,000–50,000 American soldiers remaining in Iraq as advisers and trainers, down from the roughly 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq in early 2009. In 2008, President Bush had signed the U.S.–Iraq <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forces</b> Agreement, in which the United States committed to withdrawing all forces by late 2011. Obama attempted to convince Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to allow U.S. soldiers to stay past 2011, but the large presence of American soldiers was unpopular with most Iraqis. By late-December 2011, only 150 American soldiers remained to serve at the US embassy. However, in 2014, the U.S. began a campaign against ISIL, an Islamic extremist terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that grew dramatically after the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from Iraq and the start of the Syrian Civil War. By June 2015, there were about 3500 American soldiers in Iraq serving as advisers to anti-ISIL forces in the Iraqi Civil War, and Obama left office with roughly 5,262 U.S. soldiers in Iraq and 503 of them in Syria.|$|E
