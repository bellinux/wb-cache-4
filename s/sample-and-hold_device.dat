40|$|The use of {{conventional}} analog controllers {{to produce a}} one- quarter -decay transient response in sampled output control systems is studied. In particular, the control of processes which can be adequately represented by a first order lag plus deadtime is analyzed, where the process deadtime does not exceed the sampling interval. The process output is measured by a <b>sample-and-hold</b> <b>device,</b> which introduces additional deadtime equal to the sampling interval. This extends previous work, which considered only the plant delay. Proportional and proportional- integral (two-mode) controllers are studied. Controller settings yielding a one-quarter-decay transient response are calculated using z-transform theory. Plant simulations on a digital computer verify the predicted results. Comparisons are then made with results found by earlier authors studying continuous systems and sampled systems with no feedback deadtime...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The “virtual wall ” is {{the most}} common {{building}} block used in constructing haptic virtual environments. A virtual wall is typically based on a simple spring model, with unilateral constraints that allow the user to make and break contact with a surface. There are a number of factors (<b>sample-and-hold,</b> <b>device</b> dynamics, sensor quantization, etc.) that cause virtual walls to demonstrate active (nonpassive) behavior, destroying the illusion of reality. In this paper, we find an explicit upper bound on virtual wall stiffness that is a necessary and sufficient condition for virtual wall passivity. We consider a haptic display that can be modeled as a mass with Coulomb-plus-viscous friction, being acted upon by two external forces: an actuator and a human user. The system is equipped with only one sensor, an optical encoder measuring the position of the mass. We explicitly model the effects of position resolution, which has not been done in previous work. We make no assumptions about the human user, and we consider arbitrary constant sampling rates. The main result of our analysis is a necessary and sufficient condition for passivity that relies on the Coulomb friction in the haptic device, as well as the encoder resolution. We experimentally verify our results with a one-degree-of-freedom haptic display, and find that the system can display nonpassive behavior in two decoupled modes that are predicted by the necessary and sufficient condition. One mode represents instability, while the other mode results in active tactile sensations.

40|$|Random access {{memory is}} used to store {{synaptic}} information {{in the form of}} a matrix of rows and columns of binary digits. N rows read in sequence are processed through switches and resistors, and a summing amplifier to N neural amplifiers in sequence, one row for each amplifier, using a first array of <b>sample-and-hold</b> <b>devices</b> S/H 1 for commutation. The outputs of the neural amplifiers are stored in a second array of <b>sample-and-hold</b> <b>devices</b> S/H 2 so that after N rows are processed, all of said second array of <b>sample-and-hold</b> <b>devices</b> are updated. A second memory may be added for binary values of 0 and - 1, and processed simultaneously with the first to provide for values of 1, 0, and - 1, the results of which are combined in a difference amplifier...|$|R
