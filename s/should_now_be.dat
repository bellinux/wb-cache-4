25|$|The {{relatively}} empty midfield {{relied on}} defenders that <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> able {{not only to}} steal the ball, but also hold it, pass it or even run with it and start an attack. So this formation required that all players, including defenders, are somehow skilful and with initiative, making it a perfect fit for the Brazilian player's mind. The 4–2–4 needed {{a high level of}} tactical awareness, as having only two midfielders could lead to defensive problems. The system was also fluid enough to allow the formation to change throughout play.|$|E

25|$|Methodist presbyters {{are usually}} given {{pastoral}} charge of several local churches in a circuit. Ordinary presbyters are in turn overseen by a superintendent, {{who is the}} most senior minister in a circuit. Unlike many other Methodist churches, the British church does not have bishops. A report, What Sort of Bishops? to the conference of 2005, was accepted for study and report. This report considered whether this <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> changed, and if so, what forms of episcopacy might be acceptable. Consultation at grassroots level during 2006 and 2007 revealed overwhelming opposition from those who responded. As a consequence, the 2007 conference decided not to move towards having bishops at present.|$|E

In the debate, McMahon identified Blumenthal {{as a career}} politician, touted her job creation record while CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, criticized Washington partisanship for Republicans not being invited {{to the negotiating table}} during healthcare reform discussions in Congress, and stated that remaining stimulus dollars were a waste that <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> used to pay down debt. Blumenthal as well criticized partisanship, saying that he would have sided with Republicans who voted against the Troubled Assets Relief Program. He also used the debate to argue that middle class tax cuts should not have to wait for current tax rates on top income earners to be extended, stated that he would oppose special interests in Washington, and criticized McMahon for outsourcing WWE products overseas.|$|E

25|$|On 5 November 2006, a {{group of}} Muslims {{gathered}} outside the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes, Silibin, {{in the town of}} Ipoh, Perak to protest an alleged conversion of Muslim Malays out of Islam. The allegation was spread via a text message that claimed the church would baptise {{a group of}} Muslim Malays. The message proved to be false as the church celebrated only a Holy Communion service for 110 Indian children. The message further alleged that a famous Malaysian sportsman Azhar Mansor was leaving Islam to embrace Christianity. The police had traced the message to a lady who had met Harussani Zakaria, mufti of the state of Perak in a meeting. He has stated that the message was to remain {{within the confines of the}} meeting but had made no attempt to verify the authenticity of the message nor report it to the police as converting Muslims is illegal under Malaysian law. On 17 November, Azhar Mansor declared that he had not renounced Islam, and Umno president Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said that there <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> an end to the speculation.|$|E

500|$|Yancey was {{increasingly}} {{interested in politics}} as his personal politics moved towards the most radical wing of the Southern Democratic Party. [...] Influenced most by Dixon Hall Lewis, Yancey fell into a social and political circle that included political leaders of the state such as Thomas Mays, J. L. M. Curry, John A. Campbell, and John Gill Shorter. [...] In April 1840, Yancey started a weekly campaign newsletter that supported Democrat Martin Van Buren over Whig William Henry Harrison in the 1840presidential election while emphasizing that slavery <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> the most important political and economic concern of the South.

500|$|Australia has not {{incorporated}} the ICCPR into its domestic law with any specific legislation, unlike some other international treaties, such as World Heritage treaties (see Commonwealth v Tasmania). However, Dietrich {{argued that the}} common law of Australia should be developed {{in accordance with the}} principles in the ICCPR, as well as other international treaties to which Australia is a party. This is the approach used in the United Kingdom, in relation to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, for example. But the court pointed out that this practice was usually done in relation to interpreting legislation, and in this case the court was being asked [...] "to declare that a right which has hitherto never been recognised <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> taken to exist." ...|$|E

500|$|As a symbol, the sea has {{for centuries}} {{played a role}} in {{literature}} and poetry. Sometimes, it is there just as a gentle background but often it introduces such themes as storm, shipwreck, battle, hardship, disaster, the dashing of hopes, or death. In his epic poem the Odyssey, written in the 8th century BC, Homer describes the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero Odysseus who struggles to return home across the sea's many hazards after the war described in the Iliad. The sea is a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694). In modern literature, sea-inspired novels have been written by the sailors Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad, and Herman Wouk. The psychiatrist Carl Jung argued that, in dream interpretation, the sea symbolizes the personal and the collective unconscious. Although the origin of life on Earth is still a matter of debate, naturalist Rachel Carson wrote in The Sea Around Us that [...] "it is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist: the threat is rather to life itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> in a position to rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, {{where are we going to}} end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E
500|$|Researchers {{reported}} finding Armillaria gallica in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in {{the early}} 1990s, during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of extremely low frequency radio stations, which were being investigated {{as a means to}} communicate with submerged submarines. In one particular forest stand, Armillaria-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as A.gallica (then known as A.bulbosa). Using molecular genetics, they determined that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to examine isolates collected from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along [...] transects in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or clone, that had reached its size through vegetative growth. In their conclusion the authors noted: [...] "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom <b>should</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth." [...] After the Nature paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; {{as a result of this}} publicity, the individual acquired the common name [...] "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood.|$|E
