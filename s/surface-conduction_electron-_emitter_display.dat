40|$|Of {{the many}} ways of {{detecting}} high redshift galaxies, the selection of objects due to their redshifted Ly-alpha emission {{has become one of}} the most successful. But what types of galaxies are selected in this way? Until recently, Ly-alpha emitters were understood to be small star-forming galaxies, possible building-blocks of larger galaxies. But with increased number of observations of Ly-alpha emitters at lower redshifts, a new picture emerges. Ly-alpha <b>emitters</b> <b>display</b> strong evolution in their properties from higher to lower redshift. It has previously been shown that the fraction of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) among the Ly-alpha emitters increases dramatically between redshift three and two.

We argue that Ly-alpha emitters are not a homogeneous class of objects, and that the objects selected with this method reflect the general star forming and active galaxy populations at that redshift. Ly-alpha emitters should hence be excellent tracers of galaxy evolution in future simulations and modeling. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted in A&A Letter...|$|R

40|$|Superradiance is a {{signature}} effect in quantum photonics {{that explains the}} collective enhancement of emission power {{by a factor of}} N 2 when N emitters are placed in subwavelength proximity. Although the effect is inherently transient, successful {{attempts have been made to}} sustain it in the steady-state regime. Until recently, the effects of superradiance were not considered to be applicable to thermal emitters due to their intrinsic incoherent nature. Novel nanophotonic thermal <b>emitters</b> <b>display</b> favourable coherent characteristics that enable them to obey principles of superradiance. However, published analytical work on conventional superradiant thermal emitter assemblies show an anomalous power scaling of 1 /N and therefore, increasing the number of thermal emitters leads to a degeneration of power at resonance. This phenomenon immediately renders the effect of thermal superradiance futile since it cannot outperform non-coupled emitters in the steady-state regime. We propose an alternative assembly of thermal emitters with specific features that improves the power scaling while maintaining the effects of superradiance. In essence, we show that our emitter assembly achieves superior power delivery over conventional non-coupled emitter systems at resonance. Additionally, this assembly has the ability to be tuned to operate at specific resonant frequencies, which is a vital requirement for applications such as photothermal cancer therapy...|$|R

Theoretical studies suggest that 1) ?the almost nonemissive nature of the 2 -aryl-substituted complexes is mainly attributable to the large contribution to the LUMO in the S 1 excited state from an o-carborane unit and 2) ?the variation in the C[BOND]C bond length between the S 0 and T 1 state structures increases with increasing steric (2 -alkyl) and electronic effects (2 -aryl) of the 2 -R substituent and the polarity of the solvent.

Representatively, carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) are attractive for use in a variety of nanomaterials for which a high aspect ratio is required. Numerous {{attempts have been made to}} commerciallize these carbon nanomaterials in devices and products. In particular, CNT has been applied in numerous industrial areas, such as <b>emitters</b> [1], <b>displays,</b> x-ray and electron amplifiers [2 – 5], in the probe of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) [6], as a nano-balance and nano-tweezer [7, 8], memory devices [9, 10], lithium-ion battery [11 – 13], and even sensors for neurochemical detection [14 – 16]. Additionally, CNT was recently studied as a filler material to be mixed into a polymer/composite [17 – 19]. The areas in which CNF has been applied are similar to those of CNT. In relation to electrodes, CNF can be used in super capacitor [20, 21], lithium-ion battery [22 – 24], fuel cell [25, 26]. Several studies have shown that CNF can be applied as a gas absorbent [27, 28], catalyst support [29] and to compostie mixture [30 – 33]. However, most studies have focused on performance improvements for products with nanomaterials. The performance, durability and reliability of these product depends on the mechanical properties of nanomaterials. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the precise mechanical properties as a means of determining the reliability of products with nanomaterials, as the mechanical properties of theses materials are closely related to their reliability metrics, such as service life times of the products. But the mechanical behavior and the structure of bulk materials are different with nanomaterials due to the downsizing of materials and the manufacture processing. In other words, the mechanical properties of bulk materials could be not applied to nanomaterial production. Moreover the mechanical properties depend on the change of the physical and chemical characteristic in nanomaterials. Consequently, the mechanical properties should be directly measured on nanomaterials. The evaluation system and standard method of mechanical properties for bulk materials is established to determinate the performance and reliability of the general product with macro size. It is very important to establish the standard method and system, whereas those of nanomaterials have been not organized yet. But the many efforts have been attempted to researched to measure the mechanical properties of nanomaterials and present concretely in the next chapter.|$|R
40|$|The key {{technology}} towards electrically pumped vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are high reflectivity Bragg-mirrors with high conductivity in vertical direction. A Bragg pair {{is made of}} a high and a low refractive index layer with an optical thickness of a quater wavelength each. The ZnSe-based material system {{is the only one}} to realize epitaxial high reflectivity distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) for monolithic devices lattice matched to GaAs in the blue-green spectral region. The use of II-VI materials enables an emission in the green spectral region which is of high interrest for many applications. With green being a primary color it can be used together with red andblue <b>emitters</b> for <b>display</b> technologies. Another application is the use in an optical network using plastic optical fibre (POF) with a absorption minima at 560 nm. A green-emitting VCSEL will enhance the performance of these networks. In literature approaches of II-VI-DBRs are reported using ZnSe/ZnS or ZnSe/ZnTe-DBR structures. DBRs wtih ZnSe/MgSSLsas low index material have been reported but with ZnSe ashigh index material and fewer SL-periods. These structures reach reflectivities around 93 %. Also nitride-based structures with high reflectivities have been reported. But up to now these structures are not conductive. Previous investigations showed that the doping does not affect the optical properties within the accuracy of measurement and p-type doped DBRs have a much lower conductivity than n-type doped DBRs. Therefore only n-doped DBRs seem to be suitable for the use in electrically pumped devices. This work is concentrating on the optimaziation of the design of n-type DBRs, suitable metal contacts and the incorporation of such DBRs into devices. In a first step metal contacts for n- and p-type doped semiconductorswere inverstigated. For the n-type structures Aluminium is asiutable contact material. Current densities of over 160 A/cm 2 at 3 volts have been achieved. Concerning the p-type contacts Pd/Au is the best material. The introduction of a epitactically grown ZnTe/ZnSe contact layer leeds to the best results but also contact without that layer are applicable having the benefit of a better crystal quality of the top mirror. The second step was then to optimize the conductivity of the Bragg-mirrors. To achieve this the MgS layer thickness in the low index super lattice was reduced. This leeds also to a reduction of reflectivity. But even after compensation the latter effct with more periodes a conductivity increase of almost a factor of two can beachieved. In the third and final step the above shown concepts were incorporated into electrically driven surface-emitting devices. Here a RCLED demonstrated the feasibillity of such devices. Different approaches for the contacting are displayed, i. e. intra-cavity contacts and dielectric mirrors...|$|R
30|$|Although CNTs {{have several}} {{advantages}} mentioned above, {{as the key}} component of FED, they must be deposited on a substrate (such as indium tin oxide (ITO) conductive glass) for their applications, low-cost, large-scale area, and homogeneous deposition become the primary targets of CNTs-based field <b>emitters</b> on the <b>display</b> panel [9]. To meet these requirements, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique was adopted. However, the problem of weak electrical contact {{has to be taken}} into account. As field emission electron sources, CNTs must have good adhesion and electric conductivity to the electrode so that they can exhibit excellent field emission performance, especially the stability of electron emission. Wang et al. [10] ascribed the instability in emission current to the structural damage during emission. Bonard et al. [11] attributed the failure of a CNT to the resistive heating at the contact to substrate. More investigations had revealed that emitting CNT would involve a self-heating process [12, 13], which might result in subliming and melting of a CNT and ultimately caused a failure in field emission. Xu and colleagues [14] addressed the physical mechanism responsible for the breakdown process because of the self-heating of CNTs. To sum up, how to avoid the instability of electron emission because of thermal injury of bad contact to substrate is an urgent issue to be overcome. It was reported that the presence of a charging agent could improve the adhesion of CNTs to substrate in the EPD process [15]. Talin et al. [16] developed a method of EPD process with Mg (NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O additive to precoat CNTs with Mg (OH) 2, and then transformed the precoat into MgO by heat-treating that improved the adhesion of the CNTs. Above-mentioned method did not improve the electrical contact between the electrode and CNTs by reason that MgO was the dielectric material. It was also reported that nanostructured metal-CNT composites had a combination of high strength and good plasticity [17]. In this article, a simple and low-cost way to improve field emission performance especially stability of carbon nanotube field emission display (CNT-FED) using copper metallic particle-carbon nanotube (Cu-CNT) assemblies through EPD technique is investigated.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{process for}} the fabrication of random arrays of silicon nanotips has been demonstrated to be feasible. Relative to other such processes, this process offers advantages of low cost and simplicity. Moreover, this process can readily be combined with other processes used to fabricate integrated circuits and other monolithic silicon structures. Arrays of silicon nanotips are subjects {{of research and development}} efforts directed toward utilizing them as field <b>emitters</b> in flat-panel <b>displays,</b> vacuum microelectronics, and microwave devices. Other silicon-nanotip-fabrication processes developed thus far predominantly include lithography, etching, and/or elaborate deposition steps followed by oxide sharpening steps and are both process intensive as well as expensive. In addition to being cheaper and simpler, the present process can efficiently produce silicon nanotips that range in height from a few microns to several tens of microns and are distributed over large areas. The process mentioned here can be summarized as consisting of (1) the growth of micro-etch masks on a silicon substrate, followed by (2) etching away of the masks, along with some of the substrate, to make an array of sharp tips. In the first step of the process, a cleaned silicon substrate is subjected to reactive ion etching (RIE) in a certain mixture of oxygen and carbon tetrafluoride under radio-frequency excitation. This process step results in the growth of fluorine based compounds in the form of stumps randomly distributed on the substrate. These stumps are known in the art as polymer RIE grass. The dimensions of these stumps are of the order of hundreds of nanometers, the exact values depending on process time and gas composition. The areal density of the stumps decreases with increasing process time as they grow and merge with neighboring stumps. These stumps constitute the micro-etch masks for the next step of the process. In the second step of the process, the substrate covered with the microetch masks is subjected to deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process, which consists of cycles of reactive ion etching alternating with passivation (the Bosch process). The gas used in the etching substeps is sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6); the gas used in the passivation substeps is octafluorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8). The portions of the substrate directly under the RIE grass stubs are etched more slowly than are the portions between the stubs. Hence, what remains {{at the end of the}} process, after the stubs and parts of the substrate have been etched away, are silicon spikes where the stubs were (see figure). In a variation of the process, one starts with a silicon or silicon-on-insulator substrate with the intent to etch through the full thickness of the substrate. That is to say, one chooses the thickness so that the DRIE step releases individual nanotips. Such individual silicon nanotips may have utility as microscopic probes in biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|Studies on charge {{transport}} {{properties in}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have been a}} subject of great interest {{for a long time}} not only as an important topic in fundamental science, but also as a basic requirement for the application of CNTs for nanoelectronics. CNTs show a wide range of transport behavior that varies from ballistic to hopping regime, depending on the dimensionality and nature of disorder in the system. Minute variations in disorder can lead from weak to strong localization, and this yields complex and intriguing features in the analysis of transport data. It is particularly important to carry out such a study for multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), in which both dimensionality and disorder play an important role and the nature of localization is non-trivial as wave functions are extended along the tube or bundle of tubes. A proper understanding of the mechanisms of charge transport and their quantitative knowledge is an essential requirement for any possible application of CNTs in nanodevices. Such studies not only yield information on the transport parameters crucial for applications but can also provide a test for any possible microscopic theories of transport. Main focus of the current thesis is to understand the mechanism of charge transport in iron-embedded MWCNTs and to gain more knowledge on the transport behavior. Magnetically functionalized CNTs, in particular the CNTs ﬁlled with ferromagnetic materials are of profound interest for the basic scientiﬁc research as well as for technological application. Iron-embedded MWCNTs are synthesized by one step pyrolysis method. This method gives a proper route to synthesize the magnetic particles encapsulated CNTs. Beyond the geometrical advantage of a cylinder-shaped nanostructure design, the carbon shells provide an effective protection against oxidation of magnetic nanoparticles. The iron-embedded MWCNTs exhibit excellent magnetic properties like the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and the high coercivity, which is larger than the coercivity of bulk iron. Thus, they have signiﬁcant potential for data storage devices and biomedical applications. Vertical alignment of CNTs is an important issue for device applications such as field electron <b>emitters</b> and flat-panel <b>displays.</b> Vertically aligned MWCNTs are grown on various substrates in the present work and the role of catalyst particles in vertical alignment is discussed. This thesis also reports the investigations on the magnetic properties including magnetotransport studies. The thesis is organized in seven chapters and a brief summary of each chapter is given below. Chapter 1 presents an introduction of the CNTs and its structural and electronic properties. Charge transport in CNTs is then discussed in terms of the fundamental aspects of conduction regimes and transport length scales. The synthesis and characterization of iron-embedded MWCNTs is described in chapter 2. It is important to get good quality CNTs in a scalable way. The various methods available for CNT synthesis are arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition etc. A one-step thermally assisted pyrolysis method employed for synthesizing MWCNTs is a simple and cost-effective method. Benzene is used as a precursor and ferrocene as a catalyst in the present case. Good quality CNTs are obtained from this method, which are of multiwall in nature (outer diameter in the range of 10 - 25 nm). Vertically aligned mats of MWCNTs are also obtained on the quartz substrate. The thickness of the mats is several tens of microns. The prepared MWCNTs are characterized by electron microscopic studies for its structure and surface morphology. Many iron particles are seen inside the tubes. Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra taken from the small region of the sample under TEM show the presence of iron. Raman spectra of the sample suggest good quality of the tubes. Prominent G-peak in this spectrum shows that the sample is of well-graphitic nature. X-ray diffraction pattern of MWCNT material shows the presence of -Fe and Fe 3 C apart from the graphitic peak. Chapter 3 describes the growth of vertically aligned MWCNTs (v-MWCNTs) on various substrates and role of catalyst particles in the alignment. The v-MWCNTs are grown on sapphire, quartz and thermally oxidized silicon substrates without pre-deposition of any catalyst. The grown MWCNT mats had a thickness of several tens of microns. Surface elemental analysis shows the presence of catalyst particles on the substrate which is essential for vertical alignment of the tubes. It is found that the order in which the precursor and the catalyst were introduced during chemical vapor deposition determines the orientation of the nanotubes. When there were no catalyst particles on the substrate in the beginning, random alignment of CNTs took place instead of vertical alignment. Base growth mode of CNTs is proposed in the present case from the results obtained. Chapter 4 deals with the magnetic properties of the as-synthesized MWCNTs. The CNTs in pristine form are of diamagnetic in nature. The ferromagnetic-like behavior arises from the iron particles embedded in MWCNTs. These ferromagnetic particles are retained in the MWCNTs automatically, as the catalyst in this case contains iron. MWCNTs of different iron weight percentage are prepared by taking different amount of ferrocene as a precursor. These particles exhibit a magnetic moment up to 98 emu/g and coercivity in the range of 500 – 2000 Oe. Reduced magnetization is attributed to the formation of surface shell with spin disorder and to the presence of Fe 3 C phase. Large coercivity compared to the bulk vale of few orested is due to the complex state of interactions, which can create strong pinning centers for the core moments during the demagnetization. In addition the observed dependence of the magnetoresistance on the direction of applied ﬁeld, is correlated with the shape anisotropy of the Fe particles. The trend of saturation of magnetization at higher fields suggests that exchange coupling in the present case is one-dimensional. The charge transport properties of MWCNT mats are discussed in chapter 5. Many of the transport parameters are often affected by the presence of magnetic field. In order to gain a deeper insight into the conduction mechanism, the study of the electrical transport in presence of magnetic field is highly useful. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the conductivity of MWCNT mat is studied in the temperature range of 1. 4 - 150 K in the magnetic field up to 10 T. The charge transport in the system is governed by Mott’s variable-range hopping (VRH) of three-dimensional type in the higher temperature range and two-dimensional type in the lower temperature range. Mott’s various parameters like localization length, hopping length, hopping energy, and density of states at the Fermi level are deduced from the VRH fit. The hopping length decreases from 13. 2 to 12. 2 nm, as temperature increases from 110 to 150 K. The obtained value of hopping length around ~ 13 nm is within the range of nanotube diameters of 10 to 25 nm. This is the main component of the hopping length, which indicates that VRH takes place on the tube scale. The localization lengths observed in the case of 3 D VRH and 2 D VRH conduction are well within the range of outer diameter of MWCNTs, which indicates that the localization takes place at the tube scale along the boundaries of the tubes. If the charges are localized at the tube boundaries, then the localization length gives an average diameter of the tubes and the results obtained supports this argument. It is also {{important to note that the}} defects present in the nanotubes in the form of structural defects and bad matching of chirality gives rise to localization. There are not many reports on the effect of a magnetic field on the VRH process for MWCNT systems. The resistance of the sample decreases with the magnetic field in the direction of tube axis of the nanotubes. The magnetic field gives rise to delocalization of states as evident from the values of localization lengths at different fields. The application of magnetic field lowers the crossover temperature, at which three-dimensional VRH turns to two-dimensional VRH. The conductivity at the lower temperature side is governed by the weak localization (WL) give rise to positive magnetoconductance (MC). Here a phase diagram with temperature and magnetic field is proposed, showing different regions for different kind of transport mechanisms. This may be applicable for other class of disordered material as well. Chapter 6 deals with the magnetotransport studies on disordered MWCNT mat. The electrical conductivity and MC data are analyzed in the temperature range of 1. 4 - 150 K and in the magnetic fields up to 11 T. The system is in the critical regime obeying conductivity of metallic systems as suggested in weak localization-electron electron interaction model. The MC is positive for the whole temperature range except at temperature below 4. 2 K. Results are analyzed in the terms of weak localization, electron-electron interaction and VRH. The H 2 dependence at lower magnetic fields and H dependence at higher magnetic fields is found supporting weak localization. Inelastic scattering lengths are also deduced from the low temperature MC data and its temperature dependence shows that the dominant dephasing mechanism in the present case is inelastic electron-electron scattering in the dirty limit. Chapter 7 describes measurements on individual MWCNTs and subsequent charge transport studies. After many trials a suitable method was devised to isolate single tubes and to put contacts on it for the four probe measurement. For electrical measurements on isolated single tube, it is found that the joule heating due to excess current is an important issue. A current of the order of few µA burns the sample immediately. I-V characteristics of the MWCNTs show that the electrical contacts are ohmic and the resistance is few k. Initial electrical measurements show that there is slight decrease in resistance with increase of temperature and MR is approximately negative. This behavior suggests that signature of weak localization is present in the sample. Further studies are required in order to gain the insight into the transport mechanism for individual MWCNT. Finally, the thesis concludes with a general conclusion and future directions for this work...|$|R
