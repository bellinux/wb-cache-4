5|$|When {{the police}} arrest Laszlo on a minor, trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by {{promising}} to <b>set</b> <b>him</b> {{up for a}} much more serious crime: possession of the letters.

5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has <b>set</b> <b>him</b> forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|After college he {{rejoined the}} Naval Reserve {{with the aim}} of {{becoming}} an officer. Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.|$|E

5|$|Although Harvey {{started as}} a wicketkeeper at school, he became a highly {{regarded}} cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher. He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions, taking only three wickets in his Test career. Away from the field, Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner, in complete contrast to his dynamic batting, and his non-smoking, non-drinking <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period. Harvey {{was known for his}} respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training <b>set</b> <b>him</b> on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E
5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E

50|$|Tanabe's own {{contribution}} to this dialog between eastern and western philosophy ultimately <b>sets</b> <b>him</b> off from {{the other members of}} the Kyoto School. His radical critique of philosophical reason and method, while stemming from Immanuel Kant and Søren Kierkegaard, which emerges in his work Philosophy as Metanoetics, easily <b>sets</b> <b>him</b> off as a major thinker with a unique position on perennial philosophical questions. Some commentators, for example, suggest that Tanabe's work in Metanoetics is a forerunner of deconstructionism.|$|R
5|$|Mendelssohn enjoyed {{early success}} in Germany, {{where he also}} revived {{interest}} in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, and in his travels throughout Europe. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there– during which many of his major works were premiered– form {{an important part of}} his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt, Richard Wagner, Charles-Valentin Alkan and Hector Berlioz. The Leipzig Conservatoire (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig), which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Tsaritsa Catherine the Great on November 17, 1796, {{led to a}} change in Russia's {{policies}} toward Poland. On November 28, Tsar Paul I, who had hated Catherine, pardoned Kościuszko and <b>set</b> <b>him</b> free, after he had tendered an oath of loyalty. Paul promised to free all Polish political prisoners held in Russian prisons and forcibly settled in Siberia. The Tsar gave Kościuszko 12,000 rubles, which the Pole later, in 1798, attempted to return, when also renouncing the oath.|$|E
5|$|The {{two seasons}} of Carnivàle {{take place in}} the Depression-era Dust Bowl between 1934 and 1935, and consist of two main plotlines that slowly converge. The first {{involves}} a young man with strange healing powers named Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who joins a traveling carnival when it passes near his home in Milfay, Oklahoma. Soon thereafter, Ben begins having surrealistic dreams and visions, which <b>set</b> <b>him</b> on the trail of a man named Henry Scudder, a drifter who crossed paths with the carnival many years before, and who apparently possessed unusual abilities similar to Ben's own.|$|E

5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|A youth named Guybrush Threepwood {{arrives on}} the fictional Mêlée Island™, {{with the desire}} to become a pirate. He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who <b>set</b> <b>him</b> three trials that must be {{completed}} to become a pirate: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, finding a buried treasure, and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion. These quests take Guybrush throughout the island, where he hears of stories of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck, who apparently died in an expedition to the mysterious Monkey IslandTM, an act that was meant to win the love of the governor Elaine Marley. Guybrush meets several characters of interest, including a local voodoo priestess, Stan the Used Boat Salesman, Carla the Sword Master, a prisoner named Otis, and Meathook, whose hands have been replaced by hooks.|$|E

She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They invite him to have Christmas dinner, as they had always <b>set</b> <b>him</b> a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E
5|$|At the {{shipping}} yard, Dexter breaks into the container in the picture, {{only to find}} it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him what he is doing, and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that {{he knows that he}} is up to something, and says that he will be watching him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and <b>set</b> <b>him</b> up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|Falko Bindrich {{was born}} on 17 October 1990 in Zittau, Germany, to parents Zdena and Oswald Bindrich. His father, Oswald Bindrich (born 1951), was an expert-level chess player, with a highest Elo rating of 2212. In 1993, {{at the age of}} three, Falko was taught chess by his brother and soon after, his father, Oswald, {{enrolled}} him the Oberland Chess Club. In 1998, he entered for the German Youth Individual Championship (under nine) and placed 28th out of 80 participants. After achieving second place in the 1999 German Youth U10 Individual Championship, he was allowed to attend the U10 European Championship where he finished only 39th. After this disappointment, he asked his father, Oswald, how he could improve, and he <b>set</b> <b>him</b> on a daily training regimen with him and later consulted with stronger German players. In late 1999, he reached 1400 Elo, whereby his training sessions were extended and held with the likes of grandmasters Lubomir Ftacnik and Zigurds Lanka.|$|E

Hoffman asks Salaam to use Karami, but he refuses, believing a greater return will come later. Unknown to Ferris and Salaam, Hoffman tells Ferris' CIA subordinate (Skip) to follow Karami and kidnap him. Karami escapes and notifies the terrorists in the safe house that it is being watched, and they abandon it. Ferris's partner is caught and Salaam accuses Ferris of having had knowledge of the move on Karami, and blames Ferris's duplicity with him for the destruction of the safe house. He exiles Ferris from Jordan.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Kenney {{became a}} student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, the Air Corps' {{advanced}} training school. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, and therefore a waste of time, but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army. Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was particularly interested in low-level attacks, as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments. His interest in attack aviation would ultimately <b>set</b> <b>him</b> apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.|$|E
