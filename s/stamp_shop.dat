The Clerk of the Signet made 'a Signet bill for the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal.' I paid him four pound, seven. The Clerk of the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal made 'a Privy-Seal bill for the Lord Chancellor.' I paid him, four pound, two. The Privy-Seal bill was {{handed over to the}} Clerk of the Patents, who engrossed the aforesaid. I paid him five pound, seventeen, and eight; at the same time, I paid Stamp-duty for the Patent, in one lump, thirty pound. I next paid for 'boxes for the Patent,' nine and sixpence. Note. Thomas Joy would have made the same at a profit for eighteen-pence. I next paid 'fees to the Deputy, the Lord Chancellor's Purse-bearer,' two pound, two. I next paid 'fees to the Clerk of the Hanapar,' seven pound, thirteen. I next paid 'fees to the Deputy Clerk of the Hanaper,' ten shillings. I next paid, to the Lord Chancellor again, one pound, eleven, and six. Last of all, I paid 'fees to the Deputy Sealer, and Deputy Chaff- wax,' ten shillings and sixpence.

If I had taken it out for the United Kingdom, it would have cost me more than three hundred pound.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an ultrasonic instrument to measure texture (preferred grain orientation), stress, and related physical properties in metal sheets in industrial environments. The technique is based on precise measurements of the speed of guided modes, including angular variations, and is made practical by the use of EMAT transducers, which require no couplant. The instrument is expected to find important initial applications in predicting sheet metal formability, either as a process control tool in the rolling mill or as a quality control tool in a <b>stamping</b> <b>shop.</b> Since the instrument will offer an improved measurement capability not presently available to industry, a much broader range of applications may develop, including measurements of stress and porosity in sheet and other simple geometries...|$|R
