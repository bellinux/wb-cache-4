5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters on the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and the enemies on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from the arcade game. Some have Donkey Kong on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in the barrel level (like he is in the arcade game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E
5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across {{the left or}} right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
50|$|In {{shooting}} mode, {{the balls}} fly {{in from all}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> balls are <b>of</b> four colors and must be shot with the cursor color matching their own.|$|R

5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, and revolves around Robbie the Robot's objective {{to defend his}} plant from interstellar space slugs. The plant grows from a pot at the bottom centre of the screen, and spray cans containing three different pesticides are located on ledges on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Bonus items such as fertiliser and spades appear on unoccupied ledges which will increase both the players score and the plant's growth rate.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a side-scrolling endless runner snowboarding game. The player {{character}} moves automatically through procedurally generated landscapes {{towards the}} right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and the player can only control when to jump. The player taps the screen once to jump {{and holds the}} screen while the player character is midair to perform tricks. While the character moves across the landscape, the player can complete some of the game's 180 goals, though they are given only three at a time. Goals include such things as traveling a set distance, rescuing runaway llamas, crossing dangerous gaps, grinding across rooftops of villages, and outsmarting the mountain elders. The player receives awards from completing goals, and can also collect coins {{that can be used}} to purchase upgrades. Players perform tricks in quick succession, or combos, to earn points towards a competitive high score. The game also tracks distance traveled and trick combos. Later in the game, players can use a wingsuit, which changes some elements of the game. The environments of Alto's Adventure change in lighting as time passes through the cycle of the day, and incorporate various weather effects. Player progress syncs between iPads and iPhones over iCloud, and the game uses Game Center leaderboards.|$|E

50|$|The HUD {{was changed}} {{slightly}} in the home console version where it was set along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> rather than <b>the</b> bottom.|$|R
50|$|NinJump is a game. The player, as a ninja, {{climbing}} up the walls on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> while dodging protruding objects and attacking things in the air.|$|R
25|$|On {{the upper}} left hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> there are two bars: heart gauge (maximum of five hearts) and emotion meter. Whenever Peach falls down a hole, an ocean of lava or gets hit by an enemy, she loses half a heart and respawns at the last checkpoint. When all hearts are gone, she must start over at the {{beginning}} of the level. Peach has infinite lives, so the player can continue as much as he/she pleases.|$|E
25|$|The spiritual {{barometer}} is on {{the lower}} left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> This is a close-up view of the main character currently being played. Since good behavior is meaningless lacking the temptation to do evil, each character is free to do good or evil acts. However, good acts are rewarded by increases in the character's spiritual barometer, which affect the chances of the player destroying AM in the final adventure. Conversely, evil acts are punished by lowering the character's spiritual barometer.|$|E
25|$|With {{triggered}} sweeps, {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negativeâ€”trigger polarity).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{exterior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nexus 4 uses a glass-based construction with {{a rounded}} metallic plastic bezel; to improve <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> edge swiping gestures, {{the glass is}} slightly curved on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> device contains a glass panel with an etched pattern of dots, producing a [...] "holographic" [...] effect.|$|R
50|$|Normal mode {{frames the}} 4:3 video to the 16:9 picture area by {{displaying}} {{it in its}} original aspect ratio, with vertical gray or black bars on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> disadvantage <b>of</b> this method {{is the fact that}} the image is small by virtue <b>of</b> not using <b>the</b> entire width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> This is also known as the 4:3 mode.|$|R
50|$|The {{player is}} {{equipped}} with the AK47 rifle as monsters and spiders make their way towards the player from {{the left and right}} <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> respectively. This mode does not have perk or bonuses.|$|R
25|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of the main protagonist of the series, Mario. Mario's younger brother, Luigi, is only playable by the second player in the game's {{multiplayer}} mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool. The player moves from the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.|$|E
25|$|Window {{management}} in Windows 7 has several new features: Snap maximizes a window {{when it is}} dragged {{to the top of}} the screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows users to snap software windows to either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> such that the windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state. Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. Shake hides all inactive windows when the active window's title bar is dragged back and forth rapidly (metaphorically shaken).|$|E
25|$|Windows Sidebar {{is a new}} panel {{which can}} be placed on either the left or the {{right-hand}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> where a user can place Desktop Gadgets, which are small applets designed for a specialized purpose (such as displaying the weather or sports scores). The gadgets can also be placed on {{other parts of the}} desktop, if desired, by dragging. By default, Windows Vista ships with 11 gadgets: Calendar, Clock, Contacts, CPU Meter, Currency Conversion, Feed Headlines, Notes, Picture Puzzle, Slide Show, Stocks, and Weather. Additional gadgets were published at Microsoft's web site, which offered both Microsoft-created and user-submitted gadgets in a gallery. This feature was removed for security reasons.|$|E
60|$|This {{artificial}} breeze, sweeping round <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> {{caused an}} eddy which sent up {{a cloud of}} coal-dust, but neither John nor his mate appeared to care for this. Their eyes were evidently coal-proof.|$|R
50|$|NinJump Deluxe is {{an action}} game and <b>the</b> sequel <b>of</b> NinJump. <b>The</b> player, as a ninja, {{climbing}} up walls on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> while dodging protruding objects and attacking {{things in the}} air. This version has three new levels.|$|R
50|$|Marooned {{on the ice}} planet Krybor, {{the player}} uses a laser cannon to destroy legions of demons that attack from above. Visually, the demons appear in waves similar to other space-themed shooters, but {{individually}} combine from <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> area above the player's cannon.|$|R
25|$|Jacek is {{armed with}} a gun which can be {{upgraded}} by collecting special batteries. A special meter on the right-hand <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> shows the current firepower of the gun. There is {{a limited number of}} shots of each power level available â€” once these run out, the firepower of the gun falls down by one level. At higher firepower levels the gun's rate of fire drops down, forcing the player to wait for the gun to cool down before firing again; the temperature of the gun is indicated by another meter on the left-hand side. Touching a checkpoint causes the gun's power level to drop down back to zero.|$|E
25|$|Still {{searching for}} a single-tube {{solution}} that was bright enough for direct viewing, in 1942 Baird hit upon the Telechrome concept. His solution was essentially to combine two tubes into one large spherical enclosure. In {{the center of the}} enclosure was a translucent mica sheet forming the display, covered on one side with cyan phosphor, the other with an orange-red color, producing a limited but useful color gamut. Two electron guns arranged on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> fired at it, producing the two colors. The image was viewed from one side, seeing one of the colors directly and the other being transmitted through the screen from the other side. This was the first single-tube color television system.|$|E
25|$|A MapMaker is also {{available}} that can create playable levels. Levels for Story mode can be made as well as levels for Arcade mode. Created Story levels, however, cannot be played co-operatively. Maps are created by selecting and placing different pre-made tiles and rooms onto a grid. Spawn points, weapons, bags, armour, and objectives can then be placed anywhere on the level. There is a bar in the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> representing memory, that lowers each time a tile or item is placed. When the bar depletes completely, nothing else can be placed onto the map. However, items can be deleted to increase memory. A theme can be chosen for each map such as Victorian, Industrial, Alien, and Virtual, which changes how the rooms appear.|$|E
5000|$|Regular Objects: These {{move down}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> player's {{judgement}} line, richocheting off <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Regular Objects can have black or gold rims: the gold-rimmed Objects will move {{back towards the}} opponent's judgement line once hit. Only the gold-rimmed Objects {{can be used to}} perform Just Reflec.|$|R
50|$|The links were {{produced}} in the 16:9 widescreen format. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insert programming was only available in the older 4:3 format; this is cropped to be <b>screened</b> in <b>the</b> compromise 14:9 format with coloured bars at <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> {{to make up the}} difference. Shows made in 16:9 are not cropped.|$|R
25|$|TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter that {{requires}} players to kill enemies and complete objectives {{using a variety}} of weapons and tactics in different predefined scenarios. Armour and health bars on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> lower when <b>the</b> player is shot, which can be increased by walking over body armor and medical kits.|$|R
25|$|The Visual Studio code editor also {{supports}} setting bookmarks in code for quick navigation. Other navigational aids include collapsing code blocks and incremental search, {{in addition to}} normal text search and regex search. The code editor also includes a multi-item clipboard and a task list. The code editor supports code snippets, which are saved templates for repetitive code and can be inserted into code and customized for the project being worked on. A management tool for code snippets is built in as well. These tools are surfaced as floating windows which can be set to automatically hide when unused or docked to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The Visual Studio code editor {{also supports}} code refactoring including parameter reordering, variable and method renaming, interface extraction and encapsulation of class members inside properties, among others.|$|E
25|$|Atomix {{takes place}} on a playfield, {{consisting}} {{of a number of}} walls, with the atoms scattered throughout. The player is tasked with assembling a molecule from the atoms; more specifically, the atoms must be arranged into a specific shape, identical with the shape of the molecule displayed on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The player can choose an atom and move it in any of the four cardinal directions; however, a moved atom keeps sliding in one direction until it hits a wall or another atom. Solving the puzzles requires strategic planning in moving the atoms, and on later levels with little free space, even finding room for the completed molecule can be a problem. Once the molecule is assembled, the player receives score; the faster the puzzle is completed, the more score is given.|$|E
25|$|Also on August 14, 2006, UPN {{discontinued}} all promotional {{advertising for}} its programs during network time periods (except for audition promotions for America's Next Top Model that aired during that program), though some local stations still aired promos for the network's shows. The network also stopped customizing the closing credits of its shows to the network's standardized graphics scheme (perhaps {{in reaction to}} affiliate preemptions, see below), instead showing the program's studio credits full-screen with theme music intact (save for ANTM, where previews for the next episode and casting calls for future CW cycles were shown on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> with the studio credits on the right). In contrast, at The WB, advertising for its shows continued during network time periods, with promos for The CW mixed in, and the network's standard closing credits format remained unchanged with promos in the upper two-thirds of the screen and credits in the lower third.|$|E

50|$|The buttery was {{situated}} to one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens</b> passage, which sectioned off <b>the</b> low end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Hall. <b>The</b> <b>screens</b> passage generally {{had two or}} three doors on the side opposite its entrances into the Great Hall, which led, respectively, to the buttery, kitchen, and pantry, each of which formed separate household departments.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{level is}} a [...] "fixed" [...] shooter. More specifically, it is a [...] "tube shooter" [...] where the player {{approaches}} the last boss's fortress {{and attempts to}} destroy it. Apollo, in a more enhanced ship than any seen before, rotates from <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> bottom, shooting at the center while avoiding enemy fire.|$|R
