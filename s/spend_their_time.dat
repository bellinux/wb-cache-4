5|$|While wintering, {{bald eagles}} {{tend to be}} less habitat and {{disturbance}} sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.|$|E

25|$|People {{often say}} that {{machines}} enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, {{but they are}} wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still {{have to work with}} the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.|$|E
25|$|Alexander I {{gave the}} palace to his brother, the future Nicholas I, for summer usage. From that time on, {{it was the}} summer {{residence}} of the heir to the throne. From 1830–1850, extensive redecoration was carried out according to designs by D.Cerfolio, A.Thon, D.Yefimov, A.Stakenschneider and others in keeping with rapidly changing tastes. The appearance of the formal and private rooms of the palace during Nicholas' reign can be seen in exquisite watercolors by E. Hau, I. Premazzi and I. Volsky from 1840-1860. The famous Mountain Hall which had a large slide built in for the children of Nicholas I was built during this time. Nicholas I and his family lived in the palace from the early spring till the end of May and after a short period at Krasnoye Selo during manoeuvres returned to the palace to <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> there until the late autumn. In 1842, the Imperial couple celebrated their silver wedding anniversary with a series of galas including a medieval jousting tournament. Two years later, the family mourned the death of Nicholas's daughter Grand Duchess Alexandra (1825–1844), who was born at the palace and lived the last few months of her life there. On October 19, 1860, the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna also died at the palace.|$|E
25|$|Larvae hatch about 12–21 {{hours after}} the eggs have been laid. The larvae are a cream color. C. hominivorax larvae dive head-first into {{whatever}} food source is nearest, and burrow deeper, eating into live flesh if available. This results in a pocket-like lesion that causes severe pain to the host. C. macellaria larvae only feed on the necrotic tissue of a wound. After 5 to 7 days, the larvae drop and {{move away from the}} food source to pupate. The larvae burrow into the first layer of topsoil, beneath leaves or garbage, and begin their pupation. The pupa is a dark brown color. This stage can last from 7 days at a warm temperature to as long as two months if the weather is much colder. The adults emerge and spend a day or two finishing maturity. Adults of C. hominivorax breed only once in their lifetimes. Sexually mature adults breed 3–4 days after emerging from the pupa. Males mature rapidly, and <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> waiting and eating nearby vegetation and the nectar of flowers. The females, however, are predatory, and feed on the fluids from live wounds. The females can fly long distances to find a mate. The adult flies of this species live around two to three weeks.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{graduation}} thesis was to {{find out}} how pupils with special needs, who are part of a regular educational program with additional support, <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time.</b> We wanted to present how they experience and <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time,</b> what activities they participate in and how active they are in comparison to their peers in primary school. In the theoretical part of the thesis we defined the concept of free time, we presented the development of children during primary education and the main aspects of education and integration of children with special needs into regular classes of primary school. In the empirical part of the thesis we conducted a survey in which we explored how children that are committed into a regular educational program with additional support <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time,</b> the differences in the way they spend it and how involved they are in school and afterschool (extracurricular) activities in comparison with their peers in primary school. The obtained results show that pupils with additional support <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time</b> in different and active ways, preferably in the company of their friends. They get involved in school and afterschool (extracurricular) activities. Children with special needs <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> free <b>time</b> in a similar way to their peers. ...|$|R

25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled to a lot of art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has touched him and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E
25|$|Through {{various groups}} and {{organizations}} {{that the women}} of Willow Bunch belong to, they often <b>spend</b> <b>their</b> <b>time</b> volunteering and raising money for charities and community causes. The Legion Ladies Auxiliary #287 was formed June 8, 1974 in Willow Bunch. Its curling team won first in the Legion auxiliary zone district curling bonspiel in 1982. The Catholic Women’s League started in October 29, 1963 in Willow Bunch. The League says it is, “dedicated to serving {{the needs of the}} community and increasing the spiritual growth of its members as they work and share together”. Its members raise money doing raffles, teas, bake sales, etc. and then donate to various organizations and charities. The Federation des Femmes Canadiennes Françaises was originally formed in 1914 in Canada to help soldiers of World War I. It came to Willow Bunch in 1967. Since the war their goal has been to help French Canadian women reach their full potential and to be proud of their heritage {{as a member of the}} minority in the community. They have carried out substantial work for different charities including distributing meals for, “Meals on Wheels”. The Happy Hobby Club originated at the house of Elizabeth “Beth” Marie Louise Viala in October 1955. They enjoyed themselves meeting on a weekly basis and often worked on projects, which they sold to raise money for charities (such as quilts). They also put on social events in the Community Centre (formerly the Sharon School building). They had annual picnic for members and their families; one year, 100 people were in attendance. The Kinettes Club of Willow Bunch was formed on January 27, 1978 with Mary Eger as the formation president. Their goal was to help with Kinsmen club projects as well as to start their own projects in order to promote Willow Bunch and stimulate community interest. Their events include Ladies Night Out and the Community Birthday Calendar.|$|E
