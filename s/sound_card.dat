5|$|A {{version of}} the game with VGA {{graphics}} and <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> audio appeared in 1991. Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards used the new game engine Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was released in 1991 for the Amiga, DOS, and Macintosh platforms. For the first remake, Al Lowe served as director and designer, also helping to program the game, and Ken Williams became executive producer. Other key people included Stuart Moulder (producer), William R. Davis Sr. (creative director), William D. Skirvin (art designer), Mark Seibert (music director), Oliver Brelsford (lead programmer), and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris Braymen.|$|E

25|$|A PSK31 {{operator}} typically uses a single-sideband (SSB) transceiver {{connected to}} the <b>sound</b> <b>card</b> of a computer running PSK31 software. When the operator enters a message for transmission, the software produces an audio tone that sounds, to the human ear, like a continuous whistle with a slight warble. This sound is then fed through either a microphone jack (using an intermediate resistive attenuator to reduce the sound card's output power to microphone levels) or an auxiliary connection into the transceiver, from which it is transmitted.|$|E
