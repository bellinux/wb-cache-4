50|$|Press {{comment in}} a country where {{technical}} innovation generates enthusiasm was very positive in respect of the car’s status as the world’s first production car to be fitted with a belt driven camshaft, but criticised the unresponsiveness of the standard drum brakes and the heavy clutch. The car’s tendency to pitch under acceleration or <b>sharp</b> <b>braking</b> which was attributed to its short wheel base also drew criticism as did the “back to front” gear box which, as on the existing Isar, had originally been intended for a (never produced except as a prototype) front-wheel-drive small car and accordingly positioned first and third gears nearest to the driver, with second and fourth gears nearest the front of the car.|$|E
5000|$|The Water-Tank Challenge: For {{this annual}} challenge, the drivers must {{navigate}} an early 1990s Volvo station wagon with a roof-mounted 300-litre water tank (which has been specially reinforced {{to prevent a}} recurrence of the incident the previous season when Shelby D'Souza accidentally broke the tank midway through his run) through a course designed to test their ability to drive smoothly. Andrew has another rocky demonstration, getting soaked three times and losing 25 litres of water. Tyler has the first run, and loses large amounts of water on {{every part of the}} course, along with knocking down a foam person in the final slalom; he sets the bar extremely low, losing 180 litres. While George only loses 60 litres(by far the smallest amount of any of the drivers), his braking and acceleration are erratic throughout the challenge, and the experts remain unimpressed by his attitude toward the challenges. Jason loses over half of the water on the opening straight alone due to jerky acceleration and <b>sharp</b> <b>braking,</b> and bizarrely decides to remove his new glasses halfway through the challenge, making things even worse, and he loses 150 litres. Siham also drives erratically throughout, and the experts note that Wayne's well-intentioned but poor advice is becoming as much of a problem as Siham's own lack of self-confidence; she loses 140 litres. Mariah loses 280 litres of water after a run so bad that most of it doesn't even get shown after she lets go of the steering wheel during the initial straight. Amazingly, Chanie loses exactly the same amount of water due to repeated <b>sharp</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{years of}} the war require a <b>sharp</b> <b>brake</b> on Vico's activity: he leaves his studio in Rome and settles {{with his family in}} Siena, where he builds {{relations}} of deep esteem with Count Guido Chigi Saracini, a lover of chamber music and important figure in Siena's charismatic cultural environment. Vico makes for him the door of Gratitude for the Duomo of Siena, opened on August 16, 1946, as the fulfillment of the vote for the salvation of the city made two years earlier by the Sienese citizenship. It's the first of five monumental bronze doors he created, a sculptural record recognized by the citizens of Siena who named him, with familiarity and affection, [...] "Vico of the door". Then Vico joins and wins the competition for the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, that was cast by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry of Florence and opened during the Jubilee of 1950; after that Vico makes the bronze door for the church of Ludriano (Brescia), commissioned by Count Antonio Folonari, and completes the series in 1966 with the main door of the sanctuary of Oropa in Biella, that is the largest door he ever made (also cast in Florence by the Ferdinando Marinelli's Foundry).|$|R
25|$|Contemporary {{automotive}} {{journalists were}} effusive about the SM's dynamic qualities, which were unlike anything {{they had experienced}} before. The SM provided a combination of comfort, <b>sharp</b> handling, and <b>braking</b> not available in any other car at the time. The magazine Popular Science noted that the SM had the shortest stopping distance of any car they had tested.|$|R
5000|$|Cliffside Realm - The Cliffside Realm has {{tracks that}} composes of switchbacks and loops {{alongside}} a towering cliff. Drivers {{will need to}} navigate hairpin turns while avoiding rock slides, falling trees and large flying vultures if they hope {{to make it to}} the end of the Cliffside Realm. The Cliffside Realm tests a driver's ability of drifting (Sideswiping or fishtailing a <b>sharp</b> turn while <b>braking</b> and accelerating after, decreasing friction and thus increasing traction and speed).|$|R
5000|$|The Water Tank Challenge: For this year's {{incarnation}} of this signature challenge, the drivers each have to navigate a 1992 Buick Roadmaster station wagon through an obstacle course. A partially-open plexiglas tank containing 200 litres {{of water is}} mounted on the roof, and any less-than-smooth driving {{will lead to a}} soaking for the driver and their nominator. Even Andrew is unable to carry out the course perfectly, losing 20 litres in his demonstration. Tyler is up first, and his sharp, erratic braking leads to him losing 185 of the 200 litres, setting the bar very low. Daniella gets off to a terrible start, crashing through the barrier {{at the end of the}} initial straight and losing a lot of water, though she does a little better in the rest of her run, losing 110 litres. Lou requires two attempts on the initial straight after suffering a panic attack on her first go, and then has to be guided by Andrew for much of her run. While she loses less than Tyler, with 120 litres, she takes by far the longest to complete the challenge. Krystal ends up quitting the challenge after only driving a few car lengths, during which she still gets soaked thanks to erratic acceleration and <b>sharp</b> <b>braking.</b> Diana drives too hastily during her run, causing her to lose 150 litres. Mike has one of the better runs so far, losing slightly over 100 litres, but his slow response times still prove a major issue. Amrinder, whom Akash is unable to accompany in this challenge due to an old back injury, has a less-than-enthusiastic Tim Danter in the car with him. Despite Amrinder committing a major blunder when he makes a wrong turn and nearly leaves the course, causing him and Tim to get soaked when he's forced to brake, he still has the best performance for the second challenge in a row, losing 80 litres.|$|E
5000|$|The Water Tank Challenge: In this year's {{variation}} of the challenge, the drivers have to drive a Volkswagen New Beetle with a shark-inspired livery and roof-mounted water tank down a straight section of road at 50 km/h, then through a course of wheel rims, over a pair of rails, then stop before they hit a suddenly-appearing baby carriage, and finally turn the car around in a section made up of concrete Jersey barriers and blocks. Despite his best efforts, Andrew loses 18 L {{during the course of}} his demonstration, mostly because this year's incarnation is designed to soak drivers who spent too much time going up or down the rails. Sholom is the first to take the challenge, and loses a lot of water on the initial straight section thanks to uneven acceleration and <b>sharp</b> <b>braking.</b> He gets through the wheel rims without hitting anything, although he misses the rails altogether, causing him to lose even more water. After that, Sholom hits the baby carriage and pushes {{it all the way to}} the concrete barriers, where he breaks the foam tail fin that has been attached to the car's rear. This, along with the amount of denting and scraping that he causes while trying to turn around, and a total of 140 L of water lost, causes Andrew to comment that Sholom looks not only like Canada's Worst Driver (something that even Shmuel has to agree with), but very possibly the single worst driver who's ever appeared on the show. Polly doesn't fare much better, losing a lot of water on the initial straight after failing to brake at all, and then accelerating and braking erratically throughout her run; she loses 120 L. Jordan gets off to a bad start by braking sharply at the end of the initial straight, but after that he loses even less than Andrew did in the corresponding parts of his demonstration, and has an overall water loss of just 23 L, by far the best performance of the day. Renee does well initially, but she rapidly loses her nerve (and a huge amount of water) when she hits the baby carriage at some speed. Subsequently, her acceleration becomes very erratic, and this combined with a lot of hits while turning around in the concrete barriers causes her to lose a total of 130 L. Jillian is exempted from this challenge, as the experts are not worried about her pedal control; instead, Andrew drives her into Dunnville, then asks her to drive a short journey to a nearby coffee shop, guided by a talking GPS unit, this time without anyone else in the car. She proves so nervous that it takes her ten minutes just to get going, and during the journey, she goes considerably off-course, though thanks to the GPS' turn-by-turn navigation, it does not take too long for her to get to her destination. Once she arrives, Andrew asks her to make the same journey again in reverse, but she declines, claiming that she's too nervous to do so.|$|E
40|$|An optimal Fractional Order PID (FOPID) {{controller}} {{is designed}} for a full vehicle nonlinear active suspension system. The optimal values of FOPID controller parameters for minimizing the cost function are tuned using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), which offers an optimal solution to a multidimensional rough objective function. The fitness parameters of FOPID controller (proportional constant P, integral constant I, derivative constant D, integral order and derivative order) are selected from ranges of reliable values, depending on survival-to-the-fitness principle used in the biology science. A full vehicle nonlinear active suspension model including hydraulic actuators, nonlinear dampers and nonlinear springs has been proposed with structural and analytical details. The nonlinear frictional forces due to rubbing of piston seals with the cylinders wall inside the actuators {{are taken into account}} to find the real supply forces generated by the hydraulic actuator. The results of the full vehicle nonlinear suspension system using the FOPID controller are compared with the corresponding passive suspension system (system without controller). The controlled suspension system has been investigated under typical vehicle maneuvers: cruising on rough road surface, <b>sharp</b> <b>braking</b> and cornering. The results have clearly shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller...|$|E
5000|$|What Car {{tested the}} XM 2.0 (8v) Si against the Renault 25 GTX, Lancia Thema CDi and Saab 9000 2.0 16v. The XM came second overall. The {{magazine}} summarized its test as follows [...] "The XM {{is an impressive}} car in many respects, particularly in its excellent interior spaciousness, and for the confirmed Citroen enthusiast the oleopneumatic suspension, super <b>sharp</b> steering and <b>brakes</b> {{will be a major}} attraction. Its a great long distance cruiser but is let down by mediocre outright performance. Many will consider the XM to have outstanding elegance and style, a brilliant car that stands out among the current crop of jelly-mould, computer-designs. Others will be put off in the first ten minutes by {{what they see as the}} oversharp steering and brakes." [...] Concerning the ride quality, What Car noted that while the overall ride was of a high quality, the XM was unable to absorb short, sharp irregularities.|$|R
5000|$|The Water-Tank Challenge: For this, {{one of the}} show's most {{notoriously}} tricky challenges, {{the drivers}} each have to drive at 40 km/h through an obstacle course with a 100-litre tank of water mounted on the car's roof. The car used is a Ford Taurus wagon, painted in a water-inspired livery. Any <b>sharp</b> acceleration or <b>braking</b> {{will result in the}} water draining from the tank onto the driver and their nominator. As usual, even Andrew doesn't avoid a soaking, losing 16 litres of water in all (he deliberately accelerates and stopssharply at the end as well). Sly is first-up, and his acceleration and braking are erratic throughout the challenge, resulting in him losing 65 litres. Dale doesn't fare much better and loses 55 litres, mostly through not properly using her mirrors. Michael keeps driving too fast, but still has what {{turns out to be the}} best run in this challenge, losing 50 litres (also making him the only drive beside Andrew to keep at least half the water in the tank). Kevin doesn't take the challenge seriously and keeps braking sharply, resulting in him losing 80 litres. Shelby knocks over a foam person in his run, then backs over it, and the shock of hitting the ground on the other side of the person fractures the tank, resulting in all 100 litres draining into the driver's compartment. Angelina doesn't participate in the challenge, instead getting a private therapy session from Shyamala. Despite the concerns of the experts that she shouldn't be in rehab, Angelina is able to talk Shyamala out of expelling her, and it's agreed that she may continue on the show for now.|$|R
5000|$|Used {{for very}} short {{distances}} where a rope, chain, or {{a length of}} webbing {{is attached to the}} casualty, which must have a working braking system as it will be used to slow both vehicles. This can be dangerous, unless both drivers are competent enough to do it. Although many people believe this is illegal on motorways it is not in Europe, as long as the relevant trailer laws are complied with, i.e., correctly configured lights and signing, observing trailer speed limits, etc. In the US this is simply called a [...] "flat tow", and it is not common practice to use the brakes of the rear vehicle to stop both vehicles. As typically a car is being flat towed because the engine won't run, and without a running engine the power brakes don't work, it could be dangerous as well as difficult to slow and stop two vehicles using only the brakes that only half function. Instead, it is typical for the towing vehicle to drive normally, but avoiding <b>sharp</b> acceleration or <b>braking.</b> All the person driving the rear vehicle has to do is gently apply the brakes whenever the tow chain begins to slacken, and anticipate stops so he or she can drag the brakes and come to a halt without excessive slack in the chain. This still requires a relatively skilled driver, as neither the power brakes or power steering will function, and you must take care to steer wide in sharp corners and never allow the chain to slacken, or it may get jerked and broken, or worse, drag underneath the vehicle and possibly cause damage or even loss of control.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{coatings}} of {{road traffic}} highways along with operational loadings caused by {{flow of traffic}} are subjected to weather and climate impacts. These are the following impacts: changes in temperature and air humidity, solar radiation, surface wind speed which is participating in formation of active heat-and-mass transfer in a surface layer of the concrete coating. One of the most complicated and important periods in the road traffic highway operation is so called transitional nature period (from Summer to Autumn and from Winter to Spring). These periods are accompanied by intensive rain and snow fall and possible formation of ice loading {{on the surface of}} cement and concrete coatings. These impacts significantly deteriorate friction properties of road pavement (friction factor φ is decreased up to 0. 4 and less) that can be a prerequisite to creation of various accident situations due to <b>sharp</b> increase in <b>braking</b> distance. For example, while having dry pavement the friction factor φ is equal to 0. 80 – 0. 85, and during icy condition of the road the factor φ constitutes 0. 08 – 0. 15 that consequently entails an increase in braking distance from 7. 5 up to 20. 0 m and more. It is quite possible that ice layer appears on the surface of concrete coatings when road traffic highways are used in winter season. Various methods are applicable to remove ice from the surface they can include also ice-melting chemicals and sodium chloride NaCl in particular. The chemical decreases freezing temperature of the formed brine and causes ice melting at negative temperature. Processes of NaCl dissolution and ice melting have an endothermic character, in other words these processes are accompanied by heat ingress and due to it temperature is sharply decreasing in the surface layer of the concrete coating which is under the melting ice and in this case phenomenon of thermal shock is observed. </p...|$|R
