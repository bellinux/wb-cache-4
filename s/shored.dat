5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required {{to work in the}} difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers <b>shored</b> up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E
5|$|By about 19:30, Marlboroughs pumps had {{contained}} the flooding in the boiler rooms {{but she took}} {{on a list of}} around 7–8degrees. Instead of using counter-flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty watertight compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently <b>shored</b> up. Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19:33. She evaded the first two and the third harmlessly passed under the ship.|$|E
5|$|During the day, the French {{strengthened}} {{the positions of}} both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified by Trial, which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was in better condition and remained well protected. Her crew <b>shored</b> up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable.|$|E

5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party <b>shored</b> up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|The {{two cities}} were later pushed toward merger by a {{disaster}} that nearly {{wiped out the}} falls. The geological formation of the area consisted of a hard, thin layer of limestone overlaying a soft sandstone formation. As the sandstone eroded away, large blocks of limestone would fall off. The expansion of milling and industry at the falls accelerated the process of erosion. If the fragile limestone cap ever eroded away completely, the falls would turn into a rapids that would no longer provide water power. This process {{came to a head}} on October 4, 1869, when a tunnel under Hennepin Island and Nicollet Island collapsed and filled with water. With the limestone cap breached, the tunnel quickly created a torrent of water that blasted Hennepin Island and threatened to destroy the falls. The falls were <b>shored</b> up quickly, and over the next several years, the falls were repaired by building a wooden apron, sealing the tunnel, and building low dams above the falls to avoid exposing the limestone to the weather. This work was assisted by the federal government, and was eventually completed in 1884. The federal government spent $615,000 on this effort, while the two cities spent $334,500. Possibly {{as a result of the}} bonding needed to rehabilitate the falls, the cities of St. Anthony and Minneapolis merged on April 9, 1872.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} elucidates {{the load}} capacities of wooden <b>shores</b> and adjustable steel tube <b>shores</b> that {{are commonly used}} in construction. A series of loading tests was performed based on actual setups used on construction sites. Research results reveal that the load capacity of an isolated wooden or an adjustable steel tube <b>shore</b> declines as its length increases, and the load capacity of adjustable steel tube <b>shores</b> greatly exceeds that of wooden <b>shores</b> of the same length in isolated and multi-post <b>shoring</b> systems. A wooden <b>shore</b> fails by buckling under compression load. The failure of an adjustable steel tube <b>shore</b> in tests is due to buckling when the <b>shore</b> length exceeds 3. 96 m, and the failure will be resulted from damage of connecting tube lock if the <b>shore</b> length is less than 3. 96 m. When the top block of the adjustable steel tube <b>shore</b> is a wooden stringer, the load capacity is remarkably less than when it is a steel block. Adjustable steel tube <b>shores</b> will be reduced in load capacity after reuses. The load capacity of an isolated <b>shore</b> is reduced when the <b>shore</b> is placed on an inclined base. Reinforcing an isolated wooden <b>shore</b> with horizontal wooden bars and iron wires increases its load capacity. However, when an isolated wooden <b>shore</b> is reinforced with lateral cable bracings, the load capacity is not affected. Inserting the woodblock under an isolated wooden <b>shore</b> on an inclined plane can increase the load capacity of the <b>shore.</b> The multi-post <b>shoring</b> system that is reinforced with horizontal bracings only slightly affects the total load capacity of the system studied in this paper.

Clarke spent freely in the transfer market, notably purchasing Peter Barnes, but his impact was slight – between 12 December 1981 and 6 April 1982, the team scored just five goals in fourteen league games.

At the other <b>shores</b> they are originated from adjacent sea cliffs, but at Miura <b>shore,</b> they are supplied both from the Ohse river and from sea cliff. However, the small embayed <b>shores</b> (e. g., No. 231 <b>shore,</b> Shukuura <b>shore,</b> etc) are still being supplied with their sediments from adjoining cliffs. (2) In these areas, there is longshore drift of sediments in each <b>shore.</b> And main moving particles are below 32 mm, for the particles 32 mm have high roundness by compared with those above 32 mm. (3) In these <b>shores,</b> the sediments have lower roundness of sediments than Kumanoura <b>shore</b> (NAKAYAMA, 1965) and Atsumi <b>shore</b> (YAMANOUSHI, 1967).
