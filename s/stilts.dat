The <b>stilts</b> have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills. All three mainland species have been recorded in Tasmania, although two are vagrants only.|$|E

The first type is the single house, which is the <b>stilt</b> house for a single family and {{includes}} bedroom and kitchen. The second type is a group house, which is the <b>stilt</b> house that has at least two buildings in the same area. The next type is the official house or <b>stilt</b> house for government officer. “Pathway store” and “waterfront” store <b>stilt</b> houses are the type of <b>stilt</b> houses that is built for trading. The final type is the raft house which is built near the coast or a river.|$|R

5|$|Building traditions {{varied by}} region {{and type of}} structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on <b>stilts</b> in ways that made it {{difficult}} for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod.|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} redevelop Tai O into a tourist spot. Recently, {{the government is}} seeking strategies to maintain the existing community of Tai O and retain the cultural heritage, natural environment and local economy of the place. This will shift Tai O’s major economy from fishing to tourism. The <b>stilt</b> houses are {{an important element of}} the history and the fishing village character of Tai O. Under the Government plan, all <b>stilt</b> houses in Tai O will be kept as one main tourism attraction, however the Government does not have intention to help the residents in the ongoing maintenance of the <b>stilt</b> houses. The conditions of the <b>stilt</b> houses for most of the households, especially the elderly need to be improved. If the vulnerable states of the <b>stilt</b> houses are not well-identified, they could soon fall apart and disappear within our generation. This should force us to consider the preservation of the <b>stilt</b> house. Also, with the rebuilding project ahead, some signs of history will disappear if not controlled and conserved. As such the vulnerable factors need to be identified and suggestions are needed for the preservation purpose. In order to thoroughly understand the vulnerable factors of the <b>stilt</b> houses, interviews with residents and members from Tai O Rural Committee, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), Tai O Alliance Church and Tai O Residents’ Rights Concern Group were carried out in order to seek their views on the vulnerable factors of the <b>stilt</b> house and their opinion towards Tai O <b>stilt</b> house development and cultural & heritage conservation. The dissertation is as attempt to address key queries such as:  Impact on Tai O <b>stilt</b> house resulted from disaster, natural degradation and Government policy  Human impact relating to the <b>stilt</b> house, including depopulation, environmental condition and tourist  Opinions regarding improving Tai O <b>stilt</b> house from residents  Future of Tai O <b>Stilt</b> house. For the development of the Tai O <b>stilt</b> house, the opinion of local residents and actual situation in Tai O should be considered. In view of better development of <b>stilt</b> house in Tai O, cooperation and compromise between Government, Tai O Rural Committee, Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), Tai O Alliance Church, Tai O Residents’ Rights Concern Group and residents would be more constructive for <b>stilt</b> house in Tai O. published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R

5|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Groening and Brooks pitched a live-action spin-off series centered in Krusty the Clown (expected to be portrayed by Dan Castellaneta) entitled Krusty (although they began planning the series since 1992). Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot episode where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden <b>stilts</b> which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project.|$|E

5|$|It is {{constructed}} primarily {{of steel and}} glass. The main building {{is based on the}} diagonal truss. Originally, the museum was planned parallel to the river, but was quickly changed so it would lie perpendicular to the river, for the purpose of providing a better view to visitors. The western façade of the museum is a screen wall composed of laminated glass tiles, providing a sunscreen for the building. The underside {{is constructed}} of aluminum. Some critics dislike the bridge design, saying it looks too much like a trailer on <b>stilts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Catlins coast often hosts New Zealand {{fur seals}} and Hooker's sea lions, and {{occasionally}} southern elephant seals can be seen. Several species of penguin also nest along the coast, notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin (hoiho), as do other seabirds including mollymawks and Australasian gannets, and the estuaries of the rivers {{are home to}} herons, <b>stilts,</b> godwits and oystercatchers. Bitterns and the threatened fernbird (matata) can also occasionally be seen along the reedy riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements made over the previous film {{was to make the}} centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical <b>stilts</b> with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.|$|E

40|$|SummaryMany {{cellular}} effectors of pluripotency are dynamically regulated. In principle, regulatory mechanisms can {{be inferred}} from single-cell observations of effector activity across time. However, rigorous inference techniques suitable for noisy, incomplete, and heterogeneous data are lacking. Here, we introduce stochastic inference on lineage trees (<b>STILT),</b> an algorithm capable of identifying stochastic models that accurately describe the quantitative behavior of cell fate markers observed using time-lapse microscopy data collected from proliferating cell populations. <b>STILT</b> performs exact Bayesian parameter inference and stochastic model selection using a particle-filter-based algorithm. We use <b>STILT</b> to investigate the autoregulation of Nanog, a heterogeneously expressed core pluripotency factor, in mouse embryonic stem cells. <b>STILT</b> rejects the possibility of positive Nanog autoregulation with high confidence; instead, model predictions indicate weak negative feedback. We use <b>STILT</b> for rational experimental design and validate model predictions using novel experimental data. <b>STILT</b> is available for download as an open source framework from [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} {{typically}} raised on <b>stilts</b> above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own from wood and thatch gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E
5|$|Broadwater Farm in Tottenham, in the Borough of Haringey, north London (N17), {{emerged from}} the British government's policy from the 1930s onwards of slum clearance, in which poorly {{maintained}} terraced houses were bulldozed {{to make way for}} high-rise social housing. Built between 1967 and 1973, the Farm consists of 1,063 flats (apartments) in 12 blocks raised on <b>stilts,</b> linked by first-floor outdoor connecting walkways; no homes or shops were built at ground level for fear of flooding from the nearby River Moselle.
