40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} which components of spending by brazilian states which had positive effects on economic growth, based on Devarajan, Swarrop and Zou (1996). Using panel data composed of public spending and gross domestic product of the brazilian states, in the period 1995 - 2010, linear and quadratic estimates of aggregate and segmented basis in developed and developing states were performed. The results taken together show that the aggregate spending of the brazilian states present themselves positively related to economic growth, and economic components, appear unproductive for both. For developing states, it is evident the positive impact on growth in spending on public goods and {{the negative impact of}} spending on semi-public goods. We suggest the need for better <b>sizing</b> <b>composition</b> of government spending brazilian states to achieve the maximization of their potential contribution to economic growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of offshore wind farms (OWFs) in Europe is progressing to sites which are characteristically further from shore, in deeper waters, and of larger scale than previous sites. A consequence of moving further offshore is that installation operations {{are subject to}} harsher weather conditions, resulting in increased uncertainty {{in relation to the}} cost and duration of any operations. Assessing the comparative risks associated with different installation scenarios and identifying the best course of action is therefore a crucial problem for decision makers. Motivated by collaboration with industry partners, we present a detailed definition of the OWF installation process logistics problem, where aspects of fleet <b>sizing,</b> <b>composition,</b> and vessel scheduling are present. This article illustrates the use of simulation models to improve the understanding of the risks associated with logistical installation decisions. The developed tool employs a realistic model of the installation operations and enables the effect of any logistical decision to be investigated. A case study of an offshore wind farm installation project is presented in order to explore the impact of key logistical decisions on the cost and duration of the installation, and demonstrates that savings of up to 50 % can be achieved through vessel optimization...|$|E
40|$|The <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> {{of primary}} {{producers}} has a potential {{influence on the}} length of marine food chains and carbon sinking rates, thus on the proportion of primary production (PP) that is removed from the upper layers and available to higher trophic levels. While total rates of PP are widely reported, it is also necessary to account for the <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of primary producers when developing food web models that predict consumer biomass and production. Empirical measurement of <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> over large space and time scales is not feasible, so one approach is to predict <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> from environmental variables that are measured and reported on relevant scales. Here, we describe relationships between the environment and the <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of phytoplankton communities, using a collation of empirical measurements of <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> from sites that include polar, tropical and upwelling environments. The <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of the phytoplankton communities can be predicted using two remotely sensed variables, chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature. Applying such relationships in combination allows prediction of the slope and location of phytoplankton size spectra and estimation of the percentage of different sized phytoplankton groups in communities...|$|R

40|$|Spawner biomass (SB) {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} {{proportional}} to total egg production (TEP) by fish stocks. Recent studies suggest that this assumption may not be valid, particularly when the physiological condition of fish varies. This study used Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the relationship between SB and TEP for Northcast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua). In the first simulation exercise, reproductive traits reflecting condition (length-specific maturity, weight and fecundity) were varied according to food abundance (capelin biomass) while the <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> (numbers at length) was held constant. In the second exercise, the <b>size</b> <b>composition,</b> as described by the modal length of spawners, was varied and condition was held constant. In the final exercise, condition and <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> were varied simultaneously. The first exercise indicated that variation in TEP was not constant but increased as the SB increased. The second exercise showed that, for a given SB, TEP increased with increasing modallength of spawners. Comparing {{the results of the}} first and second exercise showed that food-dependent variation in condition introduced greater variability into the relationship between SB and TEP than did shifting the <b>size</b> <b>composition.</b> When condition and <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> were varied simultaneously, as would be expected in wild stocks, TEP exhibited approximately 4 -fold level of variation at any given SB...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{describing}} the <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of salmonid spawning gravel was developed. For gravel samples from Idaho and Washington streams, cumulative distributions of particle sizes for gravel smaller than 25. 4 mm were consistently plotted as straight lines on log-probability paper. Because of the lognormal {{distribution of the}} particle sizes in this range, the <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of material smaller than 25. 4 mm was closely approximated by two points on a regression of cumulative particle size distribu tion. The two size classes that best reflected {{the composition of the}} spawning gravel size were the percentage of the substrate smaller than 9. 50 mm and the percentage smaller than 0. 85 mm. Salmonid embryo survival was related to these two groups of particle size in laboratory tests. In these tests, 90 - 93 % of the variability in embryo survival was correlated with changes in substrate <b>size</b> <b>composition.</b> Equations were developed to describe the effect of spawning gravel <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> on chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (Salrno gairdneri) survival to emergence {{in a wide range of}} spawning gravel mixtures.

Remote sensing provides an efficient approach to estimate phytoplankton <b>size</b> <b>compositions</b> on global scale. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, a global sensitivity analysis method was used to determine factors mainly controlling the variations of remote sensing reflectance and inherent optical properties inverse algorithms. To achieve these purposes, average mass-specific coefficients of particles were first calculated through Mie theory, using particle size distributions and refractive indices as input; and then a synthesis remote sensing reflectance dataset was created using Hydrolight. Based on sensitivity analysis results, an algorithm for estimating phytoplankton <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> was proposed in the second part. This algorithm uses five types of spectral features: original and normalized remote sensing reflectance, two-band ratios, continuum removed spectra, and spectral curvatures. With the spectral features, phytoplankton <b>size</b> <b>compositions</b> were regressed using support vector machine. According to validation results, this algorithm performs well with simulated and satellite Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), indicating that it is possible to estimate phytoplankton <b>size</b> <b>compositions</b> through satellite data on global scale...|$|R
40|$|Waterfowl ingest {{lead shot}} because they confuse it with grit, {{but there has}} been limited study of {{differences}} among species and locations. The spatial and interspecific variation in the quantity and <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of ingested grit and in the ingestion of lead shot by eight waterfowl species in the three main wintering areas in the western Mediterranean (Do˜nana, Ebro Delta and Camargue) was investigated. Variation in the mass of grit in the gizzard was related to bird species, whereas <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> of ingested grit was more closely related to locality and less to species. Birds with a large proportion of vegetation in their diets had more grit in the gizzard. Grit <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> was related to prevalence of lead shot ingestion. Thus, the quantity of grit in the gizzard is an attribute of species, and grit <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> (which largely determines the risk of ingestion of lead shot) is more affected by local conditions. This conclusion is supported by a meta-analysis of previous studies of the incidence of lead shot ingestion in 51 locations and 27 waterfowl species in North America and Europe. The prevalence of lead shot ingestion in a given waterbird species was highly variable between localities, and was not consistently different between dabbling, grazing and diving species.

A first analysis was applied to a commercial fishing data base made up of biological-fishery and environmental records from 343 fishing sets performed between 2000 and 2002 by two longline vessels. Furthermore, a data base of fishing research cruises over the Cordillera de Nazca was analyzed; this set consisted of biological-fishery and environmental satellite information recorded for 43 fishing sets done in summer and winter 2003 and autumn and spring 2005.

40|$|Fishing {{trials were}} {{performed}} simultaneously using commercial bottom trawl and longline {{in an investigation}} that was primarily designed to explore the effects of seismic airgun shooting on catch rates of cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Fish density, species and length composition in the experimental area were determined from a combined acoustic and bottom trawl survey. The seismic shooting led to lower fish density and changes in <b>size</b> and species <b>composition,</b> and analyzing catch data obtained before and after shooting {{made it possible to}} compare the species and length compositions of trawl and longline catches at two different stock levels. The fishing trials showed that both the species and <b>size</b> <b>compositions</b> obtained by the two gears were significantly different. Relatively more haddock were caught by longline than by trawl, and longline fishing was found to catch less undersized cod and more undersized haddock than trawling.

40|$|During {{the past}} three decades the species {{composition}} and abundance of finfishes on Georges Bank has changed dramatically, as measured by standardized trawl surveys and fishery performance data. Notwithstanding the dramatic shifts in species <b>composition,</b> the aggregate <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> (normalized numbers-at-length) has remained relatively stable. The descending limb of the aggregate species numbers-at-length curve estimates the weighted average rates of survival and growth (cumulative energy transfer) from one length category to the next. Observed changes in the slope of the aggregate <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> on Georges Bank can be correlated with various stanzas in the exploitation regime. Similar studies from other temperate fishery ecosystems indicate much different characteristic slopes to the aggregate catch-at-length curves. The conservation of aggregate <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> within fishery ecosystems may be indicative of size-based trophic interrelation-ships that tend to buffer fish production at length against perturbations to particular species and/or length components in highly-networked food webs. If such feedback mechanisms exist, they have important implications for the development of long-term multispecies management policy. A modelling approach to multispecies length composition is outlined, along with data requirements for such analyses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{commonly}} known that particles {{play a critical}} role in urban stormwater quality because other pollutants can be attached to the particles and transported into receiving waters. Previous research studies have shown a strong relationship between pollutant build-up loads and particle sizes. In this context, accurately estimating the particle amounts in different sizes is extremely important since it can assist in predicting stormwater quality and hence contribute to effective stormwater quality improvement measures. This paper presents a robust model to predict particle <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> on urban road surfaces using heavy-duty vehicle volumes, traffic coefficient and road texture depth by multiple linear regression (MLR) method. The pollutants build-up data was used for model development and was collected on typical urban roads in Shenzhen, China. The relative prediction error and coefficient of variation values were found within the acceptable limits and hence indicated that the developed prediction models are relatively reliable. This developed model can assist in predicting particle <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> on urban road surfaces and thereby contribute to effective stormwater quality assessment and treatment design. Additionally, this developed modelling approach can also provide a guide in terms of particle <b>size</b> <b>composition</b> prediction using more influential factors...|$|R
