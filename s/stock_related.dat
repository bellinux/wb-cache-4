40|$|The {{implementation}} of IFRS 2 led to {{significant changes in}} the accounting practices for corporations regarding <b>stock</b> <b>related</b> compensation. The new regulations required firms to account for the stock based compensation as an expense in the financial statements, rather than merely disclosing the information in the notes section to the statements. Following prior research on the area; specifically studies made in the U.

The results of this study show that the use of option incentives has decreased during the studied period 2001 - 2008 and that the decrease in part can be derived from IFRS 2 and in part from other factors. The results are useful to future research, as they provide an overview of the effects that IFRS 2 had on companies, and various factors that influence the behavior of corporations, as well as in a larger perspective be a factor to take into account for future modifications of the IFRS...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{timetable}} reliability is {{a measure}} of the likely performance of the timetable as a whole, in terms of schedule adherence. The reliability of arrivals is a critical performance measure for all rail markets. This paper presents analytically based models designed to quantify the amount of delay risk associated with each track segment, train and the schedule as a whole. Three main types of delays are modelled, namely: terminal/station delays; track related delays; and rolling <b>stock</b> <b>related</b> delays. The models can be used to prioritise investment projects designed to improve timetable reliability. For example, a comparison can be made between track, terminal and rolling stock projects, in terms of their likely impact on timetable reliability. The effect of timetable changes on likely reliability can also be modelled. Using the risk models developed here, it is possible to assess the likely effect of removing/adding sidings for passing and crossing purposes, under single line train operations. The paper illustrates the use of the models using a series of tests with a timetable consisting of nine trains and six stations. The effect of changing assumptions regarding delays due to terminal congestion; track related problems; and rolling stock, are modelled and the results are summarised. Also modelled is the impact of changes to the timetable...|$|E

It commences {{with the development of}} a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model to describe the all over dynamic behavior including food production bounds. More precisely, the different stages applied to the design of an object-oriented DES are presented. Then the global simulation tool is coupled with a stochastic optimization procedure to solve efficiently the production planning problem of a highly combinatorial nature. LOZA-GARAY & FLORES (2000) and POSNER & HIBBS (1997) focus on the flow characteristics of the product through the flour mill at the total flow rate. This is considered following a flow with normal distribution variations. The model describes the flow of total matter in a stochastic (probabilistic) analysis. The mass flow is linked directly to wheat attributes and to the specific process conditions of the pilot mill. Production planning in fish processing factories is marred by uncertainty in both the demand for final goods and the supply of raw fish.

The results disproved this assumption and demonstrated that sustainable building can be financially profitable.

SenterNovem initiated a new research project in order to recommend practical solutions for the identified issues. Besides the sustainable and ‘regular’ building sectors, the new project included other sectors {{in an effort to}} develop new insights.

It recommends giving top priority to the introduction of a labeling system that translates sustainability in housing into a manageable and controllable system. The system should clearly identify the level of sustainability of a specific house. To gain acceptance among consumers, the system would have to tie in with consumer needs.

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. Sharemilking is a contractual arrangement where one party (the farm owner) provides the infrastructure required for dairy farming, and the other (the sharemilker) provides the physical labour, management skills and some of the chattels or livestock required to operate the farm. Under the 50 % agreement the sharemilker owns the herd, plant and mobile equipment. The sharemilker is usually responsible for all milk harvesting and <b>stock</b> <b>related</b> expenses, general farm work and maintenance. The sharemilker usually receives 50 % of milk income and the proceeds from most of the stock sales. The sharemilker is usually largely responsible for farm management. Under the Variable Order agreement the sharemilker does not usually own the livestock and has minimal plant or equipment. The sharemilker’s expenses normally relate directly to milk harvesting. The percentage of income received is negotiated and the farm owner is often more involved in farm management than with the 50 % agreement. The purpose of this report is to provide an outline of the concept of sharemilking as it applies to the New Zealand dairy industry in 2002. It is intended to: - Highlight to those involved in dairy farming, the value and scale of sharemilking. - To be a useful reference bringing together information about sharemilking in an easily accessible format. - Provide an outline of the situation as at 2002. It will serve as a benchmark for future examinations of the evolution of sharemilking. - To be a useful resource for those looking to have a greater understanding about sharemilking {{from the perspective of the}} dairy industry in other countries. - To be a useful resource for those considering a career in dairy farming. - To be a useful resource for those considering engaging a sharemilker. - To be a useful resource for those considering the possibility of applying the principles of sharemilking to other industries. - To be a useful reference for people in New Zealand who have little knowledge of the role sharemilking plays.

40|$|Forest {{conversions}} {{may lead}} to an accumulation of carbon in vegetation, but {{little is known about}} changes in soil C storage with establishment of plantation forests. Understanding these effects is important to addressing issues relevant to ecosystem function and productivity, and to global balance of carbon. The study investigated the effects of the created coniferous plantations on former beech and pasture sites on the soil organic carbon storage. The major forest-related land-uses in the high mountainous regions of central Stara Planina Mountain were investigated: mountainous pasture, coniferous plantations (planted on previous pasture and beech forests between four and five decades ago) and natural beech forests. The experimental data of soil properties, conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007, were used in determining the variations in organic carbon storage in forest litter and in mineral soil under different land-use patterns. At each site five representative soil profiles were opened and described giving a total 75 soil samples from the soil layers respectively at 0 - 10, 10 - 30 and 30 - 50 cm depth. A total of 55 samples from forest floor layers (Aol, Aof, Aoh and greensward) were collected with 25 : 25 cm plastic frame. The main soil properties were determined in accordance with the standardized methods in the Laboratory of soil science at the Forest Research Institute - BAS. The IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry was used to estimate the soil organic carbon stock in soil and litter. The results obtained showed that the SOC stock was quite similar among forest land-uses. The conversion of natural beech forests to coniferous plantations in studied region is related with slightly expressed decrease in soil carbon storage. The values of SOC stocks in 0 - 50 cm soil layer in these sites were 8. 5 (± 2. 1) tones/ha for pine and 11. 0 (± 1. 4) tones/ha for spruce, while under the natural beech forest it was 14. 8 (± 1. 0) tones/ha. The SOC stock in mountainous pasture was 20. 7 (± 6. 5) tones/ha, while in spruce plantation created on previous pasture it was 13. 5 (± 2. 7) tones/ha. Our finding showed that forest conversions effect in central Stara Planina Mountain is expressed by decrease in SOC <b>stock</b> <b>related</b> with losses of carbon from the upper mineral soil decades after creation of coniferous plantations. Nevertheless the relatively large organic carbon storage in forest litter in the spruce plantations compensated C lost from mineral soil after the land-use change. The overall carbon stock both in forest litter and soil under plantations ranged from 56 tones/ha (pine) to 77 tones/ha (spruce), while under natural beech forest and pasture the values were 70 and 81 tones/ha respectively. But in terms of stability C sequestrated in mineral soil is more desirable than C sequestrated in forest floor which are more vulnerable to decomposition following disturbances. The application of silvicultural activities in coniferous plantations created by conversion of forest lands or grasslands in the region of central Balkan is desirable to improve the carbon sequestration in soils...|$|E

This system {{has to deal with}} a minimum grass height of 8 or 10 cm (depending on the season) in order to obtain maximum grass production. A model should predict the available herbage mass under changing weather conditions and therefore the available fresh grass and the related amount of additional feed needed for the cows. A concept model, called McGraze, is developed for farmers in order to manage modern continuous stocking (Figure 1). McGraze consists of a grass production section and a stoking related section.
