40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} and clustering of non-metallic inclusions was investigated by applying a steel casting simulator. In a fully controlled atmosphere, the oxygen {{content of the}} steel melt was intentionally increased. At a specified level, the steel was deoxidized by pure aluminum. After the treatment, the melt was cooled down in the crucible. The effects of the inclusions and the cavities were determined by means of metallography, tensile tests, dynamic fracture toughness tests, and fractography. Metallographic results show that alumina particles have a strong tendency to aggregate at {{the walls of the}} crucible. Neglecting this aggregation, a relatively homogeneous distribution of alumina inclusions was observed. Furthermore, the solidified steel exhibited manganese sulphide inclusions and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cavities.</b> The results of the tensile tests revealed a relatively low ductility. Fractographic examinations showed that both non-metallic inclusions and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cavities</b> promoted ductile fracture. Results of dynamic fracture toughness tests revealed a relatively large scatter in the dynamic crack resistance.

The {{effects of}} {{titanium}} modification, which was added {{along with the}} pouring liquid in ladles, on the shrinkage porosity and cavity of cast steel ZG 45 smelted in intermediate frequency induction furnace were studied. The metal liquid fluidity was measured by casting spiral samples. 0. 2 wt. % titanium modification achieved the highest fluidity for steel liquid. Proper content of titanium could effectively increase the volume of concentrated <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cavity,</b> and restrain the forming of shrinkage porosity. By scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscope (EDS) analysis, {{it was found that}} TiC, acting as heterogeneous nuclei, could refine the structure grains, diminish the strong dendrite, and increase the fluidity and feeding capacity of steel liquid. However, overdoes titanium modification easily caused mass oxide TiO 2, which kept solid phases with high meting point in metal liquid to increase its viscosity and decrease the fluidity.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{cast steel}} {{has been used}} in broad fields of industries, such as power generation, construction, vessels, and automobiles. In the solidification process of a hummer used for press machine, for example, sometimes defects such as <b>shrinkage</b> <b>cavity,</b> segregation and cracks appear at hummer 2 ̆ 7 s surface. <b>Shrinkage</b> <b>cavity</b> and segregation can be predicted by performing non-steady state heat transfer analysis; and therefore such two types of defects can be eliminated by using chills which control solidification process.

For causing those cracks, thermal stress may be important; however, there have been few studies for this thermal stress analysis. In this study, a three dimensional thermal elasto-plastic stress analysis has been performed by using finite element method in connection with three dimensional non-steady state heat transfer analysis, including interaction between the temperature and stress field.

The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial steel ingot that was sectioned and analyzed.
