We examine how two methods of limiting foreign tax credits, separate limitations based on type or source of income or an overall limitation aggregating across all foreign income, affect the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> We show that when investment opportunities exist in both low-tax and high-tax countries, a separate limitation method will always result in an inefficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> In some circumstances, an overall limitation can result in the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> In other cases, both limitation methods will result in an inefficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> In these cases either limitation method can be relatively more efficient. Simulations show that the potential differences in economic welfare under the alternative limitation methods can be significant. We consider the limitation methods in multiple settings, including the presence of pre-existing foreign income and allocation rules, such as interest allocation.

40|$|According to Harberger 9 ̆ 2 s 1962 and 1966 seminal papers, the {{corporate}} income tax distorts the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> between {{the corporate}} and the non-corporate sector and reduces therefore aggregate output. To quantify this efficiency loss we apply a dynamic, computable, general equilibrium growth model. We compare the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> under the current, non-uniform German tax system with the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> arising from a hypothetical, sector neutral tax system where both sectors face the same effective tax burden. Our numerical results underpin the theoretical finding, that the loss in overall output is highly sensitive {{to the source of}} investment funds. Accordingly, if investments are exclusively financed via new share issues the efficiency loss amounts to nearly 2 percent of aggregate output. However, if less than half of overall investments are financed via new equity injections the efficiency loss is almost negligible...|$|R

The negative effect is strongest for domestic {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} while there is no significant effect on foreign and large domestic firms. We conclude that reducing the level and incidence of bribery by public officials would facilitate a more efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> This in turn would support economic growth and development, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of eight chapters investigating {{the relationship between}} bank competition and capital allocation. Following the introduction (chapter 1), the second chapter provides {{a review of the}} literature. The third chapter extends a seminal contribution in the bank competition literature, the model developed by Broecker (1990). In chapter 4 I show that an auction framework may be an inappropriate way of modeling bank competition and I explore the implications of modeling bank competition in a more robust fashion for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> The fifth chapter aims to resolve a long-standing discrepancy between the empirical and theoretical literatures on bank competition and capital allocation. While theoretical work tends to see few benefits from more intense competition, the evidence suggests that the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> improves as bank competition becomes more intense. The theoretical model developed in chapter 5 reconciles these results by modeling banks' objective function in a way consistent with empirical evidence on X-inefficiency in banks. Chapters 6 and 7 investigate the transmission mechanism through which a greater intensity of competition is transmitted within banks and study lending-related incentive structures through interview-based fieldwork. Chapter 6 provides motivation and outlines the scope of the study whereas the actual findings are presented in chapter 7. That chapter also analyzes the implications for the lending and monitoring decisions that co-determine the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> Chapter 8 concludes...|$|R

The calibration to the Chinese economy implies that the rapid increase in the share <b>of</b> housing <b>capital</b> and the simultaneous decrease in the consumption-output ratio observed in China can be rationalized {{by a combination of}} three factors: a high elas-ticity of substitution between the two sectors, a high <b>capital</b> intensity <b>of</b> production of the housing sector, and a low initial share <b>of</b> housing <b>capital</b> before the Chinese housing market reform.
