5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was plagued}} by a few issues during the 2009 season. Most notable were the poor free-throw and 3-point {{shooting}} percentages. Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 {{in both of these}} categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively. Despite their poor performance <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> beyond the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10. The following chart displays player per-game average statistics for the regular season and Atlantic 10 tournament.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> their place of concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, Nash {{was named}} to his eighth All-Star Game. At the time, he was leading the NBA in assists per game. On 21 April 2012, Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets. Despite his stellar play the Suns missed {{the playoffs for the}} second {{consecutive}} time. He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game on 53.2% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the field (tying his career high). Near the end of the 2011–12 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA's Magic Johnson Award.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013–14 season, Bosh {{played and}} started in 79 games, {{averaging}} 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.

In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat {{return to the}} NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if {{he knew how to}} play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the foul line. His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was not interested in the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
5|$|To promote {{comfortable}} and accurate <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> {{a standing position}} match air pistols must have fast lock times, shoot practically recoilless and vibration free and exhibit minimal movement and balance shifts during discharge. The pistol must {{also be able to}} be tailored by adjustable user interfaces and various accessories to individual shooters personal preferences. Combined with appropriate match pellets the pistol has to produce a consistent 10 ring performance, so a non maximal result during the initial phase {{can be attributed to the}} participant.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increase}} in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> helicopters, and instead favored the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.|$|E

5|$|Elara's archers, <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the walls, inflicted heavy {{casualties}} on the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Hilliard {{improved}} in most offensive categories in the 2013–14 season, his junior year. He averaged 14.3 {{points per game}} that season and improved his three-point shooting percentage to 41.4 percent (up from 31.5 percent the year before). He made 70 three-pointers that year out of 169 attempts. Hilliard scored 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting against Marquette in a 94–85 victory on January 25, 2014. In an 82–79 win over Providence, he hit a crucial 3-pointer with a minute left in overtime. In a 73–56 win over Marquette on March 2 at the Wells Fargo Center, he established a new career high with 26 points on 7-of-11 <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the field.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 White House {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} November 11, 2011, when Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an unemployed 21-year-old man, fired a semi-automatic rifle at the White House, the official {{residence of the}} U.S. President in Washington, D.C. At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, {{to find out why}} the first family had not been informed.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{advanced}} to the NBA Finals {{for the first time}} in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled an outstanding 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{only part}} of the region that is {{predominantly}} given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. In the twentieth century, numbers of red grouse and black grouse in the area fell significantly, but improved gamekeeping practices have resulted in both species making a comeback in the region.|$|E
5|$|The team's first intra-squad {{scrimmage}} showcased Pitino's fast-paced, three-point-heavy style; the {{two teams}} combined to shoot 98-of-175 from the field, including 23-of-57 from three, as the Blue team defeated the White team 14585. Farmer led the White team (the projected reserves) in scoring with 26 points, including 5-of-13 <b>shooting</b> <b>from</b> three-point range. In the next scrimmage, played at Farmer's alma mater, Clay County High School, Farmer scored 32 points, but the White team lost to the Blue team again, 125117. The teams again combined for 175 shots, and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points. Farmer sat out much {{of the second half}} of the final scrimmage due to illness but scored 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a 124120 victory for the White team.|$|E
