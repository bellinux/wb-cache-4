Background: Early in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, {{a large number of}} health care workers had {{negative}} attitudes toward persons infected with HIV, but a more positive shift has occurred in these attitudes over the past decade. However, recent information about attitudes of physician assistants (PAs) is missing.  Methodology: A nationwide randomized sample of 1, 500 PAs was surveyed through the US mail. The AIDS Attitudes Scale (AAS) developed by Froman, Owen, and Daisy in 1992 was used for this purpose. The results were analyzed using descriptive, t test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics.  Results: A majority of respondents had high empathy, low avoidance, and positive general attitude scores. Respondents living in the South had the highest avoidance and lowest general attitude scores compared with those living in other regions (ANOVA, P <. 05).  Conclusion: The results were consistent <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> of health care workers, which demonstrated supportive attitudes towards persons with HIV/AIDS.  peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Third Place {{winner of}} poster presentations at the 5 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) {{held at the}} Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, May 1, 2009. Research {{completed}} at the Department of Physician Assistant, College of Health ProfessionsSeveral {{studies have shown that}} a large number of healthcare workers have negative attitudes toward persons infected with HIV early in the epidemic, but a more positive shift has occurred in these attitudes over the last decade. These studies focused mostly on the perceptions of physicians, surgeons, and nurses. However, recent surveys about attitudes of mid-level providers, such as Physician Assistants (PAs), a large purveyor of health care services, are missing. Methodology: This crosssectional survey was completed to determine the current attitudes of practicing PAs concerning individuals with HIV/AIDS. A nationwide randomized sample of 1, 500 PAs was surveyed through the United States (U. S.) mail. The AIDS Attitudes Scale (AAS) developed by Froman, Owen and Daisy in 1992 was used as a self-reported measure of attitude toward persons with AIDS. The AAS is viewed as a reliable and valid Likert-based instrument that measures HIV/AIDS empathy and avoidance among healthcare workers. In the scale, avoidance is described as fear of contracting the disease, and empathy is described as supportive attitudes towards persons living with HIV/AIDS. The results were analyzed using descriptive, t-test, and ANOVA statistics. Results: The response rate was 16 % (n= 246). A majority had high empathy, low avoidance, and positive general attitude scores. Respondents living in the South had the highest avoidance and lowest general attitude scores compared with those living in other regions (ANOVA, p <. 05). Conclusion: The results were consistent <b>with</b> <b>similar</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> of healthcare workers, which demonstrated supportive attitudes towards persons with HIV/AIDS...|$|R

40|$|An optical system, which {{requires}} {{only a single}} optical window mounted on a test volume, is proposed for holographic particle image velocimetry (HPIV). The optical system is a derivative of the double-exposure, double-reference-beam, off-axis HPIV system, but the innovative idea behind the system is to use back scattered light from the particles as the object wave. A 45 {degree} beam splitter inserted {{in front of the}} window serves to admit the illuminating beam and extract the back scattered light. This concept can be of great engineering interest because optical access is often limited to one window in practical devices. The preliminary results of the technique appear quite promising, <b>with</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> aimed at defining the optical resolution capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} detection of human affective {{states has been}} of great interest lately for its applications {{not only in the}} field of Human-Computer Interaction, but also for its applications in physiological, neu-robiological and sociological studies. Several standardized techniques to elicit emotions have been used, with emotion eliciting movie clips being the most popular. To date, there are only four studies that have been carried out to validate emotional movie clips using three different lan-guages (English, French, Spanish) and cultures (French, Italian, British / American). The context of language and culture is an underexplored area in affective computing. Considering cultural and language differ-ences between Western and Arab countries, it is possible that some of the validated clips, even when dubbed, will not achieve similar results. Given the unique and conservative cultures of the Arab countries, a stan-dardized and validated framework for affect studies is needed in order to be comparable <b>with</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> of different cultures and languages...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, microRNAs (miRNAs) {{have been shown to}} play a more {{significant}} role in the formation and progression of cancer diseases than previously thought. With an increase in reports about the dysregulation of miRNAs in diverse tumor types, it becomes more obvious that classic tumor-suppressive molecules enter deep into the world of miRNAs. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a typical tumor suppressor p 53, known as the guardian of the genome, regulates some kinds of miRNAs to contribute to tumor suppression by the induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Meanwhile, miRNAs directly/indirectly control the expression level and activity of p 53 to fine-tune its functions or to render p 53 inactive, indicating that the interplay between p 53 and miRNA is overly complicated. The findings, along <b>with</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies,</b> will underline the continuing importance of understanding this interlocking control system for future therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment and prevention...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{an unusual}} {{configuration}} of a jet with rubber strips (cilia) distributed along a circular nozzle {{in a small}} scale prototype. Performing laboratory experiments in a flume initially characterized by a thermal stratification in two layers, we have studied {{the effect of the}} strips on the flow field and on the temporal modification of the temperature profile. Preliminary results show that the destratification induced by the ciliate jet is slower with respect to the free jet (without cilia). Therefore, the same discharge of fluid (possibly enriched in oxygen, as for lake oxygenation) may be released and distributed with a milder impact on the thermal profile. Being not restricted to the case of lake recovery, the observed dynamics of ciliate jets may give hints for possible applications in other contexts (e. g. industrial processes). Finally, we note that further developments of this work may also have interesting relationships <b>with</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> about biomimicry and animal propulsion. 1...|$|R
