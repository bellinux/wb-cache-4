40|$|ABSTRACT Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya are {{emerging}} arboviruses and important causes of acute febrile disease in tropical areas. Although dengue {{does not represent}} a new condition, a <b>geographic</b> <b>expansion</b> over time has occurred {{with the appearance of}} severe neurological complications. Neglect has allowed the propagation of the vector (Aedes spp), which is also responsible for the transmission of other infections such as Zika and Chikungunya throughout the world. The increased number of infected individuals has contributed to the rise of neurological manifestations including encephalitis, myelitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital malformations such as microcephaly. In this narrative review, we characterize the impact of the <b>geographic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the vector on the appearance of neurological complications, and highlight the lack of highly accurate laboratory tests for nervous system infections. This represents a challenge for public health in the world, considering the high number of travelers and people living in endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} lawyers working for large U. S. law firms has {{increased}} dramatically. One important manifestation {{of this is}} the growing network of branch offices. Informed by three theories of spatial change—law firms (i) following the <b>geographic</b> <b>expansion</b> of their clients, relying on (ii) traditional agglomeration economies and relying on (iii) agglomeration benefits emerging from a location’s connectivity to other important geographies— we analyze longitudinal data on large U. S. law firms and the global urban network in which they are embedded. We find that, after the late 2000 s, <b>geographic</b> <b>expansion</b> was less connected to organic market growth in U. S. domestic markets and London, a plausible explanation being the global financial crisis. At the same time, growth has continued in key foreign markets. We demonstrate how network analysis and a relational approach to organizations and organizational fields can yield insights into the structure and dynamics of industries...|$|R
