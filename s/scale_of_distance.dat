We compare the numbers of hypocentre triplets forming a particular triangle in a real catalogue and in a randomized (simulated Poissonian) catalogue, which has the same boundaries and depth distribution of hypocentres as the real catalogue. The ratio of these quantities seems fairly well approximated by the reciprocal of the surface area of the triangle. There is good evidence that this ratio is independent of {{the form of the}} triangle once the surface area is fixed. These results, similar to those from the two-point spatial moments, indicate lack of any intrinsic <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>distance</b> or triples configuration for distances between hypocentres ranging from a few kilometres up to 1000 km.

With this kind of state we show that the locality constrains imposed by Bell inequality are violated by the quantum mechanics, and an experimental test of this effect is feasible within the earthâ€™s length scale. Theoretically, the quantum entanglement of neutrino pairs can be employed {{to the use of}} long distance cryptography distribution in a protocol similar to the BB 84. Entanglement represents the essence of quantum mechanics (QM) and is the source of a number of paradoxial and counterintuitive phenomena [1]. The kernel of entanglement is the non-local correlation exhibit by QM. In 1964, Bell derived out a group of inequalities [2], that is a set of constraints that local hidden variable theory (LHVT) must satisfy whereas QM violates. Many experiments in regard of the Bell inequalities have been carried out by using entangled photons [3]. Great progress was made in this direction by using PDC technique in generating the entangled photon pairs [4]. More importantly quantum information theory has been developed along with the research of entanglement. The same effort has also been made in high energy physics [5, 6], where the mixing properties of neutral mesons can play a practical role [7, 8, 9]. People also attempted to use the entangled state in high energy physics to implement quantum information tasks [10], i. e. quantum teleportation.

40|$|Background: Machine {{learning}} and data mining techniques {{have been successfully}} applied on MRI images for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). But only {{a few studies have}} explored the possibility of AD detection from non-image data. These studies have applied traditional data visualization and classification algorithms. There is a need for new sophisticated learning algorithms, for detecting and quantifying the severity of AD by exploring the complex interactions between the features in AD subjects. Method: In this work, a supervised learning model to effectively capture the complex feature interactions, in the sample space of AD data, is presented for knowledge discovery. The discovered knowledge is further used to quantify the similarity of a test subject to the demented class. Results: Evaluation of the proposed model, on OASIS database of Alzheimer's subjects, validates the well established risk factors and identifiers for AD: Age, Socio-Economic Status, MMSE Score and Whole Brain Volume. The Test subjects are affiliated to either non-demented (ND) or AD class, with non-overlapping and measurable similarity indices: Female ND (CDR= 0) [0. 48 Ã¢ 2. 90], Female AD (CDR= 0. 5) [90. 16 Ã¢ 774. 51], Female AD (CDR= 1) [1633. 90 Ã¢ 7182. 23], Female AD (CDR= 2) [55258. 51 Ã¢ 66382. 44], Male ND (CDR= 0) [0. 69 Ã¢ 3. 66], Male AD (CDR= 0. 5) [99. 18 Ã¢ 647. 51] and Male AD (CDR= 1) [3880. 16 Ã¢ 6519. 40].

40|$|Persistent Homology {{is a tool}} {{to analyze}} and {{visualize}} the shape of data from a topological viewpoint. It computes persistence, which summarizes the evolution of topological and geometric information about metric spaces over multiple <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>distances.</b> While computing persistence is quite efficient for low-dimensional topological features, it becomes overwhelmingly expensive for medium to high-dimensional features. In this thesis, we attack this computational problem from several different angles. We present efficient techniques to approximate the persistence of metric spaces. Three of our methods are tailored towards general point clouds in Euclidean spaces. We make use of high dimensional lattice geometry {{to reduce the cost}} of the approximations. In particular, we discover several properties of the Permutahedral lattice, whose Voronoi cell is well-known for its combinatorial properties. The last method is suitable for point clouds with low intrinsic dimension, where we exploit the structural properties of the point set to tame the complexity. In some cases, we achieve a reduction in size complexity by trading off the quality of the approximation. Two of our methods work particularly well in conjunction with dimension-reduction techniques: we arrive at the first approximation schemes whose complexities are only polynomial {{in the size of the}} point cloud, and independent of the ambient dimension. On the other hand, we provide a lower bound result: we construct a point cloud that requires super-polynomial complexity for a high-quality approximation of the persistence. Together with our approximation schemes, we show that polynomial complexity is achievable for rough approximations, but impossible for sufficiently fine approximations. For some metric spaces, the intrinsic dimension is low in small neighborhoods of the input points, but much higher for large <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>distances.</b> We develop a concept of local intrinsic dimension to capture this property.
