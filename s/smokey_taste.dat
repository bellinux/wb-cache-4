It is mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} associations with plants, making it very challenging to cultivate. It is smaller than the golden chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) and has a dark brown cap with paler gills and a hollow yellow stem. C. tubaeformis tastes stronger but less fruity than the golden chanterelle. It has a very distinctive <b>smokey,</b> peppery <b>taste</b> when raw. It grows in temperate and cold parts of Northern America and Europe, including Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, and the British Isles, {{as well as in}} the Himalayas in Asia, including Assam, in the central parts of the Indian Subcontinent, and in Thailand.|$|R
