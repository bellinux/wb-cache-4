40|$|Traditional Italian {{fresh sausage}} was {{manufactured}} with 3 different formulations: no sodium lactate; 1. 5 % sodium lactate at pH 7. 0; or 1. 5 % sodium lactate at pH 5. 5. Sausages were packaged in trays with a gas permeable <b>sealing</b> <b>film</b> or {{modified atmosphere packaged}} (in an 80 % O 2 / 20 % N 2 atmosphere at a product:gas ratio of 1 : 3) with a gas-impermeable <b>sealing</b> <b>film.</b> All the packaged samples were stored at 6 °C. Physicochemical properties (pH, a w, drip formation), microbiological quality (psychrotrophic bacteria, coliforms and lactic acid bacteria) and sensory properties were assessed after 3, 6 and 9 days of storage for the conventionally packaged samples and after 5, 10 and 15 days for the modified atmosphere packaged samples. Overall, sodium lactate reduced microbial growth and improved shelf life of fresh sausages; use of sodium lactate at pH 7. 0 gave the best inhibition of microbial growth. pH had no {{significant effect on the}} action of sodium lactate on retention of sensory properties during storage. Modified atmosphere packaging gave better shelf life then conventional packaging, except for a slightly higher incidence of drip formation {{on the surface of the}} sausages...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{measurement}} of mechanical <b>sealing</b> <b>film</b> thickness and just-lift-off time is very difficult, the <b>sealing</b> <b>film</b> condition monitoring method based on acoustic emission signal is proposed. The mechanical seal acoustic emission signal present obvious characteristics of time-varying nonlinear and pulsating. In this paper, the acoustic emission signal is used to monitor the seal end faces just-lift-off time and friction condition. The acoustic emission signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition {{into a series of}} intrinsic mode function with independent characteristics of different time scales and different frequency band. The acoustic emission signal only generated by end faces friction is obtained by eliminating the false intrinsic mode function components. The correlation coefficient of acoustic emission signal and Multi-scale Laplace Wavelet is calculated. It is proved that the maximum frequency (8000 Hz) of the correlation coefficient is appeared at the spindle speed of 300 rpm. And at this time (300 rpm) the end faces have just lifted off. By a set of mechanical oil seal running test, it is demonstrated that this method could accurately identify mechanical seal end faces just-lift-off time and friction condition. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sealed</b> {{pressure-sensitive}} <b>film</b> {{is frequently}} used to record contact characteristics in physiological joints. However, {{the effect on}} the pressure-recording characteristics of <b>sealing</b> the <b>film</b> when used in these circumstances has never been studied. This study compares the coefficient of variation, the standardized coefficient of variation, the tangent and secant contact stress gradients, and the actual pressures between unsealed and <b>sealed</b> Fuji <b>film,</b> in a simplified physiological joint model with a full-thickness surface defect. Unsealed <b>film</b> and <b>sealed</b> <b>film</b> were loaded through a range of nominal loads and the resulting stains were analysed by use of custom-made macros for the ImageJ image-processing program. The coefficient of variation did not exceed 5. 7 per cent (<b>sealed</b> <b>film),</b> and the standardized coefficient of variation did not exceed 1. 8 per cent (unsealed and <b>sealed</b> <b>film).</b> Contact stress gradients did not differ significantly. The recorded pressure at the level of surface defects was always about 0. 2 MPa higher in the case of <b>sealed</b> <b>film,</b> and therefore predictable.

30|$|The {{germination}} and vegetative {{exposure to}} VOCs were determined using the methods described previously (Hung et al. [2014]; Lee et al. [2014]). Seeds (in Petri plates) or two-week-old plants (in individual test tubes) were exposed in one liter culture vessels (see Additional file 1). All tests were done {{at a low}} concentration similar to the concentration of VOCs analyzed previously: one part per million (1  ppm[*]=[*] 1  μl/l). The desired concentration of 1  ppm in the test container was obtained by depositing a drop of the chemical standard (VOC) in liquid form onto {{the inside of the}} glass vessel. The compounds, due to their chemical properties will quickly volatilize into the gas phase in the test conditions. Before sealing the lids, a 10 × 10  cm piece of Dura Seal Cling <b>Sealing</b> <b>Film</b> (Diversified Biotech) was placed over the top of each culture vessel so as to prevent VOC leakage through the polypropylene closure. The culture vessels containing either seeds in Petri plates or two-week-old plants in test tubes were arranged randomly in the growth chamber and then placed on a one inch throw rotator at 40  rpm in order to volatilize and evenly distribute the compounds. The control plants were placed in identical conditions without any VOCs.|$|E
40|$|Novel cost {{efficient}} high barrier envelopes are developed for vacuum insulation panels. In order to fulfil the required maximum oxygen permeability (at 23 °C and 50 % relative humidity (RH)) of 1 × 10 − 14 m 3 (STP) m− 2 day− 1 Pa− 1 and water vapour transmission rate (at 23 °C and 85 % → 0 % RH) of 1 × 10 − 6 kg m− 2 day− 1, hybrid polymeric (ORMOCER®) and aluminium barrier layers are combined. Using roll-to-roll processes, these materials are deposited from the liquid or gas phase {{on top of}} a poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate film. The low adhesion strength observed between aluminium and ORMOCER® layers is significantly increased by the deposition of an additional aluminium oxide layer between the two materials. The lamination of a polyethylene or polypropylene <b>sealing</b> <b>film</b> does not weaken the adhesion strength. The resulting barrier structure has reached an oxygen permeability of lower than 5 × 10 − 14 m 3 (STP) m− 2 day− 1 Pa− 1 (at 37 °C and 30 % RH). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy gives evidence for a possible penetration of the ORMOCER® lacquer into the aluminium oxide layer (synergistic effect), which explains the improved adhesion and barrier performance due to the aluminium oxide layer...|$|E
30|$|Amplification of SSR markers using {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) was done with a 15  μl reaction mixture that contained 3  μl of DNA template, 1.5  μl of 10 x PCR buffer, 2.0  μl of MgCl 2, 0.5  μl each of forward and reverse primers, 0.5  μl of 1  mM dNTP and 0.5  μl of Taq DNA polymerase (1 : 20 homemade). A drop of mineral oil was added on each well to prevent the mixture from evaporating and the plate was covered with PCR <b>sealing</b> <b>film.</b> Finally, 10 x loading buffer {{was added to the}} PCR product prior to loading (1.3  μl of 10 x loading buffer for every 10  μl of PCR product). Amplification reaction was carried out in a 96 -well PCR plate in a thermocyler. The following PCR profile was used for SSR amplification: initial denaturation at 94  °C for 5  min and then 35  cycles of denaturation at 94  °C for 30  s, annealing at 55  °C for 30  s and extension at 72  °C for 30  s; and final extension at 72  °C for 5  min and storage at 10  °C forever. The PCR products were resolved using high-resolution 8 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described by Sambrook and Russell (2001). The gel was run in 1 x TBE at 95 volts for 1 to 3  hours depending on the product size of the SSR marker. Gels were stained with SYBR SafeTM DNA gel stain and were viewed after 20  minutes.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Probe Missions to the Giant Planets, Titan and VenusSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopA feasibility study of the small Venus entry capsule and the scientific observation by the water-vapor balloon are described in this paper. Though Venus is the nearest planet to the Earth, it is still filled with mysteries and surprises. The atmosphere observation under the thick cloud on the venusian surface is of great scientific interests. Because a super-pressure type of the balloon can travel long time a wide area by strong winds on the Venus, it is considered to be of prime candidate for the atmosphere observations. A water-vapor super-pressure balloon is advantageous to obtain buoyancy force in the hot Venus atmosphere. At the entry to the Venus, the liquid-phase water is adhered to a number of the water-absorption films layered inside of the outer <b>sealing</b> <b>film.</b> The heat required for the water vaporization is supplied from the ambient environment during the ascending phase. Recently, IC chips, batteries, and solar arrays that function under the high-temperature environment ranging 180 to 220 ?C have been developed and been in practical use. By use of solar arrays, the electric power is supplied to the onboard instruments without any extra cooling system, which enables long-term observation. Then the target altitude is determined to be from 35 to 37 km considering the operation range of the high-temperature electronics. A small entry capsule with the 20 m-long water-vapor balloon accommodated in it is separated from a 150 kg small spacecraft and carries out direct entry from the interplanetary transfer orbit at the velocity of 11. 5 km/s. The capsule releases the balloon at the appropriate altitude after passing through the aerodynamic heating corridor. Total weight of the capsule is about 30 kg containing balloon and observation instruments with weight of 10 kg. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; Institute of Space and Astronautical Scienc...|$|E

The films with large pores require thick barrier layers to form effective diffusion barriers. In addition, a possible ultra-thin diffusion barrier, i. e. a plasma-induced densification layer, has also been investigated. The PALS data confirm that a porous low-dielectric-constant thin film can be shrunk by exposure to plasma. This shrinkage is confined to a surface layer of collapsed pores and forms a dense layer. The dense layer tends to behave as Ps (positronium) diffusion barriers. Indeed, the controlled thin ``skin'' layer could prevent Cu diffusion into the underlying dielectrics...|$|R
