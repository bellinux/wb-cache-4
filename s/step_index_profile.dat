Whenever an optical fiber is under stress, the optical path length, the index of refraction, and the propagation constants of each mode change.

This relation is applied to both single mode and two-mode fibers {{in order to determine}} the sensitivity characteristics of strained fibers. It was found that the phase shift is strongly dependent on the core refractive index, n(co). It was also found that it is possible to design fibers which are insensitive to axial strain.

The coherence length of the side-chain polymer, equal to 28 µm at 1200 nm, was evaluated from the dispersion of the linear refractive indices.

W. Nd doped lithium tantalate waveguide laser. It presents a threshold of 24 mW and a slope efficiency of 15 %. Operating at about 60 °C, {{it was possible to}} observe up to 8 mW output power at 1. 0816 pm for 75 mW absorbed pump power without any instabilities due to photorefractive effects, which are the best results observed to date. Following the recent success in fabricating waveguide lasers and laser devices in rare-earth doped lithium niobate 12, 3, it appeared interesting to develop similar elements in rare-earth doped lithium tantalate in view of this latter material's reputation for having a considerably higher optical damage threshold. Unfortunately, first attempts, using Proton Exchanged (PE) waveguides on Nd:LiTa 03 were not very successful 4. In order to improve these performances we decided to use an annealed PE waveguide, which was realized on a X-cut lithium tantalate substrate 5 doped with 0. 1 mole % of ~ d 3 +.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study of optical effects, arising {{in the form of}} non-uniform waveguide structure, complicated refractive index profiles or due to pulse propagation in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) optical communication systems. These effects are important and critically influence the performance of DWDM optical systems. A comprehensive survey of current literature on optical effects due to nonuniform optical structure and nonlinear optical effects is first done, showing their advantages and disadvantage in optical communication systems. A survey on methods of optical waveguide analysis is also done. The main contribution has been made to three main aspects of the problem : Accurate analysis of uniform/non-uniform optical waveguides with arbitary refractive index profiles Pulse propagation and distortion in DWDM Raman amplification systems. Use of non-uniform FBG to compensate for pulse distortion We study several existing analytical techniques developed so far for analyzing the mode of non-uniform optical waveguide structures. Later, we verify the analytical results by finite element method (FEM). The convergence study is also carried out. A new computational technique is proposed modifying the finite element method to analyze complex refractive index profiles required for the analysis, namely single mode <b>step</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile,</b> multi clad fiber, W -profile, chirp profile etc. An accuracy of 10 − 4 in the calculation of propagation constant/eigen-value is demonstrated. Dispersion characteristics of optical fibers w. r. t. different profile parameters is evaluated. A modification to scalar BPM is proposed and applied to study the effects of inhomogeneities along the propagation direction. The applicability and accuracy of the method is tested using integrated optic waveguide devices, namely, graded index slab waveguide. The proposed BPM uses Fourier decomposition of the transverse field. Coupled mode theory (CMT) of optical waveguides in non-homogeneous optical medium is applied to study the interaction of lightwaves propagation together such as in a DWDM system. The BPM results is verified by CMT. The inhomogeneous waveguide theory is extended to study pulse propagation in DWDM optical communication system. Nonlinear optical effects are an important aspects of DWDM systems with fiber Raman amplifier. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is necessary to study these nonlinear optical effects as other conventional methods are not suitable here. Here, we discuss DWDM optical communication systems due to nonlinearity in the form of SRS effect. In case of FRA, we study the various kinds of fiber profile design parameters, for the purpose to achieve and extend the flat gain bandwidth over the EDFA window. We also propose and study, a new bi-directional optical fiber transmission scheme with various constraints, using Raman amplification process with and without pump depletion. Our scheme, provides an advantage like high SNR, low pump induced noise, for long-haul communication link. We find that, there is a quite significant crosstalk and power coupling among the dense DWDM channels but earlier discussed BPM fails to account for possible interference effects among the channels. To reduce the harmful nonlinear optical effects like four wave mixing (FWM), we need to deploy a high chromatic dispersion fiber, which will ultimately lead to high pulse walk-off rate among the DWDM channels; hence for high bit rate long haul systems, walk-off effect can not be ignored. Application of FDTD provided an improved insight into the effect of GVD on stimulated Raman scattering crosstalk than different modulation techniques and line codes. It is shown through analysis that pulse walk-off phenomena may distort the data asymmetrically; especially for case of wide-band DWDM transmission system. Hence, the pulse walk-off effect should be considered in future systems containing optical amplifier. It is shown, that large walk-off rate may reduce the crosstalk among DWDM channels but tends to increase the asymmetric pulse distortion. Data may lose due to high walk-off effect. We also investigate channel addition/removal process in DWDM fiber Raman amplifier. We also demonstrate that the pulse walk-off effect tends to lead significantly to positive chirp for higher frequency channels. This feature can be exploited to overcome the chromatic dispersion effects in DWDM transmission systems. Pulse walk-off induced chirp, can be compensated by using the nonuniform fiber Bragg grating (NUFBG). The CMT due to periodic perturbation of the circular cylindrical waveguide structures is applied here. Here, we discuss the function of fiber Bragg grating as a transmission versus reflecting grating filter. We also discuss, FBG application to gain flattening of an EDFA window as well as how the group velocity dispersion (GVD) will be affected with bandwidth and coupling coefficient. We develop a new analytical technique to estimate the bandwidth of FBG based optical system. Finally, we investigate the dispersion compensation properties, pulse distortion, peak reflectivity analysis in uniform/non-uniform FBG due to an uniform/non-uniform incoming signal. More complicated refractive index profile can significantly reduce the GVD as well as side lobes intensity. Dispersion characteristic due to an arbitrary refractive index profile is discussed in details for the case of non-uniform FBG. Thus, we concluded that wide band DWDM optical communication system need to closely take into account various inhomogeneities and nonlinearities of optical fibers w. r. t. wave and pulse propagation...|$|E

40|$|Optical fibers have {{realized}} their immense potential for high power {{applications in the}} last decade. However, non-linearity still remains a challenge for power scaling for fiber lasers [1]. A large effective area of the fundamental mode of the optical fiber can increase {{the threshold of the}} non-linear effects [2]. However, simply increasing the core size leads to multi-mode operation and hence deteriorates the beam quality. Several novel optical fiber designs have been proposed to offer a large effective area of optical fibers such as Low NA <b>Step</b> <b>index</b> fibers, Photonic Crystal Fibers, Bragg Fibers, etc., while still maintaining single mode operation. Recently, we proposed a novel multi-trench fiber (MTF) design for large effective mode area, as shown by a cross-section schematic and a refractive <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> design in Fig. 1. [3]. This fiber design offers advantages of relatively easy fabrication, splicing, and cleaving.
