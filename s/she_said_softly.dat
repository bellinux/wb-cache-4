6000|$|... "One never knows," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "You {{yourself}} {{have seen}} and heard of strange things happening within the last few days." ...|$|E
6000|$|She sighed, {{and looking}} at him with an {{expression}} of tender reproach. [...] "I wonder whether I can believe you," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'You go hence to-morrow, prince,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> 'and I have a favour {{to ask of}} you, if {{you will}} listen to your handmaid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In a moment," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>softly</b> {{crossed the}} floor to peep into the bedroom. [...] "Poor papa, he looks almost bloodless as he sleeps." ...|$|R
6000|$|She put {{her hands}} behind her {{back and looked at}} the dead man with her head a little on one side. [...] "Too kind," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{answered}} him in Latin, with two lines from Virgil. As she watched him, she pitied his helplessness, {{and gave him}} a last cut as <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>softly</b> and tenderly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am afraid," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "that {{the moment}} they reach London this {{document}} will {{be taken to the}} Austrian Embassy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I do thank you--with all my heart," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I owe you now--for {{myself and}} her--more than I can ever repay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> {{laughing}} at his sudden quickness. She {{seemed to think}} it unnecessary to proffer any eager disavowal of the charge.|$|E
6000|$|There was a pause. Mercy's fingers toyed nervously {{with the}} {{trinkets}} at her watch-chain. [...] "When {{would you like}} it to be?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>softly,</b> with her whole attention fixed on the watch-chain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Harmachis; {{there is}} no fear for thee," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> {{laughing}} <b>softly,</b> [...] "seeing that I know how far thy thoughts are set from woman's beauty and the common weakness of thy sex. With cold iron we may safely toy." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned her}} face away. She looked at the hand lying idle upon her crape-covered knee. [...] "You are my dearest friend," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>softly.</b> [...] "You are almost my only friend. But----. I can never go into {{marriage}} any more...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} come back," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "That is very kind of you, Capitaine Rotherby. I have been lonely--very lonely, indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{raised her}} shy eyelids. The faintest {{ghost of a}} long-buried dimple came into her pale cheek as <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> to his utter consternation: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Monsieur!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "Lie still. By {{a miracle}} and the {{faithfulness}} of Michelot you live. Be thankful, be content, and sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night, Scaramouche," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> but so <b>softly,</b> so tenderly, that {{he caught}} his breath, and stood conning her, {{his dark eyes}} aglow.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are much}} better," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> and her <b>softly</b> {{modulated}} voice fell pleasantly on his ears. He contrived to raise himself a trifle.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Sally {{directed}} a critical {{glance at her}} handmaiden's red-coifed head. [...] "No," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to herself <b>softly,</b> [...] "it felt nicer than wool, anyway!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{understand}} now,” <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> “why {{there are}} lines on your forehead and you sometimes look worn. Your life {{must have been}} very hard.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mean that, dear," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I mean--your not quarrelling {{with me when}} I'm unreasonable. Why can't {{we always}} do so!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is freedom}} for Theos," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "and revenge upon the King. Whatever may befall him from our hands he has deserved." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{waited in}} silence for a while, nor did she detain him by the {{slightest}} gesture although he once more made a movement as if to go, only her eyes rooted him to the spot even as <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>softly,</b> her voice sounding full and mellow like the cooing of a dove.|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Wren {{cocked her}} tail {{up in that}} saucy way of hers and winked at Johnny Chuck. [...] "The way he can fly," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But Old Mother Nature {{overlooked}} this. [...] "I don't {{suppose you}} ever ate a chestnut or a fat hickory nut or a sweet beechnut," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>softly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you would}} have none of my advice, Mr. Secretary," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> coming a little nearer to me. [...] "You are already installed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still--I'm {{glad you}} came to try," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "That horrid foreman is {{watching}} us, Victor. I am going {{to look the other}} way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Gwilt {{advanced}} {{with the}} first signs of agitation she had shown yet. [...] "Is it possible?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "Can it really be you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Negore, my man! my man!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to herself, as {{she watched}} him go, but <b>she</b> <b>said</b> it so <b>softly</b> that even Old Kinoos did not hear, and his ears were over keen, what of his blindness.|$|R
6000|$|The {{daughter}} had sat quite silent and still during this speech, {{with her eyes}} fixed on the ground; her cousin standing near her, and looking on the ground too. <b>She</b> now <b>said</b> very <b>softly,</b> in a trembling voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one little}} thing I almost {{forgot to tell}} you," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>softly,</b> very slowly, very clearly. [...] "I do love you. I have never loved you so much as right now. After our dozen years you've bowled me over at last. And I was bowled over from the beginning, {{although}} I did not know it. I have {{made up my mind}} now, once and for all." ...|$|R
6000|$|Regina put her {{handkerchief}} to her eyes, {{when the}} maid had discreetly retired. [...] "Oh," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "I am afraid {{this is very}} wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|She hesitated. Then, {{lifting her}} eyes to his, [...] "I don't believe," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly,</b> [...] "that you would tell me {{anything}} that was not true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'And {{all the air}} {{a solemn}} stillness holds,'" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I love this cliff, Mr. Garnet. It's the most {{soothing}} place in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; he {{is coming}} to meet me, it appears. But, father,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> more <b>softly</b> and slowly, 'how wrong {{it will be for}} me to come so close to you, and never {{recognize}} you! I don't like it. I wish you could have given up service by this time; it would have been so much less painful for us all round. I thought we {{might have been able to}} manage it somehow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{he has got}} my letter," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>softly.</b> [...] "I {{wonder what}} they are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> again, very <b>softly,</b> {{stretching}} out her arms, [...] "come {{and give me}} a kiss, and let us change the subject once and for ever. I {{want to tell you about}} my poor father; he left some messages for you, Morris." ...|$|R
