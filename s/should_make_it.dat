25|$|Its name {{initially}} was 'Parallels Workstation for Mac OS X', which {{was consistent with}} the company's corresponding Linux and Windows products. This name was not well received within the Mac community, where some felt that the name, particularly the term “workstation,” evoked the aesthetics of a Windows product. Parallels agreed: “Since we've got a great Mac product, we <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look and sound like a Mac product...”, it was therefore renamed ‘Parallels Desktop for Mac’.|$|E

25|$|If so, {{then we must}} plan our eugenic policy {{along some}} such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, {{allegedly}} less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest {{the removal of the}} last check on natural selection <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer. Watson's criticisms of then Mariners owner George Argyros {{eventually led to the}} P-I reducing the frequency of his column. Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor called and said he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week. I said maybe we <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> zero columns a week." [...] On October 30, 1983, after a hiatus of more than three decades, Watson's column appeared once again in The Seattle Times.|$|E
500|$|Kotaku {{gave the}} release a {{generally}} positive rating, praising the redone visuals, tweaked gameplay and expanded content, but also noting the game's age is still palpable. Game Informer gave the collection an 8.25 out of 10, stating [...] "The {{core of this}} collection is the excellent original game, and that’s where your attention should be. The other two lowly offerings are inessential bonus features." [...] Joystiq gave a positive, unscored review, saying the collection [...] "captures that early era of the franchise at its purest simplicity. It's a trip down memory lane for long-term fans, while the visual overhaul and back-to-beginnings story <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a welcoming entry point for newcomers." [...] GameSpot gave the HD remake a 7 out of 10, saying, [...] "Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix presents {{a couple of the}} earliest games in the beloved series in their best light and makes a revealing cinematic experience out of a third one. The three experiences complement one another with unique elements and welcome context that is a treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike." ...|$|E

500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we <b>should</b> <b>make.</b> <b>It</b> wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Star Wars Headspace was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 {{on the site}} Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy." [...] A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it to be, giving all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. [...] Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being [...] "simple fun" [...] and [...] "Neither [...] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly [...] "a way of avoiding risk".|$|E
500|$|During the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, Sega of America {{research}} and development head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama {{stressed the importance of}} coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar. [...] Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. [...] One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as [...] "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console. [...] Project Jupiter was initially slated to be {{a new version of the}} Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. [...] Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. [...] According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, [...] "Oh, that's just a horrible idea. [...] If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> an add-on. [...] If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great. [...] But if the only thing it does is double the colors...." [...] Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. [...] One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. [...] This would come in the form of an add-on. [...] From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed [...] "Project Mars", was advanced.|$|E

[...] Hoig writes, [...] "Even though the number 103 was not arrived at by a precise battlefield count, it is a definite figure which has already been placed on historical markers of the battlefield. Since it will likely never be proved absolutely incorrect, the figure will undoubtedly remain accepted as the number of Indians killed by Custer at the Washita.
