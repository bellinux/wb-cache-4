40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on chip deformation {{of the actual}} turning with actively driven rotary tool. The main {{purpose of the present}} work is to make clearly the effect of tool rotational speed and its direction upon the cutting force components, and the chip formation. In order to investigate the effect of tool rotation {{with a wide range of}} speed, the cutting tool is driven by the high speed motor of main <b>spindle</b> <b>machine</b> and its rotation is controlled by NC Programmable. The components of cutting force were measured using the piezoelectric force transducers of a force ring dynamometer. Experimental results show that the tool rotational speed can lead an increase in the dynamic inclination angle so that causes the helix angle and the pitch of chip were increased. This indicates the cutting mechanics changed from the orthogonal to the oblique cutting. It was also found that the tool rotational speed has a significant effect on the cutting forces. The resultant and tangential cutting forces decrease with increasing the tool rotational speed to certain value and then constant. The resultant cutting force of rotary tool was approximately 18...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum {{silicon carbide}} Metal Matrix Composites (Al-MMC) {{are widely used}} in {{aeronautical}} and automobile industries due to their excellent mechanical and physical properties. However the harder reinforcement particles make machining difficult. Tool wear occurs more quickly and reduces {{the life of the}} tool. This paper presents the experimental investigation on turning A 356 matrix metal reinforced with 20 % by weight of Silicon carbide (SiC) particles, fabricated in house by stir casting. Fabricated samples were turned on medium duty lathe with Poly crystalline Diamond (PCD) inserts of 1300 and 1500 grade exposed to various cutting conditions. Parameters such as power consumed by main <b>spindle,</b> <b>machined</b> surface roughness and tool wear are studied. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images support the result.

40|$|International audienceSpindle speed {{variation}} {{is a well-known}} technique to suppress regenerative machine tool vibrations, but it is usually considered to be effective only for low spindle speeds. In this paper, the effect of spindle {{speed variation}} is analyzed in the high-speed domain for spindle speeds corresponding to the first flip (period doubling) and to the first Hopf lobes. The optimal amplitudes and frequencies of the speed modulations are computed using the semidiscre- tization method. It is shown that period doubling chatter can effectively be suppressed by spindle speed variation, although, the technique is not effective for the quasiperiodic chatter above the Hopf lobe. The results are verified by cutting tests. Some special cases are also discussed where the practical behavior of the system differs from the predicted one in some ways.

40|$|The {{process of}} ductile mode {{grinding}} has been analyzed experimentally. Besides the traditional approach, controlling {{the depth of}} a cut on feed-controlled ultra-precision machines (UPMs), two alternative approaches have been tested. By applying fluid jet polishing (FJP) using a grinding slurry, a stable ductile mode grinding could be set up. Subsequently, loose abrasive grinding processes on load-controlled traditional <b>spindle</b> <b>machines</b> have been tested to be suited for ductile mode grinding identifying the dependence of crack initiation {{on the type of}} slurry fluid being applied. In that way, substantially improved levels of surface roughness could be achieved, although local brittle cracking within the generated clear apertures still remained. Furthermore, critical process parameters were identified determining the process window of feed-controlled ductile grinding applied on state-of-The-Art UPM machineries. These have been analyzed experimentally, and {{it was found that the}} critical depth of a cut significantly depends on the set of critical process parameters being applied. Finally, the critical ductile grinding process parameters could be identified determining the generated level of surface roughness achieving 0. 83 nm Ra on tungsten carbide...|$|R

40|$|Aluminum Boron Carbide Metal Matrix Composites (Al-MMC) have {{revolutionized}} aeronautical and automobile industries, in {{the recent}} times due to their exceptional mechanical and physical properties. However it is seen that the machinability of these composites is greatly reduced by the hardness of constituent reinforcement particles.
