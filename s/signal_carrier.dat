50|$|In NTSC, {{chrominance}} is encoded {{using two}} color signals known as I (in-phase) and Q (in quadrature) {{in a process}} called QAM. The two signals each amplitude modulate 3.58 MHz carriers which are 90 degrees out of phase {{with each other and}} the result added together but with the carriers themselves being suppressed. The result {{can be viewed as a}} single sine wave with varying phase relative to a reference carrier and with varying amplitude. The varying phase represents the instantaneous color hue captured by a TV camera, and the amplitude represents the instantaneous color saturation. This 3.58 MHz subcarrier is then added to the Luminance to form the 'composite color signal' which modulates the video <b>signal</b> <b>carrier</b> just as in monochrome transmission.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The error vector {{magnitude}} (EVM) is extensively applied as a metric {{for digital}} transmitter signal quality compliance in modern communication systems. In cooperative communication, <b>signal</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency and symbol rate are predicted, and the reference signal can be recovered from demodulated symbols directly. However in non-cooperative communications, the <b>signal</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency and symbol rate are estimated. Since the demodulation and EVM {{are very sensitive to}} symbol rate, we focus on the EVM of non-cooperative communication in this paper. In our proposal ï¼Œ a novel wavelet-based EVM recovery of reference signal is presented. This method can recover reference signal accurately to achieve the true EVM, if the estimation error of symbol rate has been bounded within a small range.
