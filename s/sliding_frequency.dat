A total of 3224 landslides were mapped in watersheds covering 2993 km 2 and underlain {{by a variety of}} lithologies, including Tertiary sedimentary rocks of the Coast Ranges, volcanic rocks of the Cascade Range and Quaternary glacial sediments in the Puget Lowlands. GIS (geographical information system) techniques were used to register each mapped landslide to critical rainfall values predicted from a theoretical model for the topographic control on shallow landsliding using 30 m DEMs (digital elevation models). A single set of parameter values appropriate for simulating slide hazards after forest clearing was used for all watersheds to assess the regional in¯uence of topographic controls on shallow landsliding. Model performance varied widely between watersheds, with the best performance generally in steep watersheds underlain by shallow bedrock and the worst performance in generally low gradient watersheds underlain by thick glacial deposits.

40|$|Background: Osteochondrosis (OC) is a common, {{clinically}} important joint {{disorder in}} which endochondral ossification is focally disturbed. Reduced blood supply to growing cartilage {{is considered an}} important cause of the condition, which has both genetic and environmental origins. Housing conditions can influence cartilage injury through peak-pressure changes during limb sliding. Additionally, circulatory perturbation can cause the avascular necrosis of cartilage. In this study, we evaluated the type and frequency of limb sliding during standing up and the occurrence of OC in foals aged up to 12 months on different farms. Methods: Standing-up behavior was observed in 50 weaned, group-housed, Dutch Warmblood foals aged 6 - 9 months at five farms using black-and-white surveillance cameras, and their standing-up behavior was scored using a predetermined ethogram. OC was scored using a categorical scale between 6 and 12 months of age in 50 foals in the weanling period, and in 48 from the weanling to yearling periods because two foals died in this time. Results: At both 6 and 12 months of age, the total prevalence of OC differed between the farms: the lowest prevalence was observed on a farm with no sliding, and the highest prevalence was evident on a farm with a higher <b>sliding</b> <b>frequency.</b> The mean ratio of sliding versus normal standing-up behavior was 29 % (range: 0 - 50 %); i. e., foals experienced limb sliding during around 29 % of standing-up maneuvres. The frequency of sliding instead of normal standing-up behavior differed significantly between the farms (range: 0 - 50 %; P < 0. 05), but significantly decreased when foals could better prepare themselves to stand, e. g., when there was an obvious provocation such as the announced approach of another foal (P < 0. 05).

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} blind separation of convolutive mixtures of speech signals, based on the joint diagonalization of the time varying spectral matrices of the observation records. The main and still largely open problem in a frequency domain approach is permutation ambiguity.

This paper therefore proposes a new method based on two assumptions. The frequency continuity of the unmixing filters is still used in the initialization of the diagonalization algorithm. Then, the paper introduces a new method based on the time-frequency representations of the sources. They are assumed to vary smoothly with frequency. This hypothesis of the continuity of the time variation of the source energy is exploited on a <b>sliding</b> <b>frequency</b> bandwidth.

Unidirectional sliding tests (pin-on-disc) were performed using AISI 304 L stainless steel sliding against corundum. Experiments were carried out in Cl- and SO 42 - containing media under open-circuit and potentiostatic polarization conditions. The power spectral density (PSD) of the current and potential signals showed a strong dependence on the <b>sliding</b> <b>frequency</b> but did not depend significantly on the normal load between 5 and 20 N. The fluctuations of the tangential and normal loads were also recorded, and a critical comparison between the PSD of the electrochemical response and the PSD of the mechanical solicitation (load) is proposed. At high frequencies (f > 0. 1 Hz), the PSD of current or potential fluctuations have significantly different shapes than the PSD of load signals: the electrochemical signal PSD is governed by the dynamic balance between local depassivation and repassivation which only depends on the kinetics of the electrochemical phenomena. For lower frequencies, a plateau is observed for both the electrochemical PSD and the load PSD.

The power spectral density (PSD) of the current and potential signals showed a strong dependence on the <b>sliding</b> <b>frequency</b> but did not depend significantly on the normal load between 5 and 20 N. The fluctuations of the tangential and normal loads were also recorded, and a critical comparison between the PSD of the electrochemical response and the PSD of the mechanical solicitation (load) is proposed. At high frequencies (f > 0. 1 Hz), the PSD of current or potential fluctuations have significantly different shapes than the PSD of load signals: the electrochemical signal PSD is governed by the dynamic balance between local depassivation and repassivation which only depends on the kinetics of the electrochemical phenomena. For lower frequencies, a plateau is observed for both the electrochemical PSD and the load PSD. The electrochemical signal is then governed by the continuous depassivation induced by sliding which appears as a low frequency component. These {{results suggest that the}} electrochemical noise technique investigated in the frequency domain might be a promising electrochemical tool for successfully unfolding tribocorrosion signatures for material parings in sliding-corrosion tests. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} {{nonlinear}} scheme for esti-mating an Oscillatory Failure Case (OFC) using a nonlinear {{model of the}} hydraulic actuator which requires an estimate of rod speed. The estimation of the rod speed is provided by a supertwist differentiator. The supertwist gains are allowed to adapt to maintain <b>sliding</b> during high <b>frequency</b> and high amplitude OFCs. Ideally low gains in the differentiator are required because of the noisy environment associated with the physical system. A Lyapunov based analysis for the novel adaptive supertwist scheme is also presented. Simulations on both liquid and solid OFCs {{have been carried out}} on the full nonlinear aircraft model with highly detailed models of the actuators which include sensor and process noise. Good estimation of both actuator rod speed and the OFC is obtained...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{explore the}} effect of {{vibration}} on interfacial friction by applying normal and parallel base vibration to a block that rests on an inclined plane. Results show that the block can displace at significant lower angles than the limiting static angle, and that the acceleration level required to cause <b>sliding</b> increases with <b>frequency.</b> Limiting equilibrium analysis is insufficient to explain the observed behavior. Instead, we compute the displacement per cycle and show that (1) the apparent quasi-continuous motion of the block under vibration is the accumulation of successive slip-rest events, and (2) the displacement in every cycle must exceed a threshold displacement in order to cause sliding. The threshold displacement is 0. 1 μm for polished granite surfaces; a relation between the threshold displacement and the length scale of surface features is anticipated...|$|R

The window length in frequency direction is selected based on the expected minimum bandwidth of the PU signal or spectrum hole, and then the required time domain window length can be calculated from the target false alarm and missed detection probabilities. The basic approach would be to calculate (8) for a nonoverlapping set of windows. However, using a <b>sliding</b> window in <b>frequency</b> and/or time direction can also be done with relatively small addition to complexity. Time-domain sliding window helps to detect rapidly re-appearing PU [4, 5] whereas sliding window in the frequency direction helps to locate spectrum gaps with unknown center frequencies. Due to the Gaussian distribution of Y(m, k), the probability distribution function (PDF) of [...]...|$|R
