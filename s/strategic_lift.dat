2500|$|Chrétien's {{government}} {{did not support the}} US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. His reasoning was that the war lacked UN Security Council sanction; while {{not a member of the}} Security Council, Canada nevertheless attempted to build a consensus for a resolution authorizing the use of force after a short (two to three-month) extension to UN weapon inspections in Iraq. (Critics also noted that, while in opposition, he had also opposed the first US-led Gulf War, which had been approved by the UN Security Council and in 1999 supported NATO air strikes against Serbia, which had no Security Council approval.) In order to avoid damaging relations with the United States, Chrétien agreed to another and larger deployment of Canadian troops to Afghanistan on February 12, 2003, in order to prove that Canada was still a good American ally, despite opposing the upcoming Iraq war. The Army's commander General, Mike Jeffery, was against the deployment of 2,000 troops to Afghanistan, arguing that [...] "We did not have <b>strategic</b> <b>lift,</b> we lacked certain strategic enablers, certain types of intelligence, certain types of communications. Our logistics capability was weak", and that at most Canada had the capacity to support only 500 troops in Afghanistan. General Jeffery's views were ignored, and Canada sent 2,000 soldiers to Afghanistan in the summer of 2003. In December 2003, it emerged that the Department of National Defence had prepared plans for Canada to send as many as 800 Canadian troops to Iraq if the UN Security Council had authorized it; however, a UN request for an increased deployment of Canadian soldiers to Afghanistan removed this option from the table. This led some of Chrétien's anti-war critics on the left to accuse the Prime Minister of never really being fully opposed to the war. Nonetheless, Canada was the first non-member of the US-led coalition to provide significant financial aid to the post-war reconstruction effort, relative to Canada's size. This move allowed Canadian companies to bid on reconstruction contracts.|$|E

500|$|Many war {{films have}} been {{produced}} {{with the cooperation of}} a nation's military forces. After the Second World War, the United States Navy provided ships and technical guidance for films such as Top Gun. The U.S. Air Force assisted with The Big <b>Lift,</b> <b>Strategic</b> Air Command and A Gathering of Eagles, which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles. Critics point out that the film Pearl Harbors US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received by the US armed forces; the premiere was actually held on board a U.S. Navy carrier. In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of Crimson Tide, especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance. Film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films [...] "have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions".|$|R

50|$|The Parachute Regiment has {{its origins}} in the elite force of Commandos {{set up by the}} British Army at the request of Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister, during the initial phase of the Second World War. Churchill had been an enthusiast of the concept of {{airborne}} warfare since the First World War, when he had proposed the creation of a force that might assault the German flanks deep behind the trenches of the static Western Front. In 1940 and {{in the aftermath of the}} Dunkirk evacuation and the Fall of France, Churchill's interest was caught again by the idea of taking the fight back to Europe - the airborne was now a means to be able to storm a series of water obstacles... everywhere from the Channel to the Mediterranean and in the East.Enthusiasts within the British armed forces were inspired in the creation of airborne forces (including the Parachute Regiment, Air Landing Regiment, and the Glider Pilot Regiment) by the example of the German Luftwaffe's Fallschirmjäger, which had a major role in the invasions of Norway, and the Low Countries, particularly the attack on Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium, and a pivotal, but costly role in the invasion of Crete. From the perspective of others, however, the proposed airborne units had a key weakness: they required exactly the same resources as the new strategic bomber capability, another high priority, and would also compete with the badly stretched <b>strategic</b> air <b>lift</b> capability, essential to Churchill's strategy in the Far East. It took the continued reintervention of Churchill to ensure that sufficient aircraft were devoted to the airborne project to make it viable.|$|R

The previous strategy of NZ Kiwifruit Growers had not changed since 2006 whilst the kiwifruit industry itself had grown and changed rapidly in the decade. The goal of the review included developing a <b>strategic</b> plan that <b>lifted</b> {{the performance of the}} organisation for the benefit of NZ kiwifruit growers. Literature on strategy formation, participatory research, and stakeholder theory, informed the methodology and research outcomes. The data was analysed by describing, classifying, and connecting data through the use of hierarchies, risk matrices, and a stakeholder model that led to the establishment of NZ Kiwifruit Growers strategic plan. Priorities for the organisation included increased monitoring of performance and enhanced communication. Targets were established to rectify a disconnection that was identified during the strategy formation process, between the organisations priorities and the strategic plan caused by ineffective teamwork. This thesis provides a framework for strategy formation that includes the stages of strategic analysis, strategic planning, implementation, and monitoring that can be applied by other industry - good organisations in the horticulture industry...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of on-line video in Australia is evident {{from a range of}} recent studies. Many agricultural and horticultural industries are now utilising video as an alternative approach to information delivery and technology transfer. In 2011, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries staff trialled the use of web-based video within the Australia macadamia industry through its macSmart™ project. This project was funded to facilitate information delivery and exchange to support the macadamia industry's <b>strategic</b> priority of <b>lifting</b> farm productivity. Access to the latest research results and the ability to identify and adopt best practices are essential for improving and maximising productivity. Leading growers are also important sources of knowledge and experience as well as being effective agents for promoting practice change. A key feature of the macSmart project was its focus on grower experience as well as latest research outcomes. An initial two year pilot project focused on the topic of canopy management. Based on the success of this pilot and through industry consultation the focus was subsequently expanded to include soil health, breeding, pollination, pest and disease control, post-harvest handling, orchard rejuvenation and orchard productivity. The project produced a total of 55 video stories over four years. The stores were delivered to industry via a subscriber-only content management system with embedded video content streamed from YouTube. A total of 347 growers, consultants, researchers and other industry stakeholders subscribed to the macSmart site. More than two thirds of users surveyed indicated that the videos had directly contributed to them changing practices on their farm.

40|$|The {{commercialisation}} {{of subsistence}} farmers: a benefit or detriment to the poor? The {{aim of this}} study is to understand if rural households in Swaziland are benefiting from engaging in commercial outgrower schemes. The process of commercialising subsistence farmers has been one of the government of Swaziland’s <b>strategic</b> attempts to <b>lift</b> rural households out of poverty by raising their income levels. I explore some of the socioeconomic factors that are imposed on rural households, bringing into question whether or not this strategy is a viable poverty alleviation policy. In Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture has been central to economic development through the promotion of the export of crops and raw material. Its profitable potential provides a vehicle for using land in rural areas for poverty alleviation and rural development strategies. Commercialising subsistence farmers has the potential to offer the prospect of raising incomes, improving welfare, food security and nutritional status that could otherwise have been worse. However, this transition (from subsistence to commercial) in agricultural activities in rural communities can also have detrimental consequences such as reduce income and threaten household food security. I therefore ask the question: How have rural households benefited from engaging in commercial agriculture? In this study I explore the process of commercialising subsistence farmers as a form of rural development. To achieve this, I have carried out a case study analysis of a rural community in Swaziland called Mafucula, which has currently been involved in the commercial agriculture of sugarcane for the last six years. Empirical data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with 30 households in this community. My findings demonstrate that with six years into commercial agriculture, this community has not benefited from this venture and continues to face the ongoing struggle of poverty...|$|R
50|$|The Ashley Planes {{job was to}} join two {{railroad}} sections {{at either}} elevation and bridge over the drainage divide between the Susquehanna Valley {{and that of the}} Lehigh/Delaware valleys. It was purpose-built to join the freight capacity of two canals (The Pennsylvania Canal System, locally the West Susquehanna Division at Pittston and the Lehigh Canal) and via the Susquehanna, connect to other transportation infrastructure between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh - in intent the Planes role in the legislation was specifically to connect the seaports of the Delaware River with the new interior settlements of the near-midwest along the tributary rivers of the vast Mississippi River drainage basin. More pragmatically, it was designed during the mid-canal era as part of an overall <b>strategic</b> schema to <b>lift</b> heavy freight eastwards out of the Susquehanna Valley in suburban Wilkes-Barre into the eastside descents which gravity aided to the canal head and thence using cheap practical water transport ended feeding much needed coal into all the big coastal cities of the Eastern United States accessible via the Delaware Valley, and indeed to trans-oceanic destinations. This connecting road was seen by design as a key important link that connected by the shortest path Pittsburgh, the Ohio River and the midwest to the eastern coastal cities via the Pennsylvania Canal System and later, other railroads (that newfangled but rapidly advancing technology). To properly appreciate its role in history, one must understand in 1837-1838 the mobile steam locomotives of the day were still {{in the early stages of}} development and relatively weak and under powered even compared to those available in the 1850s; hence political planners and businessmen had a mindset thinking canals and water transport via barges over natural water features were the only pragmatic means of shipping bulk goods; and even then coal was in high demand as the eastern U.S. had denuded its large stands of woods.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the embedded literacy practices of ten Māori educators at Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec). There were {{several reasons for}} tracking these practices, including our gathering evidence that Wintec met the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) funding requirement that level- 1 and level- 2 educators integrated deliberate acts of literacy teaching into their practices (TEC, 2009 a). The most important reason was that we responded to three boundary texts (Thomas, Hardy and Sargent, 2007) : Wintec’s Maori Capability Framework (MCF) (Wintec, 2013), the Tertiary Education Strategy (2014 - 2019) (MoE, 2014), and a TEC publication {{on how to do}} better for Māori (Chauvel and Rean, 2012). These texts highlight the <b>strategic</b> priority of <b>lifting</b> outcomes for Māori learners and enhancing Māori and non-Māori educators’ capability in enacting values (tikanga) from a Māori world-view. The LN-embedding team used classroom observations to raise educators’ awareness of the diversity of deliberate acts of literacy and numeracy (as well as general pedagogical competence) they used to enhance learning or circumvent barriers in learning conversations with and among learners. The report shows the range, depth and complexity of these educators’ practices. An important related goal was that observations were viewed as neither definitive nor objective: observed educators were asked to validate or reject the observations, and their comments were recorded. The authors then performed independent analyses, coding these dialogically accomplished narrative-based observations. Our analyses yielded 90 constructs categorized into 8 superordinate categories. We found that the three peaks in the frequency table related to deliberate acts of literacy and numeracy teaching, learner-centred mediation in learning conversations and deliberately sequenced pedagogical steps. We concluded that for TEC-targeted courses (units at level 1 and 2 in level- 1 to level- 3 programmes), educators consistently used deliberate LN-embedding strategies which were consistent with both Māori pedagogy and general LN-embedding practices. We recommend that educators (a) pursue, develop and make explicit the meanings they attach to the principles and practices of Māori or any other pedagogy informing their instructional decisions (Borg, 2003; Freeman, 2002; and Woods, 1996); (b) relevant research methodologies – such as repertory grids (Greyling and Waitai, 2016) - be used to elicit, describe and critique these explicit accounts of Māori pedagogy as a resource for assessing and promoting culturally appropriate pedagogical practices; and (c) outcomes for courses delivered in Māori and non-Māori modes of delivery be tracked...|$|R
50|$|The Indian Air Force is the air {{arm of the}} Indian armed forces. Its primary {{responsibility}} is to secure Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during a conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the British Raj and the prefix Royal was added in 1945 in recognition of its services during World War II. After India achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the Royal Indian Air Force served the Dominion of India, with the prefix being dropped when India became a republic in 1950.

The MV- 22 will support key concepts, precision engagement and dominant maneuver, outlined in Joint Vision 2010 while providing the Marine Corps unique latitude in force projection. Background: The most significant advantage offered by the MV- 22 is to rapidly self-deploy worldwide and arrive ready to fight. This will provide Marines the ability to quickly respond to crisis situations while reducing the impact on valuable <b>strategic</b> <b>lift</b> sorties. The Osprey's ability to fly significant distances enables Marines to respond rapidly to those situations that require immediate reinforcement or build-up of combat power. The Osprey provides unique latitude with its capability to self-deploy and greater versatility in employing military force. Two mission areas that are suitable to the Osprey's design are aerial refuel/tanker support and command and control (C 2). Increasing the MV- 22 's role within the Marine Corps provides a single asset that can perform multiple missions. The enhanced capabilities of the MV- 22 will exten...|$|E
