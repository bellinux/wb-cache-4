5000|$|The HMSAM: TAM {{has been}} {{effective}} for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. e-learning, learning management systems, webportals, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adaption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed {{for these kinds of}} systems by Lowry et al. (...) [...] HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.|$|E

5000|$|After {{returning}} to New London via Faslane, Scotland, Trepang was soon deployed to the warmer climes of the Caribbean Sea, departing from New London on 22 April 1971 and subsequently making port at Frederiksted on St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands for weapons <b>systems</b> <b>acceptance</b> and evaluation trials.

5000|$|Continued boiler trouble {{kept the}} guided-missile {{destroyer}} in port, {{save for a}} few local operations, {{for the remainder of}} the year. Then, following a series of tests and inspections, Benjamin Stoddert commenced a major overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 3 January 1980. After five months in drydock, she moved to a berth for continued industrial work; and it was not until 30 November that the guided-missile destroyer got underway for her first sea trials. The crew spent the next five months putting the warship through full power exams, sonar tests, and weapons <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> trials. During the latter, on 31 March 1981, she successfully fired six Standard missiles on the Pacific missile range. The warship then conducted training and other local operations out of Pearl Harbor through the summer and into the fall. On 19 October, she set out for San Francisco, arriving there on the 29th. After a week of liberty, the guided-missile destroyer cruised south to San Diego, mooring at the naval station on 6 November. Benjamin Stoddert then participated in Exercise [...] "ReadiEx 1-82", the highlight of which was a missile firing exercise held on 23 November. Steaming to Hawaii the next day, she moored alongside Jason (AR-8) in Pearl Harbor on 1 December for voyage repairs.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Rail Safety Improvements Act was passed, many {{commuter}} railroads {{chose not to}} develop their own PTC protocol and instead decided to save time and money by using a protocol developed for either freight or long haul passenger (Amtrak) operations. Deploying such a protocol for urban commuter operation, where {{it will be necessary to}} support numerous, small, fast-moving trains, will be a challenge. It remains to be seen whether the performance envelope of PTC protocols developed and optimized for less numerous, slower and/or larger trains can support a more complex operational scenario, such as that of a commuter rail operation, without impacting on-time performance. Detailed and exhaustive protocol simulation testing can ease the risk of problems, however, there are too many variables, especially when the wireless component is considered, to guarantee before hand that under certain worst-case operational profiles in certain locations, train operations will not be impacted. In fact, during <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> testing, such worst-case operational profiles may not even be tested because of the effort involved. One need only consider what it would take to identify the PTC protocol train capacity limitations at each interlocking of a large commuter rail operation when a train is broken down at the interlocking and 10-20 other trains are within communications range of a single wayside location. Such a what-if scenario may be tested at a few interlockings but not at the 30 or more interlockings on a large commuter property.|$|E
5000|$|A {{simplified}} modification to flow {{has been}} {{combined with the}} technology acceptance model (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is model to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoption by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent [...] "intrinsic motivations" [...] by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is construct that {{is grounded in the}} seminal flow literature, yet ironically CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach.|$|E

40|$|Purpose- This study aims {{to develop}} {{theoretical}} framework that links e-government <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> with organizational agility. In addition, provide a solid theoretical landscape {{that is expected}} to stimulate more empirical research into an area relatively ignored by current literature. Design/methodology/approach- an extensive literature review was done to make clear link between e-government <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> popular models and the dimensions of organisational agility. Research limitations/implications- This research lack of the empirical root. Therefore, the proposed framework and its derived hypothesis remain just theoretical assumptions unless someone provide empirical validity for it. In addition, the proposed theoretical framework neither is claimed as comprehensive model nor mutually exclusive, but it represents a simplified model of complex IS phenomena. Practical implications- By focusing on e-government <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> and links it with organisational agility, this research highlights the importance of preparing good marketing strategy directed toward governmental employees to promote individual and organisational benefits of e-government system to ensure high level of usage. It also, assists in preparing excellent e-government strategy that avoid any pitfalls either related to e-government acceptance or e-government service implementation and delivery. Originality/value- This paper represents the first attempt to link e-government <b>system</b> <b>acceptance</b> with organisational agility. In addition, it opens new research venue to gauge the organisational benefits of e-government system implementation. Further, it proposes new theoretical framework that is rooted in the literature which represents an extension to the current literature.

By building on established theories, the ISA model incorporates and organises previous research, overcomes some of the limitations associated with these individual theories, and assembles IS acceptance factors into a comprehensive, understandable and useable conceptual framework. The ISA model gives managers a tool to evaluate and predict the likely success of an IS, and acts as a diagnostic aid in preventing potential problems.
