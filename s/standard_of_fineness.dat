40|$|RESUMEN: Este artículo {{describe}} la difusión universal del real de a ocho desde los siglos XVI al XVIII. Múltiplo del real, la moneda de plata por excelencia de Castilla, esta pieza sirvió de medio de pago en Europa, en el Báltico, en el Mediterráneo Oriental, en el Extremo Oriente y, por supuesto, en el interior del continente americano. El análisis de las causas y consecuencias de su expansión da pie a repasar los flujos internacionales del dinero y el cuadro de la división internacional del trabajo durante la Edad Moderna. Mercaderes y banqueros de todo el mundo respetaban el real de a ocho porque sabían que era una moneda que conservó intactas durante más de siglo y medio sus características intrínsecas, pero la estabilidad de su peso y su ley fueron la causa, precisamente, de su drenaje desde Castilla hacia el exterior. Se concluye que, si bien, desde siempre se ha asociado la moneda fuerte a la hegemonía, poder y prosperidad de una entidad política y que, en líneas generales, Castilla en su cénit no sería una excepción, sin embargo, a diferencia de la libra o del dólar, la moneda española de plata no estuvo respaldada por una economía potente. ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the worldwide spread of a Spanish coin called real de a ocho from the 16 th to the 18 th century. Múltiple of the real (1 real de a 8 equals 8 reales), this typically castilian silver coin {{was used as a}} means of payment in Europe, the Baltic lands, Eastern Mediterranean áreas, the Far East and, of course, the inner American continent. Thanks to an analysis of the causes and consequences of its expansión, it is possible here to review the way money flew internationally and to sketch the international labour división in the early modern period. Merchants and bankers all over the world accepted the real de a ocho because they were aware of its intrinsic features, which had been left untouched {{for more than a century}} and a half. Due to its weight and legal <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>fineness,</b> this coin flew regularly from Castile abroad. Finally although it has been claimed that a valuable coin is always linked to a hegemonic political power and Castile followed this rule to a great extent, we draw the conclusión that the Spanish silver coin was not correlated to a steady economic framework, as was the case with the pound or the dollar. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash on expansion of fly ash-cement mortar in magnesium sulfate solution. Fly ash from the Mae Moh {{power plant in}} Thailand was classified in to three different levels <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> Blaine of 3215, 4440 and 5890 cm 2 /g with a median particle size of 25. 57, 7. 69, and 4. 81 microns, respectively. Fly ash at each level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> was used to replace Portland cement type I and type V at percentages of 0, 20, 30, and 40 by weight of the cementitious material, to cast mortar bars of 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 30 cm 3. Expansion of the fly ash-cement mortar bars, which were immersed in 5 % by weight of magnesium sulfate solution, were measured {{at the age of}} 1 to 540 days. The results showed that the replacement of Portland cement type I and type V by fly ash reduced expansion of the mortar bars. When the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> and same percent of replacement of fly ash were used in the mortar bars, the replacement of Portland cement type V by fly ash produced less expansion than that of Portland cement type I. For the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash, the mortar bars made with 40 % fly ash replacement had less expansion than those made with 20 and 30 % replacement. The mortar bars with 20 - 25 % replacement of fine fly ash (Blaine <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 4440 or 5890 cm 2 /g) and the mortar bars with 40 % replacement of original fly ash (Blain <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 3125 cm 2 /g) had the same expansion. The smaller particle size of fly ash not only reduced expansion of the fly ash-mortar bars but also produced higher strength activity index of mortar than the bigger particle size of fly ash. Therefore, very fine fly ash could be used effectively for reducing the expansion and improving sulfate resistance of mortar...|$|R
