50|$|One such wheel from Spain {{was rescued}} {{and part of}} it is now on display in the British Museum. Some of the {{components}} are numbered, suggesting that it was prefabricated above ground before assembly in the underground passages. In the 1930s, a fragment of a wooden bucket from a drainage wheel was found in deep workings at the Dolaucothi gold mine in west Wales, and is now preserved in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. It has been carbon dated to about 90 AD. From the depth of 160 feet below known open workings, it can be inferred that the drainage wheel was part of a sequence just like that found in Spain. The shape of the edge of one of the <b>lifting</b> <b>buckets</b> is almost identical with that from Spain, suggesting that a template was used to make the devices.|$|R

50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, {{a system of}} pipes brought water to the citadel. However, this made the citadel {{vulnerable}} to siege as an enemy could easily destroy the pipe system. Therefore, in 1692, Vauban had a well cut {{to a depth of}} 132 m through the rock to the water table. A wheel with a diameter of four metres, operated by a man who walked within it, served to <b>lift</b> <b>buckets.</b> Unfortunately, the water turned out to be brackish and undrinkable. Instead, the citadel relied on cisterns that stored rainwater. There was one at the front. The water was still of average quality. The Citadel's chapel is dedicated to Saint Stephen. It was consecrated in 1683 and commemorated the cathedral and cloisters that Vauban demolished when constructing the Royual Front. Vauban included a chapel in each of his fortresses for the garrison to attend Sunday mass. The chapel has an attractive portal adorned with Doric columns but is otherwise simple. Otto I, Count of Burgundy was buried there.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} random knapsack instances described by Chvátal, who showed that with probability going to 1, such instances require an exponential number of branch-and-bound nodes. We show that even {{with the use of}} <b>simple</b> <b>lifted</b> cover inequalities, an exponential number of nodes is required with probability going to 1. It is not surprising that there exist integer programming (IP) instances for which solution by branch-and-bound requires an exponential number of nodes, since integer programming is an NP-complete problem while the linear programs solved at each branch-and-bound node are polynomially solvable. Examples of such instances were given by Jeroslow [5], who presented a set of simple instances of the knapsack problem which require an exponential number of branch-andbound nodes when branching on variables, and by Chvátal [1], who considered a class of random instances of the knapsack problem and showed that with probability converging to 1, such a random instance requires exponentially many branch-and-bound nodes to solve. Most modern IP solvers use branch-and-cut algorithms, which combine branchand-bound with the use of cutting planes. Gu, Nemhauser, and Savelsbergh [4] considered solving the knapsack problem with branch-and-cut. They presented a set of instances that require an exponential number of branch-and-bound nodes even with the addition of <b>simple</b> <b>lifted</b> cover inequalities. More recent work in proving exponential worst-case bounds in the presence of various cutting planes has been done by Dash [2], who proved worst-case exponential bounds in the presence of lift-and-project cuts, Chvátal-Gomory inequalities, and matrix cuts as described by Lovász and Schrijver. The work of Gu et al. and Dash is similar to Jeroslow’s work in that specific “worst-case ” examples are presented. In this paper we build on Chvátal’s results, which are concerned with average-case performance over a class of random instances. We add all <b>simple</b> <b>lifted</b> cover inequalities to his formulation and show that an exponential number of branch-and-bound nodes is required with probability converging to 1. This result is not suggested by the NP-hardness of binary knapsack problems, because cover inequality separation for these problems is NP-hard [6]. ...|$|R

If a dinghy is towed, an extra line with a loop in the end (known as a lazy painter) can be attached to a dinghy so that if the towing line breaks, there is a line to grab with a boat hook.
