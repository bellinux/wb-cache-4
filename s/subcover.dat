40|$|Abstract. In this article, we give {{a way of}} {{constructing}} an unramified Galoiscover of a hyperelliptic curve. The geometric Galois-group is an elementary abelian 2 -group. The construction does not {{make use of the}} embedding of the curve in its Jacobian and it readily displays all <b>subcovers.</b> We show that the cover we construct is isomorphic to the pullback along the multiplication-by- 2 map of an embedding of the curve in its Jacobian. We show that the constructed cover has an abundance of elliptic and hyperelliptic <b>subcovers.</b> This makes this cover especially suited for covering techniques employed for determining the rational points on curves. Especially the hyperelliptic <b>subcovers</b> give a chance for applying the method iteratively, thus creating towers of elementary abelian 2 -covers of hyperelliptic curves. As an application, we determine the rational points on the genus 2 curve arising from the question whether the sum of the first n fourth powers can ever be a square. For this curve, a simple covering step fails, but a second step succeeds. 1...|$|R

We determine {{the exact number of}} rational points of the curves in the class and we characterize maximal (respectively minimal) curves of the class as <b>subcovers</b> of some suitable curves. In particular we show that Coulter's maximal curves are Galois <b>subcovers</b> of the appropriate Hermitian curves...|$|R

40|$|We study degree 2 and 4 {{elliptic}} <b>subcovers</b> of hyperelliptic {{curves of}} genus 3 defined over C. The family of genus 3 hyperelliptic curves {{which have a}} degree 2 cover to an elliptic curve E and degree 4 covers to elliptic curves E_ 1 and E_ 2 is a 2 -dimensional subvariety of the hyperelliptic moduli H_ 3. We determine this subvariety explicitly. For any given moduli point p ∈ H_ 3 we determine explicitly if the corresponding genus 3 curve X belongs or not to such family.
