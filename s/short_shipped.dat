40|$|Current {{projections}} {{show that}} U. S. international trade {{is expected to}} reach nearly two billion tons by 2020, approximately double today's level. With such a large forecasted growth in trade coming through the United States and growing problems associated with highway congestion, air pollution, and national security, building <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> networks will be difficult, but possible, and potentially of great benefit to the nation. By bringing together shipping providers, customers, and with support from the federal government, <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> can become a reality. This paper outlines the need for a change in our maritime transportation system. It {{takes a look at the}} current uses of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> in the United States as well as the system used in Europe. The technology associated with this concept is described and high-speed vessel design is investigated. Issues relating to the integration of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> are brought to light, including customer requirements, capital financing, and government policy. A computer-based simulation model calculates a total cost analysis for two modes of transporting goods, trucking and <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping.</b> The model is applied to a group of products of different size, weight, and value. (cont.) The quantitative results of the model show that in most cases, for lower value products, the savings in transportation costs from <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> offset the increase in inventory costs. These results are then used to look at other commodities listed on the 2002 commodity flow survey to show the potential for <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> use. by Peter H. Connor. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the role of}} <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> within the transportation network in the European Union. It examines the existence of externalities relating to congestion, infrastructure, air pollution, noise, and accidents in the transportation sector. It evaluates the level of these externalities and also their effects on the Community. It then explains current attempts to internalize these factors, or incorporate them into the cost of transportation that the user pays. It concludes that current efforts are lacking and do not produce the most beneficial situation for the citizens of Europe. Consequently, the thesis investigates other possible methods of internalization that may produce more advantageous results and analyzes their possible effects on the transportation sector. The value of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> is examined {{in regards to the}} previously mentioned externalities. It concludes that, {{with the exception of the}} emission of sulfur dioxide, maritime transportation outperforms other modes of transportation by producing relatively few external effects. (cont.) The current status of the <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> industry is then described, followed by a discussion of intermodal transportation and the initiative within the European Community to increase the use of intermodal transportation. Two case studies are then reviewed, which demonstrate the economy of intermodal transportation solutions compared to all-road alternatives. The thesis concludes by summarizing the benefits of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping.</b> Some of the obstacles which prevent the realization of the full potential of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> are discussed. Suggestions for improving the current situation are included as well as a description of some of the measures adopted by the European Commission to increase the use of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> as an alternative to road transportation. by Goksel Tenekecioglu.

40|$|Transport by road is {{the most}} {{dominant}} mode of transportation in Europe today. An increased use of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> can balance the European transport system and contribute to a better environmental situation. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify and explore some characteristics of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> and to find general logistic weaknesses in the concept. By using a total logistic management approach, this study shows how <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> is a competitive option with high environmental performance. We present a comparative study between different modes of transportation. A fictitious case of transportation of cargo between the Lake Vänern area in Sweden and Duisburg in Germany is set up and evaluated. The intermodal network between these two regions includes road, rail and shipping. The logistic quality of the total transport chain is measured as a weighted sum of performance parameters such as transport time, transport cost, frequency and flexibility, reliability, logistic management and service, environmental impact and political acceptability. The scope of the study is narrow, but by employing systems engineering techniques, interesting conclusions regarding a strengthened role of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> in a future European transport system has been made possible...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a {{substantial}} volume of research on <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> and related national maritime transport regulation. In spite of significant support for the policy of growing the volume of <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> in Europe, and the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation within NAFTA in 2003, there has not been the level of adoption by cargo interests or shipping lines expected. In Australia, where the regulatory environment is somewhat different from Europe or North America, the industry is more focused on the bulk sector and the Rudd Government is contemplating an agenda of maritime reform. This situation presents an opportunity to build an understanding of why, how and whether <b>short</b> sea <b>shipping</b> works, and, in particular, what lessons from the Australian experience might apply to the Canadian and/or North American context and vice versa.
