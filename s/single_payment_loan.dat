40|$|Investments in {{productive}} assets by broad-based black {{economic empowerment}} (BEE) enterprises in South Africa (SA) during the 1990 s have been constrained, in part, {{by a lack}} of access to capital. Even if capital can be sourced, BEE businesses often face a liquidity problem, as conventional, equally amortized loan repayment plans do {{not take into account the}} size and timing of investment returns, or there are lags in the adjustment of management to such new investments. This paper describes five alternative loan products to the conventional equally amortized loan: the <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> non-amortized loan; the decreasing payment loan; the partial payment loan; the graduated payment loan; and the deferred <b>payment</b> <b>loan.</b> Recent SA experience with the graduated <b>payment</b> <b>loan</b> and the deferred <b>payment</b> <b>loan</b> suggests that there is scope to alleviate the liquidity problem if a wholesaler of funds can offer such terms to private banks and venture capital investors who then on-lend to finance BEE asset investments that are otherwise considered relatively high credit risks. This would shift the liquidity problem away from the client to the wholesaler of the funds, but requires access to capital at favourable interest rates. Such capital could be sourced from empowerment funds earmarked by the private sector, donors and government. Financial Economics,...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a simple}} {{graphical}} model we analyze {{the effects of the}} <b>single</b> <b>payment</b> scheme (SPS), introduced in the EU in 2003 on land prices and the distribution of rents. In par-ticular, we are interested in if the <b>single</b> <b>payments</b> are capitalized into agricultural land values. All three different ways to implement the SPS are discussed: the historical model, the regional model and the hybrid model. We show that the outcome crucially depends on the proportion of eligible agricultural area to entitlements and which model is in place.

The aims {{of the study were}} to enable the Department of Social Security (DSS) to assess {{the extent to which the}} social fund is achieving its objectives, principally that help is being targeted on the areas of greatest need; to establish whether there are areas of need which ought to be met by the social fund; the effect of the budget on meeting those needs, whether changes are necessary in the directions and guidance and whether changes are required in the division of the budgets between loans and grants. Main Topics : The DSS interest was in the discretionary budget limited elements of the fund including crisis loans, budgeting loans and community care grants. The research was required to cover successful applicants for loans and grants, unsuccessful applicants for loans and grants, people receiving income support who had not applied for help to the fund and people on low incomes not receiving income support. The questions to be tackled by the research included: What was the nature and extent of the needs for lump sum payments? What degree of help was provided by the fund to help meet those needs? What help was provided by other quarters? What was their previous history of supplementary benefit <b>single</b> <b>payments?</b> How did <b>loan</b> applicants cope with repayments? What alternative strategies were adopted by unsuccessful applicants/non applicants; how did they cope? What is the general attitude of applicants/non applicants to the social fund; what led them to turn to (not to turn to) it for help? How were they treated by the local office; what did they think of the application procedure? How has the discretion been applied locally on individual cases and in relation to priority setting? What local differences does this give rise to in the approach to a case...|$|R
