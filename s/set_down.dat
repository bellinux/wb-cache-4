5|$|Achievements in gliding {{have been}} marked by the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards <b>set</b> <b>down</b> by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
5|$|Committees {{comprise}} {{a small number}} of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament. There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory Committees are committees which are <b>set</b> <b>down</b> under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings. The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} round of Wimbledon, she was drawn against the No. 10 seed Maria Kirilenko, whom she beat in {{straight}} sets. She beat world No. 117, Mariana Duque, in the second round on Centre Court. In the third round, she came from a <b>set</b> <b>down</b> to beat Marina Erakovic to progress to the last 16 where she was beaten by Kaia Kanepi. Her performance pushed her up to 27 in the world, the first Briton in the top 30 since Jo Durie in 1987.|$|E

Their details and {{practical}} application, however, are <b>set</b> <b>down</b> in the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests for man's obedience, while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons.|$|E

5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the claimant (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort <b>set</b> <b>down</b> in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a <b>set</b> <b>down</b> to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|From 1872 to 1894 {{the station}} was served by two {{passenger}} trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day.

Limited by poor quality locomotives and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of the}} hills, and stopping at three intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and <b>set</b> <b>down</b> goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains took between 35 and 45 minutes to travel from Wotton to Brill, and around an hour from Wotton to the junction station with the main line at Quainton Road.|$|E

5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also <b>set</b> <b>down</b> in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E
5|$|Limited by {{poor quality}} {{locomotives}} and ungraded, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of}} the hills, and stopping at four intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and <b>set</b> <b>down</b> goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly. In 1887 trains took between 15 and 20 minutes to travel approximately one mile from Wood Siding to Brill, and a little over 1hour20minutes from Wood Siding to the junction station with the main line at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out {{at the time of the}} transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Wood Siding to Quainton Road to about 30 minutes.|$|E

A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin <b>set</b> <b>down</b> to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E

The purpose of implied terms is often to supplement a contractual agreement in the interest of making the deal effective for the purpose of business, to achieve fairness between the parties or to relieve hardship.|$|R

5|$|Many {{different}} versions of the events were <b>set</b> <b>down</b> and distributed due to the excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is generally considered to be that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} Russian {{settlements in}} what is today the US state of Alaska were <b>set</b> <b>down</b> in the 1790s, forming Russian Alaska, after Tsar Peter I called for expeditions across the Bering Strait in 1725, with the region administered {{by the head of}} the Russian-American Company as the Emperor's representative. Another Russian outpost, Fort Ross, was established in 1812 {{in what is}} now California. The colonies, however, were never profitable enough to maintain Russian interest in the area, with the population only ever reaching a maximum of 700. Fort Ross was sold in 1841, and in 1867, a deal was brokered whereby Tsar Alexander II sold his Alaskan territory to the United States for $7,200,000, and the official transfer took place on 30 October that year.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{surviving}} theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion {{from any of}} the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly <b>set</b> <b>down</b> in writing his theories of art, followed by Lucas de Heere in 1565 and Karel van Mander in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include Cyriacus Ancona in 1449, Bartolomeo Facio in 1456, and Giovanni Santi in 1482.|$|E
