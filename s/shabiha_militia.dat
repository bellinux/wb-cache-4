25|$|On 1 June 2012, President Assad {{vowed to}} crush the anti-government uprising. On 5 June 2012, {{fighting}} broke out in Haffa and nearby villages in the coastal governorate of Latakia Governorate. Government forces were backed by helicopter gunships in the heaviest clashes in the governorate since the revolt began. Syrian forces seized the territory following days of fighting and shelling. On 6 June, 78 civilians {{were killed in the}} Al-Qubeir massacre. According to activist sources, government forces started by shelling the village before the <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> moved in. UN observers headed to Al-Qubeir in the hope of investigating the massacre, but they were met with a roadblock and small arms fire and were forced to retreat.|$|E
50|$|British {{newspaper}} Sunday Times and pan-Arab network Al-Arabiya {{have reported}} on <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> stealing Roman antiquities {{and selling them}} {{on the black market}} in Syria and Lebanon.|$|E
50|$|Sources {{close to}} the family said that they {{believed}} he was kidnapped by <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia,</b> a group loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. He was later reportedly held in a Syrian Air Force Intelligence complex in Damascus.|$|E
5000|$|A {{resident}} {{claimed that}} <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militias</b> were targeting the Sunni inhabitants, assuring that [...] "The city of Talkalakh is empty of people. Most {{of them have}} fled to Lebanon,". The remainder of its Sunni residents continued protesting against the government and attacking nearby Alawite neighbourhoods in the city, as to show their anger against the rule of Bashar al-Assad and his Alawite-dominated government, and their determination to topple the Alawite-dominated government.|$|R
50|$|Resident of {{the city}} {{meanwhile}} said to press that city of Douma, on suburbs of Damascus, had become effectively ghost city, with most of its 200,000 population forced to flee {{as a result of}} rebel seizing with consequent army shelling. He also reported hearing {{for more than a week}} explosions from shelling in Harasta suburb, what resulted in collapse of ordinary life in Damascus. Security forces enforced unofficial curfew after 7 or 8pm when <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militias</b> arrest anyone wandering around the streets.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Syrian uprising against the government, any civilian or protester injured by the regime forces, army or <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militias</b> will have to be treated by volunteer medics or doctors in improvised sites, houses or dedicated shift clinics. Equipping and hiding field treatment locations {{has been one of the}} most threatening and resources consuming task during the uprising. The government security forces in a number of occasions used local paid informants to locate and destroy treatment locations equipped by the SRCU.|$|R
5000|$|Activists, and witnesses, {{stated that}} scores of civilians, {{including}} children, {{had been killed}} by <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> and security forces, while the Syrian government said that nine people {{had been killed by}} [...] "terrorists". It was further claimed by the Syrian National Council that 35 of the people killed were from the same Al Yatim family {{and more than half of}} them women and children.|$|E
50|$|An Alawite resident, {{from the}} nearby town of Masyaf, blamed the attack on rebels stating that they did not believe there was a massacre, but that they thought the rebels were holding a number of hostages. According to him, the clashes started when the rebels shelled a <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> {{checkpoint}} in the town. In contrast, a rebel claimed that the Syrian army shelled a house where between 200 and 500 Alawites were hiding in.|$|E
5000|$|The kidnappers {{had talked}} [...] "openly about {{their loyalty to}} the government" [...] of Syrian {{president}} Assad, and {{that they wanted to}} exchange them for four Iranian agents and two Lebanese member of the Amal Movement. He said he therefore had [...] "a very good idea" [...] about who his captors were: members of the <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia,</b> who are loyal to Assad, trained by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and allied with Lebanon-based Hezbollah group.|$|E
25|$|As the Syrian economy opened up, Muhammad {{adopted a}} more legal persona, entered {{business}} {{and bought a}} PhD for himself, though kept his criminial network and fief around Qardaha. After {{the outbreak of the}} civil war in 2011, Muhammad led the recruitment of new members for <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militias</b> in Latakia. According to an opposition source, Muhammad and his men committed various unspecified atrocities in course of the conflict, causing frictions among the powerful Alawite families of Latakia. Many clans feared possible rebel reprisals due to the actions of the Shabiha, and in October 2012 this reportedly caused an armed dispute between Muhammad {{and a member of the}} Khayyir family.|$|R
50|$|The shabiha guards, {{who each}} had loyalty to {{different}} {{members of the}} extended Assad family, were untouchable and operated with impunity from the local authorities. They gained notoriety in the 1990s for the brutal way they enforced their protection rackets in Latakia and were noted for their cruelty and blind devotion to their leaders. By the mid-1990s, they {{had gotten out of}} hand, and President Hafez Assad had his son Basil Assad clamp down on them, which he did successfully. In 2000, when Bashar Assad came to power, they were apparently disbanded, but following the uprising that began in March 2011, the shabiha gangs, which evolved into the <b>shabiha</b> <b>militias,</b> were again approved by Assad's government.|$|R
50|$|As deserted {{government}} {{soldiers had}} no armored vehicles and only light weaponry and munitions, FSA in August-October 2011 mostly ambushed {{security forces and}} the state's <b>Shabiha</b> (ghost) <b>militia,</b> and attacked trucks and buses bringing in security reinforcements by planting bombs or with hit-and-run attacks, but seldom confronted other regular army soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Witnesses said <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> {{forces from}} {{neighboring}} Alawite villages, entered the town around 7 pm, shortly after nightfall. Some were wearing uniform, {{while others were}} wearing casual civilian clothing. The men proceeded to loot homes {{for the next five}} hours, killing many civilians as they moved from house to house. In some cases, gunmen herded whole families into rooms and sprayed them with bullets. Satellite images showed a large Syrian military contingent 1.5 km southeast of the massacre site.|$|E
5000|$|The Al-Qubeir {{massacre}} (مجزرة القبير), {{also known}} as the Hama massacre, occurred in the small village of Al-Qubeir near Hama, Syria, on 6 June 2012 during the country's ongoing civil conflict. Al-Qubeir is described as a Sunni farming settlement surrounded by Alawite villages in the central province of Hama. According to preliminary evidence, troops had surrounded the village which was followed by pro-government <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> entering the village and killing civilians with [...] "barbarity," [...] UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the UN Security Council.|$|E
50|$|On 19 August, American {{journalist}} James Foley {{was executed}} by ISIL, who {{claimed it was}} {{in retaliation for the}} United States operations in Iraq. Foley was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 by <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia.</b> ISIL also threatened to execute Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped at the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013. There were reports ISIS captured a Japanese national, two Italian nationals, and a Danish national as well. At least 70 journalists have been killed covering the Syrian war, and more than 80 kidnapped, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
50|$|According to some {{residents}} of Tamana al-Ghab, the village has been mostly {{abandoned in the}} summer of 2012 after attacks by the <b>shabiha,</b> a pro-government <b>militia</b> taking part in the ongoing Syrian civil war.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} January 2012, it was {{reported}} by Reuters that over 5,000 civilians and protesters (including armed militants) {{had been killed by}} the Syrian army, security agents and <b>militia</b> (<b>Shabiha),</b> while 1,100 people had been killed by [...] "terrorist armed forces".|$|R

5000|$|In late September 2012, {{during the}} Syrian civil war, {{the deputy chief}} of staff of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA), Arif al-Hamud, stated that during a battle between rebels and pro-government forces in Darat Izza, near Aleppo, FSA fighters killed around 40 alleged members of the <b>shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> from Wadi al-'Uyun. In early October 2012, the pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq al-Awsat {{reported}} that clashes had taken place in Wadi al-'Uyun between its Alawite residents and government forces. The report quoted opposition activists who stated the town's residents were angry with the government for the burial of several of its men who had died [...] "in recent events."

5000|$|On 28 March, {{government}} loyalists attacked Saraqib, reportedly killing 21 local residents. Army defectors attacked two security {{posts in}} Idlib Province, killing 13 soldiers. Also on 28 March, {{it was reported}} that two British journalists of Algerian descent, Nassim Terreri and Walid Bledi, were killed by the pro-government <b>militia</b> <b>Shabiha.</b> Details emerged on a third journalist being injured in the shoulder and driven to Turkey for treatment. The freelance journalists were on the border with Turkey in Idlib province and were filming a documentary about refugees fleeing the violence. The committee to protect journalists, or CJP, interviewed local witnesses who said that the two journalists initially escaped the targeted shooting in the town of Darkush, but were killed when they went back to retrieve equipment after the shooting had stopped. A witness said that the army later took the journalists' bodies away. Mohamed Abdel Dayem, CPJ's Middle East and north Africa programme coordinator said the deaths were [...] "yet another illustration of the grave dangers that journalists face in reporting a conflict that the Syrian government has sought to hide from the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Alawite sect of Islam has {{the second}} highest {{religious}} following in the Syrian Arab Republic and remains {{at the heart of}} the Syrian Government grassroot support, however in April 2016 Alawite leaders released a document seeking to distance themselves from both Assad and Shia Islam. Incidents of sectarianism amongst the Sunni population have been said to be rooted in that both Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad are Alawites, a minority fundamentalist Sunnis see as heretics. Additionally, the Syrian government maintains a network known as the <b>shabiha,</b> a shadow <b>militia</b> that anti-government activists allege are prepared to use force, violence, weapons and racketeering, whose members primarily consist of Alawites. Iranian provides training and equipping of Shia militants from Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan to fight with various sectarian Sunni militias in Syria, [...] as well as alleged Syrian Government coordination with the Houthi of Yemen. Minorities such as the Druze and Ismailis have refused to join these militias or be associated with the government, with even some Alawites and Christians who are openly pro-government also refusing to join these militias or serve their conscription terms.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 March, the Syrian Army shelled {{the city}} briefly while leading a ground assault {{at the same}} time. A column of tanks entered the city to attack the {{defenses}} of the rebels, while infantry backed by snipers led the second wave to pursue the remaining fighters. [...] The Free Syrian Army fighters fought back the first day and damaged a tank. In the fighting 18 of them were killed. After the first day, the rebels were forced {{to withdraw from the}} city after the army took full control of it. An opposition group accused the army of burning most of the shops in the town and called for observers to come in the city. After the battle, security forces and <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> searched for suspected rebels and captured at least 24 and executed them.|$|E
50|$|From inside Syria, {{a citizen}} {{journalist}} Musaab al Arabi reported two independent journalists were killed {{while attempting to}} reach the town of Darkush {{with a group of}} 50 others. This was confirmed by other reports from inside Syria. The two were covering the refugees who were fleeing. The house they were staying in was attacked by the <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> who are backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The journalists fled the scene when the shooting began, but soon returned to pick up equipment left behind. When they returned they were shot to death. One was shot in the head, and the other in the chest. A third and unidentified journalist was also shot at the scene. A conflicting report claimed the two journalists were killed as they were passing through the border into Turkey. The third journalist was taken to Antakya, Syria for medical treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Around 5 December, 61 {{people were}} {{reported}} to be dead, 34 Sunnis and 27 Alawites. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said an activist on the ground reported seeing [...] "the bodies of 34 civilians, in a square in the pro-regime neighbourhood of Al-Zahra, who had been abducted by the <b>shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> on Monday", according to the AFP news agency. The civilians, the group said, had been seized from several [...] "anti-regime neighbourhoods" [...] in Homs, probably meaning Bab Amr. The Observatory also reported the [...] "shabiha" [...] abducted a bus driver and his 13 passengers in Homs province on the 5th. Both sides blamed {{each other for the}} killings, but both the pro- and anti-government forces stated that each side had enough motive for the killings of the Sunnis and the Alawites, showing the beginning of possible sectarian violence in the conflict.|$|E
50|$|On 17 August 2014, SOHR {{said that}} {{in the past two weeks}} ISIL jihadists had killed over 700 tribal members in oil-rich Deir ez-Zor Governorate. On 19 August, Abu Abdullah al-Iraqi, a senior figure in ISIL who had helped prepare and plan car and suicide bombs across Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq was killed. Some reports said that he was killed by Hezbollah fighters. There were also several reports that he was killed by the Syrian Army in the Qalamoun region, near the border with Lebanon. On 19 August, American {{journalist}} James Foley was executed by ISIL, who claimed it was in retaliation for the United States operations in Iraq. Foley was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 by <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia.</b> ISIL also threatened to execute Steven Sotloff, who was kidnapped at the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013.

5000|$|... U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. {{special envoy}} to Syria, Kofi Annan, {{described}} the attack as an [...] "appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force which is a flagrant violation {{of international law and}} of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms". They called on the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in densely populated areas, and they reiterated the call for all sides to cease violence. On May 28, U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the killing of at least 108 people and confirmed that massacre took place amid [...] "series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood", which the Syrian government denied just hours before. The UN Human Rights Commission report of August 2012 stated that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and other atrocities were [...] "state policy" [...] and claimed Assad's forces and allied <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> were involved at the highest levels in [...] "gross violation of international human rights".|$|E
5000|$|The Free Syrian Army on {{the local}} level engages and ambushes the state's <b>shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> and confronts the army during which it {{encourages}} defections. Some members of the Free Syrian Army have stated that the organization does not have the resources to occupy and take control of territories, and instead relies primarily on hit and run attacks to prompt the Syrian army into withdrawing. The FSA also uses improvised explosive devices to attack military convoys of buses, trucks and tanks that are transporting supplies and security reinforcements and engages in attack and retreat operations on government checkpoints. In neighborhoods opposed to the government, the FSA has acted as a defense force, guarding streets while protests take place and attacking the militias, known as shabiha, which {{are an integral part of}} the government's efforts to suppress dissent. In Deir ez-Zor, Al-Rastan, Abu Kamal and other cities the Free Syrian Army, however, engaged in street battles that raged for days with no particular side gaining the advantage. The FSA has also sought international help in bringing down the Assad government. It has asked the international community for arms and the implementation of a no fly zone and naval blockade of Syria ...|$|E
5000|$|The Houla {{massacre}} (مجزرة الحولة) was {{an attack}} that took place on May 25, 2012, {{in the midst of}} the Syrian Civil War, in the town of Taldou, in the Houla Region of Syria, a string of towns northwest of Homs. According to the United Nations, 108 people were killed, including 34 women and 49 children. While a small proportion of the deaths appeared to have resulted from artillery and tank rounds used against Taldou, the U.N. later announced that most of the massacre's victims had been [...] "summarily executed in two separate incidents". UN investigators have reported that some witnesses and survivors stated that the massacre was committed by pro-government Shabiha. [...] In August 2012 UN investigators released a report which stated that it was likely that Syrian troops and <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> were responsible for the massacre, concluding that: [...] "On the basis of available evidence, the commission has a reasonable basis to believe that the perpetrators of the deliberate killing of civilians, at both the Abdulrazzak and Al-Sayed family locations, were aligned to the Government. It rests this conclusion on its understanding of access to the crime sites, the loyalties of the victims, the security layout in the area including the position of the government’s water authority checkpoint and the consistent testimonies of victims and witnesses with direct knowledge of the events. This conclusion is bolstered by the lack of credible information supporting other possibilities." ...|$|E
40|$|When the dictatorial {{regimes of}} Tunisia and Egypt were toppled by popular unrest few {{expected}} Syria to follow. Despite suffering under dictatorship for over 40 years and facing similar {{economic and social}} challenges that had prompted rebellion elsewhere, Syrians appeared to support their young president, Bashar al-Assad, who had cultivated an image as a populist anti-western moderniser. When protests did eventually reach Syria in March 2011, in the southern town of Deraa, they called on Assad to reform not resign. Yet any faith in Assad as a reformer soon evaporated. His security forces responded with live fire, killing hundreds in Deraa and elsewhere, while the president offered only piecemeal reforms. The regime fashioned a narrative that protests were led by criminal armed gangs, intent on stirring up sectarian divisions within Syria’s heterogeneous population. Yet in these early stages it was mostly regime-backed <b>Shabiha</b> <b>militia</b> from Assad’s own Alawi sect that were responsible for any violence, while most protestors remained peaceful and inclusive. Tragically, as regime violence continued and protests spread, with over 9, 000 deaths in the first year, that narrative became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not only have some taken up arms against Assad, but sectarianism is increasing, with the Alawi {{community as a whole}} blamed for Assad’s excesses...|$|E
