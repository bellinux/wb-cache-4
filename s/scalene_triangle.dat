2500|$|Hatch marks, {{also called}} tick marks, {{are used in}} {{diagrams}} of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths. A side can be marked with a pattern of [...] "ticks", short line segments {{in the form of}} tally marks; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern. In a triangle, the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks. An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 sides, an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 sides, and a <b>scalene</b> <b>triangle</b> has different patterns on all sides since no sides are equal. Similarly, patterns of 1, 2, or 3 concentric arcs inside the angles are used to indicate equal angles.

Menelaus of Alexandria (c. 100 AD) pioneered spherical trigonometry through Menelaus' theorem. The most complete and influential trigonometric work of antiquity is the Almagest of Ptolemy (c.
