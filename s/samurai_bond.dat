2500|$|Issuing bonds {{denominated}} {{in foreign}} currencies also gives issuers {{the ability to}} access investment capital available in foreign markets. The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds {{can be used by}} companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds {{can also be used to}} hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the [...] "samurai bond". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a <b>samurai</b> <b>bond,</b> issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law.

5000|$|<b>Samurai</b> <b>Bond</b> Market {{was opened}} in 1970 when the Japanese Ministry of Finance {{authorized}} supranational and highly rated foreign government entities to issue Samurai bonds within certain size and maturity restrictions. [...] The market opened due to growing Japanese {{foreign currency reserves}} during late 60’s. The exchange rate of the yen {{at that time was}} fixed at 360 yen per US dollar. It was revalued to 308 yen in 1971 and moved to a floating rate system in February 1973. [...] To discourage foreign exchange pressure, the Japanese government decided to open capital market allowing foreign entities to issue yen-denominated bonds. However, at the time the market opened, only governmental entities could issue bonds. The Blue chip corporations were allowed to issue <b>Samurai</b> <b>bond</b> later in 1978.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, a {{liberalization}} {{step was}} taken to reduce the required minimum credit rating from double A to single A. In 1991, the minimum rating requirement for foreign governments, central banks, and foreign government-guaranteed institutions was lowered to triple-B. [...] In January 1996, Samurai market eliminated the minimum requirement for credit rating, increasing private sector share of the <b>Samurai</b> <b>bond</b> market.|$|E
5000|$|The Asian Development Bank {{issued the}} first <b>Samurai</b> <b>bond</b> in November 1970. The issue amount was 6 billion yen with a 7-year maturity, and the bond was {{accepted}} {{very well in}} the market. [...] At first, Asian Development Bank and other high credit supranational issuers were given an access priority to the market. [...] To control stream of issuance, these special criteria were established. Those who were unable to meet eligibility criteria could finance yen through yen-denominated private placement bonds. They were permitted to target a restricted number of institutional investments, and terms and liquidity were under close control. In 1972 the first non-Japanese 10 billion yen bond was issued by Australia. In 1979, Sears made the first corporate <b>Samurai</b> <b>bond</b> issue for 20 billion yen. [...] At that time, Samurai market gradually became accessible to more issuers through the alleviation of eligibility criteria, which now required minimum credit ratings, and through liberalization of new kinds of bonds. [...] In addition, Samurai bonds provided an opportunity of issuing in two different currencies, as well as interest and principal were paid in ether of these currencies.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>samurai</b> <b>bond</b> is a yen-denominated bond {{issued in}} Tokyo by non-Japanese companies, and {{is subject to}} Japanese regulations. [...] These bonds provide the issuer with an access to Japanese capital, {{which can be used}} for local {{investments}} or for financing operations outside Japan. [...] Foreign borrowers may want to issue in Samurai market to hedge against foreign currency exchange risk. [...] Another intention may be simultaneously exchanging the issue into another currency, in order to take advantage of lower costs. [...] Lower costs may result from investor preferences that differ across segmented markets or from temporary market conditions that differentially affect the swaps and bond markets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{eligibility}} criteria for issuing <b>Samurai</b> <b>bonds</b> were not loosened until April 1985. [...] When examining applications from potential samurai issuers, the Ministry of Finance considered {{the tendency of}} the Japanese capital account balance and the liquidity in the country’s economy. For the actual issuance of <b>Samurai</b> <b>bonds,</b> the Japanese Ministry of Finance set a quota per quarter year, and employed a queue system. [...] Borrowers, if they agreed upon the terms of underwriting, entered the quota by rotation {{from the top of}} the queue. [...] In 1998, the Ministry of Finance’s close regulatory control was annulled.|$|R

In 1988, LTCB acquired Greenwich Capital Markets, a Connecticut-based securities firm, thus giving LTCB a US-based securities business.

40|$|This paper quantifies the {{economic}} impact of changes in U. S. monetary policy on emerging market countries. We explore empirically how country risk, as proxied by sovereign bond spreads, is influenced by U. S. monetary policy, country-specific fundamentals, and conditions in global capital markets. In addition, we simulate the direct effects of a tightening in U. S. monetary policy on economic conditions in developing countries. While country-specific fundamentals are important in explaining fluctuations in country risk, the stance and predictability of U. S. monetary policy are also important for stabilizing capital flows and capital market conditions and fostering economic growth in developing countries.

40|$|Many {{official}} {{groups have}} endorsed the wider use by emerging market borrowers of contract clauses which {{allow for a}} qualified majority of bondholders to restructure repayment terms {{in the event of}} financial distress. Some have argued that such clauses will be associated with moral hazard and increased borrowing costs. This paper addresses this question empirically using primary and secondary market yields and finds no evidence that the presence of collective action clauses increases yields for either higher- or lower-rated issuers. By implication, the perceived benefits from easier restructuring are at least as large as any costs from increased moral hazard.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of foreign {{underwriting}} activity on bond markets using issue level data in the Japanese "Samurai" and euro-yen bond markets. Firms choosing Japanese underwriters tend to be Japanese, riskier, and smaller. We find that Japanese underwriting fees, while higher overall on average, are actually lower after conditioning for issuer characteristics. Moreover, firms tend to sort properly in their choice of underwriter, in the sense that a switch in underwriter nationality would be predicted to result in an increase in underwriting fees. Finally, we conduct a matching exercise to examine the 1995 liberalization of foreign access to the "Samurai" bond market, using yen-denominated issues in the euro-yen market as a control. Foreign entry led to a statistically and economically significant decrease in underwriting fees in the <b>Samurai</b> <b>bond</b> market, as spreads fell by an average of 23 basis points. Overall, our results suggest that the market for underwriting services is partially segmented by nationality, as issuers appear to have preferred habitats, but entry increases market competition.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of foreign {{underwriting}} activity using issue-level data in the Japanese “Samurai ” and euro-yen markets over the period from 1992 to 2001. We find that the firms in these markets who chose Japanese underwriters over their foreign counterparts tended to be Japanese, riskier, smaller, seasoned, and collateralized. We then examine the determinants of underwriting fees. While our data confirms that Japanese underwriters charged higher fees and spreads on average, we find that after conditioning for issuer characteristics, the residual charges of Japanese underwriters were actually lower than those of their foreign competitors. However, using the endogenous switching regression technique to account for the endogeneity of issuer choice, we find that firms tended to choose the proper nationality of underwriter, in the sense that switching from a Japanese underwriter to a foreign one, or vice versa, would be predicted on average to result in an increase in underwriting fees. Finally, we examine {{the impact of}} the 1996 liberalization of foreign access to the “Samurai ” bond market. We conduct a matching exercise, using yen-denominated issues in the euro-yen market as a control sample. We find that deregulation led to a statistically and economically significant decrease in underwriting fees in the <b>Samurai</b> <b>bond</b> market...|$|E
40|$|Currency {{mismatches}} {{in corporate}} balance sheets have {{been singled out}} as an important factor underlying the severity of recent financial crises. We propose several structural models for measuring default risk for firms with currency mismatches in their asset/liability structure. The proposed models {{can be adapted to}} different exchange rate regimes, are analytically tractable, and can be estimated using available equity price and balance sheet data. The paper provides a detailed explanation on how to calibrate the models and discusses two applications to financial surveillance: the measurement of systematic risk in the corporate sector and the estimation of prudential leverage ratios consistent with regulatory capital ratios in the banking sector.

We consider both {{external and}} domestic retructurings. Haircuts are computed as the percentage {{difference between the}} present values {{of old and new}} instruments, discounted at the yield prevailing immediately after the exchange. We find average haircuts ranging from 13 percent (Uruguay external exchange) to 73 percent (2005 Argentina exchange). We also find within-exchange variations in haircuts, depending on the instrument tendered.
