50|$|In {{a public}} key {{signature}} system, {{a person can}} combine a message with a private key to create a short digital signature on the message. Anyone with the corresponding public key can combine a message, a putative digital signature on it, and a known public key to verify whether the signature was valid—made by {{the owner of the}} corresponding private key. Changing the message, even replacing a single letter, will cause verification to fail: in a <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> system, it is computationally infeasible for anyone who does not know the private key to deduce it from the public key or from any number of signatures, or to find a valid signature on any message for which a signature has not hitherto been seen. Thus the authenticity of a message can be demonstrated by the signature, provided the owner of the private key keeps the private key secret.|$|E
40|$|We {{show how}} to {{construct}} an existentially unforgeable <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> scheme from any scheme satisfies only a weak notion of security in the standard model. This construction method combines a weakly <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> and a one-time signature. However, key generation of the resulted fully <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> {{is the same as}} the key generation of weak signature. Therefore the length of the public key in our fully <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> is independent of that of the one-time signature. Our conversion from a weakly <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> scheme to an existentially unforgeable <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> scheme is simple, efficient and provably secure in the standard model (that is, security of the resulting scheme does not rely on the random oracle model). Our results yield a new construction of existentially unforgeable <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> in the standard model.

Hence, our schemes outperform the previous tree-based forward <b>secure</b> <b>signature</b> scheme by Bellare and Miner in the key generation and key update time, which are only constant in the number of time periods. Specifically, we describe a straightforward scheme following from the encryption scheme, and then improve its efficiency for signature verification algorithm which needs only 3 pairing computations independent of the total time periods. ...|$|E

We also study quantum algorithms related to the underlying code-based assumption. Finally, we apply our reduction to a concrete example: the SURF signature scheme.
