Characterization of soil contaminants {{is needed in}} northern Canada due to increased gardening and agricultural food security initiatives {{and the presence of}} known point sources of pollution. Design. A field study was conducted in the western James Bay Region of Ontario, Canada, to examine the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (SDDT), other organochlorines, and metals/metalloids in potentially contaminated agriculture <b>sites.</b> Methods. <b>Exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> were assessed by comparing the estimated daily intake to acceptable daily intake values. Ninety soil samples were collected at random (grid sampling) from 3 plots (A, B, and C) in Fort Albany (on the mainland), subarctic Ontario, Canada. The contaminated-soil samples were analysed by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Results. The range of SDDT in 90 soil samples was below the limit of detection to 4. 19 mg/kg.

40|$|This Annual Site Environmental Report for 1998 {{describes}} the environmental conditions related to work performed for the Department of Energy (DOE) at Area IV of the Rocketdyne Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) and De Soto facilities. In the past, these operations included development, fabrication, and disassembly of nuclear reactors, reactor fuel, and other radioactive materials, under the Atomics International (AI) Division. Other activities included {{the operation of}} large-scale liquid metal facilities for testing of liquid metal fast breeder components at the Energy Technology Engineering Center (ETEC), a government-owned company-operated, test facility within Area IV. AI was merged into Rocketdyne in 1984 {{and many of the}} AI functions were transferred to existing Rocketdyne departments. All nuclear work was terminated in 1988, and subsequently, all radiological work has been directed toward decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) of the previously used nuclear facilities and associated site areas. Large-scale D and D activities of the sodium test facilities began in 1996. Results of the radiological monitoring program for the calendar year of 1998 continue to indicate that there are no significant releases of radioactive material from Rocketdyne <b>sites.</b> All potential <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> are sampled and/or monitored, including air, soil, surface water, groundwater, and direct radiation.

Conclusions: Exposure analyses showed that the human risk was below regulatory thresholds. However, the ΣDDT concentration in Plot A exceeded soil guidelines set out by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment of 0. 7 mg/kg, and thus the land should not be used for agricultural or recreational purposes. Both Plots B and C were below threshold limits, and this land can be used for agricultural purposes...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 40 {{million people}} live within a 4 -mile radius of waste sites that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has {{assessed}} to date. Human populations living {{in the vicinity of}} such sites are often subjected to complex chemical exposures that may contribute to the total body burden of oxogenous chemicals. Apart from the contaminants found at waste <b>sites,</b> <b>exposure</b> may also include environmental, occupational, and personal agents. Concurrent exposure to chemicals such as welding fumes, indoor air pollutants, tobacco smoke, alcohol, and prescription and nonprescription drugs makes the health assessment of <b>exposure</b> to waste <b>site</b> chemicals a more complex task. Voluntary exposures such as these frequently entail exposures to relatively high chemical concentrations and can usually be well defined and quantified. Conversely, involuntary <b>exposures</b> from waste <b>sites</b> may be at low concentrations and hence difficult to characterize and quantify.

40|$|Integrated {{management}} of municipal and hazardous waste {{is one of}} the challenges facing the new municipalities in South Africa, especially those located in previously disadvantaged rural areas. However, much of the research on solid and hazardous waste management in South Africa has examined waste management problematics in urban areas, the majority of which are located within the jurisdiction of local governments which are comparatively effective in terms of providing adequate disposal services. By contrast, this study has examined the environmental risk assessment associated with unregulated landfill sites in the Albert Luthuli municipality, in the Mpumalanga province. The determination of the environmental risk was achieved by the use of questionnaire surveys and landfill analysis forms in selected study areas. The findings have highlighted a very high environmental risk, nearly four times and above, the threshold limits set by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT, 2005 : 15) for all of the landfill <b>sites</b> examined. Several <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> stemming from associated environmental impacts have also been identified for the study. The higher environmental risk determined for the problem sites is ascribed to numerous factors, including their ill-planned location, the sensitivity and vulnerability of the natural environment and adjacent rural settlements, the lack of appropriate waste pre-treatment processes prior to disposal, and most significantly, the lack of regulatory and control measures to contain the myriad of environmental problems generated. In conclusion, it is recommended that several measures (including closure) should be taken in order to reduce and contain the magnitude of environmental risks involved. Environmental SciencesM. Sc.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{phase of}} a risk assessment consists of assessing (1) exposure of a measurement receptor to a compound of potential concern (COPC), and (2) toxicity of a COPC to a measurement receptor. The exposure assessment (Section 5. 1), and the toxicity assessment (Section 5. 4) are used to characterize ecological risk, as discussed in Chapter 6. 5. 1 EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT Exposure is the contact (e. g., ingestion) of a receptor with a COPC. Exposure of ecological receptors to COPCs emitted from facility sources are evaluated through consideration of <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways.</b> All <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> that are potentially complete should be evaluated. The existence of a potentially complete <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> indicates {{the potential for a}} receptor to contact a COPC; it does not require that a receptor be adversely affected. <b>Exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> considered in this guidance include all direct uptake pathways of a COPC from media (e. g., soil, sediment, and surface water) for lower trophic level receptors evaluated at the community level, and ingestion of a COPC contaminated organism (plant or animal food item) or media for higher trophic level receptors evaluated as class-specific guilds. It should be noted that <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> currently not addressed in this guidance due to the limitation of data include (1) inhalation and dermal <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> for upper trophic level organisms, (2) ingestion via grooming and preening, and (3) foliar uptake of dissolved COPCs by aquatic plants.

40|$|The Multimedia Environmental Pollutant Assessment System (MEPAS) {{provides}} physics-based {{models for}} human health risk assessment for radioactive and hazardous pollutants. MEPAS analyzes pollutant behavior in various media (air, soil, groundwater and surface water) and estimates transport through and between media and exposure and impacts to the environment, to the maximum individual, and to populations. MEPAS includes 25 <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> models, a database with information on more than 650 contaminants, and a sensitivity module that allows for uncertainty analysis. Four major transport pathways are considered in MEPAS: groundwater, overland, surface water, and atmospheric. This report describes the <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> and health impact assessment component of MEPAS, which provides an estimate of health impacts to selected individuals and populations from exposure to pollutants. The <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> analysis starts with pollutant concentration in a transport medium and estimates the average daily dose to exposed individuals from contact with the transport medium or a secondary medium contaminated by the transport medium. The average daily dose is then used to estimate a measure of health impact appropriate {{to the type of}} pollutant considered. Discussions of the <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> models include the assumptions and equations used to convert the transport medium concentrations to exposure medium concentrations. The discussion for a given <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> defines the transport pathways leading to the exposure, the special processes considered in determining the pollutant concentration in the exposure medium, and the exposure model used to estimate the average daily dose.

40|$|Depending on {{land use}} and {{corresponding}} human activities, a number of <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> are relevant for human exposure. In this chapter, six important pathways are described, i. e., exposure through consumption of vegetables, consumption of animal products, consumption of domestic water, inhalation of vapours outdoors, inhalation of dust particles (indoors and outdoors) and dermal uptake via soil material (outdoors and indoors). Note that these <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> follow different <b>exposure</b> routes to enter the human body, i. e., oral, inhalation and dermal routes, respectively. Human exposure through all oral and inhalative <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> described in this chapter (so excluding the dermal uptake <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway),</b> follow a similar pattern. This pattern includes three steps. Firstly, the transfer of contaminants {{from one of the}} mobile phases of the soil (pore water or soil gas) into a so-called contact medium. Secondly, the intake of that contact medium by human beings. And thirdly, the uptake of part of the contaminants from the contact medium into the blood stream and target organs and the corresponding excretion of the remaining part of the contaminants.

However, the applicability of these tools, {{which are based on}} Western dietary <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways,</b> to estimate chemical exposure to the Chinese population to support the development of a risk-based environment and exposure assessment, is unclear. Three frequently used modelling tools, EUSES, RAIDAR and ACC-HUMANsteady, have been evaluated in terms of human dietary exposure estimation by application to a range of chemicals with different physicochemical properties under both model default and Chinese dietary scenarios. Hence, the modelling approaches were assessed by considering dietary pattern differences only. The predicted dietary <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> were compared under both scenarios using a range of hypothetical and current emerging contaminants. Although the differences across models are greater than those between dietary scenarios, model predictions indicated that dietary preference can {{have a significant impact on}} human exposure, with the relatively high consumption of vegetables and cereals resulting in higher exposure via plants-based foodstuffs under Chinese consumption patterns compared to Western diets. The selected models demonstrated a good ability to identify key dietary <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> which can be used for screening purposes and an evaluative risk assessment.

40|$|The R?o Pilcomayo {{heads on}} the Cerro Rico de Potos? {{precious}} metal-polymetallic tin deposits of Southern Bolivia. Mining of the Potos? deposits began in 1545 and {{has led to}} the severe contamination of the Pilcomayo's water and sediments for at least 200 km downstream of the mines. This investigation addresses the potential human health affects of metal and As contamination on four communities located along the upper R?o Pilcomayo by examining the potential significance of human <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> associated with soils, crops and water (including river, irrigation and drinking water supplies). The most significantly contaminated agricultural soils occur upstream at Mondrag?n where Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations exceed recommended guideline values for agricultural use. Further downstream the degree of contamination decreases, and metal concentrations are below Dutch, German and Canadian guideline values. Metal and As concentrations in agricultural products from the four communities were generally below existing guidelines for heavy metal content in commercially-sold vegetables. Thus, the consumption of contaminated produce does not appear to represent a significant <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway.</b> A possible exception is Pb in carrots, lettuce and beetroots from Sotomayor and Tuero Chico; 37 % and 55 % of the samples, respectively, exceeded recommended guidelines. Most communities obtain drinking water from sources other than the R?o Pilcomayo. In general, dissolved concentrations of metals and As in drinking water from the four studied communities are below the WHO guideline values with the exception of Sb, which was high at Tasapampa. The inadvertent ingestion of contaminated water from irrigation canals and the R?o Pilcomayo represents a potential <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway,</b> but its significance is thought to be minimal. Given the degree of soil contamination in the area, perhaps the most significant <b>exposure</b> <b>pathway</b> is the ingestion of contaminated soil particles, particularly particles attached to, and consumed with vegetables. The risks associated with this pathway can be reduced by thoroughly washing or peeling the vegetables prior to consumption.

In this study, I sought {{to determine if there}} is any interaction between these 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways.</b> The uptake of Cd and Se by green mussels Perna viridis from the aqueous phase Was measured at different phytoplankton concentrations (green alga Chlorella autotrophica). Controlled experiments were performed to ensure that, in the presence of algal particles, the majority of metal accumulation by the green mussels was due to uptake from the aqueous phase. The influx rate of metals was independent of the food concentration and the clearance rate of the mussels, indicating that metal uptake from the aqueous phase was not directly related to the food concentration. These results verify the assumption that metal uptake from different <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> is additive and that there is no direct interaction between different routes of exposure, Metal uptake by green mussels was further tested after exposing the mussels to neurotransmitters (serotonin which stimulates ciliary pumping and dopamine which inhibits ciliary pumping). Complete inhibition of ciliary pumping was reached after addition of 100 muM of dopamine, Despite changes in the pumping activity due to exposure to neurotransmitters, there was no evidence showing the reduction or enhancement of metal uptake. A bioenergetic-based kinetic model was then employed to model the influence of seston quantity on the <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> of metals in the mussels, Our calculations indicated that the seston quantity substantially influences the relative importance of aqueous versus dietary exposure, primarily due to the dependence of a green mussel's ingestion activity on seston quantity. At a higher seston concentration, the <b>exposure</b> <b>pathways</b> are not influenced by the change in seston concentration due to the maintenance of a maximum ingestion rate and pseudofeces production...|$|R

In the last decade, the introduction of agricultural chemicals, heavy metals, domestic wastes, as well as eutrophication and incorrect utility of resources resulted in an increased water pollution. The present research work was carried out to check the various oxidative stress biomarker responses in European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) gill, kidney and liver due to this complex water pollution. Eels were caged and plunged at five different PF sites (A– E) for 48 h. A reference site (R) was also selected at the river spring where no industrial contamination should be detected. Lipid per- oxidation (LPO), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were the oxidative stress biomarkers studied. In gill, <b>site</b> A <b>exposure</b> induced a significant GST activity increase and <b>site</b> B <b>exposure</b> induced CAT activity increase when compared to R. <b>Site</b> C <b>exposure</b> showed a significant CAT and GPX activity increase. Data concerning <b>site</b> D <b>exposure</b> were not determined due to cage disappearance. <b>Site</b> E <b>exposure</b> displayed a significant CAT and GST activity increase. In kidney, <b>site</b> A <b>exposure</b> induced a significant CAT and GPX decrease {{as well as a}} GST increase. <b>Site</b> B <b>exposure</b> showed a significant decrease in GPX activity and GSH content. However, <b>site</b> C <b>exposure</b> demonstrated a significant increase in CAT and a decrease in GPX. <b>Site</b> E <b>exposure</b> showed a significant decrease in GPX and increase in GST.
