40|$|International audienceCoupling of {{evolutionary}} algorithms (EA) with meta-models (MM) {{is used to}} investigate {{the concept of the}} optimal die <b>semi-angle</b> in wire drawing. Traditional process design by minimization of the wire drawing force highlights an optimal die angle which increases with friction factor and reduction ratio. When wire drawing optimization is applied on the Latham and Cockcroft damage criterion, an optimal die <b>semi-angle</b> no longer appears: in this mono-objective optimization, the lowest industrially achievable die angle is recommended. Thanks to EA-MM coupling, multi-objective optimizations have been performed and the Pareto optimal front has been precisely plotted so as to find the best compromise. Simultaneous optimization of damage and wire drawing force suggests a refined vision of the optimal die <b>semi-angle</b> concept. Choosing a lower angle than the traditional optimum allows damage to be decreased without a significant increase of the drawing force. However, it is shown that a die <b>semi-angle</b> slightly above the optimum should be selected, for fear of friction drift; this explains the rather high traditional value of the angle...|$|E
40|$|An energy {{absorber}} device is {{a device that}} is capable to convert one form of energy to the plastic deformation or another form of energy. Plastic deformation energy can be converted into several modes of deformation including axial crushing, inversion, splitting, lateral indentation and lateral flattening. The objective {{of this paper was}} to investigate the axial splitting and curling behavior of aluminium circular metal tubes which was compressed axially under static loading. An experimental investigation was carried out by using three types of dies with different <b>semi-angles,</b>  which was 450, 600 and 750. To ease the splitting process, the tube was introduced with 4 and 6 slits with the length of 5 mm at {{the leading edge of the}} tube. The slit prevented the tubes from buckling and established the split and curl mode during the compression process. The result showed that for a specimen with 4 initial saw cuts, the number of slits remained except for semi angle die of 600 where it branched into 6 splits. Meanwhile for a specimen with 6 initial saw cuts, the effect of semi angle die was insignificant where the number of slits remained the same after compression. The mean load was found proportional to the semi angle die. In conclusion, the axial splitting and curling of aluminium circular metal tubes has high potential as an {{energy absorber}}.

30|$|Due to beam precession, (usually {{applied at}} 1 ° <b>semi-angle)</b> {{reflection}} intensities are integrated over diffraction {{conditions that are}} far from perfect zone axis orientation, therefore dynamical effects in PED patterns are highly reduced. Using PED reflections in combination with ADT- 3 D tomography is important as symmetry related PED reflections are easily revealed and this enables symmetry (Space Group) determination. Therefore, PED intensity comparison between possibly symmetry related ED intensities enables to distinguish between crystals having similar unit cell (e.g. as close as 1 – 2 %) but different crystal symmetries. In addition, during crystal tilt in ADT (−  60 ° to +  60 °), the use of PED (at 1 ° <b>semi-angle)</b> helps to recover more reliable “quasi-kinematical” ED reflections intensities within reciprocal space sections taken every 1 ° tilt step. On the other hand, orientation imaging ASTAR technique also uses PED reflection in comparison with ED theoretical templates as use of PED improves a lot resulting phase and orientation maps [2].|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this report {{describes}} the design and construction of a floating element skin friction balance. This instrument, which is essentially an improved version of Dhawan's balance, was applied to measurements of local skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer of a smooth flat plate at high subsonic Mach numbers and supersonic Mach numbers up to M = 1. 75. The measured skin friction coefficients are consistent with the results of other investigations at subsonic and also at high supersonic speeds. The principal difficulties which exist in comparing skin friction coefficients at various Mach numbers are discussed. The second part of this report describes the application of the Stanton tube technique to skin friction measurements near the base of a shock wave impinging upon a turbulent boundary layer. The floating element technique is inherently difficult to apply for skin friction measurements in non-uniform flow. Hence, a Stanton tube is calibrated by means of a floating element balance in a uniform flow field and then used to measure skin friction near the base of an impinging shock. Oblique shock waves were produced by two wedges of 2. 5 [degree] and 4. 6 [degree] <b>semi-angles</b> and a normal shock was generated by a choked channel.

40|$|We present new 230 GHz Submillimeter Array {{observations}} of the candidate first hydrostatic core Per-Bolo 58. We report the detection of a 1. 3 mm continuum source and a bipolar molecular outflow, both centered on {{the position of the}} candidate first hydrostatic core. The continuum detection has a total flux density of 26. 6 +/- 4. 0 mJy, from which we calculate a total (gas and dust) mass of 0. 11 +/- 0. 05 Msun and a mean number density of 2. 0 +/- 1. 6 X 10 ^ 7 cm- 3. There is some evidence for the existence of an unresolved component in the continuum detection, but longer-baseline observations are required in order to confirm the presence of this component and determine whether its origin lies in a circumstellar disk or in the dense inner envelope. The bipolar molecular outflow is observed along a nearly due east-west axis. The outflow is slow (characteristic velocity of 2. 9 km/s), shows a jet-like morphology (opening <b>semi-angles</b> ~ 8 degrees for both lobes), and extends to the edges of the primary beam. We calculate the kinematic and dynamic properties of the outflow in the standard manner and compare them to several other protostars and candidate first hydrostatic cores with similarly low luminosities.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the optimal streaky {{perturbations}} (which maximize the perturbed energy growth) in a wedge flow boundary layer. These three dimensional perturbations are governed by a system of linearized boundary layer equations around the Falkner-Skan base flow. Based on an asymptotic analysis of this system near the free stream and the leading edge singularity, we show that for acute wedge <b>semi-angle,</b> all solutions converge after a streamwise transient to a single streamwise-growing solution of the linearized equations, whose initial condition near the leading edge is given by an eigenvalue problem first formulated in this context by Tumin (2001). Such a solution may {{be regarded as a}} streamwise evolving most unstable streaky mode, in analogy with the usual eigenmodes in strictly parallel flows, and shows an approximate self-similarity, which was partially known and is completed in this paper. An important consequence of this result is that the optimization procedure based on the adjoint equations heretofore used to define optimal streaks is not necessary. Instead, a simple low-dimensional optimization process is proposed and used to obtain optimal streaks. Comparison with previous results by Tumin and Ashpis (2003) shows an excellent agreement. The unstable streaky mode exhibits transient growth if the wedge <b>semi-angle</b> is smaller than a critical value that is slightly larger than π/ 6, and decays otherwise.
