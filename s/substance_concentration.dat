5000|$|Molar {{concentration}}, {{also called}} molarity, amount concentration or <b>substance</b> <b>concentration,</b> {{is a measure}} of the concentration of a solute in a solution, or of any chemical species, in terms of amount of substance in a given volume.

50|$|Probabilistic {{models are}} based on the Monte Carlo method where {{distributions}} of data from various sources are randomly sampled from to calculate percentile statistics. Such probabilistic techniques typically utilise product or consumption survey data from a sample population combined with distributions of substances that may be found within those foods or products. For example, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggest that the estimation of intake of substances in food can be probabilistically conducted through food consumption surveys (NHANES/CSFII) from sample populations combined with distributions of <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> data to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) funded the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool to estimate usual intake exposure distributions based on statistical models which utilise the EFSA Comprehensive Database, which contains detailed food consumption survey data. EFSA also funded Creme Global to develop a model and databases of European food consumption on which statistical models can be run to assess intake and exposure on a pan-European basis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{science and}} technology, an {{arbitrary}} unit (abbreviated arb. unit, see below)or procedure defined unit (p.d.u.)is a relative {{unit of measurement}} to show the ratio of amount of substance, intensity, or other quantities, to a predetermined reference measurement. The reference measurement is typically defined by the local laboratories or dependent on individual measurement apparatus. It is therefore impossible to compare [...] "1 arb. unit" [...] by one measurer and [...] "1000 arb. unit" [...] by another measurer without detailed prior knowledge on how the respective [...] "arbitrary units" [...] were defined; thus, the unit is sometimes called an unknown unit. The unit only serves to compare multiple measurements performed in similar environment, since the ratio between the measurement and the reference is a consistent and dimensionless quantity independent of what actual units are used.Units of such kind are commonly used in fields such as physiology to indicate <b>substance</b> <b>concentration,</b> and spectroscopy to express spectral intensity.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} is indirect, {{involving}} a rumninant as definitive host, snail as intermediate host, and an interval of external phases {{in water and}} plants. The sexually mature monoecious self-fertilises in the mammalian rumen, and keep the eggs inside the uterus. Eggs are then released in the host intestine and are expelled along with faeces. Eggs are deposited in water and hatch at optimal temperature of 27 °C in 12-17 days to become ciliated miracidia. The non-feeding miracidia often swim through water searching for a suitable snail host, either until they reach the host or die. Most common intermediate hosts are snails belonging to the genera Bulinus, Planorbis, Physa Stagnicola and Pseudosuccinea. When sensing the soft outer surface of a snail, they attach and burrow through the epidermis and into the tissue. Young snails {{are more susceptible to}} such penetration. In the snail tissue the miracidia lost their cilia within 12 hours and get transformed into sporocysts (~53 x 93 µ). By 11th day they develop up to 8 rediae, which are rapidly liberated. After 10 days the rediae mature and each contains 15-30 cercariae. The cercariae are released to grow further which may take about 13 days. Mature cercariae are characterised by two eyespots and a long slender tail. They are stimulated by light through the sensory eyespots in sunlight and leave the snail. They swim about in water until they find plants or other suitable substrata, to which they adhere and encyst to become metacercariae. The process of this cyst formation requires about 20 minutes only. Metacercariae are infective larvae but cannot resist desiccation, hence soon die out if suitable host is not found; but under constantly moist conditions, they can survive for up to 1 year and are capable of overwintering. The mammalian hosts harbour the infective larvae by ingestion. Once they reach the duodenum and jejunum, their cysts are cast off. Excystment is influenced by changing physicochemical conditions (such as temperature, <b>substance</b> <b>concentration,</b> and pH) inside the alimentary tract. Then they penetrate and feed on tissue of the gut wall of the small intestine. Once they develop sufficiently they migrate to the rumen, where the juveniles mature and produce ova. The period of rumen entry to egg laying takes about 60 to 120 days. However, the lifespan of an adult is unknown.|$|E
40|$|Ion-selective {{electrodes}} (ISEs) {{respond to}} ion-activity and therefore do not sense <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> directly. However, it is recognized that sodium and potassium in plasma {{will continue to}} be expressed for clinical purposes in terms of <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> (mmol/l). A convention is proposed whereby for routine clinical purposes results of ISE measurements of sodium and potassium in undiluted plasma should be reported in terms of <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> (mmol/l). In specimens with normal concentrations of plasma water, total CO 2, lipids, protein and pH, the values will concur with the total <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> as determined for example by flame atomic emission spectrometry (FAES) or ISE measurements on diluted samples. In specimens with abnormal concentrations of plasma water, the results will differ. However, under these circumstances, measurements of sodium and potassium by ISE in the undiluted sample will more appropriately reflect the activity of sodium and potassium and are therefore clinically more relevant than the determination in diluted samples. Detailed recommendations are made about practical procedures to achieve this. The recommended name for this quantity is the <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> of ionized sodium or ionized potassium in plasma, as opposed to total sodium or total potassium determined by, e. g. FAES, or ISE measurements on diluted samples...|$|E

40|$|During {{a period}} of 10 months, inter and intraindividual {{variations}} in plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activity were studied in 331 employees of an organophosphorus insecticide factory, and in 193 healthy volunteers without occupational exposure to known ChE inhibitors.

30|$|In general, the DIN 38414, part 8 (1985) test is more {{tolerant}} to higher test <b>substance</b> <b>concentrations</b> than the ECETOC test, {{which is caused}} by the higher inoculum density.

30|$|This {{subsequent}} {{addition of}} test substance allows {{the detection of}} any false positive effect caused e.g. by the increased bioavailability of nutrients or easily biodegradable organic components from the sludge due to the solubilizing action of the surfactant (for known bacteriotoxic substances (e.g. many surfactants) {{it may be necessary}} to reduce the <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> so far that toxic effects no longer occur). The inclusion of a toxicity control, e.g. glucose of acetate, can help to distinguish between non-degradability cased by persistence or by toxic inhibition. However, depending on the biological activity of the sludge inoculum used (gas production rate of the control), the <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> can only be reduced to a limited extent as the signal/noise ratio has a limiting effect from approx. 120 mg TOC/L.|$|E
30|$|A mutualistic {{relationship}} between grasses, coal-degrading fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was proposed {{to account for}} the phyto-biodegradation of coal discard. In this study pot trial experiments were carried out to confirm transformation of the carbonaceous substrate, {{in the presence of a}} suite of coal degrading fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, into a humic-enriched soil-like material in the Cynodon dactylon/coal rhizosphere. The results show that after 47 weeks of C. dactylon growth on coal discard the concentration of humics increased from (62.9  ±  1.5) to (112.1  ±  5.4) mg/kg. Substrate humic acid-like <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> positively correlated (r 2  =  0.95) with accumulation of above ground C. dactylon biomass. FTIR spectroscopy of the extracted humic-like substances confirmed both product identity and increased oxidation of the coal discard substrate. Substrate ash content and electrical conductivity declined coincident with an increase in humic acid-like <b>substance</b> <b>concentration,</b> which together reduced the intensity of acidity in the C. dactylon/coal discard rhizosphere. These observations support the proposal that biological oxidative degradation of coal discard leads to increased humic-like <b>substance</b> <b>concentration</b> and formation of a soil-like material. Results have profound implications for use of coal discard as an organic substrate to replace topsoil in phyto-bioremediation strategies for sustainable large-scale rehabilitation of coal discard dumps.|$|E
