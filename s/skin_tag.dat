40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{usefulness of}} <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> {{as a predictor}} of colonic polyps, in patients of a minority population. SETTING: Inner-city community hospital serving predominantly African Americans and Hispanics. METHODS: Evaluation of 480 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy. The presence or absence of <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> was noted, and their correlation with the colonic polyps determined. RESULTS: Colonic polyps were detected in 92 patients (19 %). None of these patients had <b>skin</b> <b>tags,</b> whereas <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> were found in 87 patients (18 %), and none of them had colonic polyps. CONCLUSION: The mere presence of acrochordons (<b>skin</b> <b>tags)</b> should not be used as an indication for screening colonoscopy especially in African Americans and Hispanics...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Skin</b> <b>tags</b> (achrochordons, fibroepithelial polyps) are pedunculated lesions which {{commonly}} {{occur in}} areas of skin fold such as the neck, the axillae, the eyelids. Case Presentation: Herein a large achrochordon of the left labium majus is presented. Total excision of the lesion was performed and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of achrochordon.

40|$|BACKGROUND Acrochorda (<b>skin</b> <b>tags)</b> are benign <b>skin</b> tumors {{that form}} {{primarily}} at skin creases, generally on the neck, armpit, and groin areas. There {{have been a}} small number of published studies in 1980 s in patients who were found to have increased number of <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> and colonic polyps, with a direct correlation described between the two. In addition, metabolic syndrome has been linked to adenomatous polyps, but a link between <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> and metabolic syndrome has not been established...|$|R

50|$|If not thrombosed, {{external}} hemorrhoids may cause few problems. However, when thrombosed, hemorrhoids {{may be very}} painful. Nevertheless, this pain typically resolves {{in two to three}} days. The swelling may, however, take a few weeks to disappear. A <b>skin</b> <b>tag</b> may remain after healing. If hemorrhoids are large and cause issues with hygiene, they may produce irritation of the surrounding skin, and thus itchiness around the anus.|$|E

40|$|Background: In women, {{the age of}} 50 is {{suggested}} to be the turning point of life at which the development of <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> comes to a stop. A major event that occurs around this period of life is menopause/andropause. After menopause, estrogen receptors amounts decrease significantly. As skin is considered as the largest nonreproductive target on which estrogens and androgens act, we assume a possible relationship between the pathogenesis of <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> and sex steroid balance. Another phenomenon is the association of <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> in obese patients, which may also {{be explained by the}} interplay of sex steroids and their receptors in <b>skin</b> <b>tags.</b> Aims: Here we see that in obese patients, hyperandrogenism occurs as a result of hyperinsulinemia as well as peripheral conversion of estrogens into androgens in the excessive adipose tissue. To examine the possible role of androgen and estrogen receptors in etiopathogenesis of <b>skin</b> <b>tags.</b> Materials and Methods: To examine these hypotheses, we measured the level of androgen and estrogen receptors (both &# 945; and &# 946;) in <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> compared to control. We also correlated the level of receptors to body mass index, and compared those levels in patients with acanthosis nigricans compared to normal. Results: The level of estrogen receptors (both &# 945; and &# 946;) was significantly higher in <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> than in controls with a P value of 0. 004 and 0. 001, respectively. The same upsurge was found for androgen receptors in <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> relative to control with a P value of 0. 001. No statistically significant difference in receptor level was found either among patients with acanthosis nigricans and those without, or in correlation to body mass index (our participants were overweight non diabetic). Conclusion: These results suggest the possible role of androgen and estrogen receptors in etiogenesis of <b>skin</b> <b>tags,</b> and propose that the neck is an androgen dependent area just similar to the axillae and the groins, though hairless...|$|R

50|$|Because hyfrecation {{is always}} a {{relatively}} low-power modality, {{it can be used}} in some situations (such as very small nevus removal or <b>skin</b> <b>tag</b> removal) without local anaesthesia. In many other uses to destroy larger lesions, a local anesthetic injection or regional nerve block is used. The pain from hyfrecation is due to the burning of tissue, and the pain of electric current is absent, due to the high (radio) frequency which does not directly cause discharge of nerves.|$|E
5000|$|Hemorrhoids, {{also called}} piles, are {{vascular}} {{structures in the}} anal canal. In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control. They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term [...] "hemorrhoid" [...] {{is often used to}} refer to the disease. The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present. Internal hemorrhoids are usually present with painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Skin</b> <b>tags</b> {{are known}} to be {{associated}} with several systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. Only a few Indian studies have investigated patients with <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> for underlying metabolic complications. Objective. To assess the clinico-epidemiological profile of patients with <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> and evaluate them for underlying metabolic abnormalities. Material and methods. All the patients reporting <b>skin</b> <b>tag(s)</b> at the dermatology outpatient department from October 2013 to September 2014 were included in the study. A detailed general, cutaneous and systemic examination was carried out. The data were analyzed using the χ 2 test. A p-value < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results. Out of 165 enrolled patients, 112 (67. 88 %) completed the study protocol. Females outnumbered males, the M : F ratio being 1 : 1. 11. Most patients (32; 28. 57 %) were in the age group of 31 – 40 years. The majority of the patients (77; 68. 75 %) reported after 1 year of noticing the lesions. The most commonly affected site was the neck (99; 88. 39 %) followed by the axilla (53; 47. 32 %). Acanthosis nigricans was the most common skin disease associated with <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> (37; 33. 03 %). The diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome were fulfilled by 47 (41. 96 %) patients. The majority of the patients (70; 62. 5 %) were either overweight or obese. Abnormal glucose tolerance and hypertension were found in 41 (36. 6 %) and 37 (33. 03 %) of the patients respectively. Above optimal LDL cholesterol was the most common lipid abnormality, detected in 64 (56. 25 %) of the cases. Patients with 11 or more <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> lesions and those with involvement of the thigh, axilla or neck {{were more likely to have}} metabolic syndrome. Conclusions. Patients with <b>skin</b> <b>tags</b> should be screened for concomitant diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. Early detection of these complications followed by appropriate lifestyle changes and/or drug therapy would be beneficial in terms of reducing the considerable morbidity and mortality...|$|R

50|$|An {{acrochordon}} (plural acrochorda; also <b>skin</b> <b>tag,</b> skin polyp, fibroepithelial polyp, fibrovascular papilloma, soft fibroma, fibroma molle) {{is a small}} {{benign tumor}} that forms primarily {{in areas where the}} skin forms creases, such as the neck, armpit, and groin. They may also occur on the face, usually on the eyelids. Perianal skin tags can be associated with Crohn's disease. Acrochorda are generally harmless and painless, and usually do not grow or change over time. Though tags up to a half-inch long have been seen, they are typically the size of a grain of rice. The surface of an acrochordon may be smooth or irregular in appearance and is often raised {{from the surface of the}} skin on a fleshy stalk called a peduncle. Microscopically, an acrochordon consists of a fibrovascular core, sometimes also with fat cells, covered by an unremarkable epidermis.

40|$|Introduction: Skin tags are small, benign, {{soft and}} pedunculated skin tumors. A {{possible}} associationwith impaired carbohydrate metabolism {{has been suggested}} in previous studies, but the results are notconclusive. This study was performed {{in order to determine}} association between <b>skin</b> <b>tag</b> and diabetesmellitus. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 80 patients with skin tags as a case group and 80 patients without skin tags as a control group that they were referred to Semnan dermatological clinics. Thenfasting blood sugar (FBS) were checked out in both two groups. In addition, height and weight weremeasured in all patients and body mass index (BMI) calculated for each of the patient. Results: 43. 8 % and 55 % of patients were respectively female in the case group and the control group. Age mean (± SD) was 44. 3 ± 16. 6 and 37. 3 ± 18. 9 years in the case and control group, respectively. BMImean (±SD) index was 28. 0 ± 4. 3 kg/m 2 in the patients with <b>skin</b> <b>tag,</b> whereas, it was 25. 5 ± 5. 1 kg/m² in thepatients without <b>skin</b> <b>tag</b> (P= 0. 001).

Twinning is a well-known risk factor for congenital defects including external ear deformities. Monozygotic twins usually show identical appearances as well as congenital malformations. In special conditions as ear deformities, “mirror-image” may also occur. We report 2 cases of monozygotic twins with different ear deformities. The 8 -year-old propositus with lobule type microtia and her identical female twin presented with facial symmetry. Patient A had sausage-type right microtia with absence of external auditory canal.
