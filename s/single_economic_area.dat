40|$|Economic {{dispatch}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} issues in power system operation and planning. Economic dispatch requires reliable technique to achieve minimal cost; otherwise, a non-optimal solution may cause non-economic electricity generation to the utility. <b>Single</b> <b>area</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch does not make complete electricity generation of the whole system on the electrical transmission network. Thus, multi-area economic dispatch implementation leads to complete consideration for power transmission system. This paper presents multi-area economic dispatch performance using swarm intelligence technique. In this study, swarm intelligence technique, namely the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) is employed for solving multi-area economic dispatch problems. The algorithm is tested on a 2 -area 48 -bus power system with different case studies. Variation in active power loading in achieving an optimal solution is also considered in this study. Several trials were taken into consideration to assess the consistency of results. Comparative studies were performed with respect to evolutionary programming (EP) and revealed that PSO yields better results as compared to the EP...|$|R
40|$|In 1954 Nebraska Census of Agriculture divided Nebraska {{into eight}} <b>economic</b> <b>areas.</b> These <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> were {{determined}} {{by the type of}} agriculture prevalent in each. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 1 included the Sandhills ranching region of Nebraska. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 2 was located in the southwestern part of the state. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 a included the area beginning just west of North Platte, following the Platte River to just east of Grand Island. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 b is located in north central Nebraska just east of <b>Economic</b> <b>Areas</b> 1 and 3 a. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 4 lay along the Kansas border extending from Nuckolls County to the Colorado state line. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 5 included that land south of <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 3 b to the Kansas state line. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 6 was located in the northeastern area of the state. <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> 7 was situated in the southeastern section of the state. Several studies have previously been conducted in Nebraska concerning the occupational status of former vocational agriculture graduates. These studies were conducted on a local school basis. This study, however, was conducted on a statewide level. It was designed to determine the relationship of occupational factors of Nebraska’s farm males, graduated from high school nine to thirteen years earlier, to the <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> of Nebraska in which they lived on the day of graduation. The specific objectives of the study were to determine: The relationship between graduates’ occupations and selected home environmental characteristics by Nebraska economic area; The relationship between graduates’ occupational and educational background by Nebraska occupational area; and Some measures of occupational status of graduates by Nebraska <b>economic</b> <b>area.</b> Graduates included in the study were those whose fathers were farming on the day their sons graduated from high school or who had farmed during most of the time that their sons were in high school. Graduates who had enrolled in six or more semesters of vocational agriculture were also included in the study.

40|$|A {{question}} {{fundamental to}} {{sustainable economic growth}} is whether a poor region tends to grow faster than a rich one, such that the poor region catches up with the rich region {{in terms of the}} level of per capita income. In this article, we apply the spatial panel data approach to the analysis of regional income convergence across 177 <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> in the contiguous US states over the period from 1969 to 2009. Using data on per capita incomes in the functionally defined <b>economic</b> <b>areas,</b> we find that the absolute value of the estimated coefficient of the initial per capita income decreases in the spatial and time-period fixed effects spatial lag model and increases in the spatial and time-period fixed effects spatial error model. This result implies that the growth rate in a specific <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> will be not only directly affected by an exogenous shock introduced into that <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> but also be impacted more by both the indirect effects of the first-order neighboring <b>economic</b> <b>areas</b> and the induced effects of the higher-order neighboring <b>economic</b> <b>areas.</b> This gives helpful hints on the issue of spatial interaction and regional policy coordination to start a virtuous circle of sustainable economic growth...|$|R
