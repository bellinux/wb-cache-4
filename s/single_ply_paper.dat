5000|$|Parachuting is {{a method}} of {{swallowing}} drugs by rolling or folding powdered or crushed drugs {{in a piece of}} toilet paper (or other similar paper) to ingest while avoiding the taste of the chemical. It is sometimes called a [...] "snow bomb", especially if using cocaine.This method is used among many pharmaceuticals that are commonly crushed for recreational use. The toilet paper method must use <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> toilet <b>paper</b> or one must separate the layers of double ply. Tissues are also a common go to for this method of drug ingestion. Another common paper used is rolling paper for smoking herbal substances. Opioids and other narcotics, amphetamines, and benzodiazepines are also commonly parachuted to avoid unpleasant tastes. This method's purpose is recreational because it is all absorbed at once when the paper unravels in one's stomach.|$|R

40|$|The {{spreading}} kinetics of {{drops of}} different liquids (water, glycerol and ethylene glycol) on {{different types of}} model papers have been investigated. In {{the first part of}} the investigation <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> and two-ply <b>papers,</b> made from pulps with different degrees of beating, were investigated. The results show that is very common the surface layer of the paper had a much larger influence on the spreading than the bottom ply. By normalising the data showing the drop radius as a function of time with the viscosity and surface tension of the liquids all data collapse onto a master curve. The results from {{the first part of the}} investigation also show that in order to determine a contact angle between the liquid and the paper the drop volume should remain constant and the contact angle should be determined when the drop has reached its equilibrium volume. In the second part of the investigation the influence of surface topography and surface energy of the papers on the spreading kinetics was determined. The results show that when the pattern of use, the avails on the surface creates fine capillaries the contact angle is decreased compared to the situation with a flat surface. For papers with a higher roughness the uneven structure creates barriers against the spreading which increases the contact angle compared to the situation with a flat surface. A simple attempt to fit the data to a power law based on a hydrodynamic approach was also conducted. The results from this treatment show that it is possible to get a good match for the sheets with virtually only surface spreading. The constants achieved in this treatment can be used to rationalise the spreading data to be compared with other investigations.

To introduce randomness fibers are removed at random from the lattice, leaving vacant lattice sites of matrix material, until a certain fiber volume fraction is reached. The effect of lattice thickness {{on the critical}} fiber fraction for percolation is calculated for this random, close packed fiber model.

50|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is highly}} soluble in water. The solution used in saturating {{the paper was}} 70 Baume in density (1.93 specific gravity) and about 110°F. This is roughly a 70% percent zinc chloride solution. Zinc chloride is a mild lewis acid with a solution pH of about 4. Zinc chloride can dissolve cellulose, starch, and silk. The zinc chloride used in making vulcanized fibre swelled and gelatinized the cellulose. The fibre swelling explains why paper filters cannot be used to filter zinc chloride solutions. It is also the reason why a number of <b>paper</b> <b>plies</b> were used to build up to the desired vulcanized fibre thickness, rather treating a single paperboard thickness. For instance, the practice was to use 8 <b>paper</b> <b>plies</b> of 4 mm thickness each, {{as opposed to a}} <b>single</b> paperboard <b>ply</b> of 32 mm.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{finite element}} and experimental results for <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> strips of unidirectional cord-rubber composite using {{two types of}} finite elements: rubber elements and cord-rubber elements. The finite element model {{takes into account the}} large strain and nonlinear behavior of the rubber material, bimodular material behavior and geometrical nonlinear behavior due to reorientations of the cords. To illustrate the be-havior of strips of <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> composites, results are presented in the form of load-displacement, deformed shapes and cord strains for three polyester cord rubber composite specimens. It is shown that the rubber between cords may contract or bulge, depending on the cord angle. The effect of the material models for rubber material and cord-rubber com-posite material on the load displacement behavior is also presented. Utilizing this finite el-ement model and critical tearing energy criterion, an attempt is made to predict the critical loads for crack growth initiation and final fracture for four cracked rubber composite spec-imens. All the finite element results are compared to experimental data with relatively good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Thermoforming {{plays an}} {{increasingly}} important role in manufacturing of structural composite vehicle components. Nevertheless, a macroscopic buckling and a subsequent wrinkling of the blank is often observed during forming. Additionally, a fiber reorientation is inevitable. Both of these mechanisms emerge in dependence on material properties of the main deformation mechanisms, which namely are shearing and bending of the <b>single</b> <b>ply,</b> as well as friction between the <b>single</b> <b>plies</b> of the stacked laminate. To predict forming behavior by means of Finite Element forming simulation, these mechanisms are modeled via constitutive laws, which facilitates the prediction of the stress and strain distribution during forming, {{as well as the}} shape of the formed product. To investigate the influence of the material properties of the above mentioned deformation mechanisms on wrinkling behavior and fiber reorientation, a sensitivity study based on the Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology is conducted. The influence is examined quantitatively by means of Response Surface Methodology on basis of quantitative measures for the examined mechanisms. It could be shown, that for the examined biaxial layup shearing and bending properties have a significant influence and friction between the plies plays a minor role...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} definitive stacking sequence listings for tapered, warp-free balanced plain weave and non-crimp fabric (NCF) laminate designs {{with and without}} Extension-Shearing and/or Bending-Twisting coupling behaviour. With few exceptions, tapered designs for uni-directional (UD) material are currently certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination therefore requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations. By contrast, an extensive design space has recently been discovered for tapered UD laminates with <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> terminations, including <b>single</b> angle-ply terminations, representing unconventional laminate designs with unbalanced and/or non-symmetric stacking sequences. Such designs give rise to Bending-Twisting and/or Extension-Shearing coupling: Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment; Bending-Twisting coupling, which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent fully uncoupled laminate (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. <b>Single</b> <b>ply</b> terminations applied to NCF or balanced plain weave materials are equivalent to two adjacent ply terminations in traditional UD materials, and therefore introduce a constraint that may reduce the design space substantially, particularly in ‘thin laminate’ designs. However, this can be overcome by adopting ‘thin-ply’ or ‘spread-tow’ technology, which will allow an exponential increase in tailoring opportunities by bringing design flexibilities, found only in traditionally thick laminate construction, into the thin laminate domain. Thin-ply technology will, for instance, offer {{the prospect of a}} repeating 8 -ply NCF laminate, with a similar thickness to that of a <b>single</b> <b>ply</b> of traditional UD material. This design also follows the repeating bi-angle philosophy, possessing Extension-Shearing and Bending-Twisting coupling, but now with immunity to thermal warping distortions, which are eliminated in bi-angle laminates only when the number (r) of repeats becomes very large...|$|R
