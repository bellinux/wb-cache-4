40|$|A {{quantitative}} research {{study was conducted}} with teenagers attending Bandina Christian Youth Camp for one week in the summer of 2008. Students were divided into two groups; a control group and an intervention group. All participants were given a Self- Reflective Survey immediately prior to and following the week of summer camp. In addition to the pre- and post- Self-Reflective Surveys, the intervention group was required to complete Gallup's StrengthsQuest assessment (to determine his/her five greatest strengths) and e-mail those findings to this researcher before the first camp session. Once at camp, the intervention group participated in a five day Faith Based <b>Strengths</b> <b>Training</b> class one hour a day. The intervention group recognized and identified all 34 strengths, learned the uniqueness of his/her top five strengths, identified and related to famous individuals and their strengths and explored optimal career fields that best correlated to the participants' top five <b>strengths.</b> <b>Strengths</b> <b>Training</b> proved to be an effective tool in changing the intervention group's self confidence, sense of direction and his or her personal desire to learn more about Strengths collectively with a. 03 p at an alpha level of. 05. Youth based national organizations such as Boys & Girls Club, Boys Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4 -H, Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA) and others could greatly enhance their programs by incorporating <b>Strengths</b> <b>Training</b> into their curriculum, as <b>Strengths</b> <b>Training</b> builds on the development of core values, positive self image and character development that all of these national organizations strive to provide the youth of today. The summer camp experience offers a distinct opportunity for learning and exploration. This unique educational atmosphere sets up a positive cognitive environment where youth are typically more receptive to learning new concepts and ideas. The intervention group outcomes for this {{quantitative research}} study resulted in a positive outcome with only five hours of training. This infers a positive impact to not only the Y generation, but future generations to come and raises the need for more research in how these youth based national organizations can not only implement <b>Strengths</b> <b>Training</b> into their existing programs but network <b>Strengths</b> <b>Training...</b>|$|R

5|$|Physical {{training}} goals {{pursued in}} conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on <b>strength</b> <b>training.</b> In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements.

2500|$|In June 1949, ConAC reorganized its reserve units {{under the}} wing base {{organization}} system, in which tactical and support units on a base were organized {{under a single}} wing.

30|$|Similar to the {{development}} of maximal <b>strength,</b> flywheel <b>training</b> seems to cause greater improvements in power for well-trained individuals compared to untrained and moderately trained individuals. The average power development in well-trained individuals was +[*] 0.60 % per day, compared to an increase of +[*] 0.44 % and +[*] 0.32 % for moderately trained and untrained individuals, respectively. Since force together with velocity constitutes power, it is therefore not surprising that power development follows a similar trend as maximal <b>strength</b> following <b>training</b> programs with similar volume and intensity conditions during the intervention period.|$|R

50|$|Mario Martinez {{was born}} on July 6th 1957 and raised on a ranch in Salinas, California.

Martinez was so strong that he eventually began bending all of his bars because of all the weight he load on. He would then take a hammer and bend the bars back into place to straighten them and continue on with his training.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of exercise interventions that can be applied in kinesiology to athletic, normal, and clinical populations. Aerobic exercise interventions help to improve cardiovascular endurance. Anaerobic <b>strength</b> <b>training</b> programs can increase muscular strength, power, and lean body mass. Decreased risk of falls and increased neuromuscular control can be attributed to balance intervention programs. Flexibility programs can increase functional range of motion and reduce the risk of injury.|$|E

25|$|Strength {{improvements}} {{in the range of}} 5–20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week <b>strength</b> <b>training</b> program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at 600nbsp&mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. This dose is sufficient to significantly improve lean muscle mass relative to placebo even in subjects that did not exercise at all.
