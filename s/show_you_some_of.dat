6000|$|... "You {{talk about}} {{standards}} <b>of</b> living,--I could <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> examples <b>of</b> standards {{to make your}} heart sick," [...] he said. [...] "What you don't realize, perhaps, is that low standards help to increase the inefficient of whom you complain." ...|$|R
60|$|I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> reasons <b>of</b> the point, besides {{those five}} that I <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> before. And, First, I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> why the poor, carnal, ignorant world miss of heaven; and then, Second, why the knowing professors miss of it also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{close the}} shutter, and I {{will bring in}} the lamp, and <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> my sketches. We artists are thirsting always for praise; and I {{know you have a}} taste, Bob, that one might dread." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have yet}} a little while," [...] he said, [...] "before that happens which I have decreed. Come, Humphrey, that I may <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the marvels of this bubble blown {{in the bowels}} of the world," [...] and he motioned to us to pick up the lanterns.|$|E
60|$|And here, as {{in a fit}} place, before I go any further, I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the {{advantages}} that a Christian gets by keeping of his heart tender. For, as to have a broken heart, {{is to have an}} excellent thing, so to keep this broken heart tender, is also very advantageous.|$|E
6000|$|The sleepless man {{thrust his}} {{knuckles}} {{into his eyes}} and rubbed them. Isbister talked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then he had a fresh idea. [...] "Come down to my room," [...] he said, [...] "and try a pipe. I can <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> sketches <b>of</b> this Blackapit. If you'd care?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, but, {{slinging}} names at him's {{not much}} use," [...] he said. [...] "Well, I {{feel it in}} me that we're {{going to see more}} of that man by and by, and that's just why I'm working up the whole thing from the beginning. Now I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> more <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my lord; {{to be able}} to read another's {{thoughts}} it {{is necessary}} there should be a mystic relation established between them. As I walked beside your horse when you carried my daughter before you after saving her life, I felt that this relation had commenced, and that henceforward our fates were connected. It was necessary that you should have confidence in me, and it was for that reason that I <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the feats that we rarely exhibit, and proved to you that I possessed powers with which you were unacquainted. But in thought reading my daughter has greater powers than I have, and it was she who last night followed you on your journey, sitting with her hand in mine, so that my mind followed hers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Aquareine, [...] "I {{will send}} you out for a swim with Merla, who will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the curious sights of our sea. You need not go far this afternoon, and when you return, we will have another {{interesting}} talk together." [...] So the blonde mermaid led Trot and Cap'n Bill outside the palace walls, where they found themselves in the pretty flower gardens.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear me! How dreadful!' said Dolores, who {{had been}} used to see all manner of papers come in as {{regularly}} as hot rolls. 'Why, you never can know anything! We didn't take in society papers, because father does not care for gossip or grandees. He has other pursuits. I can <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> dear mother's articles. There's one called 'Unconscious Volition,' and another on the 'Progress of Species.' I'll bring them down next time I come.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a good deal; but I am very, very thankful {{it was no}} worse. And now I must <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the plants}} I {{have been trying to}} bring up since I came here," [...] said Milly, with animation. [...] "Of course, I cannot walk about to show them to you, so I will point them out, and ask you to fetch the pots--that is, if you have nothing better to do, and won't be bored." ...|$|E
30|$|For a pragmaticist, {{the strict}} {{morphological}} {{requirements of a}} case inventory in the structuralist tradition have {{very little to do}} with the way a language functions. Similarly, pragmatics prefers to define linguistic categories and the changes that they incur over time, using functional, not morphological criteria. Let me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> examples <b>of</b> a category which is famous for its protean character: the article (definite or indefinite).|$|R
6000|$|... "Dry your tears, girl," [...] he said roughly, {{although}} {{the thickness of}} his voice suggested that water and his own eyes were not far apart. [...] "What must be, must be, and {{now is the time}} for that God <b>you</b> worship to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> mark <b>of</b> favour. Surely, He should do so, seeing how long and how often you pray to Him in burrows that a jackal would turn from." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that {{we shall}} be able to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> {{practical}} appreciation <b>of</b> your thoughtfulness. I know nothing so stimulating to the appetite as politics, and to-day we have been so busy that I missed even my afternoon tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|But if {{she said}} it, what would follow? Prompt and instant dismissal. And Patty? The {{thought of the}} little sister quelled the storm in Marcella's soul. For Patty's sake she must control her temper--and she did. With an effort that left her white and tremulous she crushed back the hot words and said quietly: [...] "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Liddell. I {{did not mean to}} be inattentive. Let me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> our new {{lingerie}} waists, I think you will like them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{very kind}} of you indeed, Mr. Pratt," [...] Morse {{declared}} heartily. [...] "I have a heavy mail to attend to this morning, so if you'll excuse me I'll be getting on with it now," [...] he added, rising to his feet. [...] "I have ordered the car for you and Lord Felixstowe. You will find the chauffeur an exceedingly intelligent man, and he will take you around New York and <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things you ought to see. I should suggest luncheon at the Ritz-Carlton or the Plaza." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{where the}} white lord sends you," [...] {{she said in}} an {{indifferent}} voice, [...] "carrying with you these packages. I do not know where it is, but these man-eaters will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the way, and if you fail in the business but live to come back again, you shall be sacrificed to Bonsa at the next feast; if you run away then your wives and children will be sacrificed. Food shall be given you for your journey, and gold to buy more when it is gone. Now, Vernoon, tell them what they have to do." ...|$|E
60|$|Q. Will <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me <b>some</b> <b>of</b> those reasons?--A. Yes; One is, by {{a sincere}} and hearty {{confession}} of sin thou acknowledgest God to be thy Sovereign Lord, {{and that he}} hath right to impose his law upon thee (Exo 20).|$|R

"Now, I should think," [...] pursued Mrs. Follingsbee, [...] "that a {{woman who}} really loved her husband would be thankful to have him have such a rest from the {{disturbing}} family cares which smother a man's genius, as a house like ours offers him. How can the artistic nature exercise itself in the very grind of the thing, when this child has a cold, and the other the croup; and there is fussing with mustard-paste and ipecac and paregoric,--all those realities, you know? Why, Charlie tells me he feels {{a great deal more}} affection for his children when he is all calm and tranquil in the little boudoir at our house; and he writes such lovely little poems about them, I must <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them. But this creature doesn't appreciate them a bit: she has no poetry in her." ...|$|E
60|$|My patron, {{making a}} kind of an {{invitation}} to me to walk, took me up that dark chasm, or opening, on the right hand, which I have just mentioned. Here, sir, said he, if you will venture to walk a few steps, it is likely we may <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the product of this country; but, recollecting that night was approaching, he added, I see it is too dark; perhaps it will be better to defer it till the morning. Accordingly, we walked back towards the place where we had left our mules and servants, and, when we came thither, there was a complete camp fixed, three very handsome tents raised, and a bar set up at a distance, where the mules were tied one to another to graze, and the servants and the baggage lay together, with an open tent over them.|$|E
6000|$|Oct. 27, 1863.--If {{any of the}} {{soldiers}} I know (or their parents or folks) should call upon you--as they are often anxious to have my address in Brooklyn--you just use them as you know how, and {{if you happen to}} have pot-luck, and feel to ask them to take a bite, don't be afraid to do so. I have a friend, Thomas Neat, 2d N.Y. Cavalry, wounded in leg, now home in Jamaica, on furlough; he will probably call. Then possibly a Mr. Haskell, or some of his folks, from western New York: he had a son died here, and I was with the boy a good deal. The old man and his wife have written me and ask'd me my Brooklyn address; he said he had children in New York, and was occasionally down there. (When I come home I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the letters I get from mothers, sisters, fathers, &c. They will make you cry.) ...|$|E

If you like, I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> tracings <b>of</b> <b>some</b> letters which I {{discovered}} in Mr. de Valentin's portfolio.

6000|$|WISE. Yes, that I will; {{and first}} I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> {{symptoms}} <b>of</b> pride of heart. Pride of heart {{is seen by}} outward things, as pride of body in general {{is a sign of}} pride of heart; for all proud gestures of the body flow from pride of heart; therefore Solomon saith, 'There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes, and their eye-lids are lifted up' (Prov 30:13). And again, there is 'that exalteth his gait,' his going (Prov 17:19). Now, these lofty eyes, and this exalting of the gait, is a sign of a proud heart; for both these actions come from the heart. For out of the heart comes pride, in all the visible appearances of it (Mark 7). But more particularly-- ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the most}} {{important}} chapter of this book. In this chapter, we cover all the nuances the programmer should know when porting an existing CGI script to work under mod_perl, or when writing one from scratch. This chapter’s main goal is to teach the reader how to think in mod_perl. It involves showing most of the mod_perl peculiarities and possible traps the programmer might fall into. It also <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things that are impossible with vanilla CGI but easily done with mod_perl. Before You Start to Code There are three important things you need to know before you start your journey in a mod_perl world: how to access mod_perl and related documentation, and how to develop your Perl code when the strict and warnings modes are enabled. Accessing Documentation mod_perl doesn’t tolerate sloppy programming. Although we’re confident that you’re a talented, meticulously careful programmer whose programs run perfectly every time, you still might want to tighten up <b>some</b> <b>of</b> your Perl programming practices. In this chapter, we include discussions that rely on prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>some</b> areas <b>of</b> Perl, and we provide short refreshers where necessary. We assume that you can already program in Perl and that you are comfortable with finding Perl-related infor-mation in books and Perl documentation. There are many Perl books that you may find helpful. We list <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these in the reference sections {{at the end of each}} chapter. If you prefer the documentation that comes with Perl, you can use either its online version (start a...|$|R

So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when I shall <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his more inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity, {{and be ready to}} abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials then?

"Father {{says that}} you are only passing through Tasajara to-day, as you did through Sidon five years ago," [...] {{she said with a}} smiling earnestness that he fancied however was the one new phase of her character.

You see, we have not forgotten it if you have, Mr. Grant. And unless you want us to believe that your fairy gifts will turn some day to leaves and ashes, you will promise to stay with us tonight, and let me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the good we have done with them. Perhaps you don't know, or don't want to know, that it was I who got up this 'Library and Home Circle of the Sisters of Tasajara' which we are to open to-day. And can you imagine why? You remember--or have you forgotten--that you once affected to be concerned at the social condition of the young ladies on the plains of Sidon? Well, Mr. Grant, this is gotten up in order that the future Mr. Grants who wander may find future Miss Billingses who are worthy to converse with them and entertain them, and who no longer wear men's hats and live on the public road." ...|$|E

Now take the rest of these people here at the farm--nice folks, you understand, mighty well-traveled, broad-gauged, intelligent folks, and all that. There's a Mr. and Mrs. Cannon; he's some kind of an executive in the Chicago stock-yards--nice, fat, responsible job. And he was saying to me, 'Mr. Schwirtz,' he says, 'Mrs. C. and I had never been to New England till this summer, but we'd toured every other part of the country, and we've done Europe thoroughly and put in a month doing Florida, and now,' he says, 'I think we can say we've seen every point of interest that's worth an American's time.' They're good American people like that, well-traveled and nice folks. But books--Lord! they can't talk about books no more than a Jersey City bartender. So you can imagine how pleased I was to find you here.... World's pretty small, all right. Say, I just got here yesterday, so I suppose we'll be here about the same length o' time. If you wouldn't think I was presumptuous, I'd like mighty well to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the country around here. We could get up a picnic party, ten or a dozen of us, and go up on Bald Knob and see the scenery and have a real jolly time. And I'd be glad to take you down to Lesterhampton--there's a real old-fashioned inn down there, they say, where Paul Revere stayed one time; they say you can get the best kind of fried chicken and corn on cob and real old-fashioned New England blueberry pie.

With a howl of pain, the man turned and fled, Momaya {{pursuing}} him and beating him across the shoulders, through the gateway and up the length of the village street, to the intense amusement of the warriors, the women, and the children who were so fortunate as to witness the spectacle, for one and all feared Rabba Kega, and to fear is to hate.|$|R
