5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both experiments were most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self. These feelings leak out to stimuli that are closely associated with the self, not just names and birthdates, but also, implicitly, their constituent letters and numbers. The researchers suggested that the effect is <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> higher numbers because in daily life these numbers are less saturated with other meanings, other than their associations with birthdays.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{widespread}} fady about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption {{because of their}} resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or orthograde posture. The resemblance is even <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as babakoto ("Ancestor of Man"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur fady include the belief that a wife will have ugly children if her husband kills a woolly lemur, or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that people younger than 40 years also show a reminiscence bump. It was initially hidden {{because of the}} possibility of the recency effect. When researchers examined the encoding values, it showed a progressive increase with participant age around the reminiscence bump for participants older than 50. This proves that the reminiscence bump is <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> older adults than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|While {{atypical}} {{gender role}} development may be heritable, {{this does not}} mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society’s negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> boys than girls in terms of atypical development.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Fritzsche and Arnqvist tested Bateman’s Principle by {{estimating}} {{sexual selection}} {{between males and}} females in four seed beetles. They used a unique experimental design that showed sexual selection to be greater in males than in females. In contrast, sexual selection was also shown to be <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> females in role-reversed species. They suggested that the Bateman gradient is typically the most accurate and informative measure of sexual selection between different sexes and species (Fritzsche, K. & Arnqvist, G).|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> negative events. Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E
25|$|Kinetic isotope {{effects are}} common in {{biological}} systems and are especially important for hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry. Kinetic effects usually result in larger fractionations than equilibrium reactions. In any isotope system, kinetic effects are <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> larger mass differences. Light isotopes in most systems also tend to move faster but form weaker bonds. At high temperatures, entropy explains a large signal in isotope composition. However, when temperature decreases isotope effects are more expressed and randomness plays less of a role. These general trends are exposed in further understanding of bond breaking, diffusion or effusion, and condensation or evaporation reactions.|$|E

25|$|Positive self-perception {{of health}} has been {{correlated}} with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly. Various reasons {{have been proposed}} for this association; people who are objectively healthy may naturally rate their health better than that of their ill counterparts, though this link has been observed even in studies which have controlled for socioeconomic status, psychological functioning and health status. This finding is generally <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> men than women, though the pattern between genders is not universal across all studies and some results suggest sex-based differences only appear in certain age groups, for certain causes of mortality and within a specific sub-set of self-ratings of health.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2008, all of the {{original}} 50 states quarters had been minted and released. The official total, according to the US Mint, was 34,797,600,000 coins. The average mintage was 695,952,000 coins per state, but ranged between Virginia's 1,594,616,000 to Oklahoma's 416,600,000. Demand was <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> quarters issued early in the program. This was due to weakening economic conditions in later years and the waning of the initial surge of demand when the program was launched. Another factor was the reassertion of the Treasury Department's opposition to the program. When the director's term ended in 2000, the Treasury proceeded to reduce and finally terminate the most effective elements of the Mint's promotional program despite the high return on investment they earned.|$|E

When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America's shield with his bare hands. Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor's hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents him with his reforged shield, now <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears.

25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A {{is that it is}} <b>stronger</b> <b>for</b> ms = ±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in a very useful manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532nbsp&nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. For a spin state with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E and then go back to original state. However, for a spin state with ms = ±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non-radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing.|$|E

Use of taunt moves can reduce the opponent's power gauge, slow down their manual charging, and stop them reaching the maximum level.|$|E
