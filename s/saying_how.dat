Ekotaksi taxi company stated how Uber would be breaking state laws about offering passenger transport service, <b>saying</b> <b>how</b> Uber drivers have no obligation to maintain passenger safety and service quality. Cammeo taxi service stated how if they themselves invest in their drivers, issue fiscalized receipts, pay VAT, that in that case they consider Uber to be unfair competition that is breaking many laws. Večernji list reported ORaH and the taxi services were planning an open letter to the Zagreb city council to prevent Uber from coming to the Croatian capital. In October 2015, Uber initiated service in Zagreb. In June 2016, the service also started operating in the coastal cities of Split and Dubrovnik, two important tourist locations. In September 2016, Jutarnji list reported that a group of taxi drivers attacked a Uber driver who was waiting for a passenger at the Zagreb Airport. The Uber driver canceled the drive before the passenger arrived and drove away, with the attackers following him. The attack was filmed by the victim and reported to the police.|$|E

They entertain the followers and all sing of how Galitsky and his men abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, <b>saying</b> <b>how</b> she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E
25|$|Nyastadaṇḍam (Sanskrit: न्यस्तदण्डम्). While Paraśurāma {{is on his}} pilgrimage, Sahasrārjuna's sons – the Haihaya princes, {{attack the}} Āśrama of Jamadagni to avenge their father's killing. The princes run down {{everything}} and everybody that comes their way. Jamadagni is in deep meditation when he is beheaded by the princes, who take his severed head with them to Māhiṣmatī. When Paraśurāma returns, he sees the Āśrama strewn with corpses. He then sees an inconsolable Reṇukā crying near the torso of Jamadagni. When Reṇukā sees Paraśurāma, she beats her chest 21 times <b>saying</b> <b>how</b> could the Haihaya kings kill her husband with Paraśurāma still alive. Paraśurāma places Jamadagni's torso in a boat filled with oil and asks Reṇukā to protect his father's body till he is back. The enraged Paraśurāma goes to Māhiṣmatī all alone and calls out to the Haihayas. He kills their entire army and annihilates the Haihaya race. He then brings back Jamadagni's severed head and attaches it to the torso. Jamadagni is resurrected. Paraśurāma annihilates the race of Kṣatriyas 21 times from the earth, leaving out the dynasties of Raghu and Yadu. After killing 12,000 kings, Paraśurāma creates five huge lakes of blood in Kurukṣetra. Finally, on {{the request of the}} sage Kaśyapa, Paraśurāma gives up anger and gives all the lands on the earth to Kaśyapa. He then goes to the Mahendra mountain to perform penance.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Telegraph and the Athenaeum, however, {{greeted the}} opera with only mixed praise. The Musical Times {{complained that the}} ongoing {{collaboration}} between Gilbert and Sullivan was [...] "detrimental to the art-progress of either" [...] because, although it was popular with audiences, [...] "something higher is demanded for what is understood as 'comic opera'". The paper commented that Sullivan had [...] "the true elements of an artist, which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition". It concluded, however, by <b>saying</b> <b>how</b> much it enjoyed the opera: [...] "Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art-critics, let us at once proceed to say that H.M.S. Pinafore is an amusing piece of extravagance, and that the music floats it on merrily to the end". The Times {{and several of the}} other papers agreed that, while the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art. Only The Figaro was actively hostile to the new piece. Upon the publication of the vocal score, a review by The Academy joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for Pinafore and hoped that he would turn to projects [...] "more worthy of his great ability". This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.|$|E

The album was their first release to be certified platinum, (with Echo Park going platinum later on). It also spawned their second top 10 single, with [...] "Just the Way I'm Feeling" [...] in January 2003. In December of the same year they took on their only arena tour, after the album's first nationwide tour was a sell out with 50,000 tickets sold, and visited 21 different towns and cities in the United Kingdom over 23 different dates.

[...] O'Connor showed ambivalence towards [...] "Right for Me" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River", noting the former as [...] "awkward" [...] and the latter as [...] "a lousy Aaliyah impression." [...] Tyler Martin from Stylus Magazine deemed [...] "Señorita" [...] and [...] "Like I Love You" [...] as the record's highlights, while writing that the album does not maintain Timberlake's masculine persona, but still [...] "paints {{a picture of a}} complicated young man, growing into adulthood".

Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed the only noticeable tracks are [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and [...] "Rock Your Body", noting the latter as [...] "predictable", while criticising the album's lyrics as being [...] "suggestive mumbling". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that Timberlake [...] "shamelessly borrows from Jacko, from the Thriller-era", going on to criticize his vocals as to lack substance, with his falsetto lacking character.|$|E
