50|$|An RF {{anechoic}} chamber is usually {{built into a}} <b>screened</b> <b>room,</b> designed using the Faraday cage principle. This is {{because most of the}} RF tests that require an {{anechoic chamber}} to minimize reflections from the inner surfaces also require the properties of a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> to attenuate unwanted signals penetrating inwards and causing interference to the equipment under test and prevent leakage from tests penetrating outside.|$|E
50|$|A careful {{assessment}} may {{be required}} {{as to whether the}} test equipment (as opposed to the equipment under test) should be placed inside or outside the chamber. Typically most of it is located in a separate <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> attached to the main test chamber, in order to shield it from both external interference and from the radiation within the chamber. Mains power and test signal cabling into the test chamber require high quality filtering.|$|E
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of {{political}} prisoners from the various countries under Nazi occupation, the German political prisoners found contacts {{with members of the}} respective national organizations. The International Camp Committee (ICC) was organized under the leadership of the German Communist, Walter Bartel and it became the conspiratorial center of political anti-Nazi resistance at the camp in July 1943. The founding and meeting place of the ICC was a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> in the infirmary.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unclear}} {{precisely}} when the Bachelor's Hall was removed and a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> inserted on the north-western {{corner of the}} house. The Hall is visible in a 1908 photograph, but another taken in 1930 reveals {{that it had been}} removed by then. Also, the narrow verandah originally built onto the east-facing end of the later wing had been enclosed by 1907. A guest cottage built equidistant between the servants' quarters and kitchen must have been constructed at some time following the demolition of Bachelor's Hall in the early 20th century.|$|E

50|$|In plan, a long {{sitting room}} {{extends from the}} {{south-western}} {{corner of the house}} toward the north. The main bedroom caps this wing. Both rooms open onto a long, deep verandah, which overlooks the lagoon to the west, and onto a smaller verandah on the eastern facade. The width of the bedroom has incorporated this smaller, east-facing verandah. On the northern end of this wing a comparatively narrow verandah separates the main bedroom from a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> on the north-west corner and a further room between it and a corrugated iron water tank on the north-east corner. Both these rooms have individual gabled roofs of corrugated iron, the ridges of which run perpendicular to the length of this wing.|$|E

50|$|An {{electromagnetic}} reverberation chamber (also {{known as}} a reverb chamber (RVC) or mode-stirred chamber (MSC)) is an environment for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing and other electromagnetic investigations. Electromagnetic reverberation chambers have been introduced first by H.A. Mendes in 1968. A reverberation chamber is <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> {{with a minimum of}} absorption of electromagnetic energy. Due to the low absorption very high field strength can be achieved with moderate input power. A reverberation chamber is a cavity resonator with a high Q factor. Thus, the spatial distribution of the electrical and magnetic field strengths is strongly inhomogeneous (standing waves). To reduce this inhomogeneity, one or more tuners (stirrers) are used. A tuner is a construction with large metallic reflectors that can be moved to different orientations in order to achieve different boundary conditions. The Lowest Usable Frequency (LUF) of a reverberation chamber depends {{on the size of the}} chamber and the design of the tuner. Small chambers have a higher LUF than large chambers.|$|E
50|$|The {{third floor}} houses the {{academic}} {{offices of the}} Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, which provides a new base for the research activities in astronomy and astrophysics with the relocation of many staff and students from Jodrell Bank Observatory. The Observatory now forms part of the JBCA and provides leading observational facilities such as the Lovell Telescope and the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). This floor differs in design from the others in that the rooms have windows onto the atrium and glass walls to central corridors in each wing whilst retaining glass walled walkways across the atrium. The astrophysics seminar room is named after Sir Bernard Lovell, founder of Jodrell Bank Observatory. The fourth floor contains a number of labs, an RFI <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> and clean room, all for astrophysics instrumentation construction, such as receivers for the Lovell Telescope and the Planck spacecraft. In January 2008 the Project Design Office for the Square Kilometre Array relocated to Manchester to be hosted by the JBCA, co-ordinating the global efforts in constructing the next generation radio telescope.|$|E
50|$|Faraday cages cannot block stable or slowly varying {{magnetic}} fields, {{such as the}} Earth's {{magnetic field}} (a compass will still work inside). To a large degree, though, they shield the interior from external electromagnetic radiation if the conductor is thick enough and any holes are significantly smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For example, certain computer forensic test procedures of electronic systems that require an environment free of electromagnetic interference {{can be carried out}} within a <b>screened</b> <b>room.</b> These rooms are spaces that are completely enclosed by one or more layers of a fine metal mesh or perforated sheet metal. The metal layers are grounded to dissipate any electric currents generated from external or internal electromagnetic fields, and thus they block a large amount of the electromagnetic interference. See also electromagnetic shielding. They provide less attenuation from outgoing transmissions versus incoming: they can shield EMP waves from natural phenomena very effectively, but a tracking device, especially in upper frequencies, may be able to penetrate from within the cage (e.g., some cell phones operate at various radio frequencies so while one cell phone may not work, another one will).|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} characterising the {{frequency}} response of a non-ideal radiated emissions test site is {{proposed in the}} paper. The method uses a purpose built reference source (10 MHz comb generator) to determine frequency ranges that are adversely affected by resonances in a non-ideal radiated test environment. Reasons for wanting to characterise a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> are outlined, {{from the perspective of}} performing radiated emissions tests in an unlined room across the frequency range 30 - 1000 MHz. The results of a trial using the proposed method on a particular <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> are presented and discussed. Limitations of the proposed method are considered and the results are interpreted in the context of using the unlined room for radiated emission tests. 1...|$|E

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} propagation in an electrically large resonant chamber (a <b>screened</b> <b>room)</b> was simulated by two models: {{a statistical}} combination of multiple resonant modes and a computational electromagnetic simulation [the transmission line matrix (TLM) method]. The {{purpose of this}} work {{was to investigate the}} effects of passengers and windows on electromagnetic fields (EMF) in aircraft and other vehicles. Comparison of the multimode models with measurements made in a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> showed that as the electromagnetic losses increased, the transmission between two internal antennas was reduced, and there were fewer turning points in its frequency response. The autocorrelation of this frequency response provided a useful estimate of the composite Q-factor of the resonances and showed that the Q of the chamber was reduced from a value of the order of 10 000 when emptied to 1000 when windows were added and when filled with people to 100. The TLM simulation provided further useful information about the statistical variation of electric field strength with position...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) {{problems}} may occur in many environments. This Thesis considers a particular sub-set of coupling within shielded enclosures. The actual systems studied are the coupling between a dipole and either {{one or two}} rods in a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> {{and the effect of}} a cavity and apertures on a signal travelling along a wire. Experiments are described for the <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> which investigate the repeatability of the measurements and the effects of two closely spaced conductors on the coupling results. The cavity experiments also consider the repeatability of the measurements and the effects of the apertures. Transmission-Line Modelling (TLM) is compared with some other popular modelling methods and generally described. It is applied to the modelling of the experimental systems already discussed. An inherent error associated with the modelling of wires in TLM, manifesting itself as an apparent decrease in the resonant frequency of a wire-like structure, is investigated. The source of the error is deduced and a method of minimising it is proposed. The experimental results are applied to the validation of TLM, and its error correction. Very good comparisons between the experiments and simulations are reported. Correlelograms are investigated as a method of comparing the modelled and experimental results...|$|E

S-parameters measurements on specifically inserted observation ports are used instead of invasive sensors.

Emphasis is placed on visualizing common-mode currents and magnetic fields, which have bearing on the best type of connection to be used.

40|$|The transmission-line {{modelling}} (TLM) {{method is}} applied to 3 -dimensional problems in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The method {{is found to be}} a versatile tool which is ideally suited to the modelling of many EMC systems. A new way of deriving the scattering properties of the TLM node is presented and the derivation of mesh parameters, the application of boundary conditions and methods of applying excitation and of taking outputs are described. Issues regarding the efficient implementation of the TLM algorithm and a way of running very large simulations are reported. A multigrid method is introduced which allows meshes of different resolutions to be connected together to form a complete system. The method is used to apply fine resolution only in areas where it is required and to move numerical boundaries away from the region of interest. Comparisons are made with the more traditional graded mesh technique, using the hybrid node. Results are presented for a number of different systems with particular emphasis on the environment in which radiated emission tests are undertaken, although more general systems are also considered. The consequences of making measurements in an unlined <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> are discussed and ways of damping resonances are investigated. Wire, slot and spherical dipole antennas are modelled. Field-to-wire coupling, the TEM cell, a simplified device under test, the shielding properties of a vehicle body and the current induced by a simplified table-top device are also considered. Techniques are developed to obtain the Q factor of a <b>screened</b> <b>room</b> loaded with radiation absorbing material (RAM) and to obtain the radiation resistance of an antenna in free-space and also in close proximity to conducting surfaces...|$|E
