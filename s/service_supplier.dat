3000|$|In this study, {{we design}} two {{scenarios}} {{in order to}} illustrate the effects of trade liberalization in services sectors on trade flows {{by means of the}} STRI policy simulator. The first scenario focuses on the liberalization of the movement of people by removing quotas for independent <b>services</b> <b>suppliers,</b> for contractual <b>services</b> <b>suppliers</b> and for intra-corporate transferees, as well as labor market tests for intra-corporate transferees. The second scenario assumes all changes made in the first scenario as well as additional sector-specific liberalizations. In legal services and accounting services, the provision that foreign providers have to completely re-do the university degree, practice, and exam in the domestic country is reversed. Further, in telecommunications, courier services, and commercial banking, the government’s control over one major firm in the sector is suspended. Moreover, in computer services and air transport, the limitation on stays for independent <b>services</b> <b>suppliers,</b> for contractual <b>services</b> <b>suppliers,</b> and for intra-corporate transferees is increased from 12  months to more than 36  months. 14 [...]...|$|R

The performance of the contact <b>services</b> <b>supplier</b> directly affects end customer satisfaction which underlines the need for appropriate management of customer contacts and consideration of the end customer's perspective in designing appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs).
