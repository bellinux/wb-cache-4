Universal categories - History and Truth - work as a general scheme of discourse. They are examined in their widest meaning and in the ultimate concrete sense. As {{has been shown in}} the conclusion both universals are equally important for historical research as well as for theological. Both academic disciplines expose given generalities from their own point of view accomplishing thereby their mission. In the ﬁrst part the contemplation is devoted to survey, identiﬁcation and deﬁnition of some integrated theological method that could be found in diﬀerent theological systems as the most general tool for this type of science. There are the following versions: method of subalternation, method of referring, method of hermeneutical referring, method of correlation, transcendental method. The author proceeds proposing detection and identiﬁcation of ﬁ ve principles of theological operation with their proper representations: confessionality, historicity, twofold contextuality, veriﬁcation and systemacy. This part is of the most innovative nature: selection and deﬁnition of this ﬁve principals is a result of multiple discussions in various <b>scientiﬁc</b> <b>colloquiums</b> and conferences with high rate of representativeness. Moreover these systematic propositions could be used not only in the theological ﬁ eld but also in other humanities with relevant content.

40|$|Emission {{relativistic}} coordinates are a {{class of}} spacetime coordinates defined and generated by four emitters (satellites, pulsars) broadcasting their proper time by radio signals. They are the main ingredient of the simplest conceivable relativistic positioning system. The emission coordinates are independent of any observer. Receiving directly the proper time at emission of four satellites, any user or observer can measure {{the values of the}} emission coordinates, from which he/she can obtain his trajectory and hence, in particular, his position. Moreover, if and only if the four satellites also broadcast to the users the proper times they are receiving by cross-link autonavigation from the other emitters, the positioning system is called autolocated or autonomous. In an autolocated positioning system the trajectories of the satellites of the constellation can also be known by the users and they can also obtain the metric of the spacetime (the gravitational field) on the constellation. The study of autolocated relativistic positioning systems has been initiated by Coll and coll. several years ago and it has been aimed for developing an exact fully relativistic theory of positioning systems and gravimetry, based on the framework and concepts of General Relativity. This exact relativistic framework is the alternative to considering post-newtonian relativistic corrections in a classical Newtonian framework, which is the customary approach yet now used in GPS and GLONASS.

40|$|The use of GNSS signals as {{a source}} of {{opportunity}} for remote sensing applications, GNSS-R, has been a research area of interest for more than a decade. One of the possible applications of this technique is soil moisture monitoring. The retrieval of soil moisture with GNSS-R systems is based on the variability of the ground dielectric properties associated to soil moisture. Higher concentrations of water in the soil yield a higher dielectric constant and reflectivity, which incurs in signals that reflect from the Earth surface with higher peak power. Previous investigations have demonstrated the capability of GPS bistatic scatterometers to obtain high enough signal to noise ratios in order to sense small changes in surface reflectivity. Furthermore, these systems present some advantages with respect to others currently used to retrieve soil moisture. Upcoming satellite navigation systems, such as the European Galileo, will represent an excellent source of opportunity for soil moisture remote sensing for various reasons. First, the existence of pilot signals will provide the possibility to extend coherent integration times, which will contribute to the increase of received signals SNR. In addition, the availability of Galileo L 1 and L 5 signals will allow the multi-spectral analysis of the reflected signals and the development of inversion models which will be able to account more precisely for adverse effects, such as surface roughness and vegetation canopy. In this paper we present some of the recent theoretical work and experiments carried out at Starlab focusing on the development of dedicated Soil Moisture GNSS-R systems.
