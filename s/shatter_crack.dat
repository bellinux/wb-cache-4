50|$|Flakes and <b>shatter</b> <b>cracks</b> are {{internal}} fissures seen {{in large}} forgings. Hydrogen picked up during melting and casting segregates at internal voids and discontinuities and produces these defects during forging. Fish-eyes are bright patches named for their appearance seen on fracture surfaces, generally of weldments. Hydrogen enters the metal during fusion-welding and produces this defect during subsequent stressing. Steel containment vessels exposed to extremely high hydrogen pressures develop small fissures or micro perforations through which fluids may leak.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Shattered</b> rim <b>cracking,</b> {{propagation}} of a subsurface crack {{parallel to the}} tread sur-face, {{is one of the}} dominant railroad wheel failure types observed in North America. This crack initiation and propagation life depends on several factors, such as wheel rim thickness, wheel load, residual stresses in the rim, and the size and location of material defects in the rim. This article investigates the effect of the above-mentioned parameters on <b>shattered</b> rim <b>cracking,</b> using finite element analysis and fracture mechanics. This cracking is modelled using a three-dimensional, multiresolution, elastic–plastic finite element model of a railroad wheel. Material defects are modelled as mathematically sharp cracks. Rolling contact loading is simulated by applying the wheel load on the tread surface over a Hertzian contact area. The equivalent stress intensity factor ranges at the subsurface crack tips are estimated using uni-modal stress intensity factors obtained from the finite element analysis and a mixed-mode crack growth model. The residual stress and wheel wear effects are also included in modelling <b>shattered</b> rim <b>cracking.</b> The analysis results show that the sensitive depth below the tread surface for <b>shattered</b> rim <b>cracking</b> ranges from 19. 05 to 22. 23 mm, which is in good agreement with field observations.

30|$|First, the {{widespread}} shattering {{has been found}} in many coseismic landslides in the study area, and appears to be especially severe in slopes on the hanging wall (Huang and Li 2009 and Chigira et al. 2010). It has also been reported from the epicentral area of many earthquakes (Brune 2001). Numerous cracks were found in many coseismic landslides, reflecting the intensive <b>shattering</b> and <b>cracking.</b> The long duration seismic shaking can largely reduce the shear strength of the substrate and even cause liquefaction of saturated material in some cases (e.g. the Xiejiadianzi landslide). Liquefaction phenomena have also been observed in other earthquake regions, for example, in the San Francisco Bay area during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (Kayen et al. 1998) and in Niigata, Japan during the 2004 Mid-Niigata Prefecture earthquake (Sassa 2005).|$|R

The low boiling point of zinc and fast cooling of newly cast parts often trap air bubbles within the cast part, weakening it. Many components common in pot metal are susceptible to corrosion from airborne acids and other contaminants, and internal corrosion of the metal often causes decorative plating to flake off. Pot metal is not easily glued, soldered, or welded.|$|R

40|$|Non-destructive {{inspection}} of railroad wheels is performed in maintenance shops, where wheels are removed and inspected individually. No technique is yet {{available to the}} railroad industry to perform wayside inspections of wheels on a moving train. The characteristics of laser and air-coupled ultrasound are discussed to justify {{the use of a}} laser-air hybrid ultrasonic technique. Laser generation of ultrasound is combined with air-coupled detection to provide a flexible non-contact and remote technique that would enable the railroad industry to perform wayside inspections of moving railroad wheels. The present paper describes Proof of Concept set-up and results of the experiments performed at the Transportation Technology Center facilities, in Pueblo, Colorado. Sensors are used to detect the position of the wheel, drive a two-position mirror to direct the laser beam to one of two test stations and trigger the laser when the wheel is in position for detection. Wheels are inspected for subsurface <b>shattered</b> rim <b>cracks,</b> thermal fatigue cracks along the tread and the flange areas of the wheel. Analysis is based on the time domain radio frequency (RF) signal and time-frequency wavelet transforms. The experimental results are promising, indicating that dynamic wayside inspections are possible with the laser-air hybrid ultrasonic technique...|$|R

2500|$|Winding gear is the {{mechanism}} which allows paddles {{to be lifted}} (opened) or lowered (closed). Typically, a square-section stub emerges from the housing of the winding gear. This is the axle of a sprocket ("pinion") which engages with a toothed bar ("rack") attached by rodding {{to the top of}} the paddle. A lock-keeper or member of the boat's shore crew engages the square socket of their windlass (see below) onto the end of the axle and turns the windlass perhaps a dozen times. This rotates the pinion and lifts the paddle. A pawl engages with the rack to prevent the paddle from dropping inadvertently while being raised, and to keep it raised when the windlass is removed, so that the operator can attend to other paddles. Nowadays it is considered discourteous and wasteful of water to leave a paddle open after a boat has left the lock, but in commercial days it was normal practice. To lower a paddle the pawl must be disengaged and the paddle wound down with the windlass. Dropping paddles by knocking the pawl off can cause damage to {{the mechanism}}; the paddle gear is typically made of cast iron and can <b>shatter</b> or <b>crack</b> when dropped from a height. In areas where water-wastage due to vandalism is a problem, (for example the Birmingham Canal Navigations), paddle mechanisms are commonly fitted with vandal-proof locks (nowadays rebranded [...] "water conservation devices") which require the boater to employ a key before the paddle can be lifted. The keys are officially known as [...] "water conservation keys", but boaters usually refer to them as T-keys, from their shape; handcuff keys because the original locks, fitted on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, resembled handcuffs; Leeds and Liverpool Keys after that canal; or simply Anti-Vandal Keys.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} oil spraying system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage <b>shatter</b> can be <b>cracked</b> due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, spraying angle, oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of oil spraying was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system. Originality/value: The computer simulation allows to better understand the interdependence betweenparameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Shattered {{rim wheel}} failures, {{although}} relatively rare in North American railway freight service, remain {{a major concern}} for railways and wheel manufacturers since such failures can occur under a train at high speed, and can result in dangerous, expensive derailments. <b>Shattered</b> rim fatigue <b>cracks</b> typically initiate and grow {{at a depth of}} 12 to 20 mm (1 / 2 to 3 / 4 inches) below the wheel tread surface. To help further reduce the incidence of these wheel failures, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) recently adopted a wheel steel microcleanliness specification based upon ASTM E 1245. A major North American railroad has used this microcleanliness evaluation method, which involves using quantitative image analysis techniques to analyze six polished metallographic samples removed from the wheel rim, for several years. Alternative effective methods of microcleanliness evaluation, which could be performed faster in-house, would be desirable from a wheel manufacturing point of view. This paper discusses the use of two alternative microcleanliness measurement methods, phased array ultrasonic testing and the Spark-Dat system, to determine the cleanliness of wheel steel samples. An ultrasonic evaluation of several wheel rims is first conducted to provide counts and sizes of indications within the rim. From this information an ultrasonic cleanliness determination is made. Next, the Spark-Dat system is described and the basic principles of its operation are reviewed. Samples removed from th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe common {{phenomena}} – cracks {{appearance on}} newly built reinforced concrete bridge structures - is being detected in Poland {{for several years}} now. That phenomena is regarded as threatening in case of bridge structures, {{despite the fact that}} reinforced concrete theory considers cracks as a standard concrete performance. Cracks are very likely to appear on concrete surface. Cracks are usually detected during concrete surface treatment before protective coating laying. Cracks appear on monolith structures, mainly at the slab spans and foreheads as well as, at support columns in a minor range. Concrete surface cracks openings reach up to 2 mm size. The experience gained throughout consulting works on cracked structures are discussed in that paper. The influence of concrete surface mechanical cleaning prior the protective coatings laying on the crack “visual” intensification was also discussed herein. Crack openings measurement rules, as well as the most common mistakes made during the crack measurements and their real value assessment were described in the paper. The maximal crack opening allowances fluctuations in Polish and European concrete Codes were also discussed here. It was proved that the spotted crack opening increase is caused by the codes changes and by bold reinforcing cover. The bold cover is regarded as the corrosion protection of reinforcing bars. The cover bold and crack opening allowance dependency was discussed in the paper. The effect of Euro codes and the Minister of Transport and Maritime Economy Ordnance from May 30 th 2000 titled “Technical requirements for highway engineering structures and their locations” simultaneous obligation on reinforced concrete structures cracks assessment was deliberated. At the conclusion the necessary modifications in crack assessment practice were claimed. The cracks should be assessed on the basis of homogenous code system. Their openings are dependent straight forward from the reinforcement cover thickness. One should avoid crack measurement at the sections, at which the crack edges are mechanically <b>shattered.</b> The <b>crack</b> opening assessment should be dependent on cover thickness. The rod anti shrinkage activity reaches the cover depth approximately to the depth equal to the rod diameter only. That fact should be taken under consideration during crack assessment...|$|R
