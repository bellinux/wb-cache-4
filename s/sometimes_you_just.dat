Lopez stated that: [...] "They all express {{different}} moments in love and that's what this album was about. You know, sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's amazing, sometimes overwhelming, <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> don't know what to do.

MTV News noted that on the songs, Lopez might be [...] "giving us some insight about what she was dealing with in her personal life in the months before it was released".|$|E
500|$|... "Boy Oh Boy" [...] is a 90s–influenced electropop {{song with}} dancehall and reggae elements. Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune." ...|$|E
500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr. When Gooden came to bat {{in the fifth}} inning, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball. Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money well spent. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to defend yourself and your teammates." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I can get {{in these}} existential mindsets where I'll get very philosophical," [...] says Tolchin. [...] "I'll {{want to know the}} answer, and I won’t want to rest until I find it.

The process of wondering {{is one of the most}} beautiful things about being human." ...|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{topic of}} the song itself is perhaps how two {{struggling}} musicians (Duritz and bassist Marty Jones of The Himalayans) [...] "want to be big stars," [...] believing that [...] "when everybody loves me, I will never be lonely." [...] Duritz would later recant these values, and in later concert appearances, [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] was played in a subdued acoustic style, if at all. On the live CD Across a Wire Duritz changes the lyrics [...] "We all wanna be big, big stars, but we got different reasons for that" [...] to [...] "We all wanna be big, big stars, but then we get second thoughts about that," [...] and [...] "when everybody loves <b>you,</b> <b>sometimes</b> that's <b>just</b> about as funky as you can be" [...] to [...] "when everybody loves <b>you,</b> <b>sometimes</b> that's <b>just</b> about as fucked up as you can be." ...|$|R

500|$|In October 2006, Cooper became {{engaged to}} actress Jennifer Esposito. The couple married later that December. In May 2007, Esposito filed {{for a divorce}} that was {{finalized}} in November. [...] "It was just something that happened. The good thing is, we both realized it. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> realize it", he has since explained. Before his marriage, he met Renée Zellweger while filming Case 39 in 2006. The media speculated {{about the nature of}} their relationship in 2009 when the film was released. Although they refused to speak about the romance, they made several appearances together, and in 2011, the media reported {{about the end of the}} relationship. In December 2011, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Zoe Saldana that ended in January 2013. In March 2013, he began dating English model Suki Waterhouse who is 17 years his junior. According to a report by E!, they broke up in March 2015 because of their age difference and Waterhouse's desire to focus on her career. Cooper began a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk the following month. In November, he moved into her apartment in New York's West Village. In March 2017, Shayk gave birth to their daughter.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, Jackson's brother Michael {{died at age}} fifty. She spoke {{publicly}} {{concerning his}} death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating [...] "I'd just like to say, to you, Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live {{in all of our}} hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much." [...] In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming Why Did I Get Married Too?. Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, [...] "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> need to get away for a second." [...] During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet [...] "Scream". MTV stated [...] "there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] The performance was lauded by critics, with Entertainment Weekly affirming the rendition [...] "as energetic as it was heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near {{as bad as the}} fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
50|$|To be {{immersed}} in the element that holds your quarry, bass sometimes swimming so close {{to you that you}} can kick them, feeling the raw power of a big bass pull you around, wrestling one on one with a big fish in their element is unreal. They don't give up when they're still in the water, and you can't lift a big bass out of the water when you're swimming, so it can become a friggen wrestling match until you get your hook out if the fish is still green. I always crush the barbs of my hooks for an easier release anyway, so <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> can <b>just</b> give them some slack and they'll release themselves if it's just a lip hook. With an 11' rod, you really have a lot more leverage than most would think, and with some practice you can horse a fish in (or pull yourself closer to it) rather quickly.|$|R

2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... <b>Sometimes</b> when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> take animals and do nothing else, perhaps that is not as strong a message." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Chris Thomas, who was present, the 9 September {{session was}} {{especially}} spirited: [...] "While Paul {{was doing his}} vocal, George Harrison had set fire to an ashtray and was running around the studio with it above his head, doing an Arthur Brown." [...] Starr's recollection is less detailed, but agrees in spirit: [...] "'Helter Skelter' was a track we did in total madness and hysterics in the studio. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> had to shake out the jams." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{mechanics}} reportedly came {{up by the}} 100 {{staff members}} working on the game. Ideas would be written on a post-it note, and afterward were evaluated. If the team liked the idea, they would implement it in-game {{to see if it}} works. Kenta Motokura, a director of the game stated [...] "We discussed and discarded a huge number of ideas during development - <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> can't tell if an idea is good or bad by looking at it on the drawing board; when this happens, we try it out in-game. If we don't find the idea fun, it won't make it into the final product. There was a lot of {{back and forth on the}} course designs due to this".|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Duff gained fame {{through her}} {{starring}} role in the Disney Channel series Lizzie McGuire. She became interested in pursuing a music career after attending a Radio Disney concert in 2001. [...] "There were all these pop acts backstage at the concert," [...] Duff explained. [...] "They were all getting ready backstage and warming up, and I was like, 'I {{want to do this}} so bad.'" [...] One day, Duff met Andre Recke, who would soon become her manager. She told him of her interest in becoming a singer and briefly performed for him. This prompted him to tell her, [...] "I want to work with you." [...] Recke said of his encounter with Duff, [...] "When I met Hilary, I knew she had something special. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have that feeling, that, 'Wow, she's a star.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Sargent (a {{close friend}} and {{photographer}} of the band) described their relationship as like [...] "first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that" [...] - adding [...] "I think there's, y'know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I've ever seen ... but <b>sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> think, God, why don't <b>you</b> <b>just</b> get a room?!" [...] In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded [...] "I love him. Wouldn't go, um - certainly not on Radio 1 - go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah." [...] Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything [...] "physical". Barât has insisted that [...] "people are really into conjecture" [...] and has frequently denied having {{a sexual relationship with}} Doherty. However, in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship he replied [...] "There have been moments in our relationship where physicality has ensued." ...|$|R

5000|$|To {{continue}} developing {{his second}} solo album, Cantrell enlisted drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Robert Trujillo of Ozzy Osbourne. The choice would deliberately refrain Cantrell from his Alice in Chains band mates and therefore distinguish his solo career from his past. He originally booked studio time with Dave Jerden, who produced Alice in Chains' first two albums; however, Cantrell fired him after two days, claiming [...] "It {{was just not}} working out personally[...] [...] Mike and Robert had hooked up with me and we had been through rehearsals, and {{we got into the}} studio with Dave and it all blew up on us on the second day. It took us months to get regrouped again[...] [...] He's a great guy and we did some great music together, but <b>sometimes</b> I guess <b>you</b> <b>just</b> can't go home." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Driver was {{financed by}} EMI Films who {{announced}} {{they would make}} a second film with Hill, a Western he wrote with Roger Spottiswoode, The Last Gun. However The Driver was a commercial failure in the US. [...] "To say it did not do well would be kind," [...] said Hill. [...] "Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States.

[...] Patton reiterated this sentiment in another 2003 interview with Australian newspaper The Age. While no official break-up announcement ever materialized, a 2004 Rolling Stone interview confirmed Mr. Bungle had disbanded with Patton revealing, “We could have probably squeezed out a couple more records but the collective personality of this group became so dysfunctional, this band was poisoned by one person's petty jealousy and insecurity, and it led us to a slow, unnatural death. And I'm at peace with that, because I know I tried all I could.” When asked about a possible reunion, Mike Patton said, [...] "It could happen, but I won’t be singing. Some bridges have definitely been burned. It was a fun time and <b>sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to move on. I’ve got a lot on my plate now." [...] Trevor Dunn added on his website, [...] "Bungle is dead and I'm happy about it" [...] and that [...] "the members of Mr. Bungle will never work together as such again".

60|$|After all, yellowhammers {{were the}} chief {{reliance}} in the chase; they were pre-occupied, unsuspecting birds, and lit on fence rails and dead trees, {{so that they}} were pretty easy to shoot. If you could bring home a yellowhammer you felt that you had something to show for your long day's tramp through the woods and fields, and for the five cents' worth of powder and five cents' worth of shot that you had fired off at other game. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> fired it off at mullein-stalks, or barns, or anything you came to. There were a good many things you could do with a gun; you could fire your ramrod out of it, and see it sail through the air; you could fill the muzzle up with water, {{on top of a}} charge, and send the water in a straight column at a fence. The boys all believed that you could fire that column of water right through a man, and they always wanted to try whether it would go through a cow, but they were afraid the owner of the cow would find it out. There was a good deal of pleasure in cleaning your gun when it got so foul that your ramrod stuck in it and you could hardly get it out. You poured hot water into the muzzle and blew it through the nipple, till it began to show clear; then you wiped it dry with soft rags wound on your gun-screw, and then oiled it with greasy tow. Sometimes the tow would get loose from the screw, and stay in the barrel, and then you would have to pick enough powder in at the nipple to blow it out. Of course I am talking of the old muzzle-loading shot-gun, which I dare say the boys never use nowadays.|$|E

Leyden has frequently said [...] "everyone has felt completely invisible once in their lifetime, and <b>sometimes</b> it's <b>just</b> <b>you</b> against the world", and that the song's lyrics paralleled the band's status as independent and unsigned. Leyden and Andrea have also called it [...] "the cornerstone for this band and where we come from", and it was produced by Tim Patalan.|$|R

Once its purpose was fulfilled it {{was ready for the}} trash, only to be dug up if you were really desperate…We became drug buddies: <b>sometimes,</b> <b>you</b> could even <b>just</b> about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when Mötley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I’d been mostly snorting or injecting.
