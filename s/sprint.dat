5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, <b>Sprint</b> {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of <b>Sprint</b> known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first <b>Sprint</b> Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. <b>Sprint</b> testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of using aquatic-based (AB) running when compared to land-based (LB) running to produce similar gains. However, most studies have primarily focused on deep-water running styles rather than shallow-water <b>sprinting.</b> PURPOSE: To compare lower extremity running kinematics of female college athletes in an AB shallow water <b>sprinting</b> environment and in a LB <b>sprinting</b> environment. METHODS: 15 female NCAA Division III athletes completed this investigation. Each subject participated in a shallow-water <b>sprinting</b> familiarization session and completed both AB and LB <b>sprinting</b> tests. All trials were video recorded from the right sagittal view. RESULTS: T-test pairwise comparisons revealed significant differences between LB <b>sprinting</b> and AB <b>sprinting.</b> Stride rates (SR) (p 3 ̆c 0. 000) were 1. 90 Hz(± 0. 11) for LB and 0. 97 Hz(± 0. 12) for AB. Significant differences were also found in stride length (SL) (p 3 ̆c 0. 000) between LB <b>sprinting</b> (2. 95 m± 0. 19) and AB <b>sprinting</b> (0. 88 m± 0. 21).

5|$|After Christmas, Neuner won both {{individual}} races in Oberhof – her World Cup wins 27 and 28. In the women’s relay, she incurred 4 penalties {{in the final}} shooting, which foiled a likely German victory. Neuner suffered {{one of the biggest}} mishaps of her career, when she fired on the wrong targets in the Nove Mesto pursuit, dropping from first to seventh place. She recovered quickly by winning the <b>sprint</b> race in Antholz one week later. In February, Neuner claimed a double <b>sprint</b> and pursuit victory in Oslo despite suffering from a cold, which forced her to withdraw from the mass start. At the last World Cup stop before the world championships in Kontiolahti, she reached her sixth <b>sprint</b> win of the season, and extended her World Cup lead over Darya Domracheva.|$|E

40|$|Performing <b>sprints</b> on a sand {{surface is}} a common {{training}} method for improving sprint-specific strength. For maximum specificity of training the athlete’s movement patterns during the training exercise should closely resemble those used when performing the sport. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the kinematics of <b>sprinting</b> at maximum velocity on a dry sand surface to the kinematics of <b>sprinting</b> on an athletics track. Five men and five women participated in the study, and flying <b>sprints</b> over 30 m were recorded by video and digitized using biomechanical analysis software. We found that <b>sprinting</b> on a sand surface was substantially different to <b>sprinting</b> on an athletics track. When <b>sprinting</b> on sand the athletes tended to ‘sit’ during the ground contact phase of the stride. This action was characterized by a lower centre of mass, a greater forward lean in the trunk, and an incomplete extension of the hip joint at take-off. We conclude that <b>sprinting</b> on a dry sand surface may not be an appropriate method for training the maximum velocity phase in <b>sprinting.</b> Although this training method exerts a substantial overload on the athlete, as indicated by reductions in running velocity and stride length, it also induces detrimental changes to the athlete’s running technique which may transfer to competition <b>sprinting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Conventionally {{motorized}} treadmills elicit different <b>sprinting</b> kinematics to the over-ground condition. Treadmills {{powered by}} a torque motor {{have been used to}} assess <b>sprinting</b> power; yet, the kinematics of <b>sprinting</b> on the torque treadmill are unknown. This study compares the <b>sprinting</b> kinematics, during the constant velocity phase, between a conventional treadmill, a torque treadmill and the over-ground condition to assess the suitability of each treadmill for <b>sprinting</b> studies and training. After familiarization, 13 recreationally active males performed multiple <b>sprints</b> at various experimental settings on each surface. Ninety <b>sprints,</b> which attained mean velocities over 7. 0 m/s, had their lower-body sagittal plane joint angles during ground contact captured at 250 Hz. These data were low-pass filtered at 10 Hz, and compared with respect to surface, subject and velocity using an ANCOVA statistical model. <b>Sprinting</b> on the conventional treadmill elicited a longer ground contact time, a longer braking phase, a more extended knee at foot strike and a faster extending hip than the torque treadmill and over-ground (all P< 0. 05). The torque treadmill obtained an equivalent <b>sprinting</b> technique to the over-ground condition, {{with the exception of a}} less extended hip at toe-off, suggesting that it is more appropriate for laboratory <b>sprinting</b> analyses and training than the conventional treadmill...|$|R

His seventh place finish in the semifinals, with a time of 10.27 seconds, eliminated him from competition. Adams also competed in the 200 meter <b>sprint,</b> finishing second in his heat with a time of 20.59 seconds, advancing to the semifinals. He was disqualified during the semifinals heat.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>Sprint</b> was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the <b>Sprint</b> launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a <b>Sprint</b> launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing <b>Sprint</b> missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate <b>sprint.</b> As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate <b>sprint,</b> with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the <b>sprint</b> to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the <b>sprint</b> and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E

At the season-opening Daytona 500, Hornish started 29th and finished 32nd (one lap behind). He had his first top-ten finish of the season (ninth place) at Phoenix, followed by six more throughout the year. Hornish's victory in the <b>Sprint</b> Showdown at Lowe's Motor Speedway qualified him for the 2009 NASCAR <b>Sprint</b> All-Star Race, where he started 19th and finished 16th.
