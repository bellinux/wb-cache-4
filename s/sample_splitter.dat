40|$|An {{improved}} Jones <b>sample</b> <b>splitter</b> {{is described}} which is faster to operate than the conventional type, yet requires no special skill or training. Samples obtained with this instrument are {{free from the}} occasional erratic samples obtained with ordinary Jones sample splitters. Working drawings are given for this improved <b>sample</b> <b>splitter,</b> which can be built with hand tools. The <b>sample</b> <b>splitter</b> was tested with small gravel, granules, and sand in which the percentage of each constituent was accurately known. Three series of 24 samples each were taken and sieved; in each series one detail of technique was varied. The components separated by sieving were returned to the original mixture in each test to keep {{the conditions of the}} experiment nearly constant. Summarized instruction are given for the best technique of operation. The second part of the paper deals with methods used to measure the performance of the improved <b>sample</b> <b>splitter.</b> The concept of a state of control is discussed. The calculations required to detect lack of constancy in the chance cause system, biased percentages, or the presence of a predominating cause of variation are shown. The principle that variability in comparable series of samples tends to diminish as the state of control is approached was found to apply in the present study. These methods of statistical analysis are very general and may be applied to field sampling studies or wherever quantitative measurements are made on a series of samples suspected of coming from an essentially homogeneous unit or constant chance cause system...|$|E

40|$|Two efficient, senti-automatic elutriators for {{assaying}} {{soil samples}} for nematodes are described. The first apparatus is a four-unit elutriator which combines conventional extraction methods {{with the following}} major features: atttomatic mixing of 500 - to 1, 500 -cm³ soil samples with water (± air); "turbinate" <b>sample</b> <b>splitters</b> from which fractions of 1 / 15 or greater are passed onto 26 - or 38 -μm sieves for collection of larvae and adult nematodes; the capacity for collecting roots, intact egg ntasses, and cysts on 250 - 425 -μm sieves; and a variable speed motorized sieve-shaker. Nematodes, after being collected on 38 -μm sieves, are separated from debris by centrifugation or by Baermann trays. Secondary features include: air cylinders, solenoid valves, and time clock for atttomatic dumpittg residual soil and water; relay-controlled coarse spray nozzles activated for 5 sec every 30 sec for washing nematodes through 250 - 425 -μm sieves; adjustable rates of water amt air flow, and tinting.

40|$|Reflectance {{spectroscopy}} in the visible, {{near and}} shortwave infrared (350 - 2500 nm) has been employed {{to study the}} spectral mineralogy of regolith materials. It {{has the advantage of}} being sensitive to both crystalline and amorphous materials, unlike some other diagnostic methods like X-ray diffraction (Clark 1999). However, the reflectance measured can be affected by sample preparation, particle size, sample concentration and optical geometry. CRC LEME, in collaboration with Genalysis Laboratory Services, has investigated the effects of some of the routine laboratory treatments on spectral mineralogy, such as drying, crushing and pulping (particle size). In one specific study, regolith materials from a diamond drill intersection taken from the Jaguar Cu-Zn-Ag deposit, 4 km south of Teutonic Bore in the Eastern Goldfields Province of the Yilgarn Craton, were used. The main ore body is approximately 250 m below surface. The regolith materials, spanning a depth of 130 m, comprise colluvium-alluvium overlying saprolite, saprock and bedrock (basaltic composition). All of the samples were dried at 121 °C before crushing and pulverising due to the presence of moist clay in the regolith samples that cause problems during preparation. The regolith materials were crushed to approximately 2 mm, to simulate chips, using a Boyd crusher and rotary <b>sample</b> <b>splitter.</b> One half of each sample was left as chips while the other half was pulverised to < 75 um.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores two {{roles of}} limited volume solutions formed by dropcasting or by spray-based ionization processes in mass spectrometry, 1) as microcontainers to allow monitoring of bulk reactions or 2) as microreactors {{in which to}} accelerate reactions. ^ Droplets derived from the bulk reaction phase {{can be used to}} monitor the reactions. An inductive electrospray mass spectrometry (iESI-MS) -based reaction monitoring system was built to use charged droplets emitted in the electric field of a pulsed DC potential to track chemical reactions in real time, including air and moisture-sensitive and heterogeneous reactions. Highly concentrated solutions can be monitored for long periods without the spray emitter clogging. Sheath gas assists in nebulization and a <b>sample</b> <b>splitter</b> reduces the delay time and minimizes contamination of the instrument. We applied this system in both a mechanistic study of Negishi cross-coupling of 3 -bromoquinoline with diethylzinc and in Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of 3, 4 -dimethoxy-benzaldehyde, as well as in process control of the synthetic route to an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). ^ The MS reaction monitoring system was further enhanced by an on-line quantitation device which allows the introduction of internal standards accurately without affecting the reaction or later product separation. It also allows dilution of aliquots of the reaction solution to different extents, so that the concentration of each analyte falls within the linear dynamic range (LDR), and it thus can be easily quantified. The reaction of L-arginine with N-(Cbz-isopropyl-aminoacyl) -benzotriazole to yield dipeptide Cbz-L-Val-L-Arg was successfully quantified using this system while its reaction kinetics were explored also. ^ Droplets formed by paper spray MS were also used to evaluate enzyme activity by following the product formation of an enzymatic reaction. A simple MS protocol was developed for evaluation of enzymatic activity using few reagents and without sample pretreatment or derivatization reactions (which is commonly used in other methods). ^ In contrast to their role as simple microcontainers, droplets have been found a new role in reaction acceleration compared to the bulk phase. Droplets formed by dropcasting/spray-based ionization mass spectrometry can act as microreactors in which the reactions run much faster than those in the bulk solution. Droplet reaction acceleration also extends to thin film reactions as was performed in the reactive paper spray experiment which represents an alternative version of limited-volume reactors. The Katritzky reaction between a pyrylium salt and mono- or di-amines, including substituted anilines, is an example that was investigated by reactive paper spray. The increase in rate of product formation is attributed to solvent evaporation which increases reagent concentrations, to changes the pH and to enhanced intermolecular interactions at the interface. Droplet acceleration is promising for preparative scale synthesis on a short timescale. It might open a new dimension in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. ...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. Increased {{environmental}} concern about surface water pollution has heightened {{the need for}} small, in-field runoff collectors {{to assess the impact}} of land management practices without altering the landscape. We modified a surface flow sampler designed for sheet flow in Coastal Plain soils. Modifications were made to accommodate steep slopes (3 to 15 %), large flow rates, and channelized flow which are common in the Southern Piedmont. The runoff collector consists of two <b>sample</b> <b>splitters</b> (10 x and 100 x) and two sample collectors. Runoff collector performance was evaluated in the laboratory to determine percent flow captured by 10 x and 100 x splitters relative to flow rate and slope. Average flow captured on a 5 % slope was 10. 3 % for 10 x and 1. 8 % for the l 00 x. When the slope was increased to 12 % the percent flow capture also increased slightly, 10. 4 % for l 0 x and 2. 3 % for l 00 x. It was determined that the small, in-field runoff collector captures runoff volumes at specific rates at fairly consistent ratios. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

The overall {{goal is to}} choose p − 1 partitioning elements so that the final p sorted files, one per processor, are of roughly equal size. It first determines a <b>sample</b> of <b>splitters</b> by either regular sampling or random sampling techniques. Then each data file at each processor is separated according to final splitters and sublists are redistributed to appropriate processors. Finally each processor sorts incoming records into runs and merges sorted runs into a fully sorted file.

The result indicates that regular sampling provides better performance than random sampling does. ...|$|R

Isokinetic nozzle probes and shrouded probes were tested. The test aerosol was sodium-fluorescein-tagged oleic acid. The test parameters involved particle sizes from 1 to 15 {mu}m, air velocities from 3 to 15 m/s. The results of the tests show that shrouded probes can deliver samples with significantly less particle-size bias then the isokinetic nozzle probes tested. Tests were also conducted on two <b>sample</b> flow <b>splitters</b> to determine particle loss as a function of aerodynamic particle size. The particle size range covered in these tests was 5 to 15 {mu}m.

40|$|Background: An {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) {{technique was}} developed for continuous subcutaneous (s. c.) sampling and on-line analysis of absolute glucose and lactate concentrations in tissue. The relation between subcutaneous and blood concentrations was studied in men, because a subcutaneous monitoring device would put patients on less risks than an intravascular device. Methods: Ultrafiltrates were withdrawn continuously at a flow rate of 50 - 100 nl/min from a hollow fibre probe to measure glucose in the abdominal subcutis. Six healthy volunteers underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. In order to detect glucose and lactate in the same <b>sample,</b> a <b>splitter</b> was placed between the on-line flow injection valve and the parallel enzymatic conversion and electrochemical detection cells. Findings: Subcutaneous glucose concentrations were in steady state on the average 1. 06 mM lower. They rose delayed and blunted as compared to blood levels. We demonstrated the ability of simultaneous lactate and glucose measurements in vivo (n= 2). Interpretation: UF makes continuous monitoring of absolute extracellular concentrations in tissue possible. We interpret the deviations of subcutaneous measurements from intravascular levels in this way that the subcutis is a kinetic compartment not directly and exclusively linked to blood. The observed differences with blood suggest that diabetes management may demand intravascular monitoring. UF combined with analysis of glucose and lactate in the same sample offers the opportunity to study pathophysiology inside tissues. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: A current {{challenge}} for analytical chemists {{is the development}} of measurement systems and approaches required to understand dynamic processes such as tablet dissolution. The design and development of oral tablets could be improved by the availability of detailed information about the rates of release of the individual tablet components. Small footprint mass spectrometry (MS) systems are gaining use for on-line reaction monitoring because of their ability to rapidly determine multiple reactant, intermediate, and product species. We have therefore assessed the utility of such MS systems to the study of dissolution processes. METHODS: Aqueous dissolution media containing phosphate and other non volatile buffer salts were pumped from a standard USPII dissolution vessel through an active splitter and back. The <b>splitter</b> <b>sampled</b> the dissolution stream and diluted it into a make-up flow which was pumped to a small single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Single ion monitoring was used to quantify the ions of interest. Three different bio-relevant dissolution media were studied to gauge the impact of the sample matrix.

If a language contains complex words like sandhi where two or more morphemes join based on some rules, spell checking becomes very tedious. In such situations, having a spell checker with sandhi splitter which alerts the user by flagging the errors and providing suggestions is very useful. A novel algorithm of sandhi splitting is proposed in this paper. The sandhi splitter can split about 7000 most common sandhi words in Kannada language used as test <b>samples.</b> The sandhi <b>splitter</b> was integrated with a Kannada spell checker and a mechanism for generating suggestions was added. A comprehensive, platform independent, standalone spell checker with sandhi splitter application software was thus developed and tested extensively for its efficiency and correctness.

It is twice as fast, 200 times more space efficient, and it is 90 % accurate in case of complex nouns and 50 % accurate for complex verbs.

40|$|Abstract]: Pollution due {{to urban}} {{stormwater}} runoff {{is a significant}} environmental issue. Large regional devices including sediment ponds and constructed wetlands are common features in the urban landscape to treat runoff. In keeping with this approach, data requirements to evaluate stormwater impacts have mainly been met by the monitoring of sizeable urban catchments, typically greater than 10 ha in area. Urban runoff characteristics have thus been conventionally linked with broadly defined catchment attributes. Land use, as defined by zonings such as Residential, Commercial and Industrial, is an attribute often used to evaluate stormwater runoff from urban catchments. The emergence of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia is changing the management focus from the reliance on {{a small number of}} large-scale devices to many smaller-scale source controls distributed throughout the catchment. This paradigm shift in stormwater management places greater emphasis on small-scale processes within urban areas. Subsequently {{there is a need for}} more knowledge about stormwater generated from specific urban surfaces (roads, roofs, grassed areas etc). The objective of this study was to demonstrate how urban stormwater quality can be managed on the basis of urban surfaces. The study involved the collection of data for typical urban surfaces and the development of predictive models to estimate stormwater quality. A series of case studies is provided to illustrate the use of surface-related data and modelling tools in stormwater management, particularly in the context of WSUD. Non-Coarse Particles (NCP), defined as suspended solids less than 500 μm in size, was selected as the stormwater pollutant under consideration. NCP is divided into the following particle size classes; Very Fine Particles (VFP, < 8 μm), Fine Particles (FP, 8 - 63 μm) and Medium Particles (MP, 63 - 500 μm). Laboratory methods to determine the concentration of these particle classes within stormwater runoff were adapted and refined from current standard methods. Organic content of each stormwater particle class was also determined. An innovative device, the flow splitter, was developed to collect runoff samples from urban surfaces. The flow splitter was designed to obtain a composite flow-proportional sample, necessary to derive the Event Mean Concentration of stormwater particles. Hydraulic and sediment testing of a prototype flow splitter confirmed that the device is an accurate and unbiased <b>sampling</b> method. Flow <b>splitters</b> were installed at five monitoring sites within inner city Toowoomba, Australia. The sites have small catchments (50 to 450 m 2 area) representative of urban impervious areas (galvanized iron roof, concrete carpark and bitumen road pavement) and pervious areas (grassed and exposed bare soil). Overall, runoff from 40 storms with rainfalls from 2. 5 mm to 64. 3 mm was sampled during the period December 2004 to January 2006. A scatter plot analysis identified potential correlations between measured NCP loads and basic rainfall parameters such as rainfall depth and intensity. An exponential-type trend, consistent with many washoff models, is evident between load and average rainfall intensity for all surfaces. A composite index, referred to as the Rainfall Detachment Index (RDI), was found to be better than average rainfall intensity in explaining a relationship between NCP load and storm rainfall characteristics. The insight gained from the RDI led to the development of a particle Mass Balance Model for impervious surfaces. Depending on the surface type, the model was able for provide reasonable estimates (R 2 = 0. 74 to 0. 97) against the measured NCP loads. Simpler analytical methods for particle load estimation were also developed in the study. A total of five methods were produced. An error analysis was conducted to compare the performance of each method to accurately reproduce the measured NCP loads. The analysis also included three methods used in current practice, which performed poorly compared to the new modelling techniques. The analytical methods provide useful tools in urban stormwater planning. The Mass Balance Model and measured surface-specific data were used in a number of case study examples to demonstrate possible applications. The applications included assessments of 1) the relative contribution that different urban surfaces make to the particle load in runoff; 2) how surface-specific data can be directly transferred to represent a large-scale urban catchment located in a different climate; 3) the particle loads generated from Residential and Commercial land uses; 4) the effect of exposed areas of bare soil on the particle loads from a Residential catchment; 5) the effect that widespread adoption of rainwater tanks may have on particle concentration in Residential urban runoff and 6) the particle load reductions by the use of a grass swale to treat road runoff...|$|R
