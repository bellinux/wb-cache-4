The planning team included journalist Mark Sullivan, New School professor Alvin Johnson, and The Century Magazine editor-in-chief Glenn Frank.

5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the {{revenues}} from sales did not even provide him with the money to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E

5|$|Valve <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a publisher, as many {{believed}} {{the game was}} too ambitious for a first-time developer.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of the buried crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E

However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick {{was not the only}} player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a full complement of 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there ‚Äì a conversion against Devon.|$|E

5|$|Hooper {{produced}} the film {{for less than}} $300,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot.

Due to the film's violent content, Hooper <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.|$|E
