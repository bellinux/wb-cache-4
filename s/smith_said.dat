5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying {{one night in}} 1823. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that this angel {{revealed}} {{the location of a}} buried book made of golden plates, as well as other artifacts, including a breastplate and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had been hidden in a hill near his home. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E
5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Smith, {{who played}} Miss Caruso, sharing Bond's {{bed in the}} film's opening, was {{recommended}} for the part by Roger Moore after he had appeared with her on TV. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that Moore was extremely polite to work with, but she felt very uncomfortable being clad in only blue bikini panties while Moore's wife was on set overseeing the scene.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Kevin <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that he {{was open}} to having the Superman Lives script be adapted as an {{animated}} film, with Nicholas Cage voicing Superman and Michael Rooker voicing Lex Luthor. In October 2017, Batman vs. Two-Face writer Michael Jelenic stated that he originally pitched an animated film based on Smith's Superman Lives script, saying that Warner Bros seriously considered {{it for a long}} time. According to Jelenic, Cage would have loved to voice Superman in the film, but the idea never materialized and Jelenic's pitch was eventually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} angel {{returned}} the plates {{to him in}} September, 1828. In April 1829, he met Oliver Cowdery, who replaced Harris as his scribe, and resumed dictation. They worked full time on the manuscript between April and early June 1829, and then moved to Fayette, New York, where they continued {{to work at the}} home of Cowdery's friend, Peter Whitmer. When the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other. Dictation was completed around July 1, 1829.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established. The government consulted ACT Alberta, The Salvation Army, and the AAMS {{in the development of the}} plan.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family {{was caught up in}} this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by about the age of twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E
5|$|In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress to make Nauvoo an {{independent}} territory {{with the right}} to call out federal troops in its defense. Smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own independent candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries. In March 1844 — following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat — Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> the Council had authority to decide which national or state laws Mormons should obey. The Council was also to select a site for a large Mormon settlement in Texas, California, or Oregon, where Mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control.|$|E

5|$|<b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|The {{completed}} work, {{titled the}} Book of Mormon, {{was published in}} Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized the Church of Christ, and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book of Mormon brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his money-digging and the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence; before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, {{he was arrested and}} brought to trial as a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that Peter, James, and John had appeared to him and had ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood.|$|E
5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. <b>Smith</b> <b>said</b> the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
