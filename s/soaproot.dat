5000|$|Brown would {{demonstrate}} survival {{skills such as}} arrowhead making, {{and the use of}} <b>soaproot</b> as a fish poison. An anthropologist described his technique: [...] "First he mashes <b>soaproot</b> bulbs on a stone; he then places the bulbs into a basket and works them into a foam; the foam is poured into Yosemite Creek; and a half hour later he displays the rainbow trout that he caught." [...] <b>Soaproot</b> contains a poison called saponin. In addition to the Miwok, California tribes using this technique included the Lassik, the Luiseño, the Yuki, the Yokut, the Chilula, the Wailaki, the Kato, the Mattole, the Nomlaki and the Nishinam.|$|E

50|$|Two {{plants that}} had been {{designated}} as federal candidate category 2 species were eliminated {{from the list of}} candidate species when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service changed its rules for the inclusion of species as candidates in 1996. Congdon's lomatium (Lomatium congdonii) and the Red Hills <b>soaproot</b> (Chlorogalum grandiflorum) are locally common throughout the Red Hills favoring north slopes and ridgetops respectively. Congdon's lomatium is only known from the Red Hills and the Peoria Valley area. Red Hills <b>soaproot</b> is also found in El Dorado County, California on serpentine and gabbro.|$|E
50|$|The {{common names}} soap plant, <b>soaproot</b> and amole {{refer to the}} genus Chlorogalum. They are native to western North America, from Oregon to Baja California, and are mostly found in California. Common names of the genus and several species derive from their use as soap.|$|E
50|$|Red Hills <b>soaproot</b> (Chlorogalum grandiflorum) is {{also found}} in the Red Hills area of Tuolumne County, is a {{perennial}} herb and blooms in June with flowers opening at dusk and closing at morning. It grows in chaparral on serpentine and gabbro soils, and also in ponderosa pine woodland.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorogalum pomeridianum, the wavy-leafed soap plant, California <b>soaproot,</b> or Amole, is {{the most}} common and most widely {{distributed}} of the soap plants, soaproots or amoles, which make up the genus Chlorogalum of flowering plants. It is occasionally known as the [...] "wild potato", but given the plant's lack of either resemblance or relationship to the potato, this name is not recommended.|$|E
5000|$|El Dorado mule ears (Wyethia reticulata), Red Hills <b>soaproot</b> (Chlorogalum grandiflorum) and the Bisbee Peak rush-rose (Helianthemum suffrutescens) {{are not on}} {{the state}} or federal lists, but are a [...] "species of concern" [...] (or [...] "sensitive"), which is a species that may not meet the Endangered Species Act {{criteria}} for listing, but have issues such as locally rare, newly discovered, or not enough information about the plant.|$|E
50|$|Many of California's Native American tribes {{traditionally}} used <b>soaproot,</b> Chlorogalum pomeridianum, {{which contains}} saponin, as a fish poison. They would pulverize the roots, mix in water {{to create a}} foam, and then add the suds to a stream. This would kill or incapacitate the fish, which could be gathered easily {{from the surface of}} the water. The Lassik, Luiseño, Yuki, Yokut, Chilula, Wailaki, Miwok, Kato, Mattole, Nomlaki, and Nishinam tribes used this technique.|$|E
50|$|Various {{chemicals}} {{may be used}} {{to increase}} the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in <b>soaproot</b> or yucca-root used by Native American tribes, or the ash lye (usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) once widely used for soaking laundry in Europe. Soap, a compound made from lye and fat, is an ancient and common laundry aid. Modern washing machines typically use synthetic powdered or liquid laundry detergent in place of more traditional soap.|$|E
50|$|Many of California's Native American tribes {{traditionally}} used <b>soaproot,</b> (genus Chlorogalum) {{and/or the}} root of various yucca species, which contain saponin, as a fish poison. They would pulverize the roots, mixing in water to create a foam, and then add the suds to a stream. This would kill or incapacitate the fish, which could be gathered easily {{from the surface of}} the water. Among the tribes using this technique were the Lassik, the Luiseño, and the Mattole.|$|E
50|$|Laundry {{refers to}} the act of washing {{clothing}} and linens, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals {{may be used to}} increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in <b>soaproot</b> or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. Soap, a compound made from lye (from wood-ash) and fat, is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern washing machines typically use powdered or liquid laundry detergent in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes have been wrung out — twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clotheslines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass.|$|E
5000|$|Salmon spawned in most {{rivers and}} streams in California {{sometime}} during the year and were a welcome addition to the diet of the hunter-gatherer California people living near almost all the streams. Many tribes migrated to a given area along the streams during spawning runs to harvest the fish. Fish were caught with spears, harpoons, fish nets, fish traps (fishing weirs), hooks and fishing lines, gathering seafood by hand and using specific plant toxins (<b>soaproot,</b> buckeye nuts, and wild cucumber root) to temporarily paralyze the fish so they would float to the surface where could easily be captured. About the only early competitors for fish was the California grizzly bears who lived in California then and who also liked salmon. Salmon and other fish were usually eaten almost immediately, smoked or sun dried and stored in woven baskets so they could not spoil and were available to eat nearly year-round. Acorns gathered each fall were the other staple of most California Indian's diet, ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Soaproot</b> (Radix Gypsophilae) is an {{important}} herbal drug having medicinal and economic importance and has been collected from nature for more than 30 years. The main goal {{of this study was}} to determine <b>soaproot</b> yielding plant species in East Anatolia, and their potential in nature. Collected plants were determined by field studies; damage to the environment after collection was observed, and commerce, exportation, domestic utilisation of <b>soaproot,</b> and problems and proposed solutions were examined. <b>Soaproot</b> is presently obtained from a total of 7 plant species belonging to 2 genera in Turkey (6 Gypsophila L., 1 Ankyropetalu...|$|E
