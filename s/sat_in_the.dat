5|$|Cross ran as a Liberal in the 1925 federal {{election}} in the riding of Athabaska, and defeated Donald Ferdinand Kellner, the Progressive incumbent from Edmonton East. Stewart, who had also left provincial politics, was elected in the adjacent Edmonton West. The Liberals, under incumbent Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, won fewer seats than the Conservatives, but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway. As a result, Cross <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Canadian House of Commons throughout the King-Byng Affair. In the ensuing 1926 election, Cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with Kellner.

40|$|Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) {{is arguably}} {{one of the}} {{practical}} applications that motivated the development of modern Boolean Satisfiability (<b>SAT)</b> solvers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid 90 s. Despite the interest of using <b>SAT</b> <b>in</b> ATPG, <b>the</b> original model remained mostly unchanged for nearly two decades, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of renewed interest <b>in</b> applying modern <b>SAT</b> technology to large-scale hardware designs. This paper describes the SAT-based ATPG system TG-Pro. In contrast to all SAT-based ATPG work overthe last two decades, TG-Pro {{is based on a}} new fundamentally different SAT-based ATPG model. Experimental results, obtained on well-known and publicly available benchmarks, demonstrate that TG-Pro achieves major performance improvements over other well-established SAT-based ATPG models...|$|R
5|$|Though the {{prevailing}} Soviet ideology stressed gender equality in labor and education, and many Soviet women held jobs and advanced degrees, {{they did not}} participate in core political roles and institutions. Above the middle levels, political and economic leaders were overwhelmingly male. While propaganda claimed, accurately, that more women <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet than in most democratic countries' legislative bodies combined, only two women, Yekaterina Furtseva and (in its last year of existence) Galina Semyonova, were ever members of the party's Politburo, in practice the country's real leadership.|$|E
5|$|Visiting team fans <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TL Dallas Stand from 1995 to 2008, {{but have}} also been given {{other parts of the}} ground for larger matches.

The decision came after an overwhelmingly positive text message poll from the club's supporters to use the Bradford End of the ground. Visiting team fans have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand {{since the start of the}} 2008–09 season. Since the 2013–14 Season away fans have moved back to the TL Dallas stand.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening Day for the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs {{in the third inning}} and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in the pitching arm, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
50|$|François-Joseph-Marie-Henry, comte de Viry (27 July 1766 - 15 January 1820), {{known before}} 1813 as baron de la Ferrière and in England as Henry Speed, was a Savoyard nobleman who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> House of Commons of Great Britain and the Chamber of Deputies of France.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was not a time of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E

40|$|Genome-wide {{in silico}} {{analysis}} identified thousands of natural sense–antisense transcript (<b>SAT)</b> pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouse transcriptome. We investigated their expression using strand-specific oligo-microarray that distinguishes expression of sense and antisense RNA from 1947 SAT pairs. The {{majority of the}} predicted SATs are expressed at various steady-state levels in various tissues, and cluster analysis of the array data demonstrated that the ratio of sense and antisense expression {{for some of the}} SATs fluctuated markedly among these tissues, while the rest was unchanged. Surprisingly, further analyses indicated that vast amounts of multiple-sized transcripts are expressed from the SAT loci, which tended to be poly(A) negative, and nuclear localized. The tendency that the SATs are often not polyadenylated is conserved, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> randomly chosen <b>SAT</b> genes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Such common characteristics imply general roles of <b>the</b> <b>SATs</b> <b>in</b> regulation of gene expression...|$|R
