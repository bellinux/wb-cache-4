To mitigate this issue, many scholars choose to paraphrase textual data to avoid <b>source</b> <b>identification.</b> Thus, [...] "ethical concerns must be reexamined in light of new technologies for both subjects and researchers alike".|$|E

40|$|The current ATEX (Explosive Atmosphere) risk {{assessment}} methodology {{relies on a}} semi-quantitative approach based on the following indexes: probability of an explosive atmosphere formation, probability {{of the presence of}} an effective ignition source and consequences.
