40|$|Abstract—MEMS {{vibratory}} gyroscopes ideally possess un-coupled components {{on their}} orthogonal drive and sense axes. Asymmetries {{in the structure}} of the device, caused by manufacturing non-idealities and device wear, introduce unwanted dynamic interactions between the sense and drive axes. These interactions often lead to the transfer of energy from the drive <b>axis</b> to the <b>sense</b> <b>axis</b> in the absence of any external perturbation. The transferred energy (leakage) appears as a time-accumulating bias drift on the measurement signal on the <b>sense</b> <b>axis,</b> resulting in error to the sensor output. This paper describes the application of an input-output controller to compensate for non-ideal interdependencies of drive and sense axes for vibratory gyroscopes in order to reduce the bias drift in the <b>sense</b> <b>axis.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|MEMS {{gyroscopes}} {{for consumer}} devices, such as smartphones and tablets, suffer from {{high power consumption}} and drift which precludes their use in inertial navigation applications. Conventional MEMS gyroscopes detect Coriolis force through measurement of very small displacements on a <b>sense</b> <b>axis,</b> which requires low-noise, and consequently high-power, electronics. The sensitivity of the gyroscope is improved through mode-matching, but this introduces many other problems, such as low bandwidth and unreliable scale factor. Additionally, the conventional Coriolis force detection method is very sensitive to asymmetries in the mechanical transducer because the rate signal is derived from only the <b>sense</b> <b>axis.</b> Parasitic coupling between the drive and <b>sense</b> <b>axis</b> introduces unwanted bias errors which could be rejected by a perfectly symmetric readout scheme. In this thesis, I present frequency modulated (FM) gyroscopes that overcome the above limitations. FM gyroscopes operate the mechanical transducer in a perfectly symmetric way: each transducer axis is continuously driven to maintain a constant envelope oscillation. The rate is detected as changes in the frequencies of oscillations of the two axes. Frequency readout offers superior scale factor reliability in comparison to amplitude readout. For pendulum type gyroscopes, the scale factor is a dimensionless constant equal to 1 Hz (or cycle per second) per 360 deg/s. FM gyroscopes are trivial to mode-match. Oscillation frequencies of both axes can be continually monitored and matched through electrostatic tuning. The FM gyroscope receives the same improved sensitivity benefit from mode-matching as the conventional gyroscope, without the drawbacks of limited bandwidth or unreliable scale factor. Because of the symmetry, compatibility with mode-matching, and ease of frequency readout, the FM gyroscopes promise to improve the power dissipation and drift of MEMS gyroscopes...|$|R

A demodulation approach based on the estimated dynamics of the system by an extended state observer is used to estimate the rotation rate.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Rolamite architecture exploiting shape-memory alloys {{as power}} element {{to obtain a}} solid-state actuator. The Rolamite mechanism was discovered in the late 1960 s, initially as precision and low friction linear bearing. The most common Rolamite configuration consists of a flexible thin metal strip and two rollers mounted between two fixed parallel guide surfaces. The system can roll back and forth without slipping guided by the plates along its so-called <b>sensing</b> <b>axis.</b> The system presents another relevant advantage in addition to low friction coefficient, which is the possibility to provide force generation in a quite simple way. In the original literature works, the force was provided, thanks to cut-outs of various shapes in the strip, although this method does not allow the Rolamite {{to be considered a}} proper actuator, but only a force generator. In this article, we developed the idea of exploiting the shape-memory alloy as Rolamite power element, and therefore, to use the shape-memory effect to change the elastic properties of the strip and to provide the actuation force. The mechanical analysis, where the martensite–austenite transition is modelled in a simplified way, shows that this application is feasible, mainly thanks to the initial precurvature of the shape-memory alloy strip. The discussion of the results highlights some important merits of this architecture such as long stroke, constant force and compactness...|$|E

Each tablet is augmented with a two-axis linear accelerometer (tilt sensor), touch sensor, proximity sensor, and light sensor. The system recognizes when users bump two tablets together by looking for spikes in each tablet’s accelerometer data that are synchronized in time. Bumping establishes a privileged connection between the devices; the tilt <b>sensing</b> <b>axis</b> (left-right or forward-back) {{and direction of the}} spikes determines which sides of the tablets have collided.

It also has piezoelectric properties {{that can be used}} for sensing applications and it can be deposited with good control as thin polycrystalline film for the fabrication of micro-electromechanical systems. In this dissertation, optimized deposition parameters for aluminum nitride films and characterization techniques for film stress gradients are investigated. Furthermore, two different fabrication processes are presented that can be used to build several sensors and other micromechanical elements on a single chip. The more advanced process includes a bulk-micromachining step that enables the use of the silicon substrate as large proof masses for accelerometers. At the same time, the fabrication process can be used to create membranes for devices such as pressure sensors. Several different devices are discussed from the device design and theoretical analysis to the fabrication and experimental verification. The most significant contribution is the performance improvement of several orders of magnitude that can be achieved with aluminum nitride accelerometers by switching from double-ended tuning forks to triple-beam tuning forks and by using the newly discovered sensing concept of bent-beam sensing. Additionally, rate gyroscopes were presented that use aluminum nitride as the structural material and for both actuating the drive axis and reading the <b>sense</b> <b>axis.</b> Both types of sensors have potential applications in inertial navigation at high temperature.

Due to the cross-axis sensitivity, the measured signals are contaminated and this contamination can lead to serious errors in the measured FRFs as well as the resulting modal analysis. It was found that the contamination is not random in nature but is systematically accumulated in the measured FRF, and that the amount of cross-axis measurement error depends on the components of the motion to be measured relative to the primary sensing direction as well as the cross-axis plane;This cross-axis sensitivity error can be compensated for in either the time domain or the frequency domain. The method employed is dependent on the data acquisition and data processing system being used.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel calibration algorithm {{to be used}} with a gyro-free inertial measurement unit (GF-IMU) based on the use of linear accelerometers (AC). The analytical approach can be implemented in two calibration procedures. The first procedure (P-I) is articulated in the conduction of a static trial, to compute the sensitivity and the direction of the <b>sensing</b> <b>axis</b> of each AC, followed by a dynamic trial, to determine the AC locations. By contrast, the latter procedure (P-II) consists in the calculation of the previously indicated calibration parameters by means of a dynamic trial only. The feasibility of the two calibration procedures has been investigated by testing two GF-IMUs, equipped with ten and six bi-axial linear ACs, with an ad hoc instrumented double-pendulum apparatus. P-I and P-II were compared to a calibration procedure used as a reference (P-REF), which incorporates the AC positions measured with an optoelectronic system. The experimental results we present in this paper demonstrate that (i) P-I is able to determine the calibration parameters of the AC array with a higher accuracy than P-II; (ii) consequently, the errors associated with translational (a 0 ? g) and rotational (??) acceleration components for the two GF-IMUs are significantly greater using P-II than P-I and (iii) the errors in (a 0 ? g) and ? ? obtained with P-I are comparable with the ones obtainable by using P-REF. Thus, the proposed novel algorithm used in P-I, in conjunction with the double-pendulum apparatus, can be globally considered a viable tool in GF-IMU calibration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Distributed {{algorithms}} for (re) configuring {{sensors to}} cover a given area are important for autonomous multirobot operations in application areas such as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Depending on the assumptions about {{the choice of the}} environment, the sensor models, the coverage metric, and the motion models of sensor nodes, there are different versions of the problem that have been formulated and studied. In this work, we consider the problem of (re) configuring systems equipped with anisotropic sensors (e. g., mobile robot with limited field of view cameras) that cover a polygonal region with polygonal obstacles for detecting interesting events. We assume that a given probability distribution of the events over this polygonal region is known. Our model has two key distinguishing features that are inherently present in covering problems with anisotropic sensors, but are not addressed adequately in the literature. First, we allow {{for the fact that the}} sensing performance may not be a monotonically decreasing function of distance. Second, motivated by scenarios where the sensing performance not only depends on the resolution of sensing, but also on the relative orientation between the <b>sensing</b> <b>axis</b> and the event, we assume that the probability of detection of an event depends on both sensing parameters and the angle of observation. We present a distributed gradient-ascent algorithm for (re) configuring the system of mobile sensors so that the joint probability of detection of events over the whole region is maximized. Simulation results illustrating the performance of our algorithms on different systems, namely, mobile camera networks, mobile acoustic sensor networks, and static pan-tilt-zoom camera networks are presented...|$|E

40|$|Introduction : With the {{increase}} of sedentary style of life and ageing, quantifying the amount of movement during daily life becomes crucial. For monitoring daily life activities, inertial measurement units (IMU), a combination of miniature tri-axial angular rate and gravity sensors, are promising tool. To this purpose, different studies proposed to apply machine learning methods to the data provided by single or multiple sensors [1] attached to the various segments of the body [2]. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and test amethod to identify some of the daily life activities simply using a single IMU attached at the waist level on a body side. Materials and methods : Data were acquired using a single IMU (FreeSense, Sensorize ®) featuring a tri-axial accelerometer and two bi-axial gyroscopes (sampling frequency 50 Hz) placed at the waist level on the right body side. Training data set was acquired on ten subjects (four females, 31 ± 4 yrs) who performed the following dynamic activities: walking, walking up/down stairs, turning, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit. Static activities performed were: standing, sitting. The subjects were guided by an examiner, who identified the timing of each activity, throughout the 5 min long acquisitions. Ten acquisitions were made for each subject. The distinction between dynamic and static activities was accomplished with the method that was presented in a previous study [3]. Then, two different approaches were used for each activity type. Static activities were distinguished based on the relative angle with respect to the gravitational acceleration direction. For the dynamic activities a neural classifier was used. Distinguishing static and dynamic activities allows the neural classifier to focus on fewer types of activities aimed at increasing its accuracy. Multilayered feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) with the resilient backpropagation (RPROP) learning algorithm was used to train the neural classifier. The ANN presented two hidden layers and a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function was used as transfer function for each layers. The signal inspection is performed using a sliding window approach, with window size 128 samples (2. 56 s) and 64 samples (1. 28 s) overlapping between each consecutive window. For each window, features characterizing the signal were extracted from the IMU signals. The selected features were: (1) the mean value of the signal within the window interval, (2) the standard deviation of the window interval, (3) the energy content (sum of squared FFT component magnitudes divided by the window length), (4) correlation between signals in the interval of window. The correlation was useful for differentiating among activities in which most of the movement is along a <b>sensing</b> <b>axis.</b> For example, walking and running feature the largest displacement in one of the sensor directions, whereas stair climbing involves a displacement in a combination of two sensor directions. Effectiveness of these features was demonstrated in prior work [1, 2].

The Hall Effect sensors were mounted so that the change in position of a magnet on the sensor translated to a change in position. By relating this data, the voltage output of the Hall Effect sensors could be related to force through a calibration matrix. The flexure was prototyped at a large scale of 5 in x 5 in x 7 in. The force sensor behaved as expected in compression but abnormally when encountering large shear forces, causing a discrepancy in the calibration matrix. Moving forward, tightening tolerances on the flexure and modifying the Hall Effect sensor setup to use 2 - <b>axis</b> <b>sensing</b> for both compression and shear directions should decrease the error between calculated and actual force measurements, allowing for a reliable calibration matrix to be calculated. by Andrea L.

5000|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{animal and plant}} systems support the 'long axis rule'. The studied systems include the mouse embryo, Drosophila epithelium, Xenopus blastomeres (Strauss 2006), MCDK cell monolayers [...] and plants (Gibson et al., 2011).The {{mechanism}} of the 'long axis rule' relies on interphase cell long <b>axis</b> <b>sensing.</b> However, during division many animal cell types undergo cell rounding, causing the long axis to disappear as the cell becomes round. It is at this rounding stage that the decision on {{the orientation of the}} cell division is made by the spindle apparatus. The spindle apparatus then rotates in the round cell and after several minutes the spindle position is stabilised preferentially along the interphase cell long axis. The cell then divides along the spindle apparatus orientation. The first insights into how cells could remember their long axis came from studies on the Drosophila epithelium. The study indicates Cell junction#Tricellular junctions (TCJ) participation in determining the spindle orientation. TCJ localized at the regions where three or more cells meet. As cells round up during mitosis, TCJs serve as spatial landmarks. The orientation of TCJ remains stable, independent of the shape changes associated with cell rounding. The position of TCJ encode information about interphase cell shape anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. However this study is limited to only one type of epithelia in Drosophila melanogaster and has not been shown to be true in other epithelial types.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{intake of}} ω- 3 {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) {{and use of}} peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) -activating drugs are associated with attenuation of pathologic retinal angiogenesis. ω- 3 LCPUFAs are endogenous agonists of PPARs. We postulated that DNA sequence variation in PPAR gamma (PPARG) co-activator 1 alpha (PPARGC 1 A), a gene encoding a co-activator of the LCPUFA-sensing PPARG-retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcription complex, may influence neovascularization (NV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We applied exact testing methods to examine distributions of DNA sequence variants in PPARGC 1 A for association with NV AMD and interaction of AMD-associated loci in genes of complement, lipid metabolism, and VEGF signaling systems. Our sample contained 1858 people from 3 elderly cohorts of western European ancestry. We concurrently investigated retinal gene expression profiles in 17 -day-old neonatal mice on a 2 % LCPUFA feeding paradigm to identify LCPUFA-regulated genes both associated with pathologic retinal angiogenesis and known to interact with PPARs or PPARGC 1 A. A DNA coding variant (rs 3736265) and a 3 'UTR-resident regulatory variant (rs 3774923) in PPARGC 1 A were independently associated with NV AMD (exact P = 0. 003, both SNPs). SNP-SNP interactions existed for NV AMD (P< 0. 005) with rs 3736265 and a AMD-associated variant in complement factor B (CFB, rs 512559). PPARGC 1 A influences activation of the AMD-associated complement component 3 (C 3) promoter fragment and CFB influences activation and proteolysis of C 3. We observed interaction (P ≤ 0. 003) of rs 3736265 with a variant in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA, rs 3025033), a key molecule in retinal angiogenesis. Another PPARGC 1 A coding variant (rs 8192678) showed statistical interaction with a SNP in the VEGFA receptor fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT 1, rs 10507386; P ≤ 0. 003). C 3 expression was down-regulated 2 -fold in retinas of ω- 3 LCPUFA-fed mice - these animals also showed 70 % reduction in retinal NV (P ≤ 0. 001). Ligands and co-activators of the ω- 3 LCPUFA <b>sensing</b> PPAR-RXR <b>axis</b> may influence retinal angiogenesis in NV AMD via the complement and VEGF signaling systems. We have linked the co-activator of a lipid-sensing transcription factor (PPARG co-activator 1 alpha, PPARGC 1 A) to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and AMD-associated genes...|$|R
40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como campo de investigação a aplicação da prática psicanalítica fora da clínica stricto sensu (extensão). O seu eixo norteador é a {{interface}} do Direito com a Psicanálise e seu foco de atenção é a inserção do psicólogo psicanalista nos Tribunais de Justiça para prestar serviços vinculados às Varas de Família. Procura-se verificar a prática desse profissional em termos de sua coerência com os conceitos fundamentais da psicanálise e, portanto, com uma práxis que questiona os ideais sociais, em uma instituição que o convoca a trabalhar a partir do discurso normativo. Para compreender o trabalho do psicólogo / psicanalista em uma perspectiva clínica, procurando definir seus principais conceitos operadores, utilizou-se a noção de cena como articuladora dos dois discursos: o jurídico e o psicanalítico. A cena jurídica é explicitada em seus parâmetros discursivos e compreendida em uma leitura antropológica sobre a sua instituição. A cena psicanalítica é abordada tendo como conceitos principais inconsciente, fantasia, desejo e demanda. Tanto a cena jurídica quanto a cena psicanalítica são vinculadas fundamentalmente às questões da família para, em seguida, explicitarem-se os conceitos fundamentais e os orientadores da prática possível do psicanalista no Tribunal de Família. Nesse percurso, faz-se uma leitura da perícia judicial conforme as elaborações de Michel Foucault para propor uma prática diferenciada de acordo com as formulações de Freud e de Lacan sobre o desejo e a demanda. Para responder à questão sobre a possibilidade de ocupar a posição do psicanalista e intervir nos casos atendidos em Varas de Família, utilizou-se o estudo de caso de alguns processos judiciais encaminhados à Central de Serviço Social e Psicologia do Fórum Lafayette (Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais) e atendidos pelo próprio pesquisador, haja vista sua inserção na instituição como Psicólogo Judicial. O critério para a escolha dos casos foi a presença de conflito familiar instituído no qual se tentou a intervenção pelo viés da escuta analítica. Concluiu-se pela possibilidade de intervenção em alguns casos, dentro dos limites impostos pela instituição e pelo lugar que o psicanalista pode ocupar n{{a interface}} desses discursos. The following research has as an investigation field {{the application of}} the psychoanalythical practice outside the clinic strict <b>sense.</b> Its guiding <b>axis</b> is the interface of the law and the psychoanalysis, and its focus of attention is the insertion of the psychoanalist psychologist in the Law Courts, in order to render services linked with the Family Court. It is intended to verify the practise of such professional in terms of his coherence with the fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis and, thus, with a praxis which questions the social ideals, in an institution which convokes him to work based upon the normative discourse. In order to inderstand the work of this psychologist / psychoanalist from a clinical perspective. Aiming at defining his main operating concepts, a notion os scene as an articulation joint of two discourses: the juridical and the psychoanalythical ones. The juridical scene is made explicit in its discoursive parameters and from an anthropological interpretation of its institution as well. The psychoanalythical scene is broached from the concepts of the unconscious, fantasy, desire and demand. Both the juridical scene and the psychoanalythical onde are fundamentally linked with the family questions in order to. Soon after, make esplicit the fundamentally concepts and the orientations of the possible psychoanalists practise in the family court. In this course, an interpretation of the judicial skill was made according to Michel Foucault, in order to propose a differentiated practise from the Freuds and Lacans formulations about desire and demand. To answer the questions about the possibility of intervention in the cases taken to the Family Court, from the psychoanalists standpoint. The cases os some judicial lawsuits which were taken to the Central de Serviço Social e Psicologia do Fórum Lafayette (Center of Social and Psychology Service of Lafayette Forum), in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, and taken care of by the reseacher himself, were studied, taking into consideration his insertion in the institution as a judicial psychologist. The criterion for the choice of the cases was the presence of instituted family conflict in which it was intended an intervention based upon analythical listening. The conclusion was for the possibility of intervention in some cases inside the limits imposed by the institution and by the place the psychoanalist may occupy in the interface of these discourses...|$|R
