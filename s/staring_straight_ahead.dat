2500|$|... was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> shaking like a leaf. [...] Even when I {{spoke to}} him, he paid {{absolutely}} no attention. [...] I {{have never seen}} a man so completely wrecked. — Jack Thayer, First Class passenger on Titanic ...|$|E
60|$|Runyon made no reply. He was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> in a dazed, bewildered way, and now Mildred’s eyes {{followed}} his.|$|E
6000|$|For {{some time}} Mrs. Bostwick had been <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> with a dazed expression; but now, {{catching}} the senator's eye, she bowed gracefully and began reciting [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade" [...] in forceful tones.|$|E
60|$|When he was twenty-eight, a thick-limbed, stiff, fair {{man with}} fresh complexion, {{and blue eyes}} <b>staring</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> he was coming one day down from Cossethay with a load of seed out of Nottingham. It {{was a time when}} he was getting ready for another bout of drinking, so he stared fixedly before him, watchful yet absorbed, seeing {{everything}} and aware of nothing, coiled in himself. It was early in the year.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of Leonides Sepulveda, [s. d. ]. She {{can be seen from}} the knees up. She stands <b>straight</b> <b>staring</b> proudly <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> with her body turned slightly to the right. Her hands are held behind her back. Her dark hair is parted in the middle and fixed in a bun on top of her head. She is wearing a dark dress with puffy sleeves, a brooch at her neck and a belt with a square buckle with a swastika design. In an oval cutout. Photoprint reads, "Mrs. A. W. Day, residing at 221 East 43 rd Street, Los Angeles"...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Todd paused, and, {{wiping his}} mouth with a red pocket-handkerchief, sat <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before him.|$|R
60|$|When she {{had gone}} the old man sat in deep thought for a long time. The summer evening cast shadows; {{twilight}} fell; darkness gradually shrouded the bare little room. Still {{he sat in his}} chair, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> into the gloom and thinking.|$|E
60|$|She mailed {{her letter}} the next day, {{and a month}} later an answer came. Sidney read {{it as soon as}} she left the post office, and walked {{the rest of the way}} home as in a nightmare, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of her with wide-open, unseeing brown eyes.|$|E
60|$|Josie saw him {{suddenly}} pause, motionless, as he {{clung to}} the rails. She guessed from his attitude that he was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of him at something that had surprised him. A full minute he remained thus before he let himself down {{on the other side}} and disappeared from view.|$|E
60|$|Blanche sat motionless, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before her, {{while the}} fire died {{out and the}} room grew cold.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} with a packet of messages, and Grant sat still, with care in his face, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> in front of him.|$|R
60|$|The captain did not answer. He was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before him, {{as if he}} saw {{something}} invisible in eyes forever closed in death.|$|R
60|$|Entering {{the spacious}} lobby, {{he found it}} deserted. In the office a man was hastily making a package of some books and papers and did not respond or even look up when spoken to. At the concierge's desk a big, whiskered man sat <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of him {{with a look of}} abject terror in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{was this}} {{the end of the}} chair-girl's accomplishments, for Irene had a fancy for {{sketching}} and made numerous caricatures of those persons with whom she came in contact. These contained so much humor that Mary Louise was delighted with them--especially one of [...] "Uncle Peter" [...] toying with his watch fob and <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of him with round, expressionless eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Barney sat <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> but {{his gaze}} {{did not stop}} upon the {{familiar}} objects of the foreground. Instead it spanned two continents and an ocean to rest upon the little spot of woodland and rugged mountain and lowland that is Lutha. It was with an effort that the man suddenly focused his attention upon that which lay directly before him. A shadow among the trees had moved! ...|$|E
50|$|The movie {{ends with}} a cut to Jessica's face, in which {{she opens her eyes}} and looks around, before finally <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> into the camera.|$|R
6000|$|Several {{carriages}} went jingling by. At last he came. Sitting there, and <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before him, {{he did not}} see them. She {{heard her}} husband say: ...|$|R
60|$|Babalatchi, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before him, hardly {{moved his}} lips, while Mrs. Almayer's {{persistent}} lamentations drowned {{the whisper of}} his murmured reply intended only for Almayer's ear.|$|R
60|$|She was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> of {{her with}} breath quickened by the sincere passion in his quivering voice. The manly repentance which {{burdened}} his soul reached her heart. After all, it was true: he had been only a reckless, thoughtless boy as he planned that raid on her uncle, {{and he had been}} so kind and helpful afterward--and so merry! It was pitiful to see how changed he was, how repentant and sorrowful.|$|E
6000|$|A minute {{more and}} they had parted, shaking hands in a fashion that meant a great deal. Perhaps they would never again meet in this world. Dave turned away and stole off silently, his eyes <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and his throat working convulsively. Ah, how little do the boys of to-day, living in their {{comfortable}} homes and surrounded with every luxury and convenience, realize how much their great-grandfathers of those days had to endure {{in the shape of}} privation and peril! ...|$|E
6000|$|She felt a shock, {{as though}} the bullet had struck her breast. She ran on without pausing. The cottage was dark. She cried at the door, [...] "Giselle! Giselle!" [...] then dashed round the corner and screamed her sister's name at the open window, without getting an answer; but as she was rushing, distracted, round the house, Giselle {{came out of the}} door, and darted past her, running silently, her hair loose, and her eyes <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> She seemed to skim along the grass as if on tiptoe, and vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] responded Millicent, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before her. [...] "What a pity! Still {{accidents}} of {{that description}} must be fairly common where the mountain roads are bad?" ...|$|R
60|$|This man's {{eyes were}} still gleaming, and under their curiously deep tan his bearded cheeks were pale. He was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> {{in front of him}} with an unseeing gaze.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{brought up}} to the very guns, Mr. Bosengate, red in the face, thrust his hands deep into the side pockets of his tunic, and, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before him, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems to {{be going}} a bit stale lately," [...] said Lord Algernon, [...] "and I think {{is getting a little}} queer in his head. He has a trick of {{stopping}} and <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> at times, when he seems to go off for a minute or two. There!" [...] continued the young man, with a light laugh. [...] "I say! he's doing it now!" [...] They both turned quickly and gazed at the bent figure--not fifty yards away--standing in exactly the same attitude as before. But, even as they gazed, he slowly lifted his rake and began his monotonous work again.|$|E
6000|$|They {{developed}} a remarkable skill in seeing her car coming {{far down the}} road. When either of them saw it the other was summoned, and they waited tremblingly. But the landaulet always passed, with Mrs. Carter <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> gray-haired and hook-nosed; sometimes with Miss Margaret Carter, whose softly piquant little nose would in time be hooked like her mother's. Father's treacherous ally the chauffeur never even looked at [...] "The T Room." [...] Sometimes Father wondered if the chauffeur knew just where the house was; perhaps he had never noticed it. He planned to wave and attract the chauffeur's attention, but in face of the prodigious Mrs. Carter he never dared {{to carry out the}} plan.|$|E
6000|$|Schomberg steered with dignity, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> {{but very}} much {{interested}} {{by these two}} promising [...] "accounts." [...] Their belongings, a couple of large leather trunks browned by age and a few smaller packages, were piled up in the bows. A third individual--a nondescript, hairy creature--had modestly made his way forward and had perched himself on the luggage. The lower part of his physiognomy was over-developed; his narrow and low forehead, unintelligently furrowed by horizontal wrinkles, surmounted wildly hirsute cheeks and a flat nose with wide, baboon-like nostrils. There was something equivocal in the appearance of his shaggy, hair-smothered humanity. He, too, {{seemed to be a}} follower of the clean-shaven man, and apparently had travelled on deck with native passengers, sleeping under the awnings. His broad, squat frame denoted great strength. Grasping the gunwales of the launch, he displayed a pair of remarkably long arms, terminating in thick, brown hairy paws of simian aspect.|$|E
60|$|The skipper made no reply. He sat goggle-eyed, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before him, trying in vain {{to realize}} the {{hardness}} of the heart that had been responsible for such a scurvy trick.|$|R
60|$|Over {{his cigar}} Dartie peered round at Bosinney, {{who was sitting}} with his arms crossed, <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> in front of him, and on his face {{the look of a}} man being tortured.|$|R
60|$|The sharp suddenness of the cry {{brought him}} to his feet, quivering. Ruth was swaying on the model-throne. Her eyes were <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> before her {{and her face was}} twisted with fear.|$|R
60|$|Directly I {{had shut}} the door after the doctor I started {{shouting}} for Therese. “Come down at once, you wretched hypocrite,” I yelled {{at the foot of}} the stairs in a sort of frenzy as though I had been a second Ortega. Not even an echo answered me; but all of a sudden a small flame flickered descending from the upper darkness and Therese appeared on the first floor landing carrying a lighted candle in front of a livid, hard face, closed against remorse, compassion, or mercy by the meanness of her righteousness and of her rapacious instincts. She was fully dressed in that abominable brown stuff with motionless folds, and as I watched her coming down step by step she might have been made of wood. I stepped back and pointed my finger at the darkness of the passage leading to the studio. She passed within a foot of me, her pale eyes <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> her face still with disappointment and fury. Yet it is only my surmise. She might have been made thus inhuman by the force of an invisible purpose. I waited a moment, then, stealthily, with extreme caution, I opened the door of the so-called Captain Blunt’s room.|$|E
5000|$|Ismay was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> shaking like a leaf. Even when I {{spoke to}} him, he paid {{absolutely}} no attention. I {{have never seen}} a man so completely wrecked. — Jack Thayer, First Class passenger on Titanic ...|$|E
50|$|She {{was sold}} {{out of the}} service to Castle and Beech on 7 October 1864 and broken up at Charlton in March 1865. Her figurehead, a {{contemporary}} sailor <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> is {{on display at the}} National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.|$|E
5000|$|... = [...] "wheel flop factor," [...] the {{distance}} that {{the center of the}} front wheel axle is lowered when the handlebars are rotated from the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> position to a position 90 degrees away from <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|If one lane {{is shared}} by left turning and <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> traffic, the left turn {{movement}} (protected or permissive) and the <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> movement must begin together and must end together {{at the same time}} in the signal cycle. In this case, a green left turn arrow may not be shown with a circular red, and a red left turn arrow may not be shown with a circular green or a <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> green arrow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come on, you dogs!' muttered Jakin to himself. 'Are we to {{play for}} hever?' Lew was <b>staring</b> <b>straight</b> {{in front of him}} and marching more stiffly than ever he had done on parade.|$|R
