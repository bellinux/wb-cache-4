In a letter of 16 April 1660, the Lords Directors informed Director General and New Netherland council of their intentions to appoint Roelof Swartwout and instructed the Director General Pieter Stuyvesant to appoint him as schout as soon as Wiltwijck later Kingston had a court. They also immediately sent over a letter of commission and instructions for Swartwout. Stuyvesant and his Councilers responded in June 1660 by opposing the decision. The Lords Directors or Board of Directors in Amsterdamn sent a <b>swift</b> <b>reply</b> on 20 September 1660 expressing their surprise at the opposition of the director general and council of their choice and added: [...] "we also think we have the power and authority to have our orders and commands precisely adhered to." [...] This is one of the only times the Directors overruled the Director General decision in New Netherland from Amsterdam.The court establishment in Wiltwijck did not take place until May 1661. The court, had both judicial and administrative tasks once created and would consist of three schepenen and one schout as chairman of the judiciary, who would be Reolof Swartwout.

She sat down and started sharing her concerns hoping to find answers with me.I listened to her long enough. I learned that she was an Arab girl who received her education in France where she was raised. It was also clear that she barely knew Islam. I started explaining basic facts, dispelling suspicions, answering questions and refuting orientalists’ lies about Islam. I also did not forget to allude to today’s civilization and how it considers women as cheap flesh. At the end of my talk, the girl asked for a future appointment and excused herself.Soon after, a young man - on whom qualities of Outward Islamism were apparent - came storming into my office and said violently: “How come such wicked person was admitted here?”“The job of a physician is to accept. He doesn’t typically see healthy people, does he?” I replied. “Of course, you advised her to wear Hijab!” he added. I said to him “The issue is much bigger than that. There is the foundation that has to be laid. There is the Belief in Allah and the Hereafter. There is the hearing and the obeying of what was revealed in the Qur’an and the Sunnah, in addition to the pillars of worship and manners; the pillars that Islam cannot exist without …”. He interrupted me saying, “All of this does not mean we don’t order her to wear Hijab”.“I wouldn’t like it if she came in a nun’s clothes while her heart is void of Allah. I taught her the basis that will help her to choose, on her own free will, to wear more decent clothes,” I calmly replied. He tried to interrupt me again so I said firmly “I can’t drag Islam by its tail as you do. I lay the foundation and then start building and I usually achieve what I want with wisdom”.Two weeks later, the girl came back. She was wearing much more decent clothes with a scarf over her head. She resumed her questions and I resumed my teaching. Then I asked “Why don’t you go to the nearest mosque to your home?” I said that but immediately I felt remorse. I remembered that mosques are closed in the face of Muslim women. The girl answered that she hated the People of Religion and that she {{did not like}} to listen to them.“Why?” I asked.“They are hard-hearted, and they treat us with contempt and scorn”, came her <b>swift</b> <b>reply.</b> I don’t know why I remembered Hind (Abu-Sufyan’s wife).

Now, I do not wish to see someone on the face of this earth more honored than you and your family.” The Prophet’s kindness and sympathy changed the hearts of the people around him.Now, would the Du`ah today learn from their Prophet? Would they learn to draw together instead of driving away, and to bring good tidings rather than to say things that repels people away from them and from Islam?" ...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} occurrence of avian duets, their adaptive significance is poorly understood. It is generally assumed that they {{function in the}} joint defense of territories, but no study has successfully distinguished between this hypothesis, which invokes cooperation between the sexes, and mate defense, which invokes conflict. Further, most duetting {{studies have focused on}} oscine passerines, the songs of which are learnt and relatively complex. We therefore tested the mate defense hypothesis in the warbling antbird (Hypocnemis cantator), an Amazonian suboscine that produces simple sex-specific songs and duets. Acoustic analysis of songs showed (1) that solos were often produced by males, but rarely by females; (2) that duets consisted of a male song and a female reply; and (3) that, although female song was invariable, a <b>swift</b> <b>reply</b> resulted in males producing shorter songs with fewer notes. These results suggest that duetting, and the structure of duets, is chiefly a product of female behavior, a scenario more suggestive of conflict than cooperation. To investigate this idea we carried out playback experiments, which showed that (4) the response to solo songs was sex specific (i. e., male solos elicited a strong response from paired males, and female solos elicited a strong response from paired females); (5) males and females responded to same-sex solos more strongly than to duets; and that (6) females answered their partner’s songs more often, and more rapidly, in response to female solos than male solos or duets. Although {{it can be argued that}} sex-specific responses to solo song result from intrasexual territorial defense, we cannot use the same reasoning to explain (5) or (6). Instead, these observations imply that solitary intruders were more threatening than paired intruders, and thus that the perceived threat was to the partnership rather than the territory. Taken together, findings (1) to (6) suggest that females adjus...|$|E

6000|$|During a {{visit to}} England {{in the winter of}} 1703-4 we find Swift in {{correspondence}} with the Rev. William Tisdall, a Dublin incumbent whom he had formerly known at Belfast. Tisdall was on friendly terms with Stella and Mrs. Dingley, and Swift sent messages to them through him. [...] "Pray put them upon reading," [...] he wrote, [...] "and be always teaching something to Mrs. Johnson, because she is good at comprehending, remembering and retaining." [...] But the correspondence soon took a different turn. Tisdall paid his addresses to Stella, and charged Swift with opposing his suit. Tisdall's letters are missing, but <b>Swift's</b> <b>reply</b> of April 20, 1704, puts things sufficiently clearly. [...] "My conjecture is," [...] he says, [...] "that you think I obstructed your inclinations to please my own, and that my intentions were the same with yours. In answer to all which I will, upon my conscience and honour, tell you the naked truth. First, I think I have said to you before that, if my fortunes and humour served me to think of that state, I should certainly, among all persons upon earth, make your choice; because I never saw that person whose conversation I entirely valued but hers; this was the utmost I ever gave way to. And secondly, I must assure you sincerely that this regard of mine never once entered into my head to be an impediment to you." [...] He had thought Tisdall not rich enough to marry; [...] "but the objection of your fortune being removed, I declare I have no other; nor shall any consideration of my own misfortune, in losing so good a friend and companion as her, prevail on me, against her interest and settlement in the world, since it is held so necessary and convenient a thing for ladies to marry, and that time takes off from the lustre of virgins in all other eyes but mine. I appeal to my letters to herself whether I was your friend or not in the whole concern, though the part I designed to act in it was purely passive." [...] He had even thought [...] "it could not be decently broken," [...] without disadvantage to the lady's credit, since he supposed it was known to the town; and he had always spoken of her in a manner far from discouraging. Though he knew many ladies of rank, he had [...] "nowhere met with an humour, a wit, or conversation so agreeable, a better portion of good sense, or a truer judgment of men or things." [...] He envied Tisdall his prudence and temper, and love of peace and settlement, [...] "the reverse of which has been the great uneasiness of my life, and is likely to continue so." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{friendship}} with Jonathan Swift began about 1695, when Swift was the prebend of Kilroot, near Carrickfergus, where Tisdall had relatives. Swift admired both Tisdall's theological views and {{his style of}} preaching. Their friendship however suffered a long rupture, due to their rivalry for the affections of [...] "Stella", whom Swift had known {{since she was a}} child in the household of his employer Sir William Temple, and who moved to Ireland in 1702 to be closer to Swift. Tisdall wrote to Swift in 1704 announcing that he intended to propose to Stella, and <b>Swift</b> wrote in <b>reply</b> to dissuade him. Swift's letter was courteous enough in tone- he stressed the practical difficulties of such a marriage, since Tisdall was not a rich man, and the Church had not yet found him a salaried position - but he privately expressed his disgust at Tisdall as an [...] "interloper", and their friendship cooled off. It is not entirely clear whether or not Tisdall proposed to Stella, but if he did she certainly refused. Stella, it is clear, would marry Swift or no-one: whether as she apparently claimed they were secretly married in 1716 remains a matter of intense debate. After Stella's death in 1728 the two men were reconciled, and Tisdall witnessed Swift's will. Tisdall died on 8 June 1735.|$|R
6000|$|The {{announcement}} of the publication by Curll of the joint letter of August 23 had not the desired effect upon <b>Swift.</b> In his <b>reply</b> he took no notice of the circumstance, and Pope, finding that nothing he could urge would shake his resolution, addressed, {{in the beginning of}} March, 1737, a statement of the case to Lord Orrery, who was then in Ireland, and engaged him to second his entreaties. Lord Orrery obtained a promise from Swift that the correspondence should be returned, and offered to be the bearer of it. The Dean accordingly acquaints Pope, July 23, 1737, that [...] "when his lordship goes over, which will be, as he hopes, in about ten days, he will take with him all the letters I preserved of yours." [...] "I cannot," [...] said Swift, in making the communication, [...] "trust my memory half an hour," [...] and this passage was a proof that he did not exaggerate his infirmity. Lord Orrery had set sail in the middle of June, and under the same date that Swift wrote from Ireland that his lordship would go over in about ten days, his lordship wrote to Swift from England, [...] "Your commands are obeyed long ago. Dr. King has his cargo, Mrs. Barber her Conversation, and Mr. Pope his letters." [...] Mrs. Barber's Conversation was the manuscript of the [...] "Polite Conversation" [...] of Swift, which she had asked permission to print for her own advantage, and the cargo for Dr. King was the manuscript of the [...] "History of the Four Last Years of Queen Anne," [...] which the Dean was anxious to print for his own credit. But much as it was in his thoughts at this time, he only remembered his settled intention to send the papers--whether history, conversation, or letters--by Lord Orrery, and the act by which the intention was fulfilled had already faded from his mind. The understanding of Swift was rapidly yielding to his mournful malady, and the first faculty to suffer was his memory.|$|R

ToR a) continued in the task of identifying broad sets of new and existing biological parameters that are emerging as critical components of modern assessment. This work is based on a literature review, input from experts, and collaboration with other ICES Working Groups.   ToR b) further dealt with the issue lists for upcoming benchmark species from 2018 and beyond and formulated the Quality indicators for biological parameters. Guide- lines for qualitative evaluation of biological parameters and a flow scheme from data collection to stock assessment were also produced. ToR c) was a generic ToR for the group handling the reviewing of calibration exercises on biological parameters, their outcomes and recommendations for such actions. All the tables containing detailed information about national experts’ contacts, stocks han- dled and techniques used in age reading, were updated and greatly improved.

6000|$|The {{correspondence}} between Swift and Bolingbroke completed the series, which Pope complained was printed without his consent. Of the eight letters from Bolingbroke, seven {{were written in}} conjunction with the poet. These joint compositions, like the partnership letters of Gay, are exactly those which would have been returned to Pope. One of the number furnishes evidence, which almost amounts to a demonstration, that the collection of 1741 proceeded from himself. When he brought out the avowed edition of his letters in 1737, he inserted {{at the end of the}} volume a letter of Swift, a letter of his own, and the joint letter from himself and Bolingbroke, of which Curll had obtained a copy. This little supplement was ushered in by a notice which says, [...] "Since the foregoing sheets were printed off, the following letters having been published without the consent of their writers, we have added them, though not in the order of time." [...] Whatever the motive the announcement was deceptive. The letter of <b>Swift</b> was his <b>reply</b> to the joint letter of Pope and Bolingbroke--that very reply which the poet boasted a month or two before could not be produced surreptitiously, because it had never been out of his custody. Nobody else, by his own showing, had the power to make it public, no earlier impression of it is known to exist, and, as will be seen by comparing it with the copy from the Oxford papers, it was printed with omissions and variations, which must have been the act of the poet, or he would have restored the genuine readings when he included it in his appendix. In juxtaposition with it is a letter from Pope to Swift, dated December 10, 1725, which in like manner has never been found in any prior publication, and which of all his letters to the Dean is the single one we are certain was in his power when the quarto of 1737 was in the press. He transcribed the original at the time it was written, and sent a copy to Lord Oxford, ostensibly to let him see the way in which he was mentioned in it, but partly, perhaps, because the poet thought well of the production.[140] This letter of December, 1725, reappears in tho quarto of 1741, with the addition for the first time of a postscript by Bolingbroke. A copy of the entire performance is among the Oxford papers, and reveals the fact that the Pope portion, and the Bolingbroke portion, are both abridged in the published version. Yet although the persons who brought out the collection of 1741, had the manuscript before them, or they could not have given Bolingbroke's share of the letter, they nevertheless, by a marvellous coincidence, print Pope's share precisely as it had been printed by Pope himself in 1737. The conclusion is irresistible that the editor of the quarto of 1737, was the editor of the collection of 1741. The postscript of Bolingbroke was not written when he was in the house with Pope, but was added subsequently when he got back to Dawley,[141] and its omission from the volume of 1737 was due to the circumstance, that the poet had not then received back his correspondence from Swift, and only possessed a copy of his own carefully composed essay.|$|R

Pope did not abandon the hope of recovering it, and <b>Swift,</b> apparently in <b>reply</b> to his applications, wrote on August 8, 1738, to acquaint him that every letter received from him for twenty years and upwards had been sealed up in bundles, and consigned to the custody of Mrs. Whiteway, whom he describes as [...] "a very worthy, rational, and judicious cousin of mine." [...] Mrs. Whiteway, who had none of the papers, had a short time before kept Swift from sending a similar fictitious account, but the idea had taken deep root in his mind, and rightly conjecturing that he would reiterate it, she engaged Lord Orrery to inform Pope that she had neither got any of the correspondence herself, nor had the slightest knowledge where it was.[134] On the present, as on the former occasion, Swift showed her what he had written, and on the 24th of August he subjoined a postscript in which, after saying that he would correct, if it were possible, the blunders committed in his letter, he simply added that his cousin had assured him that [...] "a great collection of your/my letters to me/you are put up and scaled, and in some very safe hand." [...] The counter-assurance of Mrs. Whiteway to Lord Orrery that she had no knowledge of the collection, shows that the corrected version was as fanciful as the original statement. Swift's language in 1738 would imply that the chasm in the correspondence no longer existed, and that no part of the series had yet been transmitted to England; but it was the language of a man labouring under the misapprehension and obliviousness produced by disease, and could have little weight in opposition to the testimony that Pope had received back a packet of his letters in the previous year. Any doubt which could have existed on the point is done away by the admission of Pope himself. Mrs. Whiteway had refused in 1740 to send back some of his letters by the mother of the Mr. Nugent, who afterwards became Lord Clare, because the poet had authorised her to entrust them to a Mr. M'Aulay. [...] "I believe," [...] Pope wrote to Mr. Nugent, [...] "they had entertained a jealousy of you, as the same persons did before of my Lord Orrery. They then prevented the Dean from complying to any purpose with my request. They then sent a few just to save appearances, and possibly to serve as a sort of plea to excuse them of being taxed with this proceeding, which is now thrown upon the Dean himself."[135] The [...] "proceeding" [...] was the committing the correspondence to the press, and Pope, on his own part, to avoid being taxed with it, was privately putting forth the plea that the bulk of his letters had not been returned to him. The confession that he had received a few is a complete answer to the delusion of Swift, and they must have been more than a very few, or they would not have been sufficient [...] "to save appearances." [...] Setting aside the representations of the poet, upon which no dependence can be placed, except when he bears witness against himself, there is nothing to oppose, and much to confirm the idea that they were the identical [...] "few" [...] which were published in the quarto of 1741.|$|R
