5|$|Williams shipped around 1,000units of Joust 2, {{significantly}} fewer than its predecessor. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame and Mike Bevan of Retro Gamer attributed the poor numbers to an industry <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1980s. Joust 2 arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare among collectors. Weiss negatively compared {{the game to}} its predecessor, calling Joust more popular and enjoyable. However, he commented that Joust 2s graphics are more detailed and robust.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} maiden Test century against Bangladesh {{and then was}} India's leading scorer in the Test tour of England, helping India to win their first series in England in 21 years. However, Karthik {{suffered}} a form <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> late-2007 and was dropped from the Test team, and since then has only made sporadic international appearances, although he continues to score heavily in domestic cricket. These have come in occasional appearances as a specialist batsman when other players were rested or injured, or as a wicket-keeper when Dhoni was sidelined.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Nicholl of Raith Rovers was {{appointed}} as McCarthy's replacement, {{but could not}} reverse the <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> form which saw Millwall relegated {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season in 22nd place. Just five months earlier they had been top of Division One, but now Millwall found themselves in the third tier for the 1996–97 season. The club experienced severe financial difficulties that resulted in them being placed in financial administration for a short time. Nicholl was relieved of his duties and John Docherty returned on a short-term basis to stabilise the club.|$|E

5|$|Kohli had a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> {{form when}} India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test {{which ended in}} a draw and {{averaged}} 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1. Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India came back and won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.|$|E
5|$|Miller's form {{mirrored}} {{the rest of}} the Hibs team as it went into a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> 2010, leading to the departure of Hughes. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better form out of Miller, who he described as a top-level player. Miller expressed a desire to stay at Hibs in March 2011, but the two parties did not agree a new contract, which allowed him to leave the club.|$|E
5|$|After his {{coaching}} stint, {{he worked as}} a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers prior to the 198283 season. NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988) to Los Angeles. After a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award. By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West laid down the fundaments of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.|$|E

5|$|Before 1997 was out, Adams {{took his}} third {{job of the}} 1997–98 season when he was named manager of Brentford. The club had {{suffered}} a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> league form after losing the previous season's Division Two play-off final, and were struggling near {{the foot of the}} table. He signed striker Andy Scott from Sheffield United for a fee of £75,000, as well as signing Glenn Cockerill as player/assistant manager, Warren Aspinall and loanee Nigel Gleghorn. However injuries began to mount, with Ijah Anderson, Derek Bryan and Ricky Reina all sidelined. Adams was named as Second Division Manager of the Month for March after overseeing three wins and two draws. Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were relegated to Division Three {{on the last day of}} the season, and the club was bought out by Ron Noades, who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in California, Hershberger {{attended}} Fullerton Union High School {{where he was a}} baseball standout. He was signed by the New York Yankees and was part of their minor league system for eight years. He was traded after the 1937 season to the Cincinnati Reds, where he found a place on the major league roster as a backup behind Ernie Lombardi. For three seasons, Hershberger played in relief of Lombardi, stepping in if he needed a day off or was injured. After a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> late July and early August, Hershberger committed suicide on August 3, 1940 in his hotel room; the Reds {{went on to win the}} 1940 World Series in his honor.|$|E
5|$|British Airways and Air France {{operated}} the supersonic airliner Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde, and the world's first supersonic passenger service flew in January 1976 from London Heathrow to Bahrain. Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with {{a flight to}} Washington Dulles airport, and flights to New York JFK airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with Singapore Airlines as {{a continuation of the}} flight to Bahrain. Following the Air France Concorde crash in Paris and a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> air travel following the 11 September attacks in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.|$|E

5|$|D'Oliveira was {{omitted from}} the England team for part of 1968 amid a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against Australia at The Oval. Days later, the MCC {{selectors}} omitted D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced apprehension {{and there was a}} public outcry. After Tom Cartwright's withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.|$|E
5|$|Hall of Fame debuted {{at number}} {{three on the}} US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 72,000 copies in the United States. That was a 17% decline in sales from his debut studio album Finally Famous, which also debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and sold 87,000 copies in its first week. David Drake of Complex named the album {{an example of a}} sophomore <b>slump.</b> <b>In</b> its second week, the album sold 18,000 copies in the United States. As of February 2015, the album has sold 155,000 copies {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan. On October 25, 2017, the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for over 500,000 combined sales and album-equivalent units.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weekend of sales of the iPad Mini and {{fourth-generation}} iPad, Apple reported that it sold an aggregated number of 3 million units. TechRadar noted that {{the first weekend}} sales figures for the fourth-generation iPad are lower than corresponding figures for the third-generation iPad, which sold 3 million units in its first weekend. Subsequent reports and analysis such as that from David Hsieh, a technology analyst, suggest that the iPad mini is selling better than the fourth-generation iPad. Despite the noted <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> sales, Apple's stock price, in direct response to the figures released, rose by 1.4% to $584.62 on November 5.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways {{simultaneously}} {{announced that}} they would retire Concorde later that year. They cited low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, the <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> air travel following the September 11 attacks, and rising maintenance costs. Although Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s, 30years later, its analogue cockpit was outdated. There had been little commercial pressure to upgrade Concorde {{due to a lack}} of competing aircraft, unlike other airliners of the same era such as the Boeing747. By its retirement, it was the last aircraft in the British Airways fleet that had a flight engineer; other aircraft, such as the modernised 747-400, had eliminated the role.|$|E
5|$|The HBC {{drastically}} reduced the price paid for furs, by 50% in many cases. By this time, however, the fur trade was in decline, {{both on the}} coast and the continent, due to a general depletion of fur-bearing animals, along with {{a reduction in the}} demand for beaver pelts. A financial panic in 1837 resulted in a general <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> the fur and China trade, bringing an end to a half-century boom. During the 1840s, the HBC closed most of their coastal trading posts, leaving the coast trade to just Fort Simpson and the Beaver, with the new depot at Fort Victoria anchoring the southern coast.|$|E

By month's end, the White Sox lost hold of first-place and on August 26, the Red Sox sat atop the American League at 72-56. A five-way race between the Red Sox, White Sox, Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and the California Angels developed for the American League pennant. The Angels <b>slumped</b> <b>in</b> early September to fall out of the race, and the White Sox <b>slumped</b> <b>in</b> the next to last week of the season.|$|R

5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican {{cochineal}} {{led to an}} abrupt <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> the Polish cochineal trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in quantities of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka colorant, an ingredient in folk medicine, or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E
5|$|United won the Scottish Cup for {{the first}} time in 1994 under McLean's {{successor}} Ivan Golac, but were relegated in 1995, returning a year later. Eddie Thompson purchased the club from McLean in 2002 and invested heavily in the team, but with little progress made until Craig Levein became manager in 2006 and successfully restructured the youth system. Shortly after Levein's departure, the club won the Scottish Cup for a second time in 2010 under the management of Peter Houston. After several relatively successful seasons, a <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> form led to United being relegated in 2016. The first attempt to return ended in defeat to Hamilton in the final round of promotion playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Although Hammond {{began his}} career in 1920, he was {{required}} to wait until 1923 before he could play full-time, after his qualification to play for Gloucestershire was challenged. His potential was spotted immediately and after three full seasons, he was chosen to visit the West Indies in 1925–26 {{as a member of}} a Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.) touring party, but contracted a serious illness on the tour. He began to score heavily after his recovery in 1927 and was selected for England. In the 1928–29 series against Australia he scored 905 runs, then a record aggregate for a Test series. He dominated county cricket in the 1930s and, despite a mid-decade <b>slump</b> <b>in</b> Test form, was made captain of England in 1938. He continued as captain after the Second World War, but his health had deteriorated and he retired from first-class cricket after an unsuccessful tour of Australia in 1946–47. He appeared in two more first-class matches in the early 1950s.|$|E
