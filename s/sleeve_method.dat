40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} new {{surgical}} technique âScleral Sleeve Methodâ which {{would reduce the}} risk of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) tube related complications in patients undergoing AGV FP 7 (New World Medical Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) for refractory glaucoma. Design: Prospective, Non-Randomized, hospital based interventional case series. Subjects: A total of 16 eyes of adult patients (10 males and 6 females) with refractory glaucoma. Methods: Instead of using sutures to fix the AGV tube to sclera, we devised a novel method of intra-scleral tube fixation by creating a scleral tunnel fashioned in form of sleeve. Main outcome measure: Post-operative tube related complications. Result: There were no tube related complications such as exposure, extrusion or retraction in any of the cases. Conclusion: Use of scleral <b>sleeve</b> <b>method</b> for tube fixation, along with graft to cover the tube, will provide additional safety measure and reduce the risks of tube related complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Medically safe, {{elective}} {{male circumcision}} supports traditional and cultural {{rites of passage}} by {{reducing the risk of}} adverse events and death among men undergoing initiation. It is a way of preventing penile conditions that arise from being uncircumcised. It also protects against various sexually transmitted infections, playing a particularly important role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, as it protects against HIV infection in men by up to 60 %. It also helps reduce herpes simplex virus type 2, a key biological co-factor thought to account for some human susceptibility to HIV infection and human papillomavirus. To address these needs and to meet the World Health Organization’s call to upscale male circumcision to 80 % in HIV/AIDS epidemic-gripped sub-Saharan Africa, {{there is a need to}} provide male circumcision as standard care in district health. METHOD : A retrospective review of three years of circumcision services, using the <b>sleeve</b> <b>method,</b> and not the high-volume, forceps-guided method, and training at a Level 1 district hospital in South Africa. RESULTS : Two hundred and twenty-one medical circumcisions were performed, increasing significantly in each successive year. Mostly, they were carried out under local anaesthetic, and there were only four complications, all of which were successfully resolved. The average age of the patients was 20, and generally, they elected to have medical circumcision carried out for cultural reasons. Some 60 students and clinicians were trained in safe medical male circumcision. CONCLUSION : To meet the growing demand for male medical circumcision, especially among teenagers and young adult men at district-level hospitals, there is a need to significantly expand the surgical competency of clinicians in this field. “Circumcision weeks” are one way of routinely upscaling surgical skill levels, while simultaneously responding to increased patient demand for safe medical circumcision.

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose was}} to examine the changes in tissue oxygen {{saturation}} (StO 2) in response to the application of different commercially available calf compression <b>sleeves.</b> <b>Methods.</b> Eight subjects came to the laboratory to complete a session in seated position including 10 [*]min of quiet rest followed by 3 [*]min measuring calf StO 2 without compression sleeves and then alternating of 3 [*]min of passive rest and 3 [*]min measuring StO 2 with calf compression sleeves. A total of 15 different commercially available compression sleeves were studied in a randomized order. Calf StO 2 was recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results. StO 2 was significantly increased with all compression sleeves p< 0. 05 compared with no compression (from + 6. 9 % for the least effective to + 22. 6 % for the most effective). Large differences were observed between compression sleeves p< 0. 05. StO 2 was positively correlated with compression pressure (p< 0. 05; r= 0. 84). Conclusion. This study shows that wearing compression sleeves from various brands differently affects tissue oxygen saturation.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} 2 -mm small gap sleeve bridging {{of the biological}} conduit to repair peripheral nerve injury are better than in the traditional epineurium suture, so {{it is possible to}} replace the epineurium suture in the treatment of peripheral nerve injury. This study sought to identify the regeneration law of nerve fibers in the biological conduit. A nerve regeneration chamber was constructed in models of sciatic nerve injury using 2 -mm small gap sleeve bridging of a biodegradable biological conduit. The results showed that the biological conduit had good histocompatibility. Tissue and cell apoptosis in the conduit apparently lessened, and regenerating nerve fibers were common. The degeneration regeneration law of Schwann cells and axons in the conduit was quite different from that in traditional epineurium suture. During the prime period for nerve fiber regeneration (2 - 8 weeks), the number of Schwann cells and nerve fibers was higher in both proximal and distal ends, and the effects of the small gap <b>sleeve</b> bridging <b>method</b> were better than those of the traditional epineurium suture. The above results provide an objective and reliable theoretical basis for the clinical application of the biological conduit small gap <b>sleeve</b> bridging <b>method</b> to repair peripheral nerve injury. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} relationship between the designer, the pattern maker and the elements that constitute a multiplicity of in-set sleeves. Present <b>sleeve</b> drafting <b>methods</b> represent unpredictable, single-style variations of past methods. They do not vary from the normal non-cohesive practises for any current inset sleeve styles. Current <b>sleeve</b> drafting <b>methods</b> contain only surface explanations for many of the features contained within the <b>sleeve</b> design. Drafting <b>methods</b> are restricted to surface, point-to-point drafting descriptive - they do not convey the actual detailed mechanisms required of the complete scye and sleeve assembly. My perspective suggests that designing and pattern making has scarcely advanced {{since the beginning of the}} nineteenth century, or earlier. Therefore, the principal research question is: How might the role of the designer, the tasks of the pattern maker, the many in-set sleeve styles and related fabrics, be combined to create a unique inclusive in-set sleeve design system that is advantageous to the apparel industry? In order to create a unique in-set sleeve design system, this study incorporates a hybrid process derived from a number of design methods. Case studies of a number of sleeve styles and fabrics, representative of a major percentage of the sleeve design range, are developed to confirm the proposition that although each sleeve is a unique entity, they are, contradictory, all one and the same. This is because they are composed of the same limited number of parts and elements. The study details the parts and elements that compose the scye (armhole) and sleeves. These are united with a compilation of engineering drawing methods which are explained and analysed prior to incorporation with additional drawing interpretations. The adoption of engineering drawing methods as a base, with further adaptations, to create a new logical sleeve design system, is seen as a complete break from current trial and error practises to a predictable outcomes-focussed process...|$|R

40|$|Background Laparoscopic sleeve {{gastrectomy}} is an emerg-ing bariatric {{procedure that}} typically necessitates {{five to seven}} small skin incisions to place five to seven trocars. The senior author (Saber) has developed a single umbilical incision approach to laparoscopic <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy. <b>Methods</b> Seven patients underwent single access transum-bilical laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between March 2008 and July 2008. The same surgeon performed all surgical interventions. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients, and the same operative technique and perioperative protocol were used in all patients. Results A total of seven single-incision laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomies were performed. The procedure was success-fully performed in all patients. Mean operating time was 125 min. None of the patients required conversion to an open procedure. There were no mortalities or postoperative complications noted during the mean follow-up period of 3. 4 months.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause for repair of gas {{transmission}} pipelines is external, corrosion-caused loss of wall thickness. To prevent an area of corrosion damage from causing a pipeline to rupture, the area containing the corrosion damage must be reinforced. The most commonly used method for repair of gas transmission pipelines is the installation of welded full-encirclement steel repair <b>sleeves.</b> Repair <b>methods</b> {{that can be applied}} from the inside of a gas transmission pipeline (i. e., trenchless methods) are an attractive alternative to conventional repair methods since the need to excavate the pipeline is precluded. This is particularly true for pipelines in environmentally sensitive and highly populated areas. Several repair methods that are commonly applied from the outside of the pipeline are, in theory, directly applicable from the inside. However, issues such as development of the required equipment to perform repairs remotely and mobilization of equipment through the pipeline to areas that require repair need to be addressed. Several additional repair methods that are commonly applied to other types of pipelines (e. g., gas distribution lines, water lines, etc.) also have potential applicability but require further development to meet the requirements for repair of gas transmission pipelines.

To address these problems, in this study, the <b>sleeve</b> fracturing <b>method</b> (SFM) was applied to weaken a hard roof. The numerical simulation software FLAC 3 D was used to develop three models based on an analysis of the SFM working mechanism. These models were applied to an analysis of the fracturing effects of various factors such as the borehole diameter, hole spacing, and sleeve pressure. Finally, the results of a simulation were validated using experiments with similar models. Our research indicated the following: (1) The crack propagation directions in the models were affected by the maximum principal stress and hole spacing. When the borehole diameter was fixed, the fracturing pressure increased with increasing hole spacing. In contrast, when the fracturing pressure was fixed, the fracturing range increased with increasing borehole diameter; (2) The most ideal fracturing effect was found at a fracturing pressure of 17. 6 MPa in the model with a borehole diameter of 40 mm and hole spacing of 400 mm.

Multiple buds grow towards the distal nerve stump during proximal nerve fiber regeneration. Our previous studies have verified the limit and validity of multiple amplification of peripheral nerve regeneration using small gap sleeve bridging of small donor nerves to repair large receptor nerves in rodents. The present study sought to observe multiple amplification of myelinated nerve fiber regeneration in the primate peripheral nerve. Rhesus monkey models of distal ulnar nerve defects were established and repaired using muscular branches of the right forearm pronator teres. Proximal muscular branches of the pronator teres were sutured into the distal ulnar nerve using the small gap <b>sleeve</b> bridging <b>method.</b> At 6 months after suture, two-finger flexion and mild wrist flexion were restored in the ulnar-sided injured limbs of rhesus monkey.

Osmium tetroxide staining demonstrated that the number of myelinated nerve fibers was 1, 657 ± 652 in the branches of pronator teres of donor, and 2, 661 ± 843 in the repaired ulnar nerve. The rate of multiple amplification of regenerating myelinated nerve fibers was 1. 61. These data showed that when muscular branches of the pronator teres were used to repair ulnar nerve in primates, effective regeneration was observed in regenerating nerve fibers, and functions of the injured ulnar nerve were restored to a certain extent.

The DTM nuclides have been calculated from impurity concentrations for each of these six cases, and the greatest scaling factor has been kept. The calculation is based upon two impurity sets: First impurity set : a reverse activation calculation provides us with the best estimate value of impurities calculated from the measured mean gamma spectrum and from measured scaling factors.

Stochastic resonance stimulation is a new therapy which has potential benefits for improving proprioceptive function. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if stochastic resonance (SR) stimulation applied with a neoprene sleeve could improve knee proprioception relative to a no-stimulation/no-sleeve condition (control) or a sleeve alone condition in the normal, healthy knee. We hypothesized that SR stimulation when applied with a sleeve would enhance proprioception relative to the control and <b>sleeve</b> alone conditions. <b>Methods</b> Using a cross-over within subject design, twenty-four healthy subjects were tested under four combinations of conditions: electrical stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/no sleeve, and stimulation/no sleeve. Joint position sense (proprioception) was measured as the absolute mean difference between a target knee joint angle and the knee angle reproduced by the subject. Testing was conducted during both partial-weight bearing (PWB) and non-weight bearing (NWB) tasks. Differences in joint position sense between the conditions were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance testing. Results Joint position sense error during the stimulation/sleeve condition (2. 48 ° ± 1. 32 °) was found to be more accurate (P Conclusion These results suggest that SR electrical stimulation when combined with a neoprene sleeve is an effective modality for enhancement of joint proprioception in the PWB knee.

40|$|Background Bariatric surgery {{provides}} excellent {{results in}} term of weight loss and improve associated metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). There is low evidence in literature about changes in body composition in relation to different bariatric procedures {{and the presence of}} T 2 DM. Aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate changes in body composition in diabetic obese patients vs. non-diabetic obese patients who underwent different bariatric procedures, Gastric bypass (LRYGB) or <b>Sleeve</b> Gastrectomy (SG). <b>Methods</b> the Body composition of obese patients eligible to surgery was evaluated by bioelectrical impedence analysis (Tanita BC 418 -MA) before and 1 -year after surgery. A variation test was used to analyze results (BMI and body composition). Results 46 patients underwent bariatric procedures: 20 patients LRYGB and 26 patients SG. 21 patients preoperatively suffered from T 2 DM and 25 did not. Data concerning BMI and body composition were collected at baseline and 1 - year follow-up in four subgroups of patients: obese non-diabetic patients (group 1) and obese diabetic patients (group 2) who underwent LRYGB, obese non-diabetic patients (group 3) and obese diabetic patients (group 4) who underwent Sleeve gastrectomy. At 1 -year follow-up, fat mass and fat-free mass differences in percentage were statistically significant in each subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences as regards BMI, fat mass and fat-free mass percentages between subgroups 1 and 2 as there were, in contrast, between group 3 and 4. Conclusions bariatric surgery can induce good results {{in term of}} weight loss, reduction of fat mass as well as fat-free mass improvement. Obese diabetic patients submitted to Sleeve Gastrectomy have a worse improvement of fat mass and free-fat mass compared to non diabetic patients submitted to the same procedure...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background The {{aim of the}} study was to establish longitu-dinal bone changes in obese women after laparoscopic <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy (LSG). <b>Methods</b> Twenty-nine women at baseline mean age of 40. 41 ± 9. 26 years and with mean body mass index (BMI) of 43. 07 ± 4. 99 kg/m 2 were included in a 6 -month study. Skeletal status at hip [femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH) ] and spine was assessed at baseline, as well as in 3 and 6 months after surgery. Body size was measured at baseline and follow-up (weight, height, BMI, and waist). Results Baseline body weight was 117. 5 ± 18. 4 kg. The mean body weight and BMI decreased by 17. 9 % during the first 3 months after surgery to obtain 28. 4 % after 6 months. At 6 months, BMD decreased significantly for spine by 1. 24 %, FN 6. 99 %, and TH 5. 18 %. The changes after 3 months in individual subjects showed that, in the majority of subjects, FN and TH BMD decreased significantly (in 52 % and 69 % of subjects, respectively), and in 24 % loss of BMDwas found at the spine. After 6 months, the corresponding, significant decreases in individual subjects were found in 72 %, 86 %, and 38 % of women, respectively. Those with a significant loss of FN BMD tended to lose more weight (30 ± 9. 47 versus 23. 25 ± 6. 08 kg, p 00. 061) than others; women with a signif-icant decrease of FN BMD lost more weight than those with no such decrease (30. 43 ± 8. 07 versus 15 ± 1. 91 kg). Conclusion LSG proved efficient for body weight reduc-tion, however, with a parallel decline in bone mineral density...|$|R
40|$|In the thesis, {{methods for}} the thermal and {{mechanical}} analyses of high-speed PM electrical machines are presented and implemented. The first method implemented for the thermal analysis is a combined 2 D- 3 D numerical method. The thermal and turbulent {{properties of the}} flow, such as the temperature rise in the flow and the coefficients of thermal convection, are estimated using a 2 D multiphysics method that couples CFD with heat-transfer equations. The detailed distribution of the temperature rise in the whole solid domain of the machine is determined using a 3 D numerical heat-transfer method. The temperature rises in the machine are also estimated with the traditional thermal-network method, which uses a totally different approach to the heat-transfer analysis. The methods used for the mechanical analysis of the machine include finite-element rotordynamics modelling of the rotor for estimation of the critical speeds and {{the shapes of the}} bending modes and also analytical estimation of the stress in the retaining <b>sleeve.</b> The implemented <b>methods</b> are used for the comparative thermal and mechanical analyses of three different high-speed PM rotor constructions. The first type of rotor construction is retained with a carbon-fibre sleeve and uses a shield for eddy currents made of aluminium. The second rotor construction is retained with a retaining sleeve made from the alloy Ti- 6 %Al- 6 %V- 2 %Sn and the sleeve of the third rotor construction is made from the alloy Ti- 2. 5 %Cu. The last two rotor constructions do not have separate eddy-current shields. The comparative analysis shows that the rotor with a carbon-fibre sleeve and an aluminium eddy-current shield shows the best thermal properties. The rotor with a retaining sleeve made of the titanium alloy Ti- 6 %Al- 6 %V- 2 %Sn offers promising thermal properties because the critical temperatures in the rotor are not exceeded. Additionally, the same rotor construction provides the best rotordynamics properties when compared to the other rotor constructions. The rotor construction retained with a sleeve made of the alloy Ti- 2. 5 %Cu is inferior from the thermal and mechanical points of view when compared with the previous rotor constructions. The methods used for the thermal and mechanical analyses are also used for the determination of the maximum power limits for high-speed PM electrical machines for air-compressor applications. For that purpose, five high-speed PM electrical machines for the speeds of 20, 000 rpm, 40, 000 rpm, 60, 000 rpm, 80, 000 rpm, and 100, 000 rpm are designed in order to determine their maximum mechanical powers. The electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical designs of each machine are performed simultaneously and all the critical values of the thermal and mechanical design constraints are considered. The obtained maximum power limit defines the speed-power region of safe operation of the high-speed PM electrical machines intended for compressor applications...|$|R
