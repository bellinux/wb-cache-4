5000|$|The entire {{space vehicle}} {{itself can be}} spun up to {{stabilize}} the orientation of a single vehicle axis. This method is widely used to stabilize {{the final stage of}} a launch vehicle. The entire spacecraft and an attached solid rocket motor are spun up about the rocket's thrust axis, on a [...] "spin table" [...] oriented by the attitude control system of the lower stage on which the <b>spin</b> <b>table</b> is mounted. When final orbit is achieved, the satellite may be de-spun by various means, or left spinning. Spin stabilization of satellites is only applicable to those missions with a primary axis of orientation that need not change dramatically over the lifetime of the satellite and no need for extremely high precision pointing. It is also useful for missions with instruments that must scan the star field or Earth's surface or atmosphere. See spin-stabilized satellite.|$|E

40|$|The Liquid Motion Experiment (LME), which flew on STS 84 in May 1997, was an {{investigation}} of liquid motions in spinning, nutating tanks. LME was designed to quantify the effects of such liquid motions on the stability of spinning spacecraft, which {{are known to be}} adversely affected by the energy dissipated by the liquid motions. The LME hardware was essentially a <b>spin</b> <b>table</b> which could be forced to nutate at specified frequencies at a constant cone angle, independently of the spin rate. Cylindrical and spherical test tanks, partially filled with liquids of different viscosities, were located at the periphery of the <b>spin</b> <b>table</b> to simulate a spacecraft with off-axis propellant tanks; one set of tanks contained generic propellant management devices (PMDs). The primary quantitative data from the flight tests were the liquid-induced torques exerted on the tanks about radial and tangential axes {{through the center of the}} tank. Visual recordings of the liquid oscillations also provided qualitative information. The flight program incorporated two types of tests: sine sweep tests, in which the spin rate was held constant and the nutation frequency varied over a wide range; and sine dwell test, in which both the spin rate and the nutation frequency were held constant. The sine sweep tests were meant to investigate all the prominent liquid resonant oscillations and the damping of the resonances, and the sine dwell tests were meant to quantify the viscous energy dissipation rate of the liquid oscillations for steady state conditions. The LME flight data were compared to analytical results obtained from two companion IR&D programs at Southwest Research Institute. The comparisons indicated that the models predicted the observed liquid resonances, damping, and energy dissipation rates for many test conditions but not for all. It was concluded that improved models and CFD simulations are needed to resolve the differences. This work is ongoing under a current IR&D program...|$|E

By bending the ends of the tube back towards the center of rotation, a shift of the liquid away from center will result in the water level in one end of the tube rising and thus increasing the pressure in that end of the tube, and consequently returning the liquid {{to the center of the}} tube. By measuring the rotational speed and the distance from the center of rotation to the liquid level in the bent ends of the tube, the pressure reduction inside the tube can be calculated.|$|R

40|$|Vision-aided Inertial Navigation Systems (V-INS) {{can provide}} precise state {{estimates}} for the 3 D motion of a vehicle when no external references (e. g., GPS) are available. This is achieved by combining inertial measurements from an IMU with visual observations from a camera {{under the assumption that}} the rigid transformation between the two sensors is known. Errors in the IMU-camera calibration process causes biases that reduce the accuracy of the estimation process and can even lead to divergence. In this paper, we present a Kalman filter-based algorithm for precisely determining the unknown transformation between a camera and an IMU. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly account for the time correlations of the IMU measurements and provide a figure of merit (covariance) for the estimated transformation. The proposed method does not require any special hardware (such as <b>spin</b> <b>table</b> or 3 D laser scanner) except a calibration target.

40|$|Characterization {{testing of}} {{reaction}} wheels {{is necessary for}} requirement verification and to verify manufacturer specifications. Torque accuracy verification techniques include wheel speed based methods that assume perfectly made wheels {{or the use of}} torque transducers, which are expensive and difficult to set up. A low-cost optical torque characterization method is being developed to solve these issues. In the setup the reaction wheels are placed on a frictionless <b>spin</b> <b>table,</b> commanded an output torque, and then a Pixy-Cam optically tracks the angular position of the table. The data is curve-fitted to obtain angular acceleration and, in turn, the torque outputted by the wheels. In all complete trials the acceleration curves has R 2 values of 3 ̆e. 97 indicating accurate characterization of the torques. This setup benefits from the Pixy-Cam’s built in GUI and ability to interface with Arduino microcontrollers. While these results are promising, further development is required. Improving the nature of the test setup so that the center of mass of the reaction wheels can be easily located, and characterizing the error in the Pixy-Cam, are areas for future improvement. Despite these issues, this method of torque characterization still presents a promising, low-cost method for use in small satellite programs...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{accelerating}} {{forces on the}} performance of loop heat pipes (LHP) is of interest and importance to terrestrial and space applications. They are being considered for cooling of military combat vehicles and for spinning spacecraft. In order to investigate the effect of an accelerating force on LHP operation, a miniature LHP was installed on a <b>spin</b> <b>table.</b> Variable accelerating forces were imposed on the LHP by spinning the table at different angular speeds. Several patterns of accelerating forces were applied, i. e. continuous spin at different speeds and periodic spin at different speeds and frequencies.

Tests were conducted by varying the heat load to the evaporator, sink temperature, magnitude and frequency of centrifugal force, and LHP orientation relative to the direction of the accelerating force. The accelerating force seems to have little effect on the loop start-up in terms of temperature overshoot and superheat at boiling incipience. Changes in these parameters seem to be stochastic with or without centrifugal accelerating forces. The LHP started successfully in all tests...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for controlling nutation motion in a spinning body, comprised of an angular accelerometer with its input axis {{perpendicular to the}} spin axis of the body, a flywheel with an axis of rotation perpendicular to the axis of the accelerometer and to the spin axis of the body, and a motor for driving the flywheel to attenuate or build nutation. The motor is controlled by circuitry that monitors {{the output of the}} angular accelerometer and drives the motor clockwise or counterclockwise during predetermined nutation angles synchronized to the zero crossover points of the accelerometer signal centered about the nutation peaks. The motor drive is phased to damp nutation motion to zero for stabilization. To increase the noise immunity of the system, when the output of the accelerometer falls below a threshold level, the circuitry operates in an open loop, beat mode where data representing the last accelerometer signal that exceeded that threshold level is stored, and the motor drive is controlled by the stored data. In a second version, the motor is controlled to supply a predetermined amount of nutation motion to a body undergoing testing on a <b>spin</b> <b>table</b> for energy dissipation evaluation. In each version, the use of an angular accelerometer rather than a linear accelerometer or gyro to monitor nutation enables placement of the nutation control apparatus at any location relative to the spin axis of the body requiring only crude orientation and no calibration...|$|E
40|$|About {{half of all}} {{scientific}} and commercial spacecraft spin during some part of their mission. Although spinning has many benefits (increasing stability, controlling the location of liquid propellants, and distributing solar heat loads), it also creates problems because a precession (or wobble) motion is unavoidable. For modern spacecraft, {{by far the largest}} source of wobble is energy dissipation in the liquid of partially filled tanks. The liquid s energy dissipation cannot, however, be quantified adequately by any ground test. Current analytical models are also inadequate because fundamental data on fluid motion in low gravity are needed to validate them. Consequently, spacecraft attitude-control systems are designed and operated very conservatively. Nonetheless, spacecraft often still perform poorly in orbit, and some have been lost because of a rapid increase of the wobble rate. The Liquid Motion Experiment (LME) was designed to provide spacecraft designers accurate data on the wobble dynamics of spacecraft that contain large quantities of mobile liquids. LME, which was flown on the space shuttle mission STS- 84, was built under contract to the NASA Lewis Research Center by the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas. Major accomplishments for 1998 include reduction of the flight data and publication of the experimental results. LME was essentially a <b>spin</b> <b>table</b> that created a realistic nutation motion of scale-model tanks containing liquid. Two spherical and two cylindrical transparent tanks were tested simultaneously, and three sets of such tanks were employed to vary liquid viscosity, fill level, and propellant management device (PMD) design.

This paper presents {{the second part of the}} experimental study, i. e. the effect of an accelerating force on the LHP operating temperature. It has been known that in stationary tests the LHP operating temperature is a function of the evaporator power and the condenser sink temperature when the compensation temperature is not actively controlled. Results of this test program indicate that any change in the accelerating force will result in a chance in the LHP operating temperature through its influence on the fluid distribution in the evaporator, condenser and compensation chamber. However, the effect is not universal, rather it is a function of other test conditions. A steady, constant acceleration may result in an increase or decrease of the operating temperature, while a periodic spin will lead to a quasi-steady operating temperature over a sufficient time interval. In addition, an accelerating force may lead to temperature hysteresis and changes in the temperature oscillation. In spite of all these effects, the LHP continued to operate without any problems in all tests...|$|E

TWo spherical and two cylindrical transparent tanks were tested simultaneously, and three sets of such tanks were employed to vary liquid viscosity, fill level, and propellant management device (PMD) design. All the tanks were approximately 4. 5 inches diameter. The primary test measurements were the radial and tangential torques exerted on the tanks by the liquid. Resonant frequencies and damping of the liquid oscillations were determined by sine sweep tests. For a given tank shape, the resonant frequency depended on fill level. For the cylindrical tanks, the resonances had somewhat different frequencies for the tangential axis (0. 55 to 0. 75 times spin rate) and the radial axis (0. 73 to 0. 78 times spin rate), and the tangential axis resonance agreed more closely with available analytical models. For the spherical tanks, the resonant frequencies were between 0. 74 to 0. 77 times the spin rate and were the same for the tangential and radial axes. The damping coefficients varied from about I% to 3 % of critical, depending on tank shape, fill level, and liquid viscosity. 'Me viscous energy dissipation rates of the liquid oscillations were determined from sine dwell tests. The LME energy dissipation rates varied from 0. 3 to 0. 5 times the estimates obtained from scaling previous ground tests and spacecraft flight data. The PNDs sometimes enhanced the resonances and energy dissipation rates and sometimes decreased them, which points out the need to understand better the effects of PMD on liquid motion as a function of PMD and tank design...|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} {{fabricating}} a precise, diffraction- limited, ultra-lightweight, composite- material (matrix/fiber) paraboloidal telescope mirror has been devised. Unlike the traditional {{process of fabrication}} of heavier glass-based mirrors, this process involves a minimum of manual steps and subjective judgment. Instead, this process involves objectively controllable, repeatable steps; hence, this process is better suited for mass production. Other processes that have been investigated for fabrication of precise composite-material lightweight mirrors have resulted in print-through of fiber patterns onto reflecting surfaces, and have not provided adequate structural support for maintenance of stable, diffraction-limited surface figures. In contrast, this process does not result in print-through of the fiber pattern onto the reflecting surface and does provide a lightweight, rigid structure capable of maintaining a diffraction-limited surface figure {{in the face of}} changing temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The process consists mainly of the following steps: 1. A precise glass mandrel is fabricated by conventional optical grinding and polishing. 2. The mandrel is coated with a release agent and covered with layers of a carbon- fiber composite material. 3. The outer surface of the outer layer of the carbon-fiber composite material is coated with a surfactant chosen to provide for the proper flow of an epoxy resin to be applied subsequently. 4. The mandrel as thus covered is mounted on a temperature-controlled <b>spin</b> <b>table.</b> 5. The table is heated to a suitable temperature and spun at a suitable speed as the epoxy resin is poured onto the coated carbon-fiber composite material. 6. The surface figure of the optic is monitored and adjusted by use of traditional Ronchi, Focault, and interferometric optical measurement techniques while the speed of rotation and the temperature are adjusted to obtain the desired figure. The proper selection of surfactant, speed or rotation, viscosity of the epoxy, and temperature make it possible to obtain the desired diffraction-limited, smooth (1 / 50 th wave) parabolic outer surface, suitable for reflective coating. 7.
