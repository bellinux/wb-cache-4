40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the classification of}} acoustic signatures using features extracted at multiple scales from hierarchical models and a wavelet transform. In the model-based approach, multiscale spectral features are extracted with hierarchical autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models. The modeling approach is also used for monitoring vehicular activities from an AR spectrogram. The AR spectrogram shows engine <b>speed,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>changes,</b> and other vehicular activities well, because it represents dominant spectral peaks better than a short-time Fourier transform. In the wavelet-transform based approach, multiscale features are obtained with a wavelet transform. Multiscale classification methods were applied to acoustic data collected at different test tracks under various testing conditions. In this experiment, about 92 percent of vehicles were correctly identified.

In experiment; gear box investigated includes the motor, pump, two spur gears, two shafts and <b>speed</b> <b>change</b> system. The <b>gears</b> are used in experiment and simulations are the same dimensions. Verification of experiment using finite element method that is because highly techniques to investigate the temperature distribution for two teeth of spur gear in mesh. This research deals with {{the study of the}} temperature of two teeth from the start of mesh to the end of mesh. In experimental we using laser Gun instrument to measure the temperature of the two teeth of spur gear in mesh. Measure the temperature distribution along the face width of tooth during mesh with other tooth from the start to the end of mesh. The results of simulation are close to the experimental but in fact we can measure the temperature at any point on the gear surface as well as the temperature on the area contact between two teeth on mesh without any difficulty of experiment set up especially in the area contact between two teeth in mesh as well as save wasting time and cost for measurements beside simulation presents higher accuracy and precision of finite element mesh. These temperature are compared between numerical and experimental results. Both results agree very well. This indicates that the experimental model is successful and leads to excellent results comparing with numerical results (COMSOLprogram) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{hobbing machine}} {{of recent years}} has {{positively}} introduced a computer numerical control (CNC) system, but many traditional hobbing machines with gear trains are still being used to produce gears. These traditional machines generally prepare many indexing <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> for gear cutting. But when we cut the gear of a prime number of teeth, the indexing <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> is not prepared for more than about 100 teeth of the gear. In such a case, we have to correct the indexing {{of the number of}} teeth using a differential gear to cut a helical gear, but when we apply the prime number of teeth on the helical gear, we cannot choose an arbitrary feed speed. Therefore, in this paper, we report on a new indexing mechanism for the prime number of gear teeth using a double differential gear device, which reduces the number of indexes the <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> must go through...|$|R

5000|$|The Skannerz Racerz is {{the third}} in the Skannerz series, where you can scan barcodes, and race cars from three classes: [...] "Off-Road", [...] "Drag", and [...] "Street".There are 120 cars in total, which {{consists}} of 40 cars per class. The game also has 64 optional parts you can install onto any of your vehicles to upgrade them. You start {{the game with a}} basic vehicle known as the [...] "Gizmo" [...] and you must win a certain amount of races to progress in rank, from Rookie to Amateur to Pro. Cars and parts can be obtained by scanning barcodes and either receiving a car from the dealership or beating your opponent in a Pink Slip style race. Parts are also obtained the same as dealership cars, but are received from the Garage. Only one of each car and car part can be obtained. Hindrances can pop up anytime you scan a barcode in the form of losing your car to the police, being impounded or a modified car crashing into a tree and losing a part. Races involve beating the other opponent and also involve 5 <b>Speed</b> <b>Gear</b> <b>changes.</b> Each track has its own obstacles: Off-road has bumps you have to avoid, drag involves your car swaying from side to side along the track and street involves your car slowing and sliding around turns.|$|R

The company to own the business was formed in 1897 and named A Darracq et Cie. Production began with a Millet motorcycle powered by a five-cylinder rotary engine. It was supplemented shortly after by an electric brougham. In 1898 Darracq et Cie made a Léon Bollée-designed voiturette tricar. The voiturette proved a débâcle: the steering was problematic, the five-speed belt drive [...] "a masterpiece of bad design", and the hot tube ignition crude, proving the £10,000 Darracq et Cie had paid for the design a mistake.Darracq et Cie produced its first vehicle with an internal combustion engine in 1900.
