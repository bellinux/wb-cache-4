500|$|In 1930, Ark Royal was recommissioned {{again as}} a {{training}} ship and an aircraft catapult was installed on her forecastle, forward of her cranes. For the next nine years, the ship conducted trials and evaluations of catapults and seaplane launch and recovery equipment and techniques. On 21 December 1934, she was renamed HMS Pegasus to release her name for a new carrier that was then beginning construction. The ship was assigned to Home Fleet when the Second World War began, and was mostly used to train sailors in catapult launching and shipboard recovery techniques. The ship used the Fairey <b>Seafox,</b> Supermarine Walrus, and Fairey Swordfish of the 764 Naval Air Squadron. She also served as an aircraft transport and was present in Scapa Flow, having just delivered some aircraft, on 14 October when the battleship [...] was sunk by the [...] As the closest ship to Royal Oak, Pegasus was able to rescue some 400 survivors.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 October 1939 Emerald sailed from Plymouth for Halifax, Nova Scotia {{with the}} gold bullion from the Bank of England, bound for Montreal, Canada, {{to be used to}} pay for American war materials. As this voyage was under the strictest secrecy, the crew were {{outfitted}} with [...] "tropical white" [...] uniforms, to confuse German agents. In the company of the two old battleships, HMS Revenge and HMS Resolution and her sister ship, HMS Enterprise, as well as the old cruiser HMS Caradoc, the Emerald ran into some of the heaviest seas that Agar encountered. By the time the convoy reached Halifax, the Emerald had lost her ship's boats, rafts, and various depth charges, wires, shackles, and other valuable equipment, not to mention her spotter plane, a Fairey <b>Seafox.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Katanpää-class vessels will be {{equipped}} with an extensive array of equipment to search for, locate and destroy naval mines, ranging from two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and two remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to hull-mounted sensors. The larger AUV, HUGIN (High Precision Untethered Geosurvey and Inspection system), which is manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime, is over four meters long and weighs over [...] It {{is equipped with a}} multibeam echosounder (MBES), a smaller version of the one mounted on the hull of the vessel. This instrument is used to collect topographic information of the seabed and a synthetic aperture side-scanning sonar can be used to detect and classify targets. The smaller AUV, REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit), weighs only [...] and can be used to collect information of the sea floor with its side-scanning sonar at depths of up to 100 metres. Two ROVs, a Double Eagle by Saab Underwater Systems of Sweden and <b>SeaFox</b> I by Atlas Elektronik of Germany, can be used to identify and destroy naval mines. The hull-mounted sensors include a Kongsberg EM-710 RD multibeam echosounder and a TOPAS (Topographic Parametric Sonar) sediment echosounder with jets that can penetrate the uppermost strata of the seabed. In addition the vessels will {{be equipped}} with American-made Klein Associates Klein 5500 towed side-scanning sonars. Underwater positioning is provided with Kongsberg HiPAP 500 (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessels follow a toolbox principle in which a suitable combination of sensors and equipment is selected individually for each mission according to the task and environmental conditions.|$|E

50|$|In 2001 the Royal Navy leased some <b>Seafox</b> {{for use on}} HMS Bangor and HMS Blyth off Iraq as part of Operation Telic. Bangor also {{deployed}} {{them off}} Libya in 2011.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, a <b>Seafox</b> {{played a}} part in the Battle of the River Plate against the German pocket {{battleship}} , by spotting for the naval gunners. This ended with Graf Spees scuttling and destruction.|$|E
50|$|Ledbury {{underwent}} a docking maintenance period, commencing in June 2009, {{to fit the}} new <b>Seafox</b> mine disposal equipment. This new equipment (replacing the French built PAP RCMDS) is a significant improvement in both mine detection and disposal technology.|$|E
5000|$|... {{destroyed}} a buoyant mine containing over 100 kg of high explosive. Using her sonar and underwater mine disposal system, <b>Seafox,</b> the mine was destroyed one {{mile from the}} entrance to Misrata harbour, making the waters safe for aid ships to enter ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Seafox</b> Mine Disposal System is an {{unmanned}} {{underwater vehicle}} (UUV) used {{by both the}} Sandown and Hunt class mine hunters. The unit incorporates a remotely controlled surveillance system {{in order to identify}} a target, guided from the parent ship via fibre optic cables. Once a mine has been identified, an expendable autonomous or remote guided unit is guided to the target and detonates a shaped charge to destroy the mine. Four independent reversible motors and a hover thruster provide high manoeuvrability, allowing for exact placement prior to charge detonation. The <b>Seafox</b> is highly capable unit that seen action with the Royal Navy in recent conflicts clearing coastal waters in both Iraq and Libya.|$|E
5000|$|The {{capabilities}} of the remaining eight vessels of the Hunt class have been significantly enhanced by the installation of Sonar Type 2193 and the NAUTIS 3 command system. The performance of Sonar 2193 exceeds {{that of any other}} mine hunting sonar in service in the world today and is capable of detecting and classifying an object {{the size of a football}} at a distance of up to 1,000 metres. In late 2007 Chiddingfold [...] used the <b>Seafox</b> drone, the Royal Navy's mine disposal system, during Exercise Neptune Warrior off Scotland. <b>Seafox</b> is described by the MOD as a [...] "state of the art fire and forget system, capable of destroying mines in depths of up to 300 metres".|$|E
50|$|The music video, {{which was}} {{directed}} by Ben Fee, premiered on the duo's Vevo account on 29 June 2017. The video features Galantis' mascot, the <b>Seafox,</b> accompanied {{by a host of}} ornately dressed forest creatures on the hunt for a magical remedy.|$|E
50|$|The Fairey <b>Seafox</b> was a 1930s British {{reconnaissance}} floatplane {{designed and}} built by Fairey for the Fleet Air Arm. It {{was designed to be}} catapulted from the deck of a light cruiser and served in the Second World War. Of the 66 built, two were finished as landplanes.|$|E
50|$|The Fairey <b>Seafox</b> {{was built}} to satisfy Air Ministry Specification S.11/32. The first of two prototypes {{appeared}} in 1936, first flying on 27 May 1936, and {{the first of the}} 64 production aircraft were delivered in 1937. The flights were organised as 700 Naval Air Squadron of the Fleet Air Arm.|$|E
50|$|York {{eventually}} {{received a}} rotating catapult amidships behind the funnels, and Exeter had a fixed pair {{in the same}} location, firing forwards and angled out from the centreline. A crane for recovery was located to starboard and one aircraft could be carried, initially a Fairey <b>Seafox</b> and later, in Exeter, a Supermarine Walrus.|$|E
5000|$|Dubbed 'Seafoxchella', their live set debuted {{original}} {{songs and}} remixes from such genres as pop, electro, and house. The duo played an hour-long {{set at the}} Gobi Tent, with live controllers, visuals, and <b>seafox</b> stage set. Highlights included their single [...] "Smile", as well as remixes to their other tune, [...] "You." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Seafox</b> is an anti-mine marine drone. It is a {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV) manufactured by Atlas Elektronik to locate ground and moored mines. There are two versions plus a training version, the orange Seafox-I [...] "inspection" [...] variant has a sonar and INS and the black Seafox-C [...] "combat" [...] round has a 1.4kg warhead.|$|E
5000|$|The three {{decommissioned}} vessels {{were sold}} to Estonia in September 2006. They were re-equipped with TCS (Tactical Control System) and the Atlas Elektronik <b>Seafox</b> ROV for mine disposal. The sonar system will be also be updated. The first ship (ex-Sandown), delivered in 2007, has been named , the second (ex-Inverness), was delivered in 2008 and named [...] and the last (ex-Bridport) named [...] in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{was fast}} enough to {{intercept}} machines like the Fairey Swordfish and Fairey <b>Seafox,</b> its actual performance (and sea-keeping capabilities) was so poor, that out of 51 ordered, only 35 were produced. They were used only in the Aegean Sea, with 161 Squadriglia having seven examples in service {{at the beginning of}} World War II but was soon retired from the front line and sent to seaplane schools. This was the last OFM/IMAM biplane to be designed.|$|E
50|$|Ships of the Sandown-class had a hull {{constructed}} from glass reinforced plastic, and equipment on-board {{have a low}} magnetic signature. While under normal circumstances, the ship operates on diesel engines, when operating near mines she uses an electric drive system. In addition to the bow thrusters, she is also equipped with a Voith Schneider cyclorotor. Further anti-mine equipment includes the <b>Seafox</b> mine disposal system. Ships of the class were each equipped with a single 30mm DS30M Mk2 gun.|$|E
5000|$|... 700 NAS was {{originally}} formed on 21 January 1940 at RNAS Hatston (HMS Sparrowhawk) in Orkney in {{a plan to}} centralise {{the operations of the}} 700 series [...] "Catapult" [...] flights attached to catapult units and to act as a pool and Headquarters for all catapult aircraft embarked on battleships and cruisers - chiefly the Supermarine Walrus flying boat, together with the Fairey <b>Seafox</b> and Fairey Swordfish floatplanes. Initial equipment comprised 42 Walruses together with 11 Seafoxes and 12 Swordfishes.|$|E
50|$|Ashtabula began another WestPac {{deployment}} on 8 February 1975. She {{took part}} in Operation <b>Seafox,</b> a joint SEATO exercise with six other nations. Her next assignments were Operation Eagle Pull and Operation Frequent Wind, held {{off the coast of}} Vietnam. On 11 May, she was ordered to Cambodia to support the rescue of , an American merchant ship that had been captured by communist forces. In late July, the oiler returned to her home port, where she spent the next 10 months in upkeep and local operations.|$|E
50|$|The H-block has {{a compact}} layout, as it {{essentially}} {{consists of two}} vertically opposed inline engines lying one beside another driving side by side crankshafts. Another advantage is that since the cylinders are opposed, the motion in one is balanced by the opposite motion in {{the one on the}} opposite side, leading to very smooth running. The Rapier suffered many of the same problems as the later Dagger and Sabre engines. The Fairey <b>Seafox</b> and Short S.20 were both powered by the Napier Rapier.|$|E
50|$|Many British {{naval vessels}} carried float planes, {{seaplanes}} or amphibians for reconnaissance and spotting: {{two to four}} on battleships or battlecruisers and one on cruisers. The aircraft, a Fairey <b>Seafox</b> or later a Supermarine Walrus, were catapult-launched, and landed on the sea alongside for recovery by crane. Several submarine aircraft carriers were built by Japan, each carrying one floatplane, which did not prove effective in war. The French Navy built one large submarine, the Surcouf which also carried one floatplane, and was also not effective in war.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{airfield}} in Kent was being transferred {{back to the}} RAF an air-sea rescue seaplane base and aircrew training centre was established at the Royal Motor Yacht Club at Sandbanks in Dorset and this base was formally commissioned as HMS Daedalus II on 15 May 1940. 764 & 765 Naval Air Squadrons (NAS) were based there with their Supermarine Walrus, Fairey Swordfish and Fairey <b>Seafox</b> aircraft. This station was also known as RNAS Sandbanks. Concurrently the training establishment formerly at Lympne was moved to Clayton Hall, Newcastle-under-Lyme as a base to train artificers but also retained the name Daedalus II.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 {{she took}} part in {{surveillance}} and embargo operations {{off the coast of}} Libya alongside , as part of Operation Ellamy, the UKs contribution to Operation Unified Protector. In early May 2011, she {{took part in}} a mine-clearing operation to secure the waters of Misrata Port, Libya, after mines were dropped by Muammar Gaddafis forces to prevent aid from being delivered to the besieged city. Brocklesby used her sonar and <b>SeaFox</b> mine disposal system to locate and destroy a mine that was located 1.6 km from the harbour entrance, making the waters safe for aid ships to enter.|$|E
5000|$|Man Capital (aka Mancap), the Mansour Group's private {{investment}} subsidiary, {{is based in}} London and is run by Loutfy Mansour, son of Mohamed Mansour.

Notable investments include marine logistics firm Vanguard (formerly OTS Logistics), Millennium Offshore Services, which provides services to the offshore {{oil and gas industry}} and is now known as <b>Seafox,</b> and Nigerian telecoms infrastructure provider IHS Towers. [...] The subsidiary was also an early investor in technology companies including Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and Uber.|$|E
50|$|On 31 January 2005 a {{contract}} exceeding €30 million {{was awarded to}} Atlas Elektronik for the upgrade of these five vessels with the Atlas Integrated MCM Systems (IMCMS-S). The systems will be commissioned into operational service between 2008 and 2009. The system combines minehunting, minesweeping, mine disposal, surveillance and communication with other naval forces. It comprises an Atlas MCM Tactical Command and Control system, a broadband Atlas HMS-12M hull-mounted sonar and an Atlas mine identification and disposal system (MIDS) <b>Seafox.</b> The IMCMS-S onboard also fully integrates sensors and effectors like the self-propelled variable depth sonar, underwater positioning system, navigation radar and sensors, conventional MIDS systems, and air defence system.|$|E
5000|$|... "Smile" [...] also {{marked the}} first {{instance}} of the [...] "Seafox", a creature that {{is the brainchild of}} visual artist Mat Maitland. The [...] "Seafox" [...] is the Galantis mascot of sorts, appearing in all their videos, cover art and even their live show. The duo also refer to their fans as <b>Seafox</b> Nation and can often be seen using #seafoxnation on their social media sites. Each track has an artwork that goes along with it. These artworks were released on the same date as the album. The artwork go along with audio versions of the song on their YouTube channel and on SoundCloud.|$|E
