5|$|Approximately 40,000 {{medium to}} large icebergs {{annually}} calve from Greenland glaciers, {{and depending on}} wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go {{as far south as}} 48° north latitude (St. John's). Icebergs are most commonly seen in the waters off Newfoundland in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders breed in <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> In the higher climates especially, salamanders will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E

2500|$|Both camps {{continued}} to issue proposals and counter-proposals through the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> into <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> Each side shifted ground, declaring proposals [...] "non-negotiable" [...] {{at one point}} and then abandoning them later.|$|R
500|$|Dams, {{power plants}} and diversions of the Kootenay River, {{of which there are}} many, have been built {{for a variety of reasons}} {{throughout}} the 19th and 20th centuries. The seven dams on the Kootenay serve many purposes, ranging from generation of local electricity to regulation of Columbia River flow between Canada and the United States. None provide for navigation or fish passage. In former times, the Kootenay would rise each <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> with [...] "enormous freshets that every summer flood the Kootenay River valley", but because of water regulation nowadays, such extreme variation in flow are no longer common on the lower river below Libby Dam.|$|R
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and {{sagebrush}} mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} August 2005, with work on both {{platforms}} and the intermediate tower occurring {{through the summer}} of that year. The bulk of the construction occurred in 2006. Installation of the engines and other equipment occurred during the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 2006, which was followed by installation of the cables during the late summer and early fall.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} by decomposing and digesting organic matter—and grows in clusters or in groups on decaying leaf litter or well-decayed wood. It typically fruits {{in a narrow}} window from June to July; this <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> fruiting distinguishes it from the more common Coprinus comatus and Coprinopsis atramentaria, which produce fruit bodies in late autumn. It {{is found in the}} United States, in areas east of the Great Plains.|$|E
50|$|As preparatory work, Guthrie {{painted a}} study of each subject separately, {{considerably}} delaying the process. He held sittings in the <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summers</b> of 1919 to 1921. After a delay caused by Guthrie's illness, the work was first exhibited at the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh in early 1930. Guthrie died in September 1930 before he could complete the final finishing touches before it went on display in London in October 1930. His 17 oil studies and an oil sketch of the composition were donated to Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Guthrie's study of Louis Botha was used by Sargent in making his painting of general officers.|$|R

5|$|Between the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 1921, {{the rebels}} {{experienced}} {{a series of}} defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. British intelligence officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female {{as a prelude to}} mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (<b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer),</b> when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pass}} is open in warmer weather, it {{is a popular}} destination. A scenic {{overlook}} near the pass allows visitors {{to take in the}} alpine tundra environment above treeline, and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert, Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States. Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.|$|E
50|$|Formerly called Pierhead Plaza, Ocean Walk is a {{shopping}} arcade with two seafood restaurants, one fast food restaurant, one supermarket and two health and cosmetic shops. It was extensively renovated between <b>Spring</b> 2005 <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 2006, {{at which point}} it was renamed Ocean Walk, chosen from 80 entries in a naming competition held among KCR Corporation staff.|$|R
50|$|Signagi has a mild Mediterranean-like climate. There {{are four}} seasons, with winters being {{moderately}} cold while summers can be hot. The highest average temperature is in July at 24.3°C while the lowest average temperature is in January at 0.2°C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 602.1 to 949.7 mm, with the heaviest occurring during the <b>spring</b> months <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Located on the southeasternmost {{tip of the}} Korean Peninsula, Busan has {{a cooler}} version of a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa). Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is [...] on 14 August 2016 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is [...] on 13 January 1915. May to July, late <b>Springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>Summers,</b> are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late <b>Summer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> Autumn, August <b>and</b> September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons {{at that time and}} be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, Typhoon Maemi, also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities.|$|R
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia. On 4 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted {{themselves against the}} Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences and, {{for the first time}} in the war, Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month. Also, in July 1943 the British firebombed Hamburg killing over 40,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts in the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% {{of the flow}} above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
50|$|While {{a vaccine}} is {{available}} for PHF, it does not cover all strains of the bacterium, and recent vaccine failures {{seem to be on}} the rise. Additionally, the vaccine usually produces a very weak immune response, which may only lessen the severity of the disease rather than prevent it. The vaccine is administered twice a year, in <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> in <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> with the first one inoculation given before the mayflies emerge and the second administered as a booster.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> into <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> of 1864, the 139th {{fought in}} Grant's Overland Campaign <b>and</b> the <b>early</b> {{stages of the}} Siege of Petersburg. In July, it was {{transferred}} to Washington, D.C. {{with the rest of}} the VI Corps to defeat Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's attack on the city. Then they fought under Philip Sheridan in the Valley to ensure that no more Confederate armies would invade again. (See the article on the campaign). By December 1864, they were back in the siege lines of Petersburg.|$|R
50|$|Eastern chipmunks mate in <b>early</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> {{again in}} <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> {{producing}} litters {{of four or}} five young twice each year.

5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E
5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E
40|$|The {{variability}} of the backscattering to scattering ratio of marine particles, bbp/bp, is examined from in situ measurements performed during <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>summer</b> 2004 {{in the eastern}} English Channel and southern North Sea, {{as part of the}} French National Program of Coastal Environment (PNEC). This area is characterized by a quasi permanent background of terrigenous material from direct inputs, or resuspension effects, and by relatively intense spring phytoplankton blooms (mainly diatoms and the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis globosa). The bbp/bp surface values range between 0. 0024 and 0. 0417, with a mean value of 0. 0138 ± 0. 0083. In order to interpret such a great variability, simultaneous water samples were collected for the biogeochemical characterization of the bulk suspended particle population. We show that the bbp/bp variability is closely related to the composition of the particulate assemblage expressed by Chl, the POC/SPM and POC/Chl ratios, where Chl, POC, and SPM are the concentrations of chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and suspended particulate matter, respectively. The expected decrease of bbp/bp from mineral to phytoplankton dominated waters is confirmed from biogeochemical measurements, for the first time. Our results also suggest that the relative proportion between living and non living organic material has a strong (and sometimes the greatest) impact on the backscattering to scattering ratio. JRC.

50|$|In February, 2008, the Black Atlantic started {{recording}} their {{album in}} a cabin owned by van der Velde’s in-laws, located {{in the small town}} of Saranac Lake, in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. For this recording, drummer Marcel Wolthof was re-enlisted alongside singer-songwriter Kim Janssen on various instruments. Janssen co-wrote some of the songs for the recording and has permanently settled in and joined the band.The band took a large part of these recordings back home to the Netherlands where they finished the album over the course of <b>Spring</b> 2009 <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>Summer</b> at the (now defunct) Paperboat recording studio in Zwolle.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that [...] "On the basis of the nightime air temperature data, every northern <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> northern <b>summer</b> yet observed were identical to within the level of experimental error (to within ±1 °C)" [...] but that the [...] "daytime data, however, suggest a somewhat different story, with temperatures varying from year-to-year by up to 6 °C in this season. This day-night discrepancy is unexpected and not understood". In southern <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> summer, variance is dominated by dust storms which increase the value of the night low temperature and decrease the daytime peak temperature. This results in a small (20 °C) decrease in average surface temperature, and a moderate (30 °C) increase in upper atmosphere temperature.|$|R
5|$|In <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer,</b> migrant birds {{including}} the little gull, black tern, Temminck's stint and garganey may pass through {{on their way}} to breed elsewhere. In the autumn, birds arrive from the north; some, such as whimbrels, curlew sandpipers and little stints, just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south, others staying for the winter. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds. Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, goldeneyes and northern pintails. Red-throated divers are usually on the sea, and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae. Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter, and snow bunting flocks {{can be found on the}} beaches. Thousands of geese, mainly pink-footed, roost at Holkham.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer</b> or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though {{there will be more}} broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|Sarcosphaera is a fungal genus {{within the}} Pezizaceae family. It is a {{monotypic}} genus, containing the single species Sarcosphaera coronaria, {{commonly known as}} the pink crown, the violet crown-cup, or the violet star cup. It is a whitish or grayish cup fungus, distinguished by {{the manner in which the}} cup splits into lobes from the top downward. It is commonly found in the mountains in coniferous woods under humus on the forest floor, and often appears after the snow melts in late <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>summer.</b> The fungus is widespread, and has been collected in Europe, Israel and the Asian part of Turkey, North Africa, and North America. In Europe, it is considered a threatened species in 14 countries. Although several taxa have been described as Sarcosphaera species since the introduction of the genus in 1869, most lack modern descriptions, have been transferred to the related genus Peziza, or are considered synonymous with S.coronaria.|$|E
