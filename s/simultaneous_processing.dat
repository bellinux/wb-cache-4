Results {{showed that the}} dyslexic children exhibited difficulties reporting syllabic material when presented simultaneously. As a measure of <b>simultaneous</b> visual <b>processing,</b> visual attention span skills were assessed in the dyslexic children. We presented the dyslexic children with a phonological short-term memory task and a phonemic awareness task to quantify their phonological skills. Visual attention spans correlated positively with individual scores obtained on the dichotic listening task while phonological skills did not correlate with either dichotic scores or visual attention span measures. Moreover, all the dyslexic children with a dichotic listening deficit showed a <b>simultaneous</b> visual <b>processing</b> deficit, and {{a substantial number of}} dyslexic children exhibited phonological processing deficits whether or not they exhibited low dichotic listening scores. These findings suggest that <b>processing</b> <b>simultaneous</b> auditory stimuli may be impaired in dyslexic children regardless of phonological processing difficulties and be linked to similar problems in the visual modality...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that animals can time multiple intervals that occur sepa-rately or concurrently. Such <b>simultaneous</b> temporal <b>processing</b> occurs both in temporal dis-crimination procedures and in classical conditioning procedures. The {{first part of}} the chapter will consist of the review of the evidence for <b>simultaneous</b> temporal <b>processing,</b> and the conditions under which the different intervals have influences on each other. The second part of the chapter will be a brief description of two timing theories: Scalar Timing Theory and a Packet Theory of Timing. Scalar Timing Theory consists of a pacemaker-switch-accumula-tor system that serves as a clock, a memory that consists of examples of previously rein-forced intervals, and a decision process that involves a comparison of ratios to a criterion; the Packet Theory of Timing consists of a conditional expected time function that serves as a clock, a memory that consists of weighted sums of these values, and a probabilistic decision process that produces packets of responses. Both of these theories will be applied to an example of <b>simultaneous</b> temporal <b>processing</b> by rats, and will {{serve as the basis for}} some general comments about the basis for selecting and evaluating quantitative theories of timing...|$|R

50|$|Based on A. R. Luria's (1966) seminal {{work on the}} {{modularization}} {{of brain}} function, and supported by decades of neuroimaging research, the PASS Theory of Intelligence proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes. The first is the Planning, which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting and constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. The second is the Attention process, {{which is responsible for}} maintaining arousal levels and alertness, and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli. The next two are called Simultaneous and Successive processing and they involve encoding, transforming, and retaining information. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>processing</b> is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required. Examples of this include recognizing figures, such as a triangle within a circle vs. a circle within a triangle, or the difference between 'he had a shower before breakfast' and 'he had breakfast before a shower.' Successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented. These four processes are functions of four areas of the brain. Planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains, the frontal lobe. Attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex, although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>processing</b> and Successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain. <b>Simultaneous</b> <b>processing</b> is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while Successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal-temporal lobes. The PASS (Planning/Attention/Simultaneous/Successive) theory is heavily indebted to both Luria (1966, 1973), and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence.|$|E
