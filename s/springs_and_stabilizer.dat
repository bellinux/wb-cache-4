25|$|The 2.0 {{part of the}} moniker {{refers to}} the updated aero package, which {{incorporates}} a bigger rear wing, new front dive planes, and a new carbon-fiber front splitter. The package improves downforce to 400 pounds at 150mph versus the 2014 Viper TA's 278 pounds at 150mph. The internal parts have also been improved, with a much better suspension setup, new two-piece Brembo rotors, and improved shocks, dampers, <b>springs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars. The car also has an improved X-brace.|$|E
500|$|The {{redesigned}} LS 400 interior received upgraded features, varying from dual-zone climate {{controls to}} rear cupholders. A newly patented seat cushion design, {{similar to the}} car's suspension, utilized lightweight internal coil <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars to improve comfort. One of the first in-dash CD changers was offered as an option. Safety enhancements included enlarged crumple zones, three-point seat belts at all positions, and a new collapsible steering column. In Japan, the Toyota Celsior equivalents were offered in the same [...] "A", [...] "B", and top-spec [...] "C" [...] configurations as before, along with an additional selection of exterior colors. Several optional features, such as a compact disc-based Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation system and reclining rear seats, were available only in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E

5000|$|The car was {{the first}} Brabham to use Alfa Romeo type 115-12 flat 12-cylinder engine with [...] and 340 Nm of torque. It was {{equipped}} with a Hewland six-speed transmission. It used the front air intakes of the previous Brabham, but by regulation {{no longer has the}} air-brooms behind the cockpit and has side panels with larger air intakes to feed the engine and more radiant surfaces. The frame was an aluminum monocoque, while the braking system was constituted by ventilated disc brakes produced by Girling. The front suspension consisted of double wishbones with pull-rods, coil <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars, while the rear used coil <b>springs</b> <b>and</b> <b>stabilizer</b> bars.For the [...] season, pending the development of BT46, a C version of the BT45 was created. This model was equipped with a revised radiator.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of a rigid X-shaped ovoid steel tube frame and four-wheel independent suspension provided surprisingly nimble handling. Double wishbones, coil <b>springs,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>stabilizer</b> bar were used up front and Mercedes' typical double coil spring swing axle in rear. An innovative dashboard-operated rear load-leveling suspension engaged a torsion bar to increase stiffness by one-third when needed, and a pedal-operated central lubrication system kept friction points silent. Brakes were hydraulic drum all around, steering worm-and-sector, replaced in 1952 by recirculating ball.|$|R
