40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} improper use of diacritics in the Turkish alphabet on information retrieval. A diacritic is simply a <b>supplementary</b> <b>sign</b> added to a letter to change the sound value of the letter, and the Turkish alphabet has 5 special letters derived from Latin by adding different diacritics. The statistical analysis performed in this study shows that retrieval performance significantly decreases when documents and queries contain letters with different forms, such that documents consist of letters with diacritics while queries consist of standard Latin letters and vice versa. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose 3 approaches: token normalization by equivalence classes, document expansion, and query expansion. The experimental evaluations carried on the Bilkent Turkish information retrieval test collection suggests that the proposed approaches are promising as a remedy in this line of research.

40|$|International audienceWe present two new {{features}} for our prototype of European Speed Limit Support system: detection {{and recognition of}} end-of-speed-limit signs, {{as well as a}} framework for detection and recognition of supplementary signs located below main signs and modifying their scope (particular lane, class of vehicle, etc [...] .). The end-of-speed-limit signs are globallyrecognized by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The supplementary signs are detected by applying a rectangle-detection in a region below recognized speed-limit signs, followed by a MLP neural network recognition. A common French+German end-of-speed-limit signs recognition has been designed and successfully tested, yielding 82 % detection+recognition. Results for detection and recognition of a first kind of <b>supplementary</b> <b>sign</b> (French exit-lane) are already satisfactory (78 % correct detection rate), and our framework can easily be extended to handle other types of supplementary signs.

40|$|Being able {{to always}} know the current speed-limit {{is a highly}} {{interesting}} feature both for driver information system, and for advanced driving assistance such as a smart Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) automatically adapting vehicle speed to current speed-limit. However, this kind of function can be really valuable and of practical use only if the produced speed-limit information is extremely reliable. Using vision-based Traffic Sign Recognition alone cannot be robust enough, as {{there will always be}} cases in which some sign is missed because of occlusion by another vehicle. Conversely, the system cannot rely only on cartographic navigation information, because it has to take into account roadwork temporary limits as well as variable speed limits enforced by LED <b>signs,</b> and also <b>supplementary</b> <b>signs</b> located below main signs and modifying their scope (class of vehicle, concerned lane, etc [...] .), which requires quite robust vision-based recognition of several kinds of traffic-signs. Even proprioceptive information such as current speed, turn indicators, steering wheel angle (, etc [...] .) could be necessary for a correct system. In this paper, we present several of the required bricks for building such a reliable speed-limit support system: a performant recognition of speed-limit-signs working on various European roads (despite sign variability between country) and able to operate correctly also on LED signs and at night, good detection of end-of-speed-limit-signs, a method for effective detection and recognition of <b>supplementary</b> <b>signs,</b> and a general framework for intelligent fusion, using Belief Theory, of information deduced from vision and navigation.

The {{purpose of this}} study was, therefore, to investigate the word coding strategies of profoundly deaf adults with a view to identify to what extent they used speech-based and sign-based strategies to process English text. For the gathering of the data participants completed three tasks: (1) a measure examining the use of speech and sign-based word coding during reading (2) a phoneme awareness task (3) and a task assessing skill in applying grapheme-phoneme correspondences. Data was analysed using tests of difference (t-tests and ANOVA) with the findings showing that while the less proficient readers had significantly greater English phonological deficits they reported only a minimal use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>sign</b> language coding strategies.

40|$|We {{propose the}} novel {{approach}} of dynamic affine-invariant shape-appearance model (Aff-SAM) and employ it for handshape classification and sign recognition in sign language (SL) videos. Aff-SAM offers a compact and descriptive representation of hand configurations {{as well as}} regularized model-fitting, assisting hand tracking and extracting handshape features. We construct SA images representing the hand’s shape and appearance without landmark points. We model the variation of the images by linear combinations of eigenimages followed by affine transformations, accounting for 3 D hand pose changes and improving model’s compactness. We also incorporate static and dynamic handshape priors, offering robustness in occlusions, which occur often in signing. The approach includes an affine signer adaptation component at the visual level, without requiring training from scratch a new singer-specific model. We rather employ a short development data set to adapt the models for a new signer. Experiments on the Boston-University- 400 continuous SL corpus demonstrate improvements on handshape classification {{when compared to other}} feature extraction approaches. <b>Supplementary</b> evaluations of <b>sign</b> recognition experiments, are conducted on a multi-signer, 100 -sign data set, from the Greek sign language lemmas corpus.

Bourguiba had returned to Tunis on 1 June, welcomed as he came down the gangplank by the Bey's three sons, and by a giant demonstration of Tunisians. Having crossed the capital in triumph, Bourguiba visited the Bey in Carthage, apparently unmindful of having returned his decoration only a few months before, and made a stirring declaration of the deep attachment felt by the Tunisian people towards beylical rule. On 7 August the Bey applied his seal to the conventions agreed with France and on 1 September, {{for the first time since}} the protectorate was established in 1881, he applied his seal to decrees that had not been authorised by the Resident General.
