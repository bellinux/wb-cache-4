Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex.

With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet.

Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

Tom Wilkinson was negotiated with to play the part, but the role went to Pryce, whom Depp idolized.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from being}} Carey's second highest {{worldwide}} seller, Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time. During the album's recording, Carey grew as an artist, {{as well as}} a writer. For {{the first time in her}} career, Carey was able to make music that <b>she</b> <b>truly</b> related to, R and hip hop. While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy". They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia: [...] "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?' They're nervous about breaking the formula.

500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings.

This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't.

[...] The character continues to be heavily discussed among feminist critics. Bustle included Jasmine's first encounter with Aladdin on the website's ranking of the most feminist Disney Princess moments, with author Samantha Rullo crediting the scene with demonstrating [...] "how strong-willed and independent <b>she</b> <b>truly</b> is." [...] In a similar [...] "Feminist Ranking Of All The Disney Princesses", Bustles Chelsea Maze appreciated Jasmine for refusing [...] "to let the men in her life boss her around", ultimately placing the character at number eight because she possesses [...] "the agency to choose her own mate and follow her heart, all while financially supporting the guy she loves."
