50|$|A {{splitter}} is {{a stationary}} blade of similar thickness to the rotating saw blade mounted behind it {{to prevent a}} board from pinching inward into the <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> and binding on the saw blade, potentially causing a dangerous kickback. Like a riving knife, its thickness should be greater than {{the body of the}} saw blade but thinner than its kerf. Blades with a narrow kerf relative to their body are more susceptible to grabbing and kickback.|$|E
50|$|These feet can {{be secured}} {{to the bottom}} of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be {{attached}} by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe kick board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a <b>saw</b> <b>kerf,</b> also made on the back side of the kick board. This toe kick board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Temperature {{variation}} of KDP crystal {{is an important}} reason for its cracking. A finite element model was constructed to analyze temperature and thermal stress distribution of KDP crystal during wire saw slicing. The {{results showed that the}} highest temperature of the crystal which was located on the <b>sawing</b> <b>kerf</b> remained stable during slicing. The temperature inside the crystal rose slowly {{at the start of the}} slicing, and then tended steady with the continued increase of sawing depth. Because of the good cooling condition during the sawing process, the overall rise in temperature was small, and the maximum thermal stress on the <b>sawing</b> <b>kerf</b> was less than the tensile strength of KDP crystal, so temperature variation during slicing had little effect on crystal cracking...|$|R

5000|$|The oboe da caccia has a leather-covered wooden body {{terminating}} in a {{large wooden}} bell, {{or in the case}} of Eichentopf's instruments, a flaring brass bell as pictured above. There are typically two brass keys, E-flat and C. The E-flat key is normally doubled for the left hand. There are usually two twin fingerholes, G/A-flat and F/F#, similar to the soprano baroque oboe. The construction differs from that of practically all other woodwinds. The bore and outward profiles are first created on the lathe, then a series of <b>saw</b> <b>kerfs</b> are made through the bore from the side, which is to become the inner curve. Then the instrument is bent over steam and a slat glued onto the inside curve to fix it. Any remaining lacunae in the kerfs are filled and the curved section is covered with leather. The da caccia is played with a double reed; the sound is very mellow and supple.|$|R
5000|$|The finest and rarest logs {{are sent}} to {{companies}} that produce veneer. The advantage to this practice is twofold. First, it provides the most financial gain to {{the owner of the}} log. Secondly, and of more importance to the woodworker, it greatly expands the amount of usable wood. While a log used for solid lumber is cut into thick pieces, usually no thinner than 1/8 of an inch (3 mm), veneers are cut as thin as 1/40 of an inch (0.6 mm). Depending on the cutting process used by the veneer manufacturer, very little wood is wasted by the saw blade thickness, known as the <b>saw</b> <b>kerf.</b> Accordingly, the yield of a rare grain pattern or wood type is greatly increased, in turn placing less stress on the resource. Some manufacturers even use a very wide knife to [...] "slice off" [...] the thin veneer pieces. In this way, none of the wood is wasted. The slices of veneer are always kept in the order in which they are cut from the log and are often sold this way.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Saw {{marks on}} bone have been {{routinely}} reported in dismemberment cases. When saw blade teeth contact bone and the bone {{is not completely}} sawed into two parts, bone fragments are removed forming a channel or kerf. Therefore, kerf width can approximate {{the thickness of the}} saw blade. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate 100 <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> widths in bone produced by ten saw types to determine if a saw can be eliminated based on the kerf width. Five measurements were taken from each of the 100 saw kerfs to establish an average thickness for each kerf mark. Ten cuts were made on 10 sections of bovine bone, five with human-powered saws and five with mechanical-powered saws. The cuts were examined with a stereoscopic microscope utilizing digital camera measuring software. Two statistical cumulative logistic regression models were used to analyze the <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> data collected. In order to estimate the prediction error, repeated stratified cross-validation was applied in analyzing the kerf mark data. Based on the two statistical models used, 70 – 90 % of the saws could be eliminated based on kerf width...|$|E
40|$|ArticleA {{study of}} both fibre volume loss and related {{opportunity}} cost was performed across the South African softwood sawtimber industry to gain {{information on the}} actual utilisation of useful fibre and potential loss or gain of opportunity in terms of potential revenue from both field practices and policy. The study quantified volume losses from high stumps, felling and crosscut <b>saw</b> <b>kerf,</b> log allowances, excessive removal of merchantable wood, incorrect log trimming allocation, and utilisable wood left in-field. Eight treatments were examined: four terminated with merchandising at roadside landing and four at merchandising yards. Within the treatments, felling was either motor-manual or mechanised and compartments were classed by average compartment tree size (less than or greater than 1 m 3). Total wood utilisation {{was found to be}} 92. 07 %. Stumps were found to be 7 cm higher than necessary and volume losses because of high stumps were 0. 79 % and 0. 07 % for mechanical and motor-manual felling, respectively. For felling <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> losses, mechanical felling showed 0. 92 % loss, whereas motor-manual felling resulted in only 0. 15 % loss. Incorrect log trimming allowance provided for 0. 60 % loss. Excessive trimming of logs resulted in 2. 02 % loss. Volume lost because of crosscutting <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> was low at 0. 20 %, but tops not being extracted resulted in 2. 57 % loss. Using SIMSAW 6 simulations, these volume losses translated into an additional annual harvested volume of 421 722 m 3 or additional 1 278 ha harvested area, R 166 million log value and R 393 million net lumber value loss. Total loss was lowest (6. 49 %) in the average tree size class less than 1 m 3, which was mechanically felled regardless of merchandising location. For the majority of volume loss categories, motor-manual felling caused greater loss when compared to mechanical felling methods. Log trimming allowance consumed 80 604 m 3 annually. The results indicate that the human element may have a greater impact on fibre and value losses than the system choice. Further research is recommended to quantify the effect of the human element. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Among Crystalline Silicon Thin-Films (CSiTF), {{the concept}} of Recrystallised Wafer Equivalents (RexWE) {{established}} by Fraunhofer ISE has steadily shown high efficiencies on good quality substrates. But no low-cost substrate has yet shown high enough results for an industrial launch of this technology. Meanwhile, the recently created company S’TILE has developed a new approach in wafer manufacturing with Sintering of Silicon Powders. It is a cheap process which presents among other advantages the avoiding of <b>sawing</b> <b>kerf</b> loss {{and the possibility of}} high throughput of large area wafers. For this reason, sintered silicon wafers have been used as substrates for RexWE. Up to 9. 2 % of efficiency was obtained on non-optimised 4 cm² solar cells with an excellent open circuit voltage of 580 mV. This Voc is the best obtained up to now with this technology with such low-cost substrates. As the RexWE cell process used here has poor optical confinement, the efficiency is likely to dramatically improve with the CSiTF-optimised texturisation and back reflector already developed at Fraunhofer ISE. These very promising results may thereby open to a new lead in CSiTF and trigger some large scale manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} sawing system, which simulated {{a multiple}} saw edger, {{was used to}} investigate the effect of log rotation on the timber conversions of swept logs of three size-classes. A sample of 100 logs was stratified with respect to both log size and sweep, and four sawing methods (half-taper live sawing, half-taper cant sawing, offset live sawing, and offset cant sawing) were applied with the computer sawing simulation system AUTOS AW to each log at 37 positions representing rotation at 10 ° intervals from 0 ° (equivalent to the "sweep up " position) to 360 ° inclusive. All 14 800 simulations used the same carriage configuration, <b>saw</b> <b>kerfs,</b> and target dimensions, and the timber conversion percentage was determined for each. The results suggest that, under the conditions selected for the simulations, any log rotation {{can be used with}} half-taper cant sawing without sacrifice of substantial volume, but rotation is more important with offset cant sawing. Increased conversions were obtained when the log rotation was approximately 145 °, i. e., midway between the "sweep in " and "sweep down " positions. For every angle, half-taper sawing obtained conversions that were at least equal to, if not greater than, those obtained with offset sawing. Results were consistent with the general rule of thumb that each 0. 1 increase in the sweep:diameter ratio (deviation: s. e. d.) leads to a 5 % decrease in timber recovery...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the features that}} may differentiate cuts made in bone by mechanical and hand-powered saws, specifically investigating the characteristics of commercially available reciprocating saws. The partial limbs of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were used {{as a proxy for}} human remains, and were cut using five commercially available reciprocating saw blades and a hand-powered hacksaw. The reciprocating blades tested ranged from five teeth-per-inch to 14 / 18 teeth-per-inch and included raker, alternating, and wavy tooth sets. The hacksaw blade had 32 teeth-per-inch, with wavy set teeth. All the blades examined were intended to cut wood, metal, or both materials. The resulting false start kerfs and complete kerfs on the remains were then examined macroscopically and microscopically. The present study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine kerf features that characterize reciprocating saws. The presentation of specific features within the kerf varied based upon blade properties, how the implement was powered, and how it was wielded in reference to the material. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that significant differences do exist between reciprocating <b>saw</b> blades. <b>Kerf</b> characteristics in which significant differences were noted include: kerf false start (cross section) shape, frequency of cut surface drift, presence of harmonics, striation regularity, and exit chipping size. Inter-blade differences generally reflect class characteristics previously established for hand-powered blades, though reciprocating blades do not strictly follow these categorizations (Symes 1992; Symes et al. 1998, 2010). Identification of inter-blade differences allows the limited identification of sub-classes within reciprocating saws based on the above characteristics, though blades cannot be uniquely identified. Additionally, interior exit chipping was noted, which has not been mentioned in previous sharp force trauma research. Ultimately, this research has applications for sharp force trauma analysis and further aids in the identification of reciprocating saw use in a forensic context, including dismemberments...|$|R
40|$|Sawing yield is an {{important}} parameter for the sawmill profit. One way to increase the sawing yield is by a reduced <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> width, an adapted shrinking allowance, and a lower sawing allowance. The Swedish sawmills {{on the other hand}} see a risk of poorer sawing accuracy and sawing precision and at worst, more frequent saw blade failures. One problem with a reduced <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> width is the saw mismatch that may occur in double arbor saw machines. Saw mismatch occurs when the saw blades are displaced in axial direction with respect to each other due to wear, heat or mechanical disturbance. In this study the aim was to test the robustness of a laser triangulation unit used for measuring saw mismatch during sawmill operation. The aim was also to find a suitable response variable for saw mismatch which was evaluated by using the cant height, feed speed and average top diameter of the logs as predicting variables in a partial least squares regression. The goodness of prediction for each response variable was used to compare the response variables with each other. The results showed that the robustness when measuring saw mismatch by laser triangulation during ongoing sawmill production was satisfactory. The response variable with the best goodness of prediction (Q 2 = 0. 135) was defined using a sliding window with a size of 500 boards. Each element of the response variable was calculated as the share of boards within the sliding window exceeding a threshold value of 0. 5 mm. This response variable was positively correlated with the cant height, feed speed and average top diameter of the log. Future work requires a designed experiment where the predicting variables are varied systematically and where the effect of characteristics and wear of the saw blades is also considered.

40|$|At least 90 % {{of current}} photo-voltaic (PV) solar cells are {{dominated}} by silicon based structures. For practical use, silicon needs to be physically processed by slicing into wafers and polished, and microscale / nanoscale geometrical changes added for circuits and devices. After the wire sawing procedure, less than 50 % of the silicon feedstock ends up as useful wafers with the remaining Si material lost as <b>sawing</b> slurry (<b>kerf</b> loss). Since approximately one-half {{of the cost of}} the high-efficiency, crystalline Si solar cells is the silicon materials cost, it would be highly desirable to reduce the slicing loss and usage of Si in the solar cells. In view of the expanding needs for thin Si for variety of applications such a flexible, bendable or stretchable electronics, nanowire shaped Si for advanced PV solar cells as well as a need to produce affordable PV solar cells with substantially reduced Si materials cost, convenient direction-controllable and rapid Si shaping technique is highly desirable. We have created here a new and unique Si slicing and patterned shaping method using magnetically direction-guided etching. The method can produce very thin Si sheets or create zig-zag Si wires, with a possibility of obtaining Si wafers essentially ignoring the crystallographic preferred etch directions. The application of magnetic force and gradient field accelerates the kinetics of Si etching/slicing. The Si slicing waste during the magnetically guided slicing can be minimized to be as small as 5 um or less thickness per each Si slicing, as compared to at least an order of magnitude more loss for common mechanical slicing. These studies are discussed in chapter 2. We also described nanopatterning techniques using atomic force microscopy (AFM) based or nano-manipulator based patterning of a substrate surface using localized oxidation of nano- islands or localized changes of surface structure due to applied voltage through the tip of multi-probe.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 In recent years, {{the forest}} {{products}} {{industry has been}} forced to cope with a supply of raw material that is declining in both quality and quantity. In addition, log prices are escalating rapidly. Because log costs may represent as much as 90 percent of the overall production costs of lumber (Williston, 1985), it is crucial that a mill make every attempt to maximize grade and recovery. Quality control (QC) is a broad term used loosely to indicate producing a product to meet the customer's Specifications. In lumber production, quality control is heavily influenced by meeting lumber grade requirements while minimizing fiber use. One component of these grade requirements is conformance to size standards. Size control is one of the functions of a mill's QC department. Size control for lumber manufacturing involves minimizing the variations in the dimensions of lumber that are introduced by the sawing process. An adequate size control program enables a sawmill to maximize both grade and recovery. Grade may be maximized by reducing the amount of boards downgraded due to either excess wane or from planer skip that can result from excessive sawing variation. Minimization of sawing variation can also lead to maximizing recovery. It should be made clear that the reduction in target size that can result from minimizing sawing variation will most often result in a slightly longer or wider board from any one log rather than obtaining additional boards (Darwin, 1989). There are however certain limited log diameter breakpoints at which additional boards may be obtained due to decreased sawing variation. What is proposed in this project is an automated system to collect and analyze board measurement information using optical scanning techniques. The system is intended to provide feedback to mill quality control personnel. This thesis has built upon the image processing and quality control system developed by Aslam (1990) at the Department of Forest Products at Oregon State University. The system is discussed in Aslam's M. S. thesis {{as well as in the}} article by Funck et al. (1992). The image processing system scans the edges of boards while still held in cant form after leaving a gang edger. The system can provide lumber thickness as well as kerf width data. A size control program is included to analyze measurement data and provide information regarding sawing variation. A far more detailed representation of sawing variation can be obtained using this system than is possible with standard size control practices providing measurement accuracy is sufficient. For instance, at gang edgers immediate feedback regarding sawing variation for both boards and <b>kerf</b> is provided. <b>Sawing</b> variation information is of sufficient detail for diagnosing which machine center, and more specifically, which pocket of saws is causing sawing problems. This thesis continued the previous work by quantifying measurement accuracy using various hardware and software configurations, and by developing the software necessary to analyze and then display the data in the most meaningful form. Software techniques were created to avoid measurement errors. The first step in the project was a pilot study conducted using several different imaging configurations, noise filtering techniques, and edge-detection algorithms to quantify the system's precision in measuring static objects. The second step was to develop display software to convey the detailed information this system can provide. The development of measurement error trapping mechanisms was the third step. Measurement errors may occur through incorrectly locating the edges of boards due to the presence of wane, bark, pitch or bark pockets, or knots. Measurement errors may also occur when physically blocked <b>saw</b> <b>kerfs</b> cause a failure to detect a board edge. Lastly, the system was tested on images representing a range of measurement difficulty. This test was performed to determine the measurement accuracy of the system when using combinations of three different edge-detection algorithms and three different noise filtering techniques. This type of automated measurement collection, data analysis and display system will have a financial benefit to a mill by enabling the mill to quickly identify and correct situations leading to sub-optimal lumber or grade recovery...|$|R
40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of burning on saw mark characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start kerfs, and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start kerfs, and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start kerfs and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and bow saw were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start kerfs and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of shrinkage. The average width of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation widths. Shrinkage did not appear to alter the crosscut <b>saw</b> false start <b>kerf</b> widths or the bow saw false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the samples. Warping did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|R
40|$|The sawmill {{process itself}} is not complicated. What makes it complex is thediversity of the raw material, the logs that are {{processed}} in the sawmill, and thedivergent production with many different end products. In the sawmill variousnumber of measurement and scanning equipments are installed. These are usedfor controlling the various processes and for measuring how well they are carriedthrough. The main objective of this thesis is to build knowledge of how we can makethe sawing process, {{one of the main}} steps within the sawmill process, more efficientwith respect to both volume yield and value recovery by new equipmentand new production strategies. The intention has been that the conclusions inthis thesis can contribute to a knowledge base that can be of assistance in decisionsregarding control process parameters and production strategies for a sawmill. There is a possible economic saving by increased volume yield for the sawmillsif the <b>saw</b> <b>kerf</b> width can be reduced, but there is a fear that the presence andmagnitude of saw mismatch will be affected by this. Saw mismatch occurs on thesawn boards due to displacement in axial direction of the saw blades in doublearbor saw machines as a consequence of wear, heat or mechanical disturbance. Itis shown in this thesis {{that it was possible to}} measure saw mismatch automaticallyduring sawmill operation by laser triangulation and that the measurements werecomparable to manual measurements. It is also suggested how the presence andmagnitude of saw mismatch can be evaluated when measurements are carriedout in a sawmill. Another study addressed in the thesis is the consideration of applying analternative log rotation for each log than the in Scandinavia industrial praxis ofhorns down (log crook faced upwards). This possibility for a greater profit returncomes in question since the development of an industrial computed tomographyscanner makes the internal knot structure of the log available. Log breakdown simulations of about 600 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris [L. ]) logs and 800 Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) logs mainly from differentgeographic locations in Sweden showed that there is a potential value increasewhen rotating each log for greatest profit return. The potential value increase wasdependent of the rotational error of the sawing machine and the price differencesbetween quality grades. For the 600 Scots pine logs and the 800 Norway sprucelogs in the study an increased average value increase of 13 % was obtained ifapplying the rotation that maximizes the value of each log instead of the horns down position. An introduced rotational error of the sawing machine reducedthe value potential to 6 %. There was a weak correlation between the log rotationthat maximizes the value of each log and the outer shape of the logs. This meansthat the outer shape can not be used as an indicator of how the log should berotated for greatest profit return. One subject of discussion in the thesis is also the importance of representativeinput data in order to make as general conclusions as possible. The Swedishstem bank has been an important factor in many studies made in the field ofwood technology. It is a well-documented data set and computed tomographyscanning of logs has made it possible to represent internal wood features in logbreakdown software. Since computed tomography scanning of logs is a time consuming process the number of scanned logs are relatively small. Now thatan industrial computed tomography scanner operating at production speed isentering the market this opens up new possibilities. Hopefully simulation studiesthat are performed on larger industrial data sets coming from logs processed inthe sawmills at a daily basis is not too far away.
