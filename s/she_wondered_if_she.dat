500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had focused the novel {{too much on}} her own {{personal}} life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked {{as an antidote to}} Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E

60|$|She too {{had gained}} her wish--to see {{and speak to}} Wessex. What would she say? and how would he reply?

60|$|Every night <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{might not}} hear from him. He {{had promised to}} write, and he had hinted at {{something}} very important.

60|$|Then, with a {{fleeting}} self-conscious motion, <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{would be very}} much surprised, on rising in the morning, to realise that her hair had turned white.

Yet there it remained, brown as ever, {{and there she was}} herself, looking a picture of health.|$|E
60|$|Her {{settlement}}-house {{classes were}} {{closed for the}} summer.

60|$|The {{sun came}} {{on to the}} market at about nine o'clock, and then, from the terrace of the town gate, Alvina looked down on the {{wonderful}} sight of all the coloured dresses of the peasant women, the black hats of the men, the heaps of goods, the squealing pigs, the pale lovely cattle, the many tethered asses--and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would die before she became one with it altogether. It was {{impossible for her to}} become one with it altogether. Ciccio would have to take her to England again, or to America. He was always hinting at America.|$|E
5000|$|Soames' mother {{comes to}} visit her despondent son, who has taken to his bed. In the {{presence}} of his sister Winifred, he cannot speak, only cry over Irene.

50|$|Back in her room, Cordelia {{asks about}} {{a picture of}} her, <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was a nun, handing him a handful of crucifixes she found in her boxes. Angel vamps out at the burning contact and Cordelia again runs away and into Lorne down in the lobby. She's fed up and wants to know the truth, but when the gang finally tells her everything, she {{has a hard time}} believing it.

60|$|She {{was very}} tired. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> might not {{stop for a}} moment. Then she came to an upslope. The car faltered; felt indecisive beneath her. She jabbed down the accelerator. Her hands pushed at the {{steering}} wheel {{as though she were}} pushing the car. The engine picked up, sulkily kept going. To the eye, there was merely a rise in the rolling ground, but to her anxiety it was a mountain up which she--not the engine, but herself--pulled this bulky mass, till she had reached the top, and was safe again--for a second. Still there was no visible end of the mud.|$|E
60|$|Shirley {{said nothing}} more. He {{was not a}} lad of many words. Anne did not say {{anything}} more just then, either. She was thinking of little Joyce's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour--little Joyce who would have been a woman now, had she lived--of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee--of Jem in the terrible trenches--of Nan and Di and Rilla, waiting--waiting--waiting, while the golden years of youth passed by--and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could bear any more. She thought not; surely she had given enough.|$|E
60|$|Absolute silence reigned in {{the silver}} passage. No fish were there; {{not even a}} sea flower grew to relieve the stern {{grandeur}} of this vast corridor. Trot began to be impressed {{with the fact that}} she was a good way from her home and mother, and <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would ever get back again to the white cottage on the cliff. Here she was, at the bottom of the great ocean, swimming through a big tunnel that had an enchanted castle at the end, and a group of horrible sea devils at the other! In spite of this thought, she was not very much afraid. Although two fairy mermaids were her companions, she relied, strange to say, more upon her tried and true friend, Cap'n Bill, than upon her newer acquaintances to see her safely out of her present trouble.|$|E
50|$|The {{story is}} about ten-year-old Judith, who lives with her father John in a small town, {{as members of a}} {{fundamentalist}} sect they warn their neighbours of the approaching armageddon. Motherless and bullied at school Judith seeks escape in her bedroom where she has recreated the town as an elaborate model, which she calls the 'Land of Decoration', a phrase she takes from Ezekiel. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> makes it snow in her miniature world whether she can prevent school from opening. The next morning the October landscape outside her window is blanketed in white. This is just the first of her miracles, but with her power comes trouble as her father's work-colleagues come out on strike and the bullying at school intensifies.|$|R
60|$|That {{question}} of grammar bore upon her history, {{and she fell}} into reverie, of a somewhat sad kind to all appearance. It might have been assumed that <b>she</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had done wisely in shaping her life as she had shaped it, to bring out such a result as this.|$|R
2500|$|Although <b>she</b> {{feels as}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is the fulcrum, Agnes {{begins and ends}} the play on her musings of insanity. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what that would be like. <b>She</b> <b>wonders</b> what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment {{is a very large}} issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|R
