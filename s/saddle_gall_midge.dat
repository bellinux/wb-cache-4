40|$|The <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), has {{undergone}} a resurgence recently as a pest of cereals in Belgium and other European countries. An effective monitoring tool of <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> flights is {{needed in order to}} understand the enigmatic population dynamics of this pest, and to design an integrated management strategy. Therefore, volatile compounds emitted by females (alkan- 2 -ols and alk- 2 -yl butanoates) were identified, and the chirality of the emitted esters was determined to be the R absolute configuration. In field-trapping experiments, racemic non- 2 -yl butanoate attracted substantial numbers of H. marginata males. Thus, this compound will be useful in baited traps for monitoring seasonal flight patterns, and improving integrated management of the <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge</b> in agricultural systems.

Because of the sporadic nature of this pest, which can sometimes be very harmful to cereal crops, an effective monitoring tool is required, both to determine the optimal timing for insecticide applications, and to understand the enigmatic population dynamics of this insect. Following the recent identification of the major sex pheromone component of the <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> non- 2 -yl butanoate, a slow-release dispenser was developed using rubber septa. The release rates of 5 mg and 10 mg-loaded dispensers were initially measured under laboratory conditions, and their effectiveness in terms of pheromone loading and use duration was assessed in the field. The experiments showed that sticky traps baited with 5 mg pheromone-loaded rubber dispensers, renewed every 6 weeks, are suitable for accurately monitoring male H. marginata flights.

40|$|The <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser), is a European pest of cereals. The larvae overwinter {{into the}} soil. Emergence of adult midges {{occurred}} during the spring and after mating, females lay their eggs on the leaves of cereals and several grasses. Eggs hatch a few days later; young larvae crawl to the stem and introduce themselves between the leaf sheath and the stem, were the larvae develop. As reaction {{of the presence of}} midge larvae, stem produce a longitudinal depression of 6 - 7 mm ended by two ridges looking as a horse saddle. When galls are numerous, they can cause break of stems and important yield losses. The <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> which is a major pest in Central Europe, is not very well known in the Western part of the continent. It had already caused huge damage during outbreak periods. The last one reported in Belgium and in The Netherlands occurred between 1965 and 1970. Later, it was never reported again until 2010, where large populations and severe damage were observed, especially in the Flemish polders, a region with clay soils where wheat is cropped intensively. Faced with the resurgence of this pest, we sought to develop effective curative control. To date, crops chemical protection seems to be the only solution in case of heavy emergences. Experimentation was conducted in a highly infested field (Meetkerke, Belgian Polders), according to a randomized complete block arrangement with four replications. Foremost, a lambdacyhalothrin-based insecticide was used to evaluate efficiency of several protection schemes, ranging between one and four spray(s). The large spread of flights observed during the 2011 spring allowed to highlight the effect of treatment date on the attack intensity and also on the galls distribution along the stem, on the different internodes. Moreover, several insecticides already registrated in cereals against aphids were compared for their efficacy against <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge.</b> Studied pyrethroids have shown a very good efficacy, ranging between 75 % and 87 %, when applied twice with a 2 weeks interval.

40|$|Background: <b>Saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a pest {{of cereal}} crops in Europe. Outbreaks are {{difficult}} to predict and effective monitoring tools are required to ensure the effectiveness of pest management options. The female sex pheromone, (R) - 2 -nonyl butyrate, provides {{the basis of a}} highly effective lure for this insect. Here, we demonstrate how the success of this lure can be influenced by parameters such as trap location, lure age, and interference between traps fitted with these lures. Results: A pheromone lure containing (R) - 2 -nonyl butyrate attracted male midges for at least 9 weeks under field conditions. Pheromone-baited traps performed best when situated away from field margins and below the height of the crop. Interference between nearby traps was evident at distances less than 20 m. Conclusion: The results here offer new insights into the behavioural responses of male H. marginata to the female sex pheromone and provide practical recommendations for the use of H. marginata pheromone traps in the field...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since 2010, {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} of the <b>saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser), in Belgium and several other European countries, with this pest sometimes causing severe damage in cereals. In 2012 and 2013, field trials were conducted in heavily infested fields to assess its impact on winter wheat crops and to determine efficient ways of dealing with severe infestations. RESULTS: Crop exposure to H. marginata varied with the different protection methods tried. These methods included one to four successive applications of lambda-cyhalothrin. Yield losses were significant, reaching 6 % in 2012 and as high as 15 % in 2013, and these losses were linearly related to the number of galls on stems. CONCLUSION: The trials showed that insecticide applications needed to be synchronized with H. marginata flight peaks and to target the egg hatching period. They also revealed that insecticides applied to coincide with the first flight could, in humid conditions, also reach the larvae close to the soil surface, prior to their pupation.

Many IPM programs benefit from the natural population suppression inflicted through predation and parasitism. The larval stage of H. marginata overwinters in the soil and may be preyed upon by ground-dwelling arthropods, however the natural enemies of H. marginata remain unrecognized. A PCR-based assay for detecting H. marginata in the guts of predators was designed using novel species-specific primers.

40|$|<b>Saddle</b> <b>gall</b> <b>midge,</b> Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a {{sporadic}} pest of cereals in Northern and Central Europe and is {{of increasing}} {{importance in the}} UK. Recently the major component of the sex pheromone produced by adult female H. marginata {{was reported to be}} 2 -nonyl butyrate. The importance of absolute configuration on attractiveness, the effects on trap catches of the addition of minor pheromone components, dispenser type, and pheromone loading are described in the development of an optimised pheromone lure with which to trap H. marginata males. In analyses of volatiles collected from virgin female H. marginata by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electroantennographic recording (EAG) from the antenna of a male H. marginata, two EAG responses were observed. Analyses by coupled GC-mass spectrometry (MS) indicated these were due to 2 -nonyl butyrate and a trace amount (1 %) of 2 -heptyl butyrate. A similar trace amount of 2 -nonanol was detected in GC-MS analyses but this compound did not elicit an EAG response when the synthetic compound was tested, whereas while the other two compounds did. These three compounds were not observed in collections of volatiles made from male H. marginata. The 2 -nonyl butyrate was shown to be the (R) -enantiomer, and i. In field trapping tests (R) - 2 -nonyl butyrate was at least ten times 10 × more attractive to male H. marginata than the racemic compound, and while the (S) -enantiomer was unattractive. Addition of the potential minor components individually or together at the naturally -occurring ratios did not increase or reduce the attractiveness of the lure. Polyethylene vials and rubber septa were equally effective as pheromone dispensers, lasting for at least five 5 weeks in the field in the UK, although laboratory tests indicated release from the former was more uniform and more likely to last longer in the field. Increasing loading of pheromone in the dispenser increased attractiveness. Traps baited with polyethylene vials containing 0. 5 mg of (R) - 2 -nonyl butyrate are recommended for monitoring H. marginata and these are far more sensitive than water or sticky traps currently used for monitoring this pest...|$|E
