Some of the researchers claim that cerebral dominance and laterality are determined by genetic factors, just as the case with eye color and blood type.

Hence, the present research was designed to study the relationship between 1 - lateral dominance and birth season 2 - lateral dominance and gender.

It additionally assessed the interaction with manual laterality factors, such as handedness, asymmetry of hand motor skills, and familial <b>sinistrality.</b> A Hemispheric Functional Lateralization Index (HFLI) for language was derived from fMRI. Through mixture Gaussian modeling, three types of language hemispheric lateralization were defined: typical (left hemisphere dominance with clear positive HFLI), ambilateral (no dominant hemisphere with HFLI values close to 0), and strongly-atypical (right-hemisphere dominance with clear negative HFLI values). Three cognitive scores were derived from 12 tests covering various aspects of verbal and spatial cognition. Compared to both typical and strongly-atypical participants, those ambilateral for language production had lower performances in verbal and non-verbal domains, indicating that hemispheric specialization and cognitive skills are related in adults. Furthermore, this relationship was independent from handedness and asymmetry for motor skills, as no interaction was observed between these factors. On the other hand, {{the relationship between}} familial <b>sinistrality</b> and cognitive skills tended to differ according to language lateralization type.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between manual laterality and cognitive skills remains highly controversial. Some {{studies have reported}} that strongly lateralised participants had higher cognitive performance in verbal and visuo-spatial domains compared to non-lateralised participants; however, others found the opposite. Moreover, {{some have suggested that}} familial <b>sinistrality</b> and sex might interact with individual laterality factors to alter cognitive skills. The present study addressed these issues in 237 right-handed and 199 left-handed individuals. Performance tests covered various aspects of verbal and spatial cognition. A principal component analysis yielded two verbal and one spatial factor scores. Participant laterality assessments included handedness, manual preference strength, asymmetry of motor performance, and familial <b>sinistrality.</b> Age, sex, education level, and brain volume were also considered. No effect of handedness was found, but the mean factor scores in verbal and spatial domains increased with right asymmetry in motor performance. Performance was reduced in participants with a familial history of left-handedness combined with a non-maximal preference strength in the dominant hand. These results elucidated some discrepancies among previous findings in laterality factors and cognitive skills. Laterality factors had small effects compared to the adverse effects of age for spatial cognition and verbal memory, the positive effects of education for all three domains, and the effect of sex for spatial cognition...|$|E

40|$|Summary This {{report is}} an {{overview}} of the lateral distribution of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded during silent reading in 7 different experiments. Both single word and cross-sentence averages revealed the presence of several ERP asymmetries. The P 1, P 2 and a negativity between 300 and 500 msec were found to be larger over the right than left hemisphere. It was argued that this asymmetric negativity was due primarily to the contribution of the N 400 elicited by all content words. The degree of N 400 asymmetry was unaffected either by the rate of sentence presentation or the ratio of congruent to incongruent sentences but was quite sensitive to family history of left-handedness. In contrast, the P 1 and P 2 asymmetries were uninfluenced by lexical class or familial <b>sinistrality.</b> Key words: Event-related brain potential asymmetries; Language; N 400; P 1; P...|$|E

40|$|How {{speciation}} genes {{can spread}} {{in a population}} is poorly understood. In land snails, a single gene for left–right reversal could be responsible for instant speciation, because dextral and sinistral snails have difficulty in mating. However, the traditional two-locus speciation model predicts that a mating disadvantage for the reversal should counteract this speciation. In this study, we show that specialized snake predation of the dextral majority drives prey speciation by reversal. Our experiments demonstrate that sinistral Satsuma snails (Stylommatophora: Camaenidae) survive predation by Pareas iwasakii (Colubroidea: Pareatidae). Worldwide biogeography reveals that stylommatophoran snail speciation by reversal has been accelerated {{in the range of}} pareatid snakes, especially in snails that gain stronger anti-snake defense and reproductive isolation from dextrals by <b>sinistrality.</b> Molecular phylogeny of Satsuma snails further provides intriguing evidence of repetitive speciation under snake predation.

40|$|Functional asymmetries, most {{commonly}} associated in humans with population-level hand preference and lateralization in language processing, are complex, heterogeneous traits with poorly understood biological and genetic bases. Notably, functional asymmetries are {{also associated with}} familial non-right handedness suggesting that common genetic factors influence both handedness and functional lateralization. This dissertation has two aims. The first {{is the development of}} a specific biological hypothesis that may partially account for the consistent co-lateralization of hand preference and prefrontal language function. I argue that asymmetries in local neural properties that affect the excitability and signal-to-noise ratio of neural assemblies can produce a bias in the direction and, to some extent, the degree of functional lateralization for complex functions. At a high level of representation, this hypothesis is similar to long-standing theories of hemispheric differences, but differs from these by providing a single biological difference between hemispheres that influences both motor and prefrontal asymmetries. Specifically, I propose that a hemispheric asymmetry in the ratio of activity at D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptors can account for both forms of asymmetry. The second aim is to identify novel electrophysiological and behavioral correlates of genetic effects linked to handedness. By applying a standard genetic model to familial handedness data, I obtain an estimate of these genetic effects for individual research participants that may improve sensitivity over previous studies that have primarily used categorical classifications to study familial handedness effects. Two EEG studies of executive function provide evidence for computational changes associated with familial handedness. The first, an auditory oddball paradigm, suggests that cortical noise is increased in conjunction with estimated genetic effects associated with left handedness. In the second study, a go-nogo task, a dissociation between response inhibition and response conflict processing was found with respect to estimated genetic effects associated with left handedness. In addition to bearing on current theories of conflict processing, these results may provide indirect evidence for dopaminergic contributions to neurological and behavioral differences associated with familial <b>sinistrality.</b> Additional studies of resting EEG and behavioral responses to Necker cube viewing provide additional evidence for broad effects of familial <b>sinistrality...</b>|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the common}} belief that {{language}} is unique to humans, great emphasis {{has been placed on}} the neocortex, while the role of the subcortical areas has been minimized. This project used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the linguistic involvement of the basal ganglia (BG). Previous research has demonstrated that the BG are implicated in building up sequences of behavior into meaningful, goal-directed repertoires This study developed the idea of motor sequencing into linguistic sequencing to test the BG's involvement in the abstract sequencing of language. Since past imaging studies failed to present a coherent picture of the BG laterality, which might be due to the absence of the control for subjects' familial handedness background, this subject factor was also investigated. Twenty-four right-handed, neurologically healthy English speakers were recruited. Half of them had left-handed blood relatives (FS+); the other half did not (FS-). Their tasks included 1) linguistic sequencing [...] reordering phrases into a sentence or reordering words along the general-specific dimension, 2) non-linguistic sequencing [...] swapping designated phrases/words and 3) repeat [...] repeating words in their original sequence. Voxel-wise analysis showed that both the BG and cortical areas were activated when subjects performed a reordering task. Region of interest (ROI) analysis demonstrated that the BG were involved in linguistic sequencing (reorder - repeat) and that Broca's area and the caudate head were co-opted in computing hierarchical structure (reorder - swap). Although familial <b>sinistrality</b> did not alter the activation pattern of Broca's area and the caudate head, it played a role in their activation asymmetry: both subject groups had left-lateralization in the inferior frontal gyrus, but they failed to show identical laterality in the BG. A possible explanation based on the direct and indirect pathways in the BG was offered and the laterality discrepancy was attributed to these two groups' different time course of language acquisition. To summarize, this study suggested that the BG, especially the head of the caudate nucleus, were involved in the abstract sequencing of language and that the distinct brain asymmetry associated with different familial <b>sinistrality</b> background might be rooted in the BG...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of data in the literature, the {{percentages}} of dextral versus sinistral species of snails have been calculated for western Europe, Turkey, North America (north of Mexico), and Japan.

40|$|Abstract Language {{lateralization}} {{was assessed}} by two independent functional techniques, fMRI and a dichotic listening test (DLT), {{in an attempt to}} establish a reliable and non-invasive protocol of dominance determination. This should particularly address the high intraindividual variability of language lateralization and allow decision-making in individual cases. Functional MRI of word classification tasks showed robust language lateralization in 17 right-handers and 17 left-handers in terms of acti-vation in the inferior frontal gyrus. The DLT was intro-duced as a complementary tool to MR mapping for lan-guage dominance assessment, providing information on perceptual language processing located in superior tem-poral cortices. The overall agreement of lateralization as-sessment between the two techniques was 97. 1 %. Con-flicting results were found in one subject, and diverging indices in ten further subjects.

We tested whether digit ratio is related to the degree of hand skill such that low 2 D: 4 D (indicating high levels of testosterone in utero) may be correlated with enhanced left-hand performance. In right-handed children, high 2 D: 4 D correlated with improved right-hand skill and low 2 D: 4 D correlated with enhanced left-hand skill. Correlations were found to be similar for girls and for boys. Since low 2 D: 4 D has been previously reported to be associated with faster left-hand speed compared to right in Afro-Caribbean children with very low mean 2 D: 4 D, the present finding in a Caucasian population with high mean 2 D: 4 D suggests that a tendency of improved left-hand performance due to prenatal testosterone may be found across ethnic groups...|$|E
40|$|Background —General {{conclusions}} concerning {{mechanisms of}} cerebral lateralization may {{be learned from}} the investiga- tion of functional brain organization in patients with anomalous lateralization. Case Description —The functional organization of language, attention, and motor performance was investigated in a 42 -year-old patient with crossed nonaphasia by means of functional MRI. The strongly right-handed man experienced a left middle cerebral artery infarction documented by MRI without exhibition of aphasia. However, the left hemispheric stroke was accompanied by visuospatial impairment, right-sided slight sensory and motor paresis, and right homonymous hemianopia. No history of familial <b>sinistrality</b> or prior neurological illness was present. Functional MR language mapping revealed strong right hemispheric activation in inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices. Finger tapping with the right hand recruited ipsilateral premotor and motor areas as well as supplementary motor cortex. A Stroop task, usually strongly associated with left-sided inferior frontal activation in dextrals, resulted in strong right hemispheric frontal activation. Conclusions —From our data there is clear evidence that different modalities, such as language perception and production, attention, and motor performance, are processed exclusively by 1 hemisphere when atypical cerebral dominance is present...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{analysis}} of a small freshwater goby, Rhinogobius flumineus, showed a distinct dimorphic asymmetry in the lower jaw. The mouth of each fish opened with a slight but definite distortion toward the right or left side, depending on the individual. Right-opening mouth (dextral) fish had a right lower jaw that was more protruded than the left one, and left-opening (sinistral) fish had a more protruded left lower jaw. No fish had laterally symmetric lower jaws, indicating that the asymmetry was different from ‘fluctuating asymmetry’. These fish used either the right or {{left side of the}} mouth when picking up food from the bottom, but neither dextral nor sinistral individuals used one side more frequently than the other side. The mouth asymmetry, however, was related to the stationary posture: dextral fish stayed on the bottom with the line of their bodies curved to the right more frequently than to the left, and vice versa for the sinistral fish. Genetics of the morph phenotype were investigated by observing the frequencies of morphs in F 1 under captive breeding.

Theydemonstrate a large number of left-sided motor and sensory preferences which are considered as external markers offunctional hemispheric asymmetry of the brain. The purposes of this study are to investigate gender peculiarities and specificityof age-related dynamics of laterality pattern’s formation in junior schoolchildren and to find out educational peculiarities anddifficulties of left-handed children. The findings show that left-handers differ greatly in their mental development by havingsome peculiarities of intelligence, world’s perception and prevailing thinking strategies, ways of memorization, specificity ofemotional-affective expression. The main problems of left-handed children in school performance are academic failure, lack ofperseverance, anxiety neurosis, and extreme emotional lability. Integrated development of the left hemisphere and the righthemisphere thinking of left-handed schoolchildren is a favorable condition for harmonious personal and intellectualdevelopment and effective mastering of various modules of the school curriculum. The technological solution of the problem ofteaching the children with left-sided laterality is to include in educational programs some special exercises to developimagination, emotional sensitivity, integrity of perception, global view to the problems, creativeness, and original approachesto tasks’ solving. So a complex program for the intensive development of the right hemisphere of children who demonstrateleft-sided laterality to overcome the possible failure at primary school is proposed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 60) A {{model is}} presented to explain the relationships of brain lateralization, spatial visualization, and mathematics preparation {{to the development of}} mathematics anxiety. Sex-related differences are examined. The subjects were 122 students enrolled in introductory psychology courses. All participants completed items related to demography, academic background, familial <b>sinistrality,</b> and laterality. They also completed tests of four spatial factors, a vocabulary test, the Fennema-Sherman Math Anxiety Scale, and the MARS Factor Scales of Numerical Anxiety and Math Test Anxiety. All the predictors were entered as intervening variables in an exploratory path analysis on math test anxiety. The model explains math test anxiety by the direct effects of numerical anxiety and lack of-confidence in math ability. The effect of lateralization is mediated by numerical anxiety. Indirect effects related to lack of confidence include math preparation, coursework in geometry and trigonometry, and spatial visualization. Analyses performed separately by sex indicate that factors contributing to math test anxiety are similar for both sexes. Lisrel IV was used to test the model. A preliminary principal components analysis without rotation indicated the presence of three latent variables suitable for this kind of analysis. They were labeled Spatial-Visualization, Math Participation, and Math Anxiety. A hierarchical model in which spatial-visualization affects math behavior which then produces differential attitudes toward math was confirmed. An alternative model which proposed independent effects of spatial visualization and math anxiety on math participation was not confirmed. These results are discussed {{in the context of their}} implications for intervention strategies to increase math participation...|$|E
40|$|In an {{extensive}} {{determination of the}} effects on somatosensory functions of penetrating brain wounds in man, Semmes, Weinstein, Ghent, and Teuber (1960) noted that {{there appeared to be}} inherent differences in the cerebral organization for somesthesis. Cortical representation for the right hand was found to be somewhat focally concentrated within the somatosensory regions of the left hemisphere, while representation of the left hand was more diffusely distributed within the right hemisphere, and occasionally, also in the left hemisphere. These findings raised the possibility that if cerebral organization between hands differed, then it was likely that somatosensory functions could differentially affect each hand. In their study, a small group of normal right-handed subjects were found to have greater sensitivity to pressure on the left hand while a very limited number of normal left-handers showed greater sensitivity on the right hand. Weinstein and Sersen (1961) extended this experi-ment to a large sample of normal right- and left-handers to determine whether lateralized sensitivity was the result of peripheral callus or a reflection of differential central organization. Testing palms, forearms, and soles, Weinstein and Sersen were unable to demonstrate significant directional differ-ences in mean pressure thresholds for the right or left side. However, when frequency counts were made, it was noted that there was a consistent trend for the left side to be the more sensitive side for both handedness groups, particularly on the palms. Further analysis, according to the presence of a family history of <b>sinistrality,</b> altered the direc-tional trends as follows: whereas non-familial sinistrals and dextrals continued to show a trend toward greater sensitivity on the left hand, familial sinistrals showed a significant trend toward greater sensitivity on the right hand. The results of the study of Weinstein and Sersen (1961) discount the effects of peripheral factors on directional asymmetries in pressure sensitivit...|$|E
