About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another <b>small</b> <b>plate</b> {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a <b>small</b> <b>plate</b> of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a <b>small</b> <b>plate</b> intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{his last}} {{applications}} of neuroplasticity was to treat patients with damaged vestibular systems, meaning {{they were unable to}} remain balanced. [...] The device he created (now sold as Brainport) consists of a group of accelerometers positioned on the patient and linked to a computer. [...] The information is processed and fed to a <b>small</b> <b>plate</b> which is positioned on the patient's tongue (used because of the high density of sensory receptors). [...] The device stimulates different areas of the tongue, depending on the orientation of the accelerometers. [...] This stimulation enables the patient to stay balanced. [...] However, after repeated use, Bach-y-Rita discovered that the patient remained balanced for a short time after using the device. [...] After using the device for several weeks, the patient was completely cured, demonstrating another application of neuroplasticity in treating neurological disorders, and also the ability of the brain to adapt to repeated stimuli. [...] Also created was a similar device that enables a patient to see by way of a camera attaching to his or her head and feeding information to the tongue.|$|E

[...] As his prayer was much integrated with traditional liturgy, Escrivá found the transition difficult and asked Echevarría to help him with respect to the new rites. Although he missed the practices of the old rites, especially some gestures such as the kissing of the paten (a <b>small</b> <b>plate,</b> usually made of silver or gold, used to hold Eucharistic bread), he prohibited his devotees to ask for any dispensation for him [...] "out of a spirit of obedience to ecclesiastical norms... He has decided to show his love for the liturgy through the new rite", commented Echevarría. However, when Msgr. Annibale Bugnini, Secretary of the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy, learned of Escrivá's difficulties, he granted Escrivá the possibility of celebrating the Mass using the old rite. Whenever Escrivá celebrated this rite, he did so only in the presence of one Mass server.|$|E
2500|$|The IBM arc {{system is}} part of the Philippine Sea Plate, at least to the first approximation. Although the IBM arc deforms {{internally}} – and in fact in the south a <b>small</b> <b>plate</b> known as the Mariana Plate is separated from the Philippine Sea Plate by a spreading ridge in the Mariana Trough – [...] it is still useful to discuss approximate rates and directions of the Philippine Sea Plate with its lithospheric neighbors, because these define, to a first order, how rapidly and along what streamlines material is fed into the Subduction Factory. The Philippine Sea Plate (PH) has four neighboring plates: Pacific (PA), Eurasian (EU), North American (NA), and Caroline (CR). [...] There is minor relative motion between PH and CR; furthermore, CR does not feed the IBM Subduction Factory, so it is not discussed further. [...] The North American plate includes northern Japan, but relative motion between it and Eurasia is sufficiently small that relative motion between PH and EU explains the motion of interest. [...] The Euler pole for PH-PA as inferred from the NUVEL-1A model for current plate motions [...] lies about 8°N137.3°E, near {{the southern end of the}} Philippine Sea Plate. PA rotates around this pole CCW ~1°/Ma with respect to PH. [...] This means that relative to the southernmost IBM, PA is moving NW and being subducted at about 20–30mm/y, whereas relative to the northernmost IBM, PA is moving WNW and twice as fast. [...] At the south end of IBM, there is almost now convergence between the Caroline Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate.|$|E
