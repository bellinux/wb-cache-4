5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of <b>Sex</b> <b>Differences</b> (OSSD) and the journal Biology of <b>Sex</b> <b>Differences</b> to further the study of <b>sex</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as <b>sex</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Various {{studies have}} {{reported}} mixed results during their investigation of the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in jealousy. The debate rages as to whether men do in fact respond more jealous to sexual infidelity than emotional infidelity compared to women and whether women respond more jealous to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity compared to men. This study examines {{the nature of the}} <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in jealousy with particular focus on three main issues: Firstly, whether the paradigm is simply an artefact of measurement. Secondly, whether the proposed <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> is mainly due to the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in emotional jealousy and thirdly, whether the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in jealousy is due to evolution. Method: We studied jealousy using the same group of participants, male (n = 56) and female (n = 65), on a variety of different measures including Schützwohl’s (2006) information search, Buss et al. ’s (1992) hypothetical dilemmas and Michalski, Shackelford and Salmon’s (2007) dilemmas involving siblings. The analysis of data included Chi Squares, t-tests and Analysis of Variance. Results: The <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in jealousy was apparent in measures other than the forced-choice, hypothetical dilemma measure and the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> for emotional jealousy survived on more measures than the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> for sexual jealousy. However, there was no effect found for sex of sibling but there was an effect found for sex of participant. Conclusions: Our results support the view that the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in jealousy is more to do with a <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in emotional jealousy due to a female sensitivity to emotional infidelity. In addition, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in jealousy was not found to be an artefact of measurement. However, we found no evidence to support the evolutionary theory of jealousy due to the fact we did not find an effect for sex of sibling and also {{because of the lack of}} support for a mechanism to prevent cuckoldry (sexual jealousy) ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in {{swimming}} speed {{showed no significant}} difference between World Cup races (7.9 [*]±[*] 0.6 %) and World Championships (7.8 [*]±[*] 0.0 %), whereas the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> {{in swimming}} speed in World Cup races was significant higher than in European Championships (6.2 [*]±[*] 0.1 %) (P[*]<[*] 0.01) or at the Olympic Games (6.6 [*]±[*] 0.2 %) (P[*]<[*] 0.01). There was also a significant higher <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in swimming speed in World Championships compared to European Championships (P[*]<[*] 0.01) or to Olympic Games (P[*]<[*] 0.01), whereas <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> at the Olympic Games was higher than at the European Championships (Figure  6 C).|$|R
30|$|Although women {{reduced the}} <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the shorter ultra-triathlon {{distances}} (i.e. Ironman distance), the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in longer triathlon distances (i.e. Double and the Triple Iron ultra-triathlon distance) remained greater {{compared to the}} single Ironman distance. The <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> for split times and overall race times remained unchanged at ~ 24 - 27 % for the fastest three performances ever for all distances. Additionally, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the swimming split increased significantly with increasing race distance. The most likely reasons for the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in ultra-triathlon performance are the lower number in female participation in these races, the lower muscle mass in women compared to men and the different motivational trends in women compared to men. It seems very unlikely that women will ever outrun men in ultra-distance triathlons from the Ironman to the Double Deca Iron ultra-triathlon distance.|$|R
5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{claims about}} {{hardwired}} <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> interact with people’s minds {{as they are}} communicated {{to the public in}} popular books and articles. ‘Brain facts’ have become increasingly popular and persuasive on public attitudes due to the increased fascination with neuroscience. Suggestions made in public domains that <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in achievement in science, mathematics or philosophy can be explained by innate brain differences can have important psychological effects. Haslam and colleagues found that emphasis on the biological causes of <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in intelligence suggests inevitability and fixedness, creating essentialist beliefs about gender that deepen social divides.|$|E
25|$|Large, {{representative}} {{studies of}} US students show that no <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in mathematics performance exist before secondary school. During and after secondary school, historic <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in mathematics enrollment {{account for nearly}} all of the <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in mathematics performance. A performance difference in mathematics on the SAT exists in favor of males, though differences in mathematics course performance measures favor females. In 1983, Benbow concluded that the study showed a large sex difference by age 13 and that it was especially pronounced at {{the high end of the}} distribution. However, Gallagher and Kaufman criticized Benbow's and others' reports, which found that males were over-represented in the highest percentages, on the grounds that they had not ensured representative sampling.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in {{swimming}} speed of ~ 7 % in these elite open-water ultra-distance swimmers seemed lower {{compared to the}} <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> of athletes in other ultra-endurance disciplines such as ultra-running (Lepers et al. 2013; Rüst et al. 2013 a) or ultra-cycling (Rüst et al. 2013 b). For example, Coast et al. (2004) investigated the world best running performances at distances from 100 [*]m to 200 [*]km and reported an average <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in running speed of ~ 12 %. Rüst et al. (2013 a) examined running performances in 100 mile ultra-marathons held between 1998 and 2011 and found an average <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in running speed of ~ 17 %. In ultra-cycling, such as the ‘Race Across America’, a <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in cycling speed of ~ 19 % between the annual fastest women and men was described (Rüst et al. 2013 b).|$|R

30|$|The small <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in {{swimming}} speed {{might also be}} {{explained by the fact that}} the athletes competed in ultra-distance swimming events. It was described that the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> {{in swimming}} speed decreased with increasing swimming distances, whereas in cycling (Lepers 2008) and running (Tanaka & Seals 1997) the gap between women and men appeared constant with increasing race distance (Hoffman 2008; Lepers 2008; Tanaka & Seals 1997). Indeed, previous studies showed that the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> increased with longer running distances (Coast et al. 2004; Knechtle et al. 2011). Contrary to running events, Tanaka and Seals (1997) showed a progressively smaller <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> with increasing swimming distance from 50 [*]m (19 %) to 1, 500 [*]m (11 %).|$|R

25|$|Psychologist and {{psychometrician}} Steve Blinkhorn {{published a}} {{criticism in the}} journal Nature against Richard Lynn and Paul Irwing on their meta-analysis of <b>sex</b> <b>differences,</b> where he pointed out their flaw in excluding an intelligence study from Mexico that accounted for almost 45% of the data. He claimed that {{had it not been}} excluded, no <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> would have been found. He highlighted the need for proper research designs instead of summing up through meta-analysis.|$|E
25|$|Claims from {{scientific}} research on <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in intelligence, quite independently of their scientific validity, can have self-fulfilling effects and therefore sustain the very <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> {{they seek to}} explain. Psychologist Barry Schwartz extended the concept of idea technology to convey {{the point that the}} ideas and concepts produced by science and technology, just like the tangible products, can affect our lives. This notion is also described as looping effects or feedback effects in cognition and culture, whereby the causal understanding of a particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.|$|E
30|$|A second {{important}} {{finding was}} the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in peak freestyle swimming speed {{did not significantly}} change with increasing race distance. Our findings for the distances from 100  m to 400  m freestyle {{are in line with}} previous findings from Nevill et al. (2007). Their analysis of the 100  m, 200  m, and 400  m freestyle swimming world records from 1957 to 2006 showed that the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in swimming performance remained unchanged between ~ 8 % and ~ 11 %. Regarding the distance, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> decreased with increasing race distance. For 100  m freestyle, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> was at ~ 11 %, for 200  m freestyle at ~ 10 % and for 400  m freestyle at ~ 9 %, respectively (Nevill et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|A major <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in {{the rate}} of {{continuing}} bone expansion was confirmed for 5660 adult subjects of European ancestry. The five-decade gain in metacarpal midshaft area amounted to 8. 4 % in 3455 females and 2. 8 % in 2205 males. There was no systematic age effect on the length of the second metacarpal. Accordingly, both bone expansion and the marked <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in its magnitude may be attributed to sex-specific aspects of ageing much like the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in endosteal surface loss...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that {{men are more likely}} than women to engage in direct competition, but it is unclear if this reflects social structural conditions or evolved predispositions. These hypotheses can be addressed by quantifying competitiveness in sports and testing if the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> is decreasing over time in the U. S., a society where social roles have converged. Study 1 assessed participation and the occurrence of relatively fast performances by masters runners (40 – 74 years old) at recent road races and track meets. Fast performances occurred over 20 times more often at track meets than at road races. Women comprised 55 % of finishers at roads races but only 15 – 28 % of finishers at track meets. Thus, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in masters track participation can serve as a measure of the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in competitiveness. Study 2 used data from national championship meets and yearly rankings lists to test whether the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in masters track participation decreased from 1988 – 2012. The <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> decreased overall, but {{there was no evidence of}} change since the late 1990 s. Therefore, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the willingness to engage in direct sports competition appears to reflect both social structural conditions and evolved predispositions...|$|R
25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> were found, one qualitative difference was found between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E
25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in athletic performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{desire to}} lose weight is highly {{correlated}} with poor body image, with {{more women than men}} wanting {{to lose weight}}. Kashubeck-West et al. reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in body image disappear.|$|E
30|$|This study {{investigated}} the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in performance for each discipline and overall race time for the fastest competitors in ultra-distance triathlons from the Ironman distance in ‘Ironman Hawaii’ to the Double Deca Iron ultra-triathlon distance between 1978 and 2013. It was hypothesized that women {{would be able to}} reduce the gap with men in both swimming and running parts in ultra-triathlons. The main findings were that (i) the fastest men were faster than the fastest women regarding overall race times, (ii) women reduced the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the shorter ultra-triathlon distances (i.e. Ironman distance) but extended the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in longer distances (i.e. Double and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon) and (iii) in contrast to our hypothesis, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the swimming split increased with increasing race distance.|$|R

40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>difference</b> in cardiac {{contractile}} function exists {{which may}} contribute to the different prevalence in cardiovascular diseases between genders. However, the precise mechanisms of action behind <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in cardiac function are still elusive. Given that <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> exists in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF- 1) cascade, this study is designed to evaluate the impact of severe liver IGF- 1 deficiency (LID) on <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in cardiac function. Echocardiographic, cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca 2 + properties were evaluated including ventricular geometry, fractional shortening, peak shortening, maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (± dL/dt), time-to-peak shortening (TPS), time-to- 90 % relengthening (TR 90), fura-fluorescence intensity (FFI) and intracellular Ca 2 + clearance. Female C 57 mice exhibited significantly higher plasma IGF- 1 levels than their male counterpart. LID mice possessed comparably low IGF- 1 levels in both sexes.

25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Earl Hunt {{published}} in the journal Intelligence found that <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published Intelligence also found that <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or g factor and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring g factor in a 2002 study published in Intelligence. Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that g factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of g factor. Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.|$|E

25|$|Despite some genetic <b>sex</b> <b>differences,</b> {{environmental}} factors play {{a large role}} in biological changes during adolescence.

These environmental influences in turn affect female physical development.|$|E
30|$|The <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in {{athletic}} performance {{might also be}} influenced by differences in female and male participation (Capranica et al. 2013). For both women and men, the number of successful finishes increased in the ‘Catalina Channel Swim’ in the last ~ 10  years. However, the men-to-women ratio remained unchanged. In the ‘English Channel Swim’, the increase in participants was exponential in the last ~ 40  years (Knechtle et al. 2014 b). However, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> remained unchanged for the annual three fastest in this time period. The decrease in <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the ‘Catalina Channel Swim’ {{in contrast to the}} unchanged <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in the ‘English Channel Swim’ might be due to the different time periods (i.e. ~ 40  years from 1975 to 2011 compared to ~ 90  years from 1927 to 2014) and the different samples (i.e. annual fastest compared to annual three fastest).|$|R
30|$|Accordingly, Knechtle et al. (2011) {{found that}} the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> in Double and Triple Iron ultra-triathlon was the {{smallest}} in swimming compared to cycling and running.

25|$|Although forced-choice {{questionnaires}} show {{a statistically}} significant sex- difference, critics {{of the theory of}} evolved <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in jealousy question these findings. In consideration of the entire body of work on <b>sex</b> <b>differences,</b> Harris (2003) asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise. For example, in a study by Sangrin & Guadango (2005), the authors found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity. The results of these studies also depended on {{the context in which the}} participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt, as well as the intensity of their jealousy. From this study, it is clear that context plays a role in the responses men and women give researchers and therefore how sex-differences are interpreted.|$|E
25|$|Money's {{definition}} of gender {{is based on}} his understanding of <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> among human beings. According to Money, {{the fact that one}} sex produces ova and the other sex produces sperm is the irreducible criterion of sex difference. However, there are other sex-derivative differences that follow in the wake of this primary dichotomy.|$|E
25|$|The current {{literature}} on <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> produced inconsistent results {{depending on the}} type of testing used. Among the researchers who conducted studies on intelligence, many point that there are no <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in g (Jensen 1998, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2000, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2002, Camarata and Woodcock 2006), some found a difference favoring males (Lynn 1999, Lynn Irwing 2004, 2008) and some found a difference favoring females (Keith, Reynolds, Patel & Ridley 2006 and Reynolds, Keith, Ridley, Patel 2006). The issues remains unresolved if one uses standardized tests as Jensen (1998) and Colom, Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in intelligence in general (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in general intelligence (g factor). The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while g factor is a latent scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between g and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and g are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to g factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlate highest with g factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> on an n-back working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity and thus contradicting the position pushed forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> in intelligence. The same results in the 2009 n-back working memory study have also been replicated in numerous other studies since.|$|E
