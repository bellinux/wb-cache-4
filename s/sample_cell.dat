25|$|Telomeres are {{identified}} by telomere arrays. A telomere array {{is a unique}} arrangement of telomeres within a <b>sample</b> (<b>cell,</b> individual, etc.) that {{is defined by the}} number of sequence repeats, the pattern of fragments given by restriction digest, the chromosome on which it is found, and the specific location of the sequence on that chromosome. In the literature, mega-telomeres are referred to as Class III telomeres based on the characteristics of their arrays.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the setup}} of a {{fluorescence}} assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength {{is required for}} proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the <b>sample</b> <b>cell.</b> After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to Stokes shift and various electron transitions. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission monochromator, and observed selectively by a detector.|$|E
2500|$|Gaseous samples {{require a}} <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> {{with a long}} {{pathlength}} {{to compensate for the}} diluteness. The pathlength of the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> depends on the concentration of the compound of interest. A simple glass tube with length of 5 to 10cm equipped with infrared-transparent windows at the both ends of the tube can be used for concentrations down to several hundred ppm. Sample gas concentrations well below ppm can be measured with a [...] White's cell in which the infrared light is guided with mirrors to travel through the gas. White's cells are available with optical pathlength starting from 0.5 m up to hundred meters.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for passing light bundles through a multiple pass <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> is disclosed. The multiple pass <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> includes a <b>sampling</b> chamber having {{first and second}} ends positioned along a longitudinal axis of the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> further includes an entrance opening, located adjacent the first end of the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> at a first azimuthal angular position. The entrance opening permits a light bundle to pass into the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> also includes an exit opening at a second azimuthal angular position. The light exit permits a light bundle to pass out of the <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> after the light bundle has followed a predetermined path...|$|R

50|$|In an {{exothermic}} reaction, {{the temperature}} in the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> increases upon addition of ligand. This causes the feedback power to the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> to be decreased (remember: a reference power is applied to the reference cell) in order to maintain an equal temperature between the two cells. In an endothermic reaction, the opposite occurs; the feedback circuit increases the power in order to maintain a constant temperature (isothermic/isothermal operation).|$|E
5000|$|An {{isothermal}} titration calorimeter {{is composed}} of two identical cells made of a highly efficient thermally conducting and chemically inert material such as Hastelloy alloy or gold, surrounded by an adiabatic jacket. [...] Sensitive thermopile/thermocouple circuits are used to detect temperature differences between the reference cell (filled with buffer or water) and the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> containing the macromolecule. Prior to addition of ligand, a constant power (<1 mW) {{is applied to the}} reference cell. This directs a feedback circuit, activating a heater located on the <b>sample</b> <b>cell.</b> During the experiment, ligand is titrated into the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> in precisely known aliquots, causing heat to be either taken up or evolved (depending {{on the nature of the}} reaction). Measurements consist of the time-dependent input of power required to maintain equal temperatures between the sample and reference cells.|$|E
30|$|By this method, {{the object}} space is {{segmented}} {{into a lot}} of <b>sampling</b> <b>cells,</b> as contiguous points in each cell have the same unique visibility signature. The human body acts as a structured thermal source. As the body passes the boundaries of the <b>sampling</b> <b>cells,</b> the PIR sensors will generate output with different characteristics corresponding to different human motions, e.g., falling, sitting down, standing up from a chair, walking, and jogging.|$|R
30|$|As the {{analysis}} mentioned in Section 3.1, {{to capture the}} discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall, it requires that the system can sense the time-varying HME of each sub-region. In our sensing model design, each <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> corresponds to a sub-region of the monitored region, and the PIR sensors are employed to capture the time-varying HME of these <b>sampling</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, our sensing model satisfies the design requirements. Our sensing model is an intrinsic non-isomorphic model, which means the number of PIR sensors M {{is less than the}} number of <b>sampling</b> <b>cells</b> L, and the measurement of each PIR sensor is a linear combination of the <b>sampling</b> <b>cells</b> [30]. However, its sensing efficiency is high, that is, it can robustly detect the fall by processing low-dimensional sensor data directly. The reason lies in that the our sensing model captures the most discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall by efficient spatial segmentation. In Section 5, we will elaborate the system implementation, and list the specification of the reference structure.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> available, ranging from a flow cell for a few microliters to <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> with a filling funnel for fast sample exchange without cleaning the measuring prism in between. The <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> {{can also be used}} for the measurement of poisonous and toxic samples with minimum exposure to the sample.Micro cells require only a few microliters volume, assure good recovery of expensive samples and prevent evaporation of volatile samples or solvents. They can also be used in automated systems for automatic filling of the sample onto the refractometer prism.For convenient filling of the sample through a funnel, flow cells with a filling funnel are available. These are used for fast sample exchange in quality control applications.|$|R

50|$|As the {{temperature}} of the sample has a significant influence on the optical rotation of the sample, modern polarimeters have already included Peltier Elements to actively control {{the temperature}}. Special techniques like a temperature controlled sample tube reduce measuring errors and ease operation. Results can directly be transferred to computers or networks for automatic processing.Traditionally, accurate filling of the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> had to be checked outside the instrument, as an appropriate control from within the device was not possible. Nowadays a camera system allows accurate monitoring of the sample and filling conditions in the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> from inside the instrument.A telecentric camera gives a sharp image over the complete length of any <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> placed within modern instruments. The online monitoring of the filling process ensures that no bubbles or particles obstruct the measurement. A picture can be saved together with the recorded data. Any temperature gradients, inhomogeneous sample distributions or air bubbles can immediately be recognized before measurement, so that potential errors caused by bubbles or particles are no longer an issue.|$|E

30|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{expression}} of survivin protein in prostate samples with the IHC method. According to our results, {{the expression of}} survivin was negative in the nucleus of normal prostate <b>samples</b> <b>cells,</b> slightly positive in the BPH <b>sample</b> <b>cells,</b> and associated with Gleason staging in the adenocarcinoma group. There is a significant correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin staining (Zhang et al. 2009), which is comparable {{with the results of}} studies evaluating the cytoplasmic and nuclear survivin levels.|$|R
30|$|We {{propose a}} {{proof-of-concept}} implementation scheme of the reference structure for our SensFall system. The optical flow analysis is view-dependent; however, {{to detect the}} fall that may happen in all directions within the monitored region, our system should be view-independent. Thus, {{the design of the}} reference structure is based on two principles: (1) the volume of each <b>sampling</b> <b>cell</b> is to be as equal as possible; (2) the <b>sampling</b> <b>cells</b> are symmetric along the axis of the monitored region.|$|R
40|$|For mass limited samples, the {{residual}} sample volume outside the detection coil {{is an important}} concern, as is good base line resolution. Here, we present the construction and evaluation of magnetic susceptibility-matched plugs for microcoil NMR <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> which address these issues. Mixed-epoxy glue and ultem tube plugs that have susceptibility values close to those of perfluorocarbon FC- 43 (fluorinert) and copper were used in small volume (0. 5 to 2 μL) and larger volume (15 to 20 μL) thin glass capillary <b>sample</b> <b>cells.</b> Using these plugs, the sample volume efficiency (i. e. ratio of active volume to total sample volume in the microcoil NMR cell) was improved by 6 to 12 fold without sensitivity and resolution trade-offs. Comparison with laser etched or heat etched microcoil <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> is provided. The approaches described are potentially useful in metabolomics for biomarkers detection in mass limited biological samples...|$|R
50|$|Observations are plotted as {{the power}} needed to {{maintain}} the reference and the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> at an identical temperature against time. As a result, the experimental raw data consists {{of a series of}} spikes of heat flow (power), with every spike corresponding to one ligand injection. These heat flow spikes/pulses are integrated with respect to time, giving the total heat exchanged per injection. The pattern of these heat effects {{as a function of the}} molar ratio ligand/macromolecule can then be analysed to give the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction under study. It should be noted that degassing samples is often necessary in order to obtain good measurements as the presence of gas bubbles within the <b>sample</b> <b>cell</b> will lead to abnormal data plots in the recorded results. The entire experiment takes place under computer control.|$|E

Microfabrication techniques were used to fabricate low volume (50 micro-liter) <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> with silicon nitride membranes (sub micron in thickness) as x-ray windows. Scientifically, these studies focus on the interaction of negatively charged nucleic acid systems, RNA and DNA, with their surrounding (positively charged) ion atmospheres.

40|$|In {{the near}} future a new {{generation}} of CCD based galaxy surveys will enable high precision determination of the N-point correlation functions. The resulting information will help to resolve the ambiguities associated with two-point correlation functions thus constraining theories of structure formation, biasing, and Gaussianity of initial conditions independently of the value of Ω. As one the most successful methods to extract the amplitude of higher order correlations is based on measuring the distribution of counts in cells, this work presents an advanced way of measuring it with unprecedented accuracy. Szapudi and Colombi (1996, hereafter sc 96) identified the main sources of theoretical errors in extracting counts in cells from galaxy catalogs. One of these sources, termed as measurement error, {{stems from the fact that}} conventional methods use a finite number of <b>sampling</b> <b>cells</b> to estimate counts in cells. This effect can be circumvented by using an infinite number of cells. This paper presents an algorithm, which, in practice achieves this goal, i. e. it is equivalent to throwing an infinite number of <b>sampling</b> <b>cells</b> in finite time. The errors associated with <b>sampling</b> <b>cells</b> are completely eliminated by this procedure which will be essential for the accurate analysis of future surveys.

RSE has designed and tested equipment for improving remote in-cell sampling evolutions and reducing the time required for in-cell maintenance of existing equipment. The equipment within the present process tank sampling system has been in constant use since the facility start-up over 17 years ago. At present, the method for taking samples within the <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> produces excessive maintenance and downtime due to frequent failures relative to the sampling station equipment and manipulator. Location and orientation of many sampling stations within the <b>sample</b> <b>cells</b> is not conducive to manipulator operation. The overextension of manipulators required to perform many in-cell operations is a major cause of manipulator failures. To improve sampling operations and reduce downtime due to equipment maintenance, a Portable Sampling Station (PSS), wireless in-cell cameras, and new commercially available sampling technology has been designed, developed and/or adapted and tested. The uniqueness of the design(s), the results of the scoping tests, and the benefits relative to in-cell operation and reduction of waste are presented...|$|R
