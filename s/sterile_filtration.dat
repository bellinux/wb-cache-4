25|$|For a sweet wine, {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end {{to keep some}} of the sugar: this is the Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by <b>sterile</b> <b>filtration</b> (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.|$|E

Afterwards, the product is subjected to <b>sterile</b> <b>filtration</b> with prefilters of 0.2 pm and 0.45 pm and stored at 2-6 °C for more than 14 days and subsequently filtered (0.45 pm) and again titrated to pH 6.8.
