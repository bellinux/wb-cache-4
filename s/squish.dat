This insect had {{controlled}} The Divine Order and His Divine Shadow in order to eat all human inhabitants of the 20,000 planets. The insect then begins a metamorphosis into the Gigashadow. Gigashadow produces protoblood. With the help of Zev, Kai manages to fill up his store of protoblood. Kai places the cluster lizard <b>Squish</b> in the brain of the insect and thus is able to destroy it.|$|E
500|$|In a very {{positive}} review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau called A Thousand Leaves a mature and beautiful record, commenting: [...] "It's the music of a daydream nation old enough to treasure whatever time it finds on its hands. Where a decade ago [...] plunged and plodded, drunk on the forward notion of the van they were stuck in, here they wander at will, dazzled by sunshine, greenery, hoarfrost and machines that go <b>squish</b> in the night." [...] Although the album was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1998, Christgau, the poll's creator, placed it at No. 3 in his own [...] "Dean's List". He would later name {{it one of the}} 10 best records of the 1990s. Similarly, the editors of NME placed the album at No. 40 in their year-end top 50 list.|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} match, The Undertaker faced King Kong Bundy. Ted DiBiase was at ringside holding the urn that his wrestlers had stolen from The Undertaker. Larry Young, a legit American League umpire, was the special referee for the match. Young's storyline was as an out-of-work sports {{official}} {{because of the}} recently ended MLB Players Association strike and a lockout of the Major League Umpires Association umpires (which led to the eventual dissolution of the MLUA in 2000; [...] prior to the new union, umpires were split by league). The Undertaker took control {{at the beginning of}} the match by jumping off the top rope and hitting Bundy. He then performed several clothesline attacks on Bundy. Bundy responded with a clothesline that knocked The Undertaker out of the ring. Seeing DiBiase close, The Undertaker took back his urn. After The Undertaker returned to the ring, DiBiase called Kama, another Corporation member, to the ring. Kama stole the urn, and Bundy attacked The Undertaker in order to let Kama escape backstage. Bundy picked The Undertaker up and powerslammed him to the mat. He then performed an Avalanche splash to <b>squish</b> The Undertaker against the corner of the ring. The Undertaker was unharmed, however, and performed a powerslam and a clothesline on Bundy before pinning him to win the match.|$|E

2500|$|The Ogg {{project began}} with a simple audio {{compression}} package {{as part of a}} larger project in 1993. The software was originally named <b>Squish</b> but due to an existing trade mark it was renamed to OggSquish. This name was later used for the whole Ogg project. In 1997, the Xiphophorus OggSquish was described as [...] "an attempt both to create a flexible compressed audio format for modern audio applications as well as to provide the first audio format that is common on any and every modern computer platform". The OggSquish was in 2000 referred to as [...] "a group of several related multimedia and signal processing projects". In 2000, two projects were in active development for planned release: Ogg Vorbis format and libvorbis - the reference implementation of Vorbis. Research also included work on future video and lossless audio coding. In 2001, OggSquish was renamed to Ogg and it was described as [...] "the umbrella for a group of several related multimedia and signal processing projects". Ogg has come to stand for the file format, as part of the larger Xiph.org multimedia project. <b>Squish</b> became just the name of one of the Ogg codecs. In 2009, Ogg is described as [...] "a multimedia container format, and the native file and stream format for the Xiph.org multimedia codecs".|$|E
2500|$|Mechanics of {{the time}} were wary of the 410-cubic-inch Edsel [...] "E-475" [...] engine because its {{perfectly}} flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers. [...] The heads were set at an angle, with [...] "roof" [...] pistons forming both a <b>squish</b> zone {{on one side and}} a combustion chamber on the other. [...] Combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore. [...] This design was similar to Chevrolet's 348-cubic-inch [...] "W" [...] engine, which was also introduced in 1958. [...] While the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup, it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|Matson found {{valuable}} {{support in}} Vipassana meditation and extensive psychotherapy during these later decades. Both endeavors brought depth to poems about relationships. Equal in Desire (ManRoot, San Francisco, 1982 and 1983) also expanded the direct expression style into love poems, {{at the same}} time including awareness of gender and pro-feminist concerns. Hourglass (Seagull Press, Oakland, CA: 1987) is a series of eight-syllable line sonnets with rhyme and half-rhyme schemes, each with a creative process travelogue in prose. All the poems celebrate meditation and the relation of mind and body, along with struggles inherent in establishing a practice. These came as his meditation took hold and blossomed. After he began Crazy Child workshops, Matson discovered he was one of many who, on cracking {{open the door to the}} creative unconscious, was overwhelmed by floods of images. Chaotic first drafts were eventually shaped into <b>Squish</b> Boots (Broken Shadow Publications, Oakland, CA: 2002), concerned with childhood and core family issues. The process fit William Carlos Williams’ teaching, [...] "The beauty of writing is…the discovery of something you DON’T know, rather than the synthesis [...] repetition of the things you do already know. It's a jump forward into life, unknown future life…." [...] Emotional daring and openness helped this effort contribute to the voice of Chalcedony Songs (Minotaur Press, WA: 2007, 2009). These came as protest of one of Matson's female characters, in an unfinished story, who faked her orgasms. Chalcedony explores intricate layers of love and relationship in an open and easily involved manner. Matson stayed with the challenge. He wrote from a female perspective and let that voice expand. The style, added to the consciousness of <b>Squish</b> Boots, developed into Matson's most authentic voice to date. In the background resonates his learning from Ancient Greek Classics, William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, Ranier Maria Rilke, Pablo Neruda and Rumi, as well as contemporary poets. The voice aided in making a flexible structure for a series of poems, War Allies, inspired by difficult political times toward the end of the 20th Century, by 9/11, and by the encroachment of marketing into our private lives. The collection is scheduled for production by Torean Horn Press of Sonoma, California, in 2018. These poems, along with Chalcedony and current work, indicate that the primitive heart is at the basis of Matson's effort. His poems evolve in a roughly straight line from Beat lyrics to direct expression to a deeper level of language, involving the primitive heart and limbic system. The short essay Being Present: Paleo Poetry came about with help from Marie Martin, painter and childhood friend, and from John Paige (formerly Ceely) who has remained an insightful advisor since 1964. The essay, under consideration by Ambush of San Francisco, delineates the term [...] "Paleo Poetry" [...] precisely.|$|E
2500|$|Matson {{returned}} to New York City in 1987 and {{enrolled in the}} writing program at Columbia University. He worked with Robert Montgomery, Sharon Olds, Robert Hass, and Quincy Troupe. He earned his MFA in poetry from Columbia University School of the Arts in 1989 and his thesis {{became the basis for}} the poetry volume <b>Squish</b> Boots. He joined Alan Soldofsky and Susan Lurie in organizing readings at Cody's Books in Berkeley 1979 to 1981; joined workshops with Soldofsky, Josephine Miles, Robert Hass, Diana O'Hehir, and Marc Linenthal; attended Squaw Valley Writers’ Conference in 1973; and met with peers from Squaw Valley for several years. With Paul Geffner, Glenn Ingersoll, and Katherine Harer he ran the [...] "Poetry and Pizza" [...] reading series in San Francisco from 1998 to 2010. He began the reading series [...] "Poetry Unbound" [...] in 2013 with Richard Loranger and Harold Adler at Art House Gallery and Cultural Center in Berkeley, which continues today. In 1993 Matson established a small, eight-page quarterly journal, The Scribbler, edited by workshop participants, a role since taken over by Kayla Sussell. It continues today as one of the longest-enduring literary publications in the Bay Area and in the country. Blogs on Matson's website, matsonpoet.com, from 1998 to the present, prepare for Writing Your Way In, a sequel to Let the Crazy Child Write! Following the tragic attacks of 9/11, Matson wrote Towers Down, published as a chapbook along with Diane Di Prima's Notes Toward a Poem of Revolution (Eidolon Editions, San Francisco, 2002). Matson then edited, along with Allen Cohen, An Eye for an Eye Makes the Whole World Blind: Poets on 9/11, a selection of poems by over 100 American poets. [...] In 2009, Matson reissued his first volume of poetry as Mainline to the Heart and Other Poems, adding later poems to the collection, to further praise. [...] In 2013 he began a monthly column for Berkeley Times [...] "On Words" [...] about local venues from Hip-Hop and Spoken Word to postmodern poetry at UC Berkeley. Matson has affirmed throughout his career that how a poem comes across when read aloud provides clues on how it might best be revised and also is a measure of its success. Matson continues a 40-year tradition of frequent open readings in the Bay Area to experiment orally with poems in progress. [...] Poetry readings in Northern California, often with cellist Gael Alcock accompanying, include Bay Area events such as LitCrawl, Bay Area Generations, and Literary Death Match.|$|E
