25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|The Church of Ireland church, for the Anglican Parish of Raheny (now in Union {{with the}} Parish of Coolock), All Saints Church, {{which was built}} {{at the expense of}} Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun of the Guinness family, has <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> {{architectural}} features and is considered by many as being {{one of the most beautiful}} churches in Dublin. Before this church was built, Raheny Parish was served by the older church in the centre of Raheny, an earlier St. Assam's Church, dating back to 1712, and previously to 1609 and before. All Saints' has a Rectory in the grounds, as well as a community hall and a well-preserved gate lodge for the verger. In April 2010, it was announced that the church required extensive roof repairs and funds were raised to complete this.|$|E
25|$|Hoddle was {{determined}} to establish them as a top playing side, and during his first season he had <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> opportunities to succeed. Just days after his appointment in April 2001, his first match in charge was an F.A Cup semi-final against great rivals Arsenal which Spurs lost 2–1. The following year, Tottenham reached the League Cup final in February 2002; after winning 5–1 against Hoddle's former club Chelsea in the semi-final second leg, Spurs were the favourites but they lost 2–1 to Blackburn Rovers. The club's promising early season form (which saw Hoddle voted Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2001) dwindled away into mediocrity and they finished ninth in the Premiership, an improvement on the previous season's 11th place but considerably less than what most people had been expecting.|$|E

I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> and thoughtful black people.

25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

25|$|There were memorable {{encounters}} {{in the other}} European competitions. Borussia Dortmund's wins over holders West Ham United and Liverpool (final in Glasgow) in the 1965-66 European Cup Winners' Cup were memorable as were West Ham's win over TSV 1860 Munich at Wembley Stadium in {{the final of the}} same competition a year earlier, Everton F.C.|Everton's semifinal elimination of Bayern in 1985 (they {{went on to win the}} Cup Winners Cup and the league) and Gianluca Vialli's Chelsea's win over VfB Stuttgart in the final of 1998. The UEFA Cup, which became a strong competition in the late seventies, eighties and 90s, before being devalued in recent years, threw up <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> Anglo-German encounters, among the most memorable of which would be Ipswich Town's victories both home and away over 1. FC Köln in the semifinal of the 1981 competition which they won, Tottenham Hotspur's 5–1 aggregate mauling of Cologne in the 1974 competition and defeat of Bayern ten years later when winning the competition for the second time, debutant Watford's comeback against Kaiserslautern in the first round of the 1983–84 competition, Bayern's thrashing of Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest 7–2 on aggregate – after Forest had held Bayern to a 1–1 draw in the first leg in Munich – in 1996 en route to winning the cup, debutant Norwich City's win at the Olympia Stadion in Munich before ousting Bayern at Carrow Road in 1993 and Kaiserlautern's final minutes turn around against Tottenham Hotspur, managed by George Graham, in 1999. More recently, in 2009 Hamburg eliminated Manchester City who had earlier in the campaign beaten Schalke in Germany, a team they also beat 5–1 in the quarter finals of the 1969-70 European Cup Winners' Cup which City went on to win. Reinhard Libuda played for Schalke at that time (1969–70) while City had the famous trio of Francis Lee, Colin Bell and Mike Summerbee. The English hold the upperhand even in these competitions. There were however some narrow escapes. Liverpool won their 1973 UEFA Cup Final first leg at Anfield 3–0 only for Borussia Mönchengladbach to pull back to 3–2 on aggregate by half-time. The Reds hung on in the second half. In 1976, Queens Park Rangers, also making their debut, with Stan Bowles, Dave Thomas and Don Givens in their ranks, took a 3–0 lead to the Mungersdorfer Stadion in Cologne and increased their lead there only for the Germans to storm back with four goals and miss out on qualification on the away goals rule.|$|E
500|$|In early 1953 {{the film}} {{producer}} Alexander Korda read a proof copy of Live and Let Die, and informed its author, Ian Fleming, {{that he was}} excited by the book, but {{that it would not}} make a good basis for a film.

[...] Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars saying [...] "Depp is once again an unmitigated joy as Captain Sparrow, delivering another eye-darting, word-slurring turn with <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> slapstick flourishes. Indeed, Rossio and Elliot smartly exploit these in <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> action set-pieces." [...] "We don’t get the predictable ‘all friends together on the same quest’ structure, and there’s a surfeit of surprises, crosses and double-crosses and cheeky character beats which stay true to the original’s anti-heroic sense of fun. After all, Jack Sparrow is a pirate, a bad guy in a hero’s hat, a man driven by self-gain over concern for the greater good, who will run away from a fight and cheat his ‘friends’ without a second’s thought." ...|$|E

I never had to bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump, and I played for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when we first met him. It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through." ...|$|E

It also gave Springfield a sense of community that we sometimes don't get in recent seasons. Though the blatant use of guest stars has sweeps written all over it, the tennis stars were funny and able to make fun of themselves. Homer had <b>some</b> <b>wonderful</b> lines, too, such as, 'Take your hands off me. [...] They feel like salad tongs.' [...] Overall, a very funny episode."

The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that.
