To do so, we maintained microcosms of the shallow, sandy, subtidal envi-ronment for three months. Treatment microcosms received a single application of hydrocarbon-coated sand. As indicators of effect, we used copepod and nematode abundance and copepod species diversity, sex ratio, fecundity, age structure, and neutral-lipid content. A comparison of the hydrocarbon treatments showed no significant differences. The tests had adequate power to detect ecologically significant changes.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the studied HMs, Pb was the most {{dominant}} among all the metals studied in the collected water samples at different stations. The noticed low Pb concentration during the winter season compared to the summer season (Fig. 3 a) may result from the human activities during summer such as navigation, traffic, wastewater effluents, and urban runoff. The <b>spill</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and traffic exhaust can produce a considerable concentration of Pb (Elnazer et al. 2015). The Pb was detected as a pollutant for the River Nile from several decades, where 24  μg/l was recorded in 1987 (Lasheen 1987) and about 214.3  μg/l in 2009 (Toufeek 2011). Narrow ranges of Cd (bdl- 4 and 1 – 5  μg/l in winter and summer, respectively) were recorded in the studied samples with noticed higher concentrations during summer than winter (Table 2, Fig. 3 d). The higher concentration of Cd in the summer season might have resulted from the sediments of Lake Nasser, which contains about 0.175  μg/g of Cd (Goher et al. 2014). Also, navigation, agricultural runoff, and sewage effluents discharge to the water courses contributed to the Cd load in this season.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is first, to {{understand}} the fire hazard level, the radius of exposure (radiation and possibility to exposed flame and explosion) and the effect to the worker. And second, to understand the smoke pollutant dispersion and the effect to the public health and air quality. Method: Dow 2 ̆ 7 s Fire and Explosion Index to calculate fire hazard level; Point Source Radiation Model to calculate the radiant heat flux and the effect to the worker, Gausian Dispersion Model to calculate the smoke dispersion and the effect to the public health and air quality. Findings: The level of fire and explosion hazard on all grade A fuel tank at PT Pertamina TBBM Rewulu is Moderate. There are no significant health effect in that concentration but it could increase acidity in rain. Practical implications: Pertamina need to make 1) additional wall tires to separate the tank of one heap with another, it is to localize if there is a <b>spill</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> material; 2) create a water cooling system for the tank that is considered to be impacted by heat over the critical heat flux; 3) establish evacuation paths around easy-to-use tanks; 4) provide sufficient lighting around the location of the tank heap; 5) providing education and training to local residents in facing the impact of pollutant smoke exposure.

40|$|Repetitive small <b>spills</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> as diesel and {{lubricant}} oil during repair {{and maintenance of}} machinery as well as casual accidents within the mining industry constitute an unseen pollution of current environmental concern. The northern Chilean mining industry {{has not been an}} exception, where continuous fuel spills had occurred and had subsequently been adsorbed by desert soils and sawdust used as cheap sorbent materials to control environmental pollution. The resulting fuel-contaminated mixture is considered hazardous waste by the Chilean legislation, and thus contained in a hazardous waste landfill. Alternative options to landfilling and thus reduction of waste volume dumped in landfills consists of physical, chemical, and biological treatments or either combination, where bioremediation is a cost-effective alternative. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether bioremediation of fuel-contaminated wastes is feasible under the environmental conditions of the Atacama region (Chile). In this study we determined the feasibility of bioremediation by aerated in-vessel composting of an aged fuel-contaminated desert mining soil and sawdust in the Atacama region. We investigated the removal of total organic compounds (TOCs) and changes in the microbial diversity during composting conditions at laboratory scale under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity and ventilation.

40|$|Biological {{impacts of}} oil on sandy shore {{ecosystems}} remain incompletely understood, especially following smaller spills on subtropical beaches. Here we quantified changes to benthic assemblages on a sandy beach following the 270 -t <b>spill</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>fuel</b> {{oil from the}} Pacific Adventurer that occurred in March 2009 off Moreton Island in Eastern Australia. Assessments of ecological impacts are based on spatial contrasts between multiple reference and impact sites sampled 1 ෥ek and 3 ୯nths after the spill. Benthic invertebrate assemblages exposed to oil had significantly fewer individuals of fewer species 1 ෥ek after the spill, markedly changing their ecological structure. Biological differences consistent with oil-related mortality were significant on the lower shore and in the swash and remained so 3 ୯nths after the spill. This signals a lack of recovery of these communities in the short term, despite the fairly rapid removal of oil.

Compared to adjacent reference sites, the initial effects were very marked, especially on the upper shore. Oiling was heavier and more persistent on the upper shore than the mid-shore, and biological effects were more pronounced higher in the intertidal.

Oil spill cleanup response costs depend on a variety of factors, most notably, location, oil type, spill size, and cleanup strategy, making it difficult to develop a universal per-unit cost factor. This study analyzes marine oil spill cleanup costs on the basis of country, proximity to shoreline, spill size, oil type, degree of shoreline oiling, and cleanup methodology to determine how each of these factors impacts per-unit cleanup costs. The results show that oil spill responses in different countries and regions of the world vary considerably in their costs most likely due to differences in cultural values, socio-economic factors, and labor costs. Location, oil type, and spill size also factor heavily in determining cleanup costs. Nearshore spills and in-port spills are 4 - 5 times as expensive to clean up as offshore spills.

On {{the day after the}} incident concentrations in seawater reached a maximum of 540 µg 1 - 1 for n-alkanes and 222 µg 1 - 1 for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). However, concentrations returned to local background levels within one week. The fuel had an immediate toxic effect on intertidal limpets in the local station area, and 100 animals were found dead the day after the spill. Surviving animals had elevated concentrations of both n-alkanes and PAH for over a month after the spill, reaching a maximum of 9960 µg kg- 1 for n-alkanes and 90 µg kg- 1 for PAH 30 days after the spill occurred. This was the result of accumulation from a residue of the diesel being flushed by rainwater into the littoral zone. Seven months after the <b>spill</b> concentrations <b>of</b> both n-alkanes and PAH in limpets living close to the station were still an order of magnitude greater than those found in animals at an uncontaminated control site. This is because limpets living in the littoral zone were continually exposed to chronic but low-level hydrocarbon contamination from station activities.
