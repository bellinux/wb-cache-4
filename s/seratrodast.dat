50|$|<b>Seratrodast</b> (development name, AA-2414; marketed {{originally}} as Bronica) is a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor (TP receptor) antagonist {{used primarily}} {{in the treatment of}} asthma.

50|$|Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is {{generated}} in the lungs of people with asthma, and when it signals through the thromboxane receptor it causes bronchoconstriction, vasoconstriction, mucous secretion, and airway hyper-responsiveness. <b>Seratrodast</b> inhibits {{the activity of the}} thromboxane receptor, blocking the effects of TXA2.|$|E
5000|$|TP {{receptor}} antagonist <b>Seratrodast</b> is marketed in Japan and China for {{the treatment}} of asthma.

50|$|In a non-randomized, {{uncontrolled}} examination, 4 {{weeks of}} treatment with TP receptor antagonist AA-2414 significantly reduced bronchial reactivity in asthmatic patients. A follow-up double-blind placebo contolled study of asthmatic patients found that TP receptor antagonist <b>Seratrodast</b> significantly reduced airway flow (i.e. FEV1), diurnal variation in FEV1, airway responsiveness to contractive stimulation, airway inflammation, and airway content of pro-allergic mediators (i.e. RANTES, CCL3, CCL7, and eotaxin).|$|E
50|$|Several {{synthetic}} compounds bind to, {{but do not}} activate, TP {{and thereby}} inhibit its activation by activating ligands. These receptor antagonists include I-SAP, SQ-29548, S-145, domitroban, and vapiprost, {{all of which have}} affinities for binding TP similar to that of I-BOP. Other notable TP receptor antagonists are <b>Seratrodast</b> (AA-2414), Terutroban (S18886), PTA2, 13-APA, GR-32191, Sulotroban (BM-13177), SQ-29,548, SQ-28,668, ONO-3708, Bay U3405, EP-045, BMS-180,291, and S-145. Many of these TP receptor antagonists have been evaluated as potential therapeutic agents for asthma, thrombosis and hypertension. These evaluations indicate that TP receptor antagonists can be more effective than drugs which selectively block the production of TXA2 thromboxane synthase inhibitors. This seemingly paradoxical result may reflect the ability of PGH2, whose production is not blocked by the inhibitors, to substitute for TXA2 in activating TP. Novel TP receptor antagonists that also have activity in reducing TXA2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases have been discovered and are in development for testing in animal models.|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} the chemical mediators {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis, we studied {{the effects of the}} thromboxane (TX) A 2 receptor antagonist <b>seratrodast,</b> the peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist pranlukast and the antihistamine azelastine using a guinea pig model of allergic rhinitis. In guinea pigs actively sensitized by aerosol inhalation of antigen, antigen challenge into the nasal cavity increased both the nasal vascu-lar permeability and the intranasal pressure; it also induced swelling of the nasal mucosa, which was evaluated by mag-netic resonance imaging. Both <b>seratrodast</b> and azelastine sig-nificantly inhibited these antigen-induced responses when the drugs were administered p. o. 1 hr before antigen challenge.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundA {{dry powder}} inhaler of KP- 496 is {{currently}} in clinical development in Japan as an antiasthmatic agent. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the in vitro pharmacological profile of KP- 496. MethodsThe antagonistic activities of KP- 496 for leukotriene (Lt) D 4 and thromboxane (TX) A 2 receptors were examined using the LTD 4 - and U 46619 -induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig trachea. The selectivity of KP- 496 was examined using various agonist-induced contractions in the isolated guinea pig trachea. ResultsKP- 496 produced parallel rightward shifts of the LTD 4 and U 46619 concentration-response curves in a concentration-dependent manner. Schild plot analyses of the antagonistic activities of KP- 496 demonstrated that it is a competitive antagonist for LTD 4 and TXA 2 receptors with pA 2 values of 8. 64 and 8. 23, respectively. The LTD 4 antagonistic activity of KP- 496 was comparable to that of pranlukast and zafirlukast but was more potent than that of montelukast. The TXA 2 antagonistic activity of KP- 496 was comparable to that of <b>seratrodast.</b> KP- 496 and <b>seratrodast</b> also inhibited the prostaglandin (PG) D 2 - and PGF 2 α-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig trachea. KP- 496 had no effect on the histamine-, acetylcholine-, serotonin- and substance P-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig trachea. ConclusionsThese results indicate that KP- 496 is a selective dual antagonist for LTD 4 and TXA 2 receptors. LTD 4 and TXA 2 play important roles in asthma, and antagonists for these mediators are being used for the treatment of asthma. Thus, KP- 496 is expected to become a novel potent therapeutic agent for asthma...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThromboxane (TX) A 2 is an {{important}} bronchoconstrictor in the pathogenesis of asthma. <b>Seratrodast,</b> known as AA- 2414, is a new oral TXA 2 receptor antagonist which is currently prescribed in asthma therapy in Japan. However its clinical effects have been very different in individual subjects. To assess whether the clinical efficacy of TXA 2 antagonist is predictable {{on the basis of}} urinary arachidonic acid metabolites in urine of patients with asthma, an open and multicentre trial was conducted. Fifty adult asthmatic subjects (womenmen = 2822) were enrolled [resting mean forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) % was 82 %; range, 50 – 96 %]. Urinary levels of 11 -dehydro-TXB 2, leukotriene (LT) E 4, 2, 3 -dinor- 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α and creatinine in 3 -h urine collected in the morning at the start of <b>seratrodast</b> (80 mg day− 1, once a day at evening for 4 weeks) were measured. Responders were defined by improvements of asthma symptoms score and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Of the 50 subjects, 45 completed this study. Eighteen patients were responders and the other 27 were non-responders. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups in patients' characteristics, baseline lung functions, treatments and baseline urinary eisosanoids. The 11 -dehydro-TXB 2 /LTE 4 ratio of responders was significantly higher (P = 0 · 0091) than that of non-responders (mean ±se, 7 · 49 ± 0 · 71 vs. 5 · 09 ± 0 · 67). Eleven patients out of 18 responders agreed to continue this drug for 6 months, the 11 -dehydro-TXB 2 /LTE 4 ratio decreased during this period, but not significantly. Our data demonstrated that responders and non-responders to TXA 2 receptor antagonist existed in patients with asthma, and it suggests that the ratio of urinary eicosanoids might be a possible predictor of the effects of TXA 2 receptor antagonist...|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) {{method for}} related substances test of <b>seratrodast</b> in bulk drugs has been developed.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to characterize the antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of BM- 573 [N-tert-butyl-N'-[2 -(4 '-methylphenylamino) - 5 -nitrobenzenesulfonyl] urea], an original combined thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor in rats, and to determine its effects on mice bleeding time. Intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 5 mg/kg BM- 573 to rats inhibited U- 46619 (9, 11 -dideoxy- 9, 11 -methanoepoxy-prostaglandin F- 2) -induced washed platelet aggregation 30 min and 1, 2, and 4 h after drug administration with a maximum antiplatelet effect observed after 1 and 2 h. In a rat model of thrombosis induced by ferric chloride application on the abdominal aorta, BM- 573 significantly reduced the thrombus weight by 92. 53, 80. 20, 64. 75, and 18. 21 % at doses of 5, 2, 0. 5, and 0. 2 mg/kg, respectively. Time to occlusion of abdominal aorta in the BM- 573 -treated group (41. 50 +/- 5. 21 min) was significantly prolonged compared with the vehicle-treated rats (16. 16 +/- 0. 79 min). Like furegrelate, <b>seratrodast,</b> and acetylsalicylic acid, BM- 573 {{did not affect the}} tail bleeding time induced by tail transection in mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, BM- 573, a close derivative of the loop diuretic torasemide, failed to induce a significant increase in diuresis in rat and did not produce a decrease in blood glucose concentration as observed with the sulfonylurea glibenclamide. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the nitrobenzenic sulfonylurea BM- 573, an original combined thromboxane receptor antagonist and thromboxane synthase inhibitor, is a potent antithrombotic agent that does not affect bleeding time. Moreover, BM- 573 lost the diuretic property of torasemide and has no impact on glycemia. Peer reviewe...|$|E
