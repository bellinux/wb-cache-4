500|$|According to U.S. border surveillance, a white Mercury Grand Marquis with Mexican {{license plates}} 821-THE7 crossed at Brownsville border entry at 6:39p.m. CT on March 2. This car had crossed to Brownsville from Matamoros {{eighteen}} times between August 1992 and March 1993. When police {{went to the}} motel to check the register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in her notebook as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other evidence showed that several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other evidence showed that Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol. After Fischer was killed, Garza said that the gun was stolen from his house in San Antonio after <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> it. The weapon was never recovered.|$|E
500|$|Steinman rejoined Meat Loaf and {{the band}} for a live {{performance}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 {{with the intention of}} going through the songs for Bat II after the show. However, <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Then, Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record Renegade Angel. Steinman says [...] "he sounded literally like the little girl in The Exorcist... like a dragon trying to sing—it was a horrifying sound." [...] Steinman [...] "kept writing the music to Bat Out of Hell part 2... my sequel." [...] Not being able to [...] "bear for people not to hear those songs," [...] Steinman recorded the album, retitled Bad for Good, as a solo project, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some songs. Four songs from Bad for Good were included on Bat Out of Hell II. In 1989, Steinman formed all-female vocal group Pandora's Box. The album, Original Sin, was a commercial flop, but featured two songs which would also appear on Bat II. Meat Loaf says [...] "Jim put [...] "It Just Won't Quit" [...] on Original Sin without telling me. I could have strangled him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smit {{assessed}} {{the evidence and}} concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. Smit's theory was that <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> the Ramseys' home through the broken basement window. The intruder subdued JonBenét using a stun gun and took her down to the basement. JonBenét was killed and a ransom note was left. Smit's theory was supported by former FBI agent John E. Douglas, who had been hired by the Ramsey family. [...] Believing that the Ramseys were innocent, Smit resigned from the investigation on September 20, 1998, {{five days after the}} grand jury convened against the Ramseys. While no longer an official investigator on the case, Smit continued to work on it until his death in 2010.|$|E

50|$|The station {{began in}} 1922 with call letters KFAY.

50|$|KEIN {{was off the}} air {{for quite}} some time. According to {{property}} owner Creed Evans, <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> the transmitter building in January 2011, switched off breakers and killed the signal. Munson Radio president Steve Dow owns the license for KEIN, but he is locked out of the transmitter building because of a court order. That order, in favor of Evans who filed suit against Dow, was for failing to keep insurance and to maintain the facility. While Evans owns the facility, he lacks the expertise and the authority to turn the station back on. Records show the station is still silent, as of May 2013.|$|E

5000|$|A {{video clip}} for The Big Picture {{was shot by}} Marty Callner. The only band member to appear in it is Tori Amos. It {{is typical of the}} era, {{featuring}} a scantily clad Amos cavorting and wreaking havoc on a sound-stage made to resemble the back alleys of Los Angeles. It is notable for a narrative introductory bit during which Amos argues with a police officer about her illegally parked car. Amos' excuse is that <b>someone</b> <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> her car and stole her underwear: [...] "That's gross!" [...] The officer, undeterred, hands her the ticket and walks off with her garter belt hanging out of his back pocket.|$|E
