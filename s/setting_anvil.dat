25|$|Starting on January 5, {{blocking}} forces assumed {{their positions}} to {{south of the}} Iron Triangle along the Saigon River (the 25th Infantry Division and the 196th Infantry Brigade) and east of it (1st Infantry Division) to <b>set</b> up the <b>anvil.</b> The remaining units got into position to swing the hammer. On D-day, finally, elements of the 1st Infantry Division's 2d Brigade commenced the planned air assault on the village of Ben Suc.|$|R
50|$|The {{outside of}} the sphere is covered with pistons, which {{simultaneously}} impact a <b>set</b> of stationary <b>anvils</b> {{on the surface of}} the sphere to create acoustic pressure waves in the liquid metal. The pressure waves converge to become a spherical shockwave at the center of the sphere, causing the liquid metal vortex to collapse and compress the plasma. The compression increases the temperature of the plasma to the point where the deuterium and tritium nuclei fuse, releasing energy in the form of fast neutrons.|$|R

40|$|In {{the work}} {{the results of}} the {{physical}} modeling of plate rolling process of HSLA steel were presented. The simula-tions were carried out using the Gleeble 3800 device and the <b>anvils</b> <b>set</b> for plane strain compression study. The aim of the simulation were a determination of a infl uence of changes in chemical composition of steel on obtained fi nal structure and tensile strength of specimens after controlled deformation and accelerated cooling to room tempera-ture. During investigation three grades of steels with a little diff erent chemical composition were examined. Key words: rolling, plates, thermo-mechanical treatment, HSLA steel...|$|R
40|$|We {{recorded}} {{the damage that}} wild bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) caused to a sandstone anvil during pounding stone tool use, in an experimental <b>setting.</b> The <b>anvil</b> was undamaged when set up at the Fazenda Boa Vista (FBV) field laboratory in Piauı́, Brazil, and subsequently the monkeys indirectly created a series of pits and destroyed the anvil surface by cracking palm nuts on it. We measured the size and rate of pit formation, and recorded when adult and immature monkeys removed loose material from the anvil surface. We found that new pits were formed with approximately every 10 nuts cracked, (corresponding {{to an average of}} 38 strikes with a stone tool), and that adult males were the primary initiators of new pit positions on the anvil. Whole nuts were preferentially placed within pits for cracking, and partially-broken nuts outside the established pits. Visible anvil damage was rapid, occurring within a day of the anvil’s introduction to the field laboratory. Destruction of the anvil through use has continued for three years since the experiment, resulting in both a pitted surface and a surrounding archaeological debris field that replicate features seen at natural FBV anvils...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{resistivity}} measurements under pressures at ambient and low temperatures {{have been carried}} out on bulk, melt quenched $Cu_xGe_{ 15 }Te_{ 85 -x}$ glasses (2 <x< 10) in an opposed <b>anvil</b> <b>set</b> up. The resistivities of these samples are found to decrease continuously with pressure, changing by about six orders of magnitude around 4 GPa pressure The variation of conductivity activation energy with pressure also confirms the continuous metallisation of Cu-Ge-Te samples. The composition dependence of properties such as resistivity at ambient conditions, the pressure derivative of resistance (dp/dp), activation energy for electrical conduction at different pressures, etc., is found to exhibit anomalies at the composition 5 at% Cu. These results are explained {{on the basis of the}} rigidity percolation in chalcogenide network glasses...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the occurrence and morphology of frozen drop aggregates in thunderstorm anvils from the US Midwest and describes the environmental conditions {{where they are}} found. In situ airborne data collected in anvils using several particle imaging and sizing probes and bulk total water instrumentation during the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Experiment are examined {{for the presence of}} frozen drop aggregates. These types of particles, especially chains of frozen drops, have been only rarely reported before and are hypothesized to aggregate due to electrical forces in the clouds. They were identified in nine of the anvil cases examined to-date, suggesting that they are common features in Midwestern anvils. High concentrations of individual frozen droplets occurred on the tops and edges of one particular <b>set</b> of <b>anvils,</b> while regions closer to the center and bottom of the anvils exhibited fewer frozen drops and more frozen drop aggregates. Bulk ice water content measurements across these anvils could only be explained by contributions from both small particles (frozen droplets) and large particles (large aggregates of frozen droplets). Dual Doppler radar analysis confirmed the presence of deep and strong (> 15 m s − 1) updrafts in the parent cloud of one of the anvils. These features contrast with previous anvil measurements in tropical/maritime anvils that evidently do not exhibit the same frequency of frozen drop aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Compression {{testing of}} tri-isotropic (TRISO) carbon/silicon carbide-coated fuel {{particles}} between anvil materials {{with a wide}} range of hardnesses was investigated. During compression testing, the particle produces a hardness impression before it fractures. For subsequent measurements, the same position can therefore not be used. A special testing machine was designed to use the same <b>set</b> of <b>anvils</b> for testing more than one specimen. By each time positioning a particle at a slightly different position between the anvils, a large number of measurements could be made. The load required for fracture is almost independent of anvil hardness for very hard or very soft anvils. Finite element stress analysis showed that when the anvil hardness is very high, fracture occurs because of high local contact bending stresses at the point of contact. In the case of very soft anvils, a tensile stress develops along a latitudinal direction along the perimeter of the particle over a large volume in between the contact zones with the anvils. The particle then fractures by the development of cracks at right angles to the direction of the tensile stress. From the fracture load, the ability of the particle to withstand internal pressure can be assessed. The advantages of using compression testing of full particles between soft anvils without prior preparation to complement previous test methods are highlighted. The authors wish to express their thanks to the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (Propriety) Limited, South Africa for its financial support and for the experimental batches of TRISO particles received...|$|R

When I fust comed ashore an' <b>set</b> up my <b>anvil</b> an' bellows I {{went to work}} with a will, enjyin' the fun o' the thing an' the novelty of the sitivation; an' as we'd lots of iron of all kinds I knocked off nails an' hinges an' all sorts o' things for anybody as wanted 'em.

5000|$|Utility knives {{with stone}} or flint blades were {{undoubtedly}} used in personal combat since Paleolithic times.One {{of the earliest}} metal-blade fighting knives was the dagger. The first early Bronze Age daggers featured Beaker copper blades, probably done with stone tools. In 1984, a Beaker period (ca. 2500 - 2000 BC) copper dagger blade was recovered from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland that had a remarkably modern appearance. [...] The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was 171 mm (6.75 inches) long, 42.5 mm (1.65 inches) wide, and 2mm (0.078 inches) in maximum thickness, with bevelled edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. [...] Analysis of the copper used in the dagger's construction revealed it to be of a type characteristic of the copper that was widely used in Ireland before the introduction of bronze tools and weapons. [...] By around 2000 BC daggers were being cast of bronze, with blades formed by drawing and hammering the metal on bronze <b>anvils</b> <b>set</b> in guides.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Single {{crystals}} of the lamellar compound, ZrSe 3 wer {{grown by}} chemical vapour transport tech-nique using iodine as a transporting agent. The grown crystals were characterized {{with the help}} of energy dispersive analysis by X-ray (EDAX), which gave confirmation about the stoichiometry. The optical band gap measurement of as grown crystals was carried out {{with the help of}} optical absorption spectra in the range 700 – 1450 nm. The indirect as well as direct band gap of ZrSe 3 we e found to be 1 × 1 eV and 1 × 47 eV, respec-tively. The resistivity of the as grown crystals was measured using van der Pauw method. The Hall paramet rs of the grown crystals were determined at room temperature from Hall effect measurements. Electrical resi-tivity measurements were performed on this crystal in the temperature range 303 – 423 K. The crystals were found to exhibit semiconducting nature in this range. The activation energy and anisotropy measurements were carried out for this crystal. Pressure dependence of electrical resistance was studied using Bridgman opposed <b>anvils</b> <b>set</b> up up to 8 GPa. The semiconducting nature of ZrSe 3 single crystal was inferred from the graph of resistance vs pressure. The results obtained are discussed in detail...|$|R
5000|$|That evening, crowds fill in to Yank'em Stadium (a {{parody of}} Yankee Stadium) for the fight. In Popeye's {{dressing}} room, Olive pleads with Popeye {{not to fight}} Bluto. When Popeye does not respond, Olive leaves and tells Popeye that she will never see him again. Both Popeye and Bluto enter the ring, and the boxing match begins when the time clock punches Wimpy the timekeeper and Wimpy's head hits the bell. Popeye gets pounded mercilessly as Olive listens to the fight on a radio at her home. After crying into a pot on her stove, Olive grabs a can of spinach and runs to the stadium. Olive reaches Popeye and tells him, [...] "Fight, ya palooka, fight!" [...] Popeye eats the spinach and begins to beat up Bluto. Popeye pounds Bluto in the head, as Popeye's hands turn into hammers and Bluto's head turns into an <b>anvil</b> <b>set</b> {{to the tune of}} the [...] "Anvil Chorus". Popeye continues his assault until he hits Bluto so hard that he flies out of the ring and breaks through numerous wood pillars before hitting a wall and flying back into the ring. Bluto lands on Popeye and the referee declares Bluto the winner. Popeye responds [...] "Oh, yeah?" [...] and punches Bluto in the stomach and hits the referee, knocking both men out. Popeye stands on the fallen Bluto and sings, [...] "I'm Popeye the Sailor Man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have not}} been out of doors these two months, but people call me 'looking well,' and a newly married niece of Miss Bayley's, the {{accomplished}} Miss Thomson, who has become the wife of Dr. Emil Braun (the learned German secretary of the Archaeological Society), and just passed through Florence {{on her way to}} Rome, where they are to reside, declared that the change she saw in me was miraculous--'wonderful indeed.' I took her to look at Wiedeman in his cradle, fast asleep, and she won my heart (over again, for always she was a favorite of mine) by exclaiming at his prettiness. Charmed, too, we both were with Dr. Braun--I mean Robert and I were charmed. He has a mixture of fervour and simplicity which is still more delightfully picturesque in his foreign English. Oh, he speaks English perfectly, only with an obvious accent enough. I am sure we should be cordial friends, if the lines had fallen to us in the same pleasant places; but he is fixed at Rome, and we are half afraid of the enervating effects of the Roman climate on the constitutions of children. Tell me, do you hear often from Mr. Chorley? It quite pains us to observe from his manner of writing the great depression of his spirits. His mother was ill in the summer, but plainly the sadness does not arise entirely or chiefly from this cause. He seems to me over-worked, taxed in the spirit. I advise nobody to give up work; but that 'Athenaeum' labour is a sort of treadmill discipline {{in which there is no}} progress, nor triumph, and I do wish he would give that up and come out to us with a new <b>set</b> of <b>anvils</b> and hammers. Only, of course, he couldn't do it, even if he would, while there is illness in his family. May there be a whole sun of success shining on the new play! Robert is engaged on a poem,[194] and I am busy with my edition. So much to correct, I find, and many poems to add. Plainly 'Jane Eyre' was by a woman. It used to astound me when sensible people said otherwise. Write to me, will you? I long to hear again. Tell me everything of yourself; accept my husband's true regards, and think of me as your ...|$|R
