25|$|I-40 remains {{relatively}} <b>steady</b> <b>as</b> {{it continues}} across the Cumberland Plateau and {{passes through the}} northern part of Crossville. East of Crossville, the Crab Orchard Mountains (the southern fringe of the Cumberland Mountains) come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the Interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to rockslides. At mile 340, the Interstate enters the Eastern Time Zone, and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the Tennessee Valley. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's Walden Ridge escarpment for several miles— with dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south— before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between Harriman and Rockwood.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{towards the}} west-northwest and already near the United States Gulf Coast, the NHC's {{official}} forecast {{at the time}} of Bill's formation indicated that the storm would not have much time to strengthen over water. However, meteorologists Jeff Masters and Bob Henson of Weather Underground noted the possibility of Bill strengthening over land via the brown ocean effect due to floods in the previous month that helped saturate soils in Texas and Oklahoma. The cyclone's organization remained <b>steady</b> <b>as</b> the storm approached the coast, with most of the convection taking place around the storm's eastern half, with rainbands primarily occupying the eastern and southern portions of Bill's circulation. At 15:00UTC on June16, Bill reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg) as the storm was located 15mi (20km) south of Port O'Connor, Texas. At peak intensity, Bill made landfall on Matagorda Island at 16:45UTC and began moving into inland Texas. At 09:00UTC on June17, Bill was downgraded to tropical depression intensity, though it maintained an organized structure. The next day, Bill had rapidly deteriorated as it moved northeastward. However, the system's strength slowly weakened. Operationally, it was announced that Bill stayed tropical throughout most of its lifetime, being declared a remnant low on June 20 by the WPC, however the NHC's post storm analysis revealed that Bill had degraded into a remnant low on June 18, while the storm was situated over Tulsa, Oklahoma. Bill's remnant low continued to move eastward for several more days, before being absorbed by another extratropical system on June 23.|$|E

500|$|In {{the warm}} season, lee troughs, breezes, outflow {{boundaries}} and occlusions {{can lead to}} convection if enough moisture is available. Orographic precipitation is precipitation created through the lifting action of air moving over terrain such as mountains and hills, which is most common behind cold fronts that move into mountainous areas. It may sometimes occur in advance of warm fronts moving northward {{to the east of}} mountainous terrain. However, precipitation along warm fronts is relatively <b>steady,</b> <b>as</b> in rain or drizzle. [...] Fog, sometimes extensive and dense, often occurs in pre-warm-frontal areas. [...] Although, not all fronts produce precipitation or even clouds because moisture must be present in the air mass which is being lifted.|$|E
500|$|Although {{for a time}} Craig {{appeared}} to play adequately at third base, his throwing motion raised questions whether he could play there in the Major Leagues as he was promoted through the minor leagues. [...] With David Freese one step further up the Cardinals depth chart and having the better-regarded glove, Craig was shifted more to the outfield in 2009. [...] He further increased his versatility by playing first base. [...] Despite the defensive transitions, his hitting remained <b>steady</b> <b>as</b> he posted a [...]921 on-base plus slugging percentage with the AAA Memphis Redbirds. [...] His consistent hitting and increased positional coverage prompted Craig to be named Cardinals system Player of the Year. [...] The club added him to their 40-man roster that November.|$|E
500|$|In February 1804 Reginald senior died, {{leaving the}} living {{of the parish}} of St Luke, Hodnet vacant; this may have {{prompted}} Heber's own decision to seek ordination, though he delayed this for some years. In his degree examinations he acquitted himself honourably rather than brilliantly; Montefiore quotes a contemporary's view that Heber's main contribution to university life was in fields outside formal academic success, particularly as a thinker, a poet and an orator: [...] "Reginald Heber was a star whose lustre was as <b>steady</b> <b>as</b> it was clear". He took his bachelor's degree {{in the summer of}} 1804, and was elected to a fellowship of All Souls College, Oxford. He also won the University's Bachelor's Prize for an English prose essay.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} often {{did not play}} their {{standard}} instruments when working on the songs for Rock <b>Steady.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the album's instrumentation contains less guitar and bass guitar than the band's previous work. Many of the album's sounds come from electronic keyboard effects, which bassist Tony Kanal called [...] "Devo-y bleeps and Star Wars noises". Dumont commented {{that many of the}} effects came from being unfamiliar with the equipment and [...] "just twiddling knobs". Dumont created an effect similar to that of an echo chamber by placing a microphone inside a metal garbage can with the can's open end facing a drum kit. Richard B. Simon of MTV News asserted that the sound of Rock Steady was part of the decade nostalgia of the 1980s retro movement.|$|E
500|$|Few {{streams in}} Arizona have a flow as large and <b>steady</b> <b>as</b> Fossil Creek's. Although remote, the stream {{was seen in}} the early 20thcentury as a good place to produce {{electricity}} for the copper mines of Jerome and the gold and silver mines of the Bradshaw Mountains. In 1908, construction began on a hydropower plant on the Verde River at Childs under the authority of the Arizona Power Company, later part of the Arizona Public Service Company (APS). The project included creating a diversion dam, [...] high, across the creek. About [...] of concrete flumes carried water from the dam to the Childs plant. An artificial reservoir, Stehr Lake, held enough water to keep the plant operating at normal capacity for up to 3.5 days when the flume system was closed for maintenance. In 1916, the company constructed a second plant, the Irving Power Plant, along Fossil Creek.|$|E

500|$|Deep {{convection}} {{around the}} eyewall began to diminish, and Fausto then weakened to a Category 3 hurricane. After quickly dropping in strength to a Category2 hurricane, Fausto weakened at {{nearly the same}} rate as it had intensified. Although Fausto held <b>steady</b> <b>as</b> a Category2 hurricane for 18 hours, it then began to rapidly weaken back into a Category 1 hurricane, then a tropical storm six hours later early on August26. Upon weakening into a tropical storm, Forecaster Miles Lawrence at NHC noted [...] "...there is no longer any deep convection associated with its circulation...", although Fausto still remained a tropical cyclone. On August27, the NHC issued its final advisory on Fausto, although not for dissipation, but rather that the storm crossed 140˚W, and had entered the area of responsibility for the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). While post-storm analysis from the CPHC indicated that Fausto was a tropical storm upon emerging into the CPHC's area of responsibility (AOR), the storm was operationally classified as a tropical depression upon entering the AOR. With no deep convection remaining, the CPHC downgraded Fausto into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC August28. Fausto degenerated into a remnant low while located over 800mi (1287km) north of Hilo, Hawaii on August28 at 1200 UTC.|$|E
