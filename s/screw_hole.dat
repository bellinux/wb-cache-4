30|$|As {{the plate}} is pre-contoured, {{it does not}} seat equally well in all {{patients}} and bending the plate can potentially damage the locking <b>hole</b> <b>screw</b> threads and can also change the screw direction to a certain extent. Improperly locked screws can compromise {{the stability of the}} construct, and the change in screw direction can pose a problem in the distal screws which are directed into the capitellum and trochlea. To circumvent this problem, plate bending should be done after blocking the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> with locking sleeves and bending the plate only in between the <b>screw</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringScrews {{are common}} {{orthopaedic}} hardware used {{to secure a}} fractured bone. After the bone has healed, the screws may be removed, and the vacant <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> introduce a potential site for re-fracture, which is a known complication. The current study simulated a laboratory torsional fracture test of a composite analogue tibia with vacant <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> by using a finite element (FE) model, and {{the results from the}} simulation were compared to those obtained experimentally. Variations of the FE model were also analyzed to investigate the effects of failure model, <b>screw</b> <b>holes,</b> element size, rotation direction, and simplification of the model's geometry. This FE model was set up the same as the experimental torsion test, with a section from the distal portion of the tibia. The proximal end of the section was subjected to an axial load and rotated, while the distal end was fixed. The FE model contained 102, 126 first order tetrahedral elements and 24, 817 nodes, and it utilized an isotropic linear elastic material law with material properties obtained from the composite analogue manufacturer. Comparisons between the FE model variations considered the fracture torque, fracture angle, torsional stiffness, principal stress contour, and maximum shear stress contour. The results predicted a fracture torque within the standard deviation of the experimental data, and the percent of strength reduction caused by the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> agreed with experimental data...|$|R

An Anykey that has been serviced undoubtedly has some of its date and model information destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|Shake {{plans to}} work out on his new {{exercise}} machine, the [...] "Insanoflex". Frylock notices that the machine isn't assembled properly and the instructions are nowhere to be found. He searches online for them and instead finds a website written in a rare dialect, with a message in English warning not to assemble the machine ever. The site however lists a phone number which Frylock calls. It is revealed to be the number of Emory and Oglethorpe, the Plutonians. Before they even bother to answer the phone, they discover the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future on board with them. The Cybernetic Ghost explains to the two aliens {{the story of the}} Insanoflex: a machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth leading to massive inbreeding and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost traveled to the past and stolen a single screw that holds the machine together. The Plutonians point out to him that to get it assembled, someone could just buy another screw or shove a pencil in the screw hole.Back on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the Insanoflex, with a pencil in the <b>screw</b> <b>hole,</b> somehow having obtained instructions. He discovers a missing M-shaped circuit board on the back panel. The trio visit Carl, from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After he refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. Dr. Weird, whose abandoned asylum has been purchased and is being turned into condominiums around them, is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine upon returning home. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test out the machine. The Insanoflex straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays dance/techno music and heads for downtown Philadelphia, all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic spherical eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine.|$|E
50|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a motor mount {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128.

40|$|A novel {{surgical}} treatment sequence for secondary orbitozygomatic complex (OZC) reconstruction is described. Orbital reconstruction is performed before OZC repositioning. A surgical plan is made: the affected OZC is virtually osteotomized and aligned with a mirrored {{model of the}} unaffected OZC. A patient-specific implant (PSI) is designed for orbital reconstruction. Screw holes from the primary reconstruction are used for fixation. Primary <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions at the repositioned OZC are embedded in the design, to guide OZC repositioning. A second patient-specific design is made for guidance at the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. The workflow was utilized in two patients. The PSI was positioned using navigation feedback. After repositioning of the zygomatic complex, the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions at the infraorbital rim and zygomaticomaxillary buttress seemed to align perfectly: no <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> adjustments were necessary. Minor deviations were seen between planned and acquired PSI position; the mean errors between planned and acquired OZC position were 1. 5 and 1. 2 mm. Orbital reconstruction with a PSI before OZC repositioning ensures true-to-original orbital reconstruction. The use of old <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions enables the PSI {{to be used as}} a static guide for ON repositioning. The combination of static and dynamic guidance increases predictability in secondary OZC reconstruction.

40|$|Spinal fusion cages {{are used}} to aid spinal fusion where the joint between the {{vertebrae}} is fused by bone graft. The design and material of these cages are of great importance to the fusion process. Methods such as screw fixation are sometimes used to secure these cages in vivo. However, access to the cage <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> is partially obscured by the vertebral bodies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of side-holes {{on the design of}} a cage, assess the feasibility of a bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cage material and develop an instrument to aid screw access to the cage <b>screw</b> <b>holes.</b> Computer models of cages with between 0 and 10 side-holes were produced to model compression between adjacent vertebrae. The bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cage material was analysed using a range of Young’s modulus values for the composite. The results suggested that the number of side-holes had a negligible effect on the stress distribution within the cage and the bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cervical cage material is unlikely to fail in static compression. A cutter instrument was developed in compliance with regulatory standards. It neatly removed the targeted vertebral edge adjacent to the cage <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> allowing <b>screw</b> insertion...|$|R

40|$|There have been, in some rare cases, {{difficulties}} with clamping of inserts with U-holes in their tool holder. According to the complaints, the inserts {{could not be}} properly clamped or could fracture when clamped. A study has shown that variations in clamping behaviour are mainly depending by {{the position of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in the tool holder and the centering of the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in the insert. The focus of this project has been the centering of <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in insert. It has been shown that the screw holes are not always enough centered in the insert. The problem may occur after a certain step in the production, i. e. peripheral grinding. Today, the centering can be measured by a certain measurement jig. The measurement jig has a very good Gauge R and R value but is not easy to use, especially {{if it is to be}} reinstated into the production. The aim of this thesis has been to use SmartScope for developing a new method for measuring the centering of <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in insert. The goal with the new method was to be able to measure faster and to be easier to use than the existing one. The project was started with exercises and exploration of some of the functions of SmartScope and its software Measuremind 3 D. Parallel with this, a study was made of the existing documentation for a better understanding of the problem. A method which measures how well the screw holes are centered in their inserts has been developed. The method consists of a number of measuring tools which are joined into a measurement sequence. Measurements of single inserts are fully automated. Provided that a system which picks and puts the inserts in specific locations can be implemented, a series of inserts can be measured fully automated. This method is faster and especially more automated than the current measurement jig. Measurements have shown that the accuracy of the method is well within the tolerance and that it has a good repeatability...|$|E

30|$|For {{patients}} who are candidates for a concurrent ACL reconstruction, it must be ensured that the HTO hardware does {{not interfere with the}} tibial tunnel or fixation. The procedure should begin with arthroscopic assessment and treatment of concurrent meniscal and articular cartilage injuries. The osteotomy is then completed with slope either maintained or flattened at the discretion of the surgeon. Proximal screw fixation of the plate will have to be manipulated to avoid interference with the tibial tunnel. This can be accomplished by placing the plate as posterior as possible, with or without leaving the most anterior <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> of the proximal aspect of the plate empty or short. If a <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> is left empty, the surgeon must ensure the plating system allows for adequate fixation in the proximal fragment. Once the plate is secured to the bone, the ACL reconstruction is resumed including graft preparation and the drilling of both the femoral and tibial tunnels. The tunnel should exit the anterior tibial cortex at the proximal aspect of the osteotomy site. Tibial fixation of the ligament is at the surgeon’s discretion.|$|E
40|$|Background: Microbial {{penetration}} {{inside the}} implant’s internal hole creates a bacterial reservoir that is related with {{an area of}} inflamed connective tissue opposite the fixture-abutment junction and this can affect with {{the health of the}} peri-implant tissue. Chlorhexidine (CHX) has been used to prevent internal implant contamination as a 0. 2 % solution, a varnish or gel. Aim: To evaluate the aerobic/anaerobic bacterial count-reduction potential of 2 % CHX gel placed, at the time of surgery, in the implant <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> over a period of minimum 90 d, and to monitor the periodontal health status of all patients, throughout the study. Material and methods: Ten partially edentulous patients received 30 DI and these implants were randomly allocated in to: Group I (test) 15 implants applied by flap or flapless surgery with 2 % CHX gel application. Group II (control) 15 implants applied by flap or flapless surgery without CHX gel application. All patients were examined clinically to determine their oral health status by examination of their plaque index, PLI, Gingival index GI, Bleeding on probing, BOP, and probing pocket depth, PPD, every two weeks throughout the study. Three months later, the plaque sample was collected from the internal hole of fixture and was sent for bacteriological examination. Results: The present study shows highly significant reduction of aerobic count of bacteria from 52. 1 % to 100 %. Also, anaerobic bacterial count was reduced from 64. 6 % to 100 % for group that received 2 % CHX gel in <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> of implants at time of surgery. When compared, the count of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (CFU) between test and control group, a significant reduction was found. Conclusion: The use of 2 % CHX gel at the time of placement can significantly reduce bacterial counts in the implant <b>screw</b> <b>hole,</b> and this effect can be maintained for 90 d or longer...|$|E
