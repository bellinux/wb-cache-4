The precast concrete <b>sunblades</b> and extended eaves reduce solar access that penetrates through the window. Rainwater collected from the roof will be recycled for toilet flushing and irrigation.|$|R

Contrary to most Chinese railway stations, the new look of South Station has a very clean, airport-like look and feel. The station itself is elevated 47 meters above ground and has a diameter of some 270 meters. It is made out of polycarbonate and aluminium <b>sunblades,</b> and supported by 18 branch-shaped beams resting on 3 columns each. The steel structure weight is 6000 T, for 56 000 square meters, and a 150 m maximum span. The steel structure was built by Shanghai Jiangnan shipyard and erected by SMCC.|$|R
40|$|For {{the limits}} of {{computer}} EMS memory and CPU speed,people ofen show or operate {{a large amount of}} image data such as remote sensing in computer by incising the data bulk when reading them from hard disk,It can quicken the speed when opening a file in seeing, but when we zoom or rotate the image showing on screen,it look so slowly for not all data is in memory and data exchanging exist between hard dist and memory. In the past several years, performance of computer hardware has being improved higher and higher,computer physics and virtual memory,for SUN Blade 2000 as examble,reach to 8 GB maximum, so it is not difficult reading all data from a about 1. 5 G amounts of data file. But there would have many disadvantages if such large data in memory is not dealt with properly. This article describe some advantages of reading all data into memory when opening the remote sensing image file, and some ways to show, to zoom and to operate the undivided data without taking up additional memory of the computer.
