5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who <b>specialize</b> <b>in</b> meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves.

Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky.

5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend to <b>specialize</b> <b>in</b> either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, {{due to a}} less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
