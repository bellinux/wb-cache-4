50|$|The typical early horse-drawn {{hay rake}} was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved steel or iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the rake with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This rake gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the rake, turn around and drop the teeth to rake {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a <b>sweep</b> <b>rake,</b> which could also be a horse-drawn or tractor-mounted implement, could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|E
40|$|Information on {{effects of}} tillage sweep {{geometry}} and operation on soil conditions, including soil surface elevation, {{is needed for}} effective design, selection, and use of sweeps for row crop cultivation and ridge construction. The effects of <b>sweep</b> <b>rake</b> angle and of operation speed and depth on changes in soil microtopography were determined. Changes in microtopography due to observed soil aggregate movement were also found. A factorial arrangement of pairs of sweeps with three geometries operated at three speeds (5, 7, and 9 km/h) and at two depths (50 and 100 mm) were used to form ridges in a field experiment...|$|E
40|$|The ridging {{effect of}} {{cultivator}} sweeps modifies soil microtopography affecting root environment and soil erosion potential. The effects of <b>sweep</b> <b>rake</b> angle (13. 5 °, 16 ° and 44 °), speed (5, 7, and 9 km/hr), and depth (50 and 100 mm) on lateral soil movement into a ridge, ridge height {{and changes in}} surface elevation were measured. Dependent variables soil shift, ridge height and change in surface height were defined as measures {{of the change in}} soil microtopography;Techniques were developed and used to measure soil aggregate movement during sweep tillage. A comparison was made of actual soil flow to that predicted by the Goryachkin trihedral wedge model;Soil shift and ridge height were affected ([alpha] =. 01) by both speed and tool geometry. Higher speeds moved more soil into the ridges. A modified sweep with rake angle of 44 ° produced greater ([alpha] =. 01) soil shift and higher ridges than the commercial sweeps with rake angles of 13. 5 ° and 16 °. Comparing commercial sweeps, the 16 ° sweep produced a higher ridge ([alpha] =. 05) and greater soil shift ([alpha] =. 10) than did the 13. 5 ° sweep;Change in surface height was significantly affected by tool depth ([alpha] =. 01) and speed ([alpha] =. 05) but not by tool geometry. Deeper operating depth created a higher soil surface. The relationship of change in surface height to speed was quadratic ([alpha] =. 01);The lateral movement of soil away from the tool and into the ridge was more closely related to the vertical velocity component of soil on the tool than the lateral component. Surface soil velocities were generally unrelated to those on the tool surface. Speed and the tangent of tool rake angle had some influence on the change in microtopography;Observed soil flow paths varied with rake angle, but not with speed or depth, in agreement with the Goryachkin model. As rake angle increased the ratio of vertical to lateral soil movement increased. Predicted values were outside of a 99 % confidence interval of observed mean values. Soil flow on the sweep did not vary appreciably (less than 5 °) from a vertical plane parallel to the travel direction...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} measure surface soil velocity and to determine the relation between soil aggregate velocities at the tool surface and at the soil surface. A technique incorporating use of both a video camcorder and wood blocks was developed to measure surface soil velocity. Soil velocity direction at the tool surface was measured from scratch marks on the tool. Velocity measurements were made for three <b>sweeps</b> with different <b>rake</b> angles operated at three speeds and two depths. Surface soil moved in either of two modes: V-flow (upward and laterally {{in the shape of}} one leg of the letter V) or snowplow (initially moving upward and subsequently being buried in a wave of soil). Surface soil velocities were uncorrelated with velocities on the tool surface, indicating that soil flow paths over the sweep were not parallel. The ratio of vertical to lateral soil flow at the tool surface increased with larger rake angle and was greater than the ratio at the soil surface. At the soil surface, vertical velocity was greater near the nose than near the wing tip and velocity parallel to the travel direction increased with increased speed and rake angle...|$|R
40|$|More than 95 % of Iowa {{row crop}} acres {{are treated with}} herbicides. Such {{extensive}} use is an environmental concern. Banding of herbicides over the crop row, along with mechanical cultivation to control interrow weeds, has been proposed {{as a way to}} reduce herbicide use. Though cultivation is used on 74 % of Iowa corn (Zea mays L.) land, herbicides are applied in a band on only 17 % of the corn acres. This indicates that cultivation is not relied upon for interrow weed control. The risk that weather conditions will hinder completion of mechanical cultivation seems to discourage the use of herbicide banding. Higher speed cultivation could improve the odds of timely completion of needed cultivation. An experiment was conducted on a Clarion loam soil near Boone, Iowa in 1993 through 1996 to determine the effect of cultivator design and speed, when combined with the banding of chemicals, to control weeds. Three cultivator styles, two bands [19 cm (7. 5 in.) and 38 cm (15 in.) ], and two speeds were tested. A single cultivation management strategy was used. Data were taken in a no-till continuous corn rotation on 76 -cm (30 -in.) row spacings. Faster speed did not impede weed control or yield. In two years, the corn yield was greater and weed cover was reduced in plots cultivated at 11. 2 km/h (7. 0 mph) than in plots cultivated at 6. 4 km/h (4. 0 mph). Weed populations were greater in the 19 -cm (7. 5 -in.) band than in the 38 -cm (15 -in.) band three of four years. In three of four years, leaf heights and yields were also significantly less for herbicide applied in a 19 -cm (7. 5 -in.) band than in a 38 -cm (15 -in.) band. There was no difference between yield in a broadcast treatment and treatments which used a wide band of herbicide and a cultivator with disc hillers. In two years, the sweep and smith fin (a vee-shaped flat <b>sweep</b> with low <b>rake</b> angle) cultivator treatments resulted in less weed cover than the point-and-share treatment. In one year, the sweep and smith fin cultivator treatments had greater yield than the point-and-share treatment. Groundcover among cultivators showed few differences...|$|R
