40|$|Morphometric {{characters}} were investigated to provide criteria, {{in addition to}} morphological differences that are presently employed, for <b>species</b> identification of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfishes</b> (genus Sebastes). The study involved the analysis of morphometric data for a sample of redfish which was collected in the Labrador-Newfoundland region in 1958 and initially separated into two groups (Sebastes marinus and beaked redfish) {{on the basis of}} color, eye size and beak shape. Standard length was used as a covariate to adjust the morphometric data because S. marinus were on the average largerthan beaked redfishes. Discriminant analyses of (a) 17 morphomet-ric characters resulted in an 11 -variable discriminant function where 65 % of the variability was explained by the groups, (b) the two traditional discriminatiors (length of symphyseal tubercle and width of orbit) resulted in a function where 56 % of the variability was explained by the groups, and (c) the remaining 15 morphometric characters resulted in a 9 -variable function where 58 % of the variability was explained by the groups. The results demonstrated good (87 - 90 %) separation of golden redfish (S. marinus) and beaked redfishes (S. mentella and S. fasciatus). Length of symphyseal tubercle (beak), orbit width, body depth at the position of the pectoral fins, interorbital width, depth of caudal peduncle, and width of pectoral fin base were determined as good morphometric discriminators...|$|R

We demonstrate how results from these studies can be understood by morphological characteristics of the species. We predict codend size selection based on morphological data collected from golden redfish (S. marinus) individuals. Further, consistent with previously reported morphological similarities between the three redfish species, we show the predictions for S. marinus may successfully be extrapolated to understand experimental codend size selectivity results reported for S. mentella and S. fasciatus.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} comparing acoustic and bottom-trawl surveys was conducted on <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes spp.) {{on the edge of}} the Green and Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada. Redfish were on or near bottom by day and migrated vertically in the water column at night. In an attempt to account for biases attributable to the presence of fish in the near-bottom dead zone (DZ), a correction factor was applied based on density values measured within the first few metres above the detected bottom. Acoustic densities within increasing range increments above the bottom were compared with densities estimated from the trawl catch. Swept area was calculated using both the trawl's wing spread and door spread as proxies for the minimum and maximum fishing widths. Uncorrected acoustic densities were significantly higher during the night than during the day. No significant day/night differences for the entire water column were observed after DZ corrections. Close agreement between acoustic and trawl densities was obtained by integrating within the first 10 to 20 m off the bottom, with or without the DZ corrections, for both day and night experiments, but regression slopes differed. Trawl catchability appeared to be density-dependent at night, being higher at lower fish densities. Daytime acoustic estimates were more variable than those made at night, as indicated by consecutive passes of several transects and CVs of density (means of 131 % during day, 35 % at night). We conclude that acoustic measurements made at night provide the most reliable and least variable density estimates, and make recommendations for surveys...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and utilize electrophoretic methods for the taxonomic {{identification}} of Northeast <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfish</b> (genus Sebastes). Morphological traits are insufficient for proper identification of these species, particularly for 0 - and 1 -group individuals. Haemoglobins and 17 enzymes in white muscle, heart, eye, and liver have been analysed. In adult specimens only a few of these enzymes are useful for separating between the species, so only 4 enzymes were analysed for the 0 - and 1 -group fish. The enzymes were identified by histochemical staining procedures. 0 - and 1 -group S. viviparus could be identified by diagnostic phenotypes of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in all tissues, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in eye and muscle, and malic enzyme (ME) in liver. To identify 0 - and 1 -group specimens of S. mentella, blood samples are needed, as it is only the haemoglobin patterns that are diagnostic for this species. For positive identification of 0 - and 1 -group S. marinus, analysis of both haemoglobins and, e. g. MDH is necessary. However, in all three species, specimens less than 60 mm had not developed the adult haemoglobin pattern, thus making haemoglobin of no value in the classification of smaller 0 -group specimens, and the separation of S. marinus and S. mentella specimens less than 60 mm impossible. The three species showed different fre-quency distributions of IDH (liver) and ME (muscle and liver) phenotypes, thus making it possible to estimate the most likely proportion of individuals from each species when they occur in a mixture...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} habitat {{used during}} spawning may potentially {{be an important}} factor affecting reproductive output of broadcast spawning marine fishes, particularly for species with complex, substrate-oriented mating systems and behaviors, such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2 -d research cruise (15 – 16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, a split beam echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A total of five fish species were identified through ROV surveys: including cusk Brosme brosme, Atlantic cod, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole Microstomus kitt, and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfish</b> Sebastes spp. Of the three habitats identified in the acoustic surveys, the transitional habitat between boulder/lava field and sand habitats was characterized by greater fish density and acoustic target strength compared to that of sand or boulder/lava field habitats independently. Atlantic cod were observed behaving {{in a manner consistent with}} published descriptions of spawning. Individuals were observed ascending 1 – 5 m into the water column from the bottom at an average vertical swimming speed of 0. 20 – 0. 25 m s− 1 and maintained an average spacing of 1. 0 – 1. 4 m between individuals. Our results suggest that cod do not choose spawning locations indiscriminately despite the fact that it is a broadcast spawning fish with planktonic eggs that are released well above the seafloor...|$|R

40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes spp.) are {{a commercially}} {{exploited}} groundfish in the NW Atlantic, yet {{little is known}} about the early life history of these species. Their ovoviviparous reproductive strategy and restriction to deep benthic environments during spawning makes studying embryogenic and larval stages difficult. Proper management of exploited fish species, however, depends upon a comprehensive understanding of early development as it is during the egg and larval stages that recruitment variability is considered to be largely determined. I conducted two separate investigations describing the use of endogenous and exogenous resources in larval red fish in an attempt to both provide insight into recruitment processes as well as understand the evolutionary success of these species. [...] The first study examined changes in lipid and fatty acid profiles in developing pre-extruded larvae. During development within the female there was nearly a 50 % reduction in total lipid, suggesting that lipids are an important source of energy and that metabolism of these resources occurs prior to parturition. Triacylglycerol was preferentially catabolised over polar lipids unlike other Atlantic groundfish during embryogenesis such as cod (Gadus morhua) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus). High variability in these lipid reserves suggests that sensitivity to mismatches in prey after parturition likely varies between broods, assuming increased endogenous resources reduces risk of starvation. [...] The second study investigated behaviour, growth and survival of larval redfish reared under prey densities of 0. 500. 1500 and 4500 prey L⁻¹ in laboratory conditions. Some larvae lived to day 18 in the 0 prey L⁻¹ treatment despite possible handling stress from collection and transporting. Growth, survival and condition of larvae varied with prey concentration but were highest in the 1500 prey L⁻¹ treatment. The significantly lower prey bite:orient ratios in the 4500 prey L⁻¹ treatment suggest that larvae may have become confused at higher prey densities. A possible confusion effect may have explained the significant reduction in growth and survival of larvae reared in the highest prey treatment. Although the prey densities used in this experiment are higher than those reported in the field, comparisons with other rearing experiments suggest that prey availability may not be as limiting to redfish as for other commercially important <b>species</b> such as <b>Atlantic</b> cod...|$|R
