The main goal of the thesis is to analyze the role and potential of the EU <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> with a special focus on their use {{since the beginning of}} the economic integration of the EU until today and to answer the question raised. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter describes the historical evolution of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> in three phases in parallel with the deeper integration and extension of the EU. The second chapter is focused on the analyses of economic aspects of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds.</b> Research on possible improvements of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> is presented in chapter three. Chapter four compares the <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> management between France and Czech Republic. Chapter five provides insights into the upcoming 2014 - 2020 programming period. Based on the outcomes of the past evolution of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds,</b> empirical experience of their usage in France and Czech Republic and in the context of the current financial crisis and rising euroscepticism, we predict the future evaluation and priority of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> in the process of European integratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>structural</b> <b>fund</b> {{interventions}} play {{a crucial}} role in improving the social and economic cohesion of the EU. A particular focus of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> is on Objective 1 regions that lag behind to the extent that their GDP per capita is below 75 per cent of the EU average. The amount of investment that is <b>funded</b> though the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> by the EU is substantial and consequently EU legislation requires the appraisal of the <b>structural</b> <b>funds.</b> However, while systematic monitoring and evaluation frameworks are available at the national level and at the project level, a rigorous and systematic method for quantifying the socio-economic impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>fund</b> interventions on the regional economies has not been developed to the same extent. One modelling framework – HERMIN- has been widely applied to <b>Structural</b> <b>Fund</b> analysis at the national level and macro-regional level. The HERMIN framework is based on a small open economy model. Importantly it incorporates mechanisms, which are based on the endogenous growth literature, which allow it to capture the long-run supply side impact of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> along with the short run Keynesian impact...|$|R

It’s very important to estimate abilities of Lithuanian regions to use <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> aid and to reduce regional disparities. In conclusion of analysis of use of assistance from <b>structural</b> <b>funds</b> for 2004 – 2006, it is obvious that more than 1 / 5 of its budget is allocated to Vilnius region.

50|$|In the UK, a {{significant}} shift {{of power to}} NGOs and private companies determinates the new implementation of policy by these actors. Local government and urban authorities are experiencing {{a significant}} decrease of influence and therefore, the public participation’s trust and involvement in decision processes is highly dependent on the cooperation with NGOs {{and their ability to}} provide a significant level of awareness. Central cities due to the shift of governance have been cut off from their “suburban hinterlands” and forced to implement narrower policies. With an involvement of New Labour i n 1997, the new urban regeneration programmes have been implemented into local level. Participation in EU Structural Fund programmes, the URBAN Community Initiative and Urban Pilot Projects has significantly contributed to a change of urban governance in the UK. The UK central government’s effort to retain absolute control over the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funding</b> has been determined by encouragement rather than prevention of further Europeanisation at the local level. Increasing level of Europeanisation in the UK has also a further origin in a connection between the central government with local actors, resulted in formation of new implications in terms of urban governance e.g. “european urban governance”. The centralization of local government is apparent in the weight of legislation directed at local authorities.The local authorities in cities such as Birmingham and Glasgow have participated and encouraged direct lobbying, long-term strategic programming and partnership, to liaise with conditions of The European Union Programme and to benefit from <b>Structural</b> <b>Funding</b> in terms of urban development. This process can be described as “following the European strategies” in terms of urban governance. Internalisation of European Commission’s principles of programming occurs as one of the significant elements within urban local authorities when implementing the policy on European level. Both cities have further developed strong transnational networks within Eastern Europe and strong relationship in terms of international cooperation and development programmes. Observation of their development released the evidence about the adaptation pressure arose from EU Structural Funds. The Europeanisation occurs here as an emerging process, thus a “steering regulator”, which the governments of these countries are more likely to follow than to regulate and govern.|$|E
50|$|The {{island of}} Ireland, {{comprising}} Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, has an extensive network {{of tens of}} thousands of kilometres of public roads, usually surfaced. These roads have been developed and modernised over centuries, from trackways suitable only for walkers and horses, to surfaced roads including modern motorways. Northern Ireland has had motorways since 1962, and has a well-developed network of primary, secondary and local routes. The Republic started work on its motorway network in the early 1980s; and historically, the road network there was once somewhat less well developed. However, the advent of the Celtic Tiger economic boom and an influx of European Union <b>structural</b> <b>funding</b> saw national roads and regional roads in the Republic come up to international standard quite quickly. In the mid-1990s, for example, the Republic went from having only a few short sections of motorway to constructing motorways, dual carriageways and other improvements on most major routes as part of a National Development Plan. Road construction in Northern Ireland now tends to proceed at a slower pace than in the Republic, although a number of important bypasses and upgrades to dual carriageway have recently been completed or are about to begin.|$|E
50|$|This {{also led}} to the {{establishment}} of a permanent secretariat in Bangkok in March 2000. Although there existed a secretariat since 1997, this secretariat was temporary. With the permanent office also came an increase in <b>structural</b> <b>funding</b> for the secretariat. In addition to the operating costs for the AUN secretariat, also the financial support for AUN activities increased substantially since 1999. In addition to a growth in financial terms, projects also became more comprehensive. In particular, the AUN Quality Assurance programme has very ambitious goals with consequences that transcend the disciplinary boundaries. This can also form {{a turning point in the}} sense that through such projects all members of the participating universities will be affected. Many of the current activities are focused on particular individuals of the universities, and many other students and staff that are not involved in activities are not familiar with AUN and its activities. Most exchanges and gatherings for instance, although successful, have been modest in its impact on the universities as a whole. An explanation for this lies in the top-down character of the activities, with a high involvement of the university’s central level (and in some countries the ministry level) and only modest involvement of the faculties.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{and social}} {{cohesion}} between the EU Member States {{is one of}} the explicitly stated goals in the Treaty on European Union. The EU’s <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> {{as a part of the}} Union’s regional policies are a mechanism of conditional grants that provides co-financing for growth enhancing investments. Evidence on the effectiveness of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> is mixed. While Boldrin and Canova (2001) find no sign of a catch-up effect of regions receiving aid for the period of 1980 - 1996, Beugelsdijk and Eijffinger (2005) find a positive relationship between (lagged) <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> expenditure and GDP growth at the national level covering 1995 - 2001. De La Fuente (2002) points to the fact that the inclusion of conditioning variables might also play a crucial role for the results. Ederveen, deGroot and Nahuis (2002) find that <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> themselves have a negative impact on growth. However, the impact turns out to be significantly positive, when interacting variables measuring institutional quality are taken into account. Similarly, Esposti (2005) shows that additional policy measures (spending on CAP) can have significant counter-effects on the effectiveness of <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> expenditure. So far the federal structure of the EU Member States did not attract much attention when the effectiveness of the <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> is considered. Although the EU Commission requires the inclusion of regional authorities and stakeholders in the planning and implementation procedure of programs <b>funded</b> by <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds,</b> one should expect that the performance is better, where the sub-national authorities are more accustomed to pursuing economic policy and implementing programs. This should be the case in states with a higher degree of sub-national autonomy. Using panel-data for a sample of 13 EU Member States from 1960 - 1995 the effects of <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> on growth are analysed. Then a decentralization index by Stegarescu (2004) is introduced as an interacting variable in order to measure the degree of sub-national autonomy. This paper shows that increasing sub-national autonomy has a significantly positive impact on the effectiveness of the Union’s <b>Structural</b> <b>Funds</b> expenditure. ...|$|R
