25|$|Renard {{arrived in}} Plymouth on 12 January 1799. She <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> six months, finally {{undergoing}} fitting between July 1799 and January 1800. While undergoing fitting {{she may have}} received additional cannons and extensive upperworks to hold them. There is some question though whether she in fact received the additional armament and upperworks (see below). Commander Peter Spicer commissioned Renard in August 1799 for the Channel.|$|E
25|$|The N-1M {{proved to}} be {{basically}} sound, {{paving the way for}} Northrop's later and much larger Northrop YB-35 and YB-49 aircraft. The pioneering aircraft was then donated to the United States Army Air Forces in 1945 and was placed in the storage collection of the National Air Museum the following year. It <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> nearly three decades, but was finally brought back to static, non-flying status, in its final flight configuration, after several years of painstaking restoration during the 1980s. The N-1M is now on public display at the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then went}} to his vehicle, which was just past the coaches, and changed weapons to the self loading rifle. He fired at Denise Cromer, who was near the penitentiary ruins. Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{the beer}} was ordered, {{and the three}} <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> talking <b>for</b> {{a couple of hours}} in {{reference}} to a long, long voyage to the southern seas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} must have flashed upon him while he <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> father. <b>For</b> I asked him to go there with me. The visit did not {{originate}} with him.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ginger Dick didn't answer 'im. Having to {{sit still}} and listen to all them lies {{without being able to}} say {{anything}} nearly choked 'im. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> gasping <b>for</b> breath.|$|R
500|$|The Baxter men {{found an}} old cannon lying half-embedded {{in the ground}} at the foot of Byrd street. The cannon, an [...] Naval columbiad cannon, had been brought to Little Rock in 1861 by the {{steamboat}} [...] "Ponchatrain" [...] and placed on the North side of the State House to ward off any ships coming up stream. It <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> two years until Little Rock was occupied by federal troops, and the Confederates spiked the cannon disabling it. The Baxter men pulled the cannon out of the soil, repaired it, rechristened it the [...] "Lady Baxter", and made it ready to fire. It was placed {{in the rear of the}} Metropolitan Hotel on the corner of Main and Markham streets to hit any boats bringing supplies for Brooks up the river. The cannon was only fired once â€“ [...] when Baxter finally returned to the governor's seat. It now sits on the lawn of the Old State House on permanent display.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
2500|$|Darwin paid a {{visit to}} his brother Erasmus's lady friend the {{literary}} Whig Miss Harriet Martineau who had strong views on egalitarianism and whose writings had popularised the ideas of Thomas Malthus. Around this time, she was writing her Society in America which included discussion of the geological [...] "process of world making" [...] that she had seen on her visit to the Niagara Falls. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> almost an hour. [...] "She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman." [...] In her autobiography, she later recalled Charles as being [...] "simple, childlike, painstaking, effective".|$|E
60|$|She nodded, {{and they}} <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> in silence <b>for</b> several moments. Bellamy was {{thinking}} deeply.|$|R
60|$|The girl <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> almost {{motionless}} <b>for</b> a long time, exhibiting in {{her face}} and figure at once the keen watchfulness of the savage and the endurance of the pale-face.|$|R
6000|$|That answer pointed as {{straight}} to Miss Rachel {{as straight}} could be. A silence dropped on us which I thought {{would never come}} to an end. Lord! how the wind howled, and how the rain drove at the window, as I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> waiting <b>for</b> one or other of them to speak again! ...|$|R
2500|$|Matalan {{moved to}} Strood Retail Park, {{extending}} the retail offer toward Jane's Creek. In 2009 {{the site was}} fully redeveloped with another two retail units on either side. KFC and Paul Simon moved in next to Matalan- extending the retail and leisure offer, and Subway moved into Strood High Street in 2011 giving the centre a more modern focus. Thompson Travel closed, and the empty unit <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> around 8 months until Greggs took it over. Thus {{we see that the}} economics and demographics of the area were right for expansion. Tesco planned for a brand new store to be built on its acquired land in February 2013, But after a national policy change in March 2013 it announced that it would focus on smaller Express stores. [...] The Tesco Store [...] was to include a community hub and library which would be on the behalf of Medway Council and would have replaced the annex at the previous Civic Centre site in Strood.|$|E
60|$|However {{this may}} be, the two <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> some time, absorbed and silent spectators of the chase.|$|E
60|$|If he only <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> an hour, {{reading the}} papers, and nodding to his many friends, {{it would take}} him out of himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot help feeling, mother," [...] he said, {{after she}} had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with him <b>for</b> a short time, [...] "that <b>for</b> the present <b>there</b> is a {{division}} between you and me." ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{in silence}} <b>for</b> a few moments. A promenading couple put their heads behind the screen, and withdrew {{with the sound}} of {{feminine}} giggling. Outside, the piano was being thumped to the tune of a popular polka.|$|R
60|$|We three <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{and talked}} <b>for</b> {{half an hour}} or so. Then Chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean. I could see in her sea-blue eyes some deep and intense desire. Devoe, curse him! saw it too.|$|R
6000|$|Fan <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> {{half an hour}} {{longer in}} the {{grateful}} twilight and warmth of that luxurious room, and then Rosie's voice startled her crying at the door: ...|$|E
60|$|He ate some hardtack, sauced {{with wild}} berries, {{when he reached}} the summit of the ridge, and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> some time, looking down into his home coulee.|$|E
60|$|This was uncivil enough, but Sir Francis did {{not take}} it amiss. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> twenty minutes, and even made allusion to their former {{intimacy}} at Exeter.|$|E
60|$|If {{the voice}} {{had been much}} lower and more timid, Hetty would have heard it, <b>for</b> she <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{watching}} <b>for</b> her mother as one might watch for a parent in the crisis of a dread disease. She knew that no power on earth can change the will, and she had waited and prayed till the arrow was sent home by the hand of God.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Jim had no fish. He seldom {{went out}} in his boat that summer, and his long {{tramping}} expeditions were over. He {{spent a great deal}} of his time sitting by his seaward window, looking out over the gulf, with his swiftly-whitening head leaning on his hand. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> tonight <b>for</b> many silent minutes, keeping some tryst with the past which Anne would not disturb. Presently he pointed to the iris of the West: ...|$|R
6000|$|It was Saturday and Maggie was off. She <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> rather disconsolate <b>for</b> <b>there</b> was {{a dearth}} of beaux for Maggie, none having arisen to fill the aching void left by the sudden {{departure}} of [...] "Coke" [...] Sheehan since that worthy gentleman had sought a more salubrious clime--to the consternation of both Maggie Shane and Mr. Sheehan's bondsmen.|$|R
60|$|Oliver {{stirred the}} fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> a little time, without speaking; but at length {{she raised her}} head, and looked round.|$|E
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> an hour by my watch, {{though it}} seemed {{only a few}} minutes, and all that time my lion lay {{crouched}} on his crag and never moved.|$|E
60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> {{some ten}} minutes with Miss Ambient, and we {{naturally}} had some conversation, which was begun, I think, by my asking her what {{the point of}} view of her sister-in-law could be.|$|E
60|$|But Reddy <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> only <b>for</b> a minute. He was {{too eager}} {{to find out if}} it would prove to be {{possible}} to get inside that henhouse. Running swiftly but cautiously past the henhouse and along one side of the henyard, he peeped around the corner to see if by any chance the yard gate had been left open. His heart gave a leap of joy as he saw that the gate was not quite closed. All he would have to do would be to push it and enter.|$|R
60|$|For {{some time}} he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> waiting <b>for</b> he knew not what. No sound {{penetrated}} to his subterranean dungeon. He slowly revolved {{in his mind}} the incidents of the evening--the open, unguarded gate; the lighted doorway--the only one he had seen thus open and lighted along the avenue he had followed; the advance of the warriors at precisely the moment that he could find no other avenue of escape or concealment; the corridors and chambers that led past many locked doors to this underground prison leaving no other path for him to pursue.|$|R
6000|$|... "I seed our mis'ess {{go into a}} sort of a park place, where there's seats, {{and shrubs}} and flowers, arm-in-crook with a sojer," [...] {{continued}} Cainy, firmly, and with a dim sense that his words were very effective as regarded Gabriel's emotions. [...] "And I think the sojer was Sergeant Troy. And they <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> together <b>for</b> more than half-an-hour, talking moving things, and she once was crying a'most to death. And when they came out her eyes were shining and she was as white as a lily; and they looked into one another's faces, as far-gone friendly as a man and woman can be." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{tried to}} smile but her {{strength}} was almost gone. They drove to a restaurant and <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a some little time. Lenora soon recovered her colour. She even had courage {{to speak of the}} events of the afternoon when they re-entered the automobile.|$|E
60|$|The {{other girls}} went on, leaving Rachel {{sitting on the}} skids, {{in the shadow of}} the big white boat. She <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a time dreaming happily, with her blue eyes on the far, pearly horizon, and her golden head leaning against the boat.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was soon}} done, and then Oswald started on his way; {{and an hour}} later entered the tavern, and took his seat {{with three or four}} of the men from the hold, and called for wine for the party. He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> some time, and then one said: ...|$|E
6000|$|As Peter <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> admiring Killy, <b>for</b> he was {{handsome}} enough for any one to admire, he noticed {{for the first time}} a hole high up in the trunk of the tree, such a hole as Yellow Wing the Flicker might have made and probably did make. Right away Peter remembered what Jenny Wren had told him about Killy's making his nest in just such a hole. [...] "I wonder," [...] thought Peter, [...] "if that is Killy's home." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} this movelessness and silence {{on my part}} was what was {{expected}} of me. I was not to cry out in the face of fear. It was a dictate of instinct. And so I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and waited <b>for</b> I knew not what. The boar thrust the ferns aside and stepped into the open. The curiosity went out of his eyes, and they gleamed cruelly. He tossed his head at me threateningly and advanced a step. This he did again, and yet again.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Peace Now, Tali Griffel described her memories of the attack: [...] "For many years, I didn't think about what happened. I just blocked out everything and then slowly, slowly I sort of regained feeling. I remember as the shooting started, my mother grabbed me and lay down, putting me under her. She whispered to me, keeping me calm. I can still recall {{the feeling of the}} jolt as she got shot. Yet, she continued to hold me and talk to me as she bled to death. When I crawled out, I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>for</b> a very long time. The Egyptian police came and took me away to a dark room where they interrogated me for hours." ...|$|R
