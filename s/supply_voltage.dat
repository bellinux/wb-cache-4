40|$|Abstract—This work {{proposes a}} {{switching}} policy for multi-level full-bridge switching power converters and analyses their performance by driving {{them with a}} multi-level PWM modulation, targeting high-efficiency power amplifiers. Unlike conventional policies, which generate the output voltage levels only from {{the values of the}} <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> this enhanced policy also uses the values of the <b>voltage</b> difference between <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> to generate additional output voltage levels, therefore maximising the number of output voltage levels for a given set of <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> and connection switches. Simulation results show that, when tracking a band-limited signal, the proposed switching policy can reduce the power of the high-frequency spectral content from 21 % to 11 % by upgrading a 5 -level amplifier to a 7 -level amplifier without adding <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> or connection switches.

25|$|Because {{comparators}} {{have only}} two output states, their outputs are near zero or near the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> Bipolar rail-to-rail comparators have a common-emitter output that produces a small voltage drop between the output and each rail. That drop {{is equal to the}} collector-to-emitter voltage of a saturated transistor. When output currents are light, output voltages of CMOS rail-to-rail comparators, which rely on a saturated MOSFET, range closer to the rails than their bipolar counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Movement towards lower power <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> {{is driven}} by the demand that systems consume less and less power coupled with the desire {{to reduce the number of}} power <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> in the system.

This has the additional benefit of saving space. Lowering overall power consumption has a residual benefit in that there may no longer be a need for cooling fans in the system. However, as the traditional system power <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> of ± 15 V and ± 12 V give way to lower bipolar supplies of ± 5 V and single supplies of + 5 V and + 3. 3 V, it is necessary for circuit designers to understand that designing in this new environment is not simply a matte...|$|R

25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier can, if necessary, {{be forced to}} act as a comparator. The smallest difference between the input voltages will be amplified enormously, causing the output to swing to nearly the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> However, it is usually better to use a dedicated comparator for this purpose, as its output has a higher slew rate and can reach either power supply rail. Some op-amps have clamping diodes on the input that prevent use as a comparator.|$|E
25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E
25|$|If {{the circuit}} is {{operated}} asymmetrically (as a simple <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> {{with just one}} positive pole), both {{the positive and negative}} poles (or the isolated reference potential) are pulsating opposite the center (or the ground) of the input voltage analogously to the positive and negative waveforms of the phase voltages. However, the differences in the phase voltages result in the six-pulse DC voltage (over the duration of a period). The strict separation of the transformer center from the negative pole (otherwise short-circuit currents will flow) or a possible grounding of the negative pole when powered by an isolating transformer apply correspondingly to the symmetrical operation.|$|E
