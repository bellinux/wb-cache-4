500|$|In {{keeping with}} the verbiage on large-size silver {{certificates}}, all the small-size Series 1928 certificates carried the obligation [...] "This certifies that there has (or have) been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America X <b>silver</b> <b>dollar(s)</b> payable to the bearer on demand" [...] or [...] "X <b>dollars</b> in <b>silver</b> coin payable to the bearer on demand". This required that the Treasury maintain stocks of <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> to back and redeem the silver certificates in circulation. Beginning with the Series 1934 silver certificates the wording was changed to [...] "This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America X <b>dollars</b> in <b>silver</b> payable to the bearer on demand." [...] This freed the Treasury from storing bags of <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> in its vaults, and allowed it to redeem silver certificates with bullion or silver granules, rather than <b>silver</b> <b>dollars.</b> Years after the government stopped the redemption of silver certificates for silver, large quantities of <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> intended specifically to satisfy the earlier obligation for redemption in <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> were found in Treasury vaults.|$|R

5|$|The <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> {{had never}} been a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E

5|$|By 1792, Hamilton's {{principles}} {{were adopted}} by Congress, {{resulting in the}} Coinage Act of 1792, {{and the creation of}} the United States Mint.

50|$|In 1873, the {{international}} silver crisis {{resulted in a}} devaluation of silver against gold-based currencies. Since the <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> in the USA and Canada were attached to a gold exchange standard, {{this meant that the}} <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> circulating along the China coast dropped in value as compared to the US dollar and the Canadian dollar.|$|R

500|$|Until 1964, U.S. {{citizens}} could redeem {{paper money}} known as silver certificates for <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> at a U.S. Treasury mint on demand. In 1962, an individual redeemed a silver certificate {{and received a}} rare and valuable Morgan dollar in exchange. The coin was from a bag of <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> in the vault of the Philadelphia Mint. This incident triggered huge interest, and between November 1962 and March 1964, millions of Morgan and Peace dollars were sold to the general public. [...] The demand to exchange silver certificates for <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> {{was so great that}} lines formed outside of the Treasury Building in Washington, D.C. Some people in line were pushing wheelbarrows. The U.S. Treasury discovered previously unknown mint bags of Carson City dollars in its vaults containing slightly more than 2.8 million Carson City <b>silver</b> <b>dollars</b> in the Treasury vaults. Treasury officials decided to hold them back because the total number of coins minted at the Carson City mint were generally lower than others.|$|R

5|$|In {{their book}} The Fantastic 1804 Dollar, numismatic historians Eric P. Newman and Kenneth E. Bressett assert {{that a problem}} arose at the Mint {{as to how to}} {{interpret}} Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that the sets were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> and gold eagle. The moratorium on <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> coinage had been lifted in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets of coins, minted in proof finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure on the USS Peacock on April 27, 1835. The dollars included the sets bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and Cochin-China (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets of coins.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18thcentury, many of {{the silver}} dollars {{produced}} by the Mint were shipped to and circulated or melted in China in order to satisfy the great demand for silver bullion in that nation. In 1800, silver deposits once again began to decline, and the total <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> output for that year was 220,920. In 1801, following complaints from the public and members of Congress regarding the lack of small change in circulation, Boudinot began requesting that silver depositors receive smaller denominations rather than the routinely requested silver dollars, in an effort to supply the nation with more small change. Production dropped to 54,454 silver dollars in 1801 and 41,650 in 1802, after Boudinot was able to convince many depositors to accept their silver in the form of small denominations. Although silver bullion deposits at the Mint had increased, Boudinot attempted to end <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> production in 1803, favoring half dollars instead. Mintage of the 1803 dollar continued until March 1804, when production of silver dollars ceased entirely. In total, 85,634 dollars dated 1803 were struck. Following a formal request from the Bank of the United States, Secretary of State James Madison officially suspended <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> and gold eagle production in 1806, although minting of both had ended two years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the <b>silver</b> <b>dollar.</b> Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face {{to the edge of}} the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new <b>silver</b> <b>dollar.</b> Extra care was taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, <b>silver</b> <b>dollar</b> {{production}} was temporarily restarted to supply a diplomatic mission to Asia {{with a special}} set of proof coins. Officials mistakenly believed that dollars had last been minted with the date 1804, prompting them to use that date rather than the date in which the coins were actually struck. A limited number of 1804 dollars were struck by the Mint in later years, and they remain rare and valuable.|$|E
5|$|In proposing {{his plan}} for a mint and a coinage system, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton in 1791 {{proposed}} that the one-dollar denomination be struck both as a gold coin, and as one of silver, representative of the two metals which he proposed be made legal tender. Congress followed Hamilton's recommendation only in part, authorizing a <b>silver</b> <b>dollar,</b> but no coin of that denomination in gold.|$|E
5|$|The Draped Bust {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1795 to 1803, and was reproduced, dated 1804, into the 1850s.
