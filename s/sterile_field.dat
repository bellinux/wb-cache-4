Continuous irrigation of the surgical area using a physiological salt solution mixed with noxytioline and corticoid (permanently evacuated by a Redon drain positioned in the Douglas pouch) keeps the operating area always clear. It keeps the tissues always moistened to prevent tissue drying, avoids formation of adhesion and allows for bipolar coagulation. Extreme gentleness is exercised.

40|$|Abstract Background Intra-operative {{fluoroscopy}} for orthopaedic procedures frequently involves imaging in {{the horizontal}} plane, which requires the lower {{portion of the}} C-arm (x-ray tube) to be rotated from an unsterile zone (beneath the table) into the <b>sterile</b> <b>field.</b> To protect {{the integrity of the}} <b>sterile</b> <b>field</b> the C-arm must be draped repeatedly throughout the surgical case. The current, un-standardized, practice employs draping procedures which violate the Association of peri-Operative Registered Nurses (AORN) Standards and Recommended Practices, waste time and material, and pose an increased risk for surgical site infection. Presentation of the hypothesis Use of a novel sterile C-arm drape (C-armor) that maintains the integrity of the <b>sterile</b> <b>field,</b> will improve operating room efficiency and reduce surgical site infection risk factors. This reduction in risk factors may potentially reduce surgical site infections in orthopaedic surgical cases requiring repeated horizontal x-ray imaging. Testing the Hypothesis Savings in time and material and the reduction in surgical site infection risk factors afforded by using C-armor are intuitive to those skilled in the practice of orthopaedic surgery. Testing for a {{reduction in the number of}} microorganisms introduced to the surgical site by improved C-arm draping would be challenging due to the multiple confounding factors during a surgical operation. Determination of an absolute reduction in surgical site infections may be possible, but will require accounting for many confounding variables and a large study sample in order to achieve statistical significance. Implications of the Hypothesis Improved intraoperative workflow, healthcare savings and a reduction in surgical site infection risk factors will be achieved by utilizing a standardized and safe method of <b>sterile</b> <b>field</b> maintenance during intra-operative horizontal plane fluoroscopy. </p...|$|E

Wound colonisation is classified as the existence of bacteria with no obvious host reaction (Carville 2005).

Türe et al. used the extreme lateral transatlas approach for the removal of odontoid. In this study, we applied the transatlas approach but through posterior midline incision aiming to evaluate its safety and feasibility. Methods: In four silicon injected, formalin-fixed cadaver heads, posterior removal of the odontoid was done through the familiar midline incision and subperiosteal muscle separation and elevation of muscles as on unit followed by microscopic exposure and mobilization of the vertebral artery after opening of the foramen transversarium of atlas followed by drilling of lateral mass and odontoidectomy.
