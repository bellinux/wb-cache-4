40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} spatial and {{temporal}} variations of the distribution and diversity pattern of coral reef associated gastropods assemblages in Gulf of Mannar Island and to clarify the relationship between gastropods and surrounding coral reef ecosystem. Methods: Gastropods were collected from three islands–Hare (Picnic spot), Vaan (Church Island) and Koswari (Karsuvar Island). The samples were taxonomically identified according to external structure of typical shells and classified according to their feeding habits. Statistical tool Primer (Ver. 6. 1. 11) was employed to find the species diversity, richness and evenness. Results: A total of forty species of gastropods from 19 families were identified. The gastropods population density varied differently at stations, 479 species from Vaan islands, 390 species from Koswari islands and 254 species from Hare island were recorded. The gastropods species diversity, richness and evenness indices also varied differently at stations. The highest <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> <b>indice</b> was recorded at Vaan Island (2. 968), while both the highest richness and evenness indices were recorded at Hare Island with 0. 937 and 0. 942 respectively. Conclusions: The results of present study provides useful informtation for biodiversity conservation {{as well as the}} management of coral reef habitat in India. ...|$|E

Because the limits among habitats and landscapes are diffuse {{and to some degree}} subjective, it has been proposed that gamma diversity can be quantified for any inventory dataset and that alpha and beta diversity can be quantified whenever the dataset is divided into subunits. Then gamma diversity is the total <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> in the dataset and alpha <b>diversity</b> the mean <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> per subunit.

40|$|To {{reveal the}} spatial pattern of plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> in the {{inundation}} and resettlement {{region of the}} Three Gorges Reservoir, 129 plots were investigated along 14 sample belts. The sample belts were located at different aspects {{on both sides of}} Yangtze River, within the counties of Xietan, Wushan, Fengjie, Wanzhou, Fuling and Chongqing as well as the dam area. The investigated plots in each sample belt were taken at altitude intervals of approximately 50 m within an altitude range of 70 – 610 m above sea level. The spatial pattern along the altitude gradient was firstly examined by adopting the number of species and the Shannon-Wiener index based on coverage as <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> indices. Secondly, DCCA (Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis) was used to illustrate the relationship among environmental variables and <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> indices to explore factors involved with spatial patterns of <b>species</b> <b>diversity.</b> The results indicated that the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> was higher on the southern side of Yangtze River than on the northern side. <b>Species</b> <b>diversity</b> increased but not so evidently with an increase of altitude. There was no evident correlation found between stream position (upstream or downstream) and <b>species</b> <b>diversity,</b> however {{it was found that the}} belts with the highest <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> were located in the dam area and Wanzhou, while the lowest were in Chongqing and Wushan. DCCA revealed that the environmental variables most affecting <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> was firstly the southern or northern location on the Yangtze River and secondly altitude. DCCA also revealed that the coverage of the canopy layer positively affected the <b>species</b> <b>diversity,</b> but the coverage of shrub layer affected it negatively. This suggests that the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> was determined by the characteristics of community structure, especially the coverage of the arbor layer. It was concluded that the relationships between the spatial pattern of <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and environmental factors were altered by human disturbances, which are long-term and heterogeneous in space and intensity.

50|$|Depending on the {{purposes}} of quantifying <b>species</b> <b>diversity,</b> the dataset used for the calculations can be obtained in different ways. Although <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> can be calculated for any dataset where individuals have been identified to species, meaningful ecological interpretations require that the dataset is appropriate for the questions at hand. In practice, the interest is usually in the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> of areas so large that not all individuals in them can be observed and identified to species, but {{a sample of the}} relevant individuals has to be obtained. Extrapolation from the sample to the underlying population of interest is not straightforward, because the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> of the available sample generally gives an underestimation of the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> in the entire population. Applying different sampling methods will lead to different sets of individuals being observed for the same area of interest, and the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> of each set may be different. When a new individual is added to a dataset, it may introduce a species that was not yet represented. How much this increases <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> depends on the value of q: when q = 0, each new actual <b>species</b> causes <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> to increase by one effective species, but when q is large, adding a rare species to a dataset has little effect on its <b>species</b> <b>diversity.</b>|$|R

We tested the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which states that <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> will be at it maximum in intermediately disturbed areas (the mid-tidal zone in our system). We measured <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> along an elevation (or tidal) gradient by counting the number of individuals (or area) of each invertebrate <b>species,</b> then calculating <b>diversity</b> indices for all tide pools.

Finally, these raised maps of "actual" groundfish <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> are shown to be more explainable based on physical environmental parameters such as depth.

30|$|Across the New England landscape, {{our data}} show that forest age, tree height, and biomass all have {{significant}} relationships with <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> (Table  2 and Fig.  5). Among these forest variables, tree height (H) has the best relationship with <b>species</b> <b>diversity,</b> explaining similar variation in <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> as latitude (Table  2). The relationship ought to suggest tree height (H) {{more likely to be}} a cause than an effect of <b>species</b> <b>diversity.</b> Forest age is an indicator of forest stand development, and closely related to forest tree height and particularly, biomass (Table  2). The relationships between <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and three forest attributes (age, height, and biomass) are obviously not independent to each other, all are related to the effect of time on the process of forest development, and species occurrence and establishment in situ. However, tree height as the best variable for interpreting <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> may suggest that forest structural complexity plays a more foundational role for <b>species</b> <b>diversity,</b> as tree height is a direct indicator of structural complexity (Franklin et al. 2002), which echoes forest development and succession, and also the limits of environmental conditions and topography. Moreover, tree height has a stronger correlation with biomass than with <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> (R 2 of 0.74 vs. 0.66) and as an important variable determining biomass, which suggests that biomass would more likely be an underpinning to support <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> than be regulated by it. That said, the relationship between biodiversity and forest biomass (Fig.  5 a) may not be cause and effect, which is more likely due to the impacts of forest age and tree height on biomass (Table  2).|$|R

40|$|Plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in structuring communities and mediating ecosystem processes. Experiments have shown increasing plant species richness increases primary productivity, arthropod species richness, nutrient cycling, and community stability. Because effects of diversity are driven by variation among individuals, it is expected that genetic <b>diversity</b> within a <b>species</b> may mimic the effects of <b>species</b> <b>diversity.</b> Indeed, recent experimental evidence has confirmed this prediction. However, few studies have simultaneously investigated the effects of plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and genetic diversity in the same system. Therefore, the relative importance of <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and genetic diversity for community structure and ecosystem processes remains unresolved, and, importantly, potential interactions between levels of diversity have rarely been investigated. Interactive effects between genetic <b>diversity</b> and <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> are particularly important to investigate, as natural systems are composed of several genotypes of many different species. Here, I investigated how plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and genetic diversity influenced populations, communities, and ecosystems. First, I tested whether genetic diversity within populations of a weedy annual plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, influenced population success. Increasing genetic diversity increased several measures of population viability, including seedling emergence, biomass production, flowering duration, and seed set. This result suggests that highly genetically diverse populations, such as populations created from multiple introductions, may be more able to colonize novel environments than less genetically diverse populations. Next, I simultaneously manipulated plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and genetic diversity within a dominant plant species in a common garden. This experiment addressed how both levels of diversity influenced a key ecosystem process, primary productivity. Plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and genetic diversity interactively influenced biomass production, with productivity increasing the most with genetic diversity when high levels of <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> were present. Finally, I explored how plant diversity in the common garden influenced arthropod community composition, and found that genetic diversity influenced arthropods more strongly than plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity.</b> Altogether, my work underscores the importance of understanding how plant <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and genetic diversity interactively influence ecological communities in order to gain a more holistic view of how communities are structured and what factors control ecosystem functioning...|$|R

In support of niche differentiation theory, <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> and community composition were related to edaphic factors.

Elevation is inversely proportional to <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> index, the higher the elevation, the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> index tends to decline, but the index {{of the importance of}} endemic species have increased. Group stand structure and species composition is influenced by the level of elevation with their own environment...|$|R
40|$|We {{asked if}} the genetic {{diversity}} of Saponaria bellidifolia (a habitat specialist plant) and the <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> of its habitat are driven by parallel landscape level processes in an island-like system of limestone outcrops in the Carpathian Mountains. We tested the relationship of these two diversity levels at local and regional geographic scales. Local genetic and <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> showed parallel patterns influenced {{by the number of}} plant communities. Likewise, at regional level there was strong evidence for parallel equilibrial dynamics of genotypes and species. However, a superimposed matrix effect enhanced the regional <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> only. Genetic diversity of habitat specialist organisms and <b>species</b> <b>diversity</b> of these limestone outcrop islands on mainland are modulated by parallel landscape-level processes at different geographic scales, and mechanisms may be identified at very high spatial resolutions. ...|$|R
