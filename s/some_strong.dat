5|$|Woolwich Arsenal {{played in}} the Second Division for eleven seasons, and {{generally}} occupied mid-table before the appointment of Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1899; Bradshaw and his star signings, including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft (Arsenal's first England international) and captain Jimmy Jackson, won promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. However, Bradshaw moved on to Fulham in May 1904, before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight. Despite <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> performances in the FA Cup– the club reached the semi-finals in 1905–06 and 1906–07– Arsenal {{were never able to}} challenge for the League title, only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave off}} the Bahamas organized into Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth storm of the season had ever formed that early in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier air. It moved erratically, inching closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> wind gusts, but was otherwise unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Burns {{was given}} a {{prolonged}} run in the Warwickshire team, playing both first-class and one-day cricket throughout April and May; he failed to impress during these matches, recording a highest score of 35 and averaging well under twenty in both forms of the game. He {{spent the rest of}} the season playing for the second team. <b>Some</b> <b>strong</b> performances for the seconds at the start of the 1996 season, including scores of 77 and 81 not out in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers, and a finger injury suffered by Piper, saw him regain a place in the Warwickshire first team in June. He remained in the first team for the rest of the season, playing as a specialist batsman when Piper returned to the side, and scored three half-centuries in first-class cricket, including his highest first-class score to that point, 81 runs scored against Nottinghamshire, during a match in which he also remained 65 not out in the second innings.|$|E

5|$|In early 2010, Kieswetter {{achieved}} his target; <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> performances for the England Lions, {{especially in}} a match against the senior England team, won him {{a place in the}} squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the man of the match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by Jos Buttler, his teammate at Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Outside of battle, {{the game}} {{contains}} <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> role-playing video game traditions. For example, Mario's strength {{is determined by}} multiple statistical fields and status-boosting items {{that can be used}} in and outside of combat. The effects of these items range from healing Mario or his partner to damaging the opponent. Mario can also purchase badges from non-player characters or occasionally obtain them from defeated enemies; when equipped, these badges can permanently enhance a particular skill or aspect, or, in some cases, give Mario new moves, including Power Jump and Quake Hammer. Throughout the game, Mario is permanently assisted by a party member. Each party member has a specialised skill, some of which are required to solve puzzles to advance progression in the game. More party members are gained as the player advances through the game.|$|E
5|$|The storm moved north {{over the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico, {{striking}} the Florida Panhandle between Pensacola and Panama City on August 23. Extremely high tides bombarded the Apalachicola area, resulting in extensive coastal flooding. The hurricane destroyed wharves and left many ships damaged or foundered. Sea water intrusion inundated warehouses and streets in Apalachicola, and one street was made impassable by strewn debris and fallen trees. Farther east, a {{bridge over the}} Wakulla River was washed away by raging floodwaters. A long period of high winds was reported at the state's capital city of Tallahassee. The storm produced <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> winds in interior Georgia {{on its way to}} the Carolinas. The destruction of homes, crops, and trees was reported from Griffin through Augusta. Adverse conditions extended westward to Montgomery, Alabama, where the night of August 23 was marked by high winds and heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

25|$|In 1844, Maharaja Srish Chandra Roy had {{initiated}} {{steps for}} setting up a Brahmo Samaj at Krishnanagar. By the time, Ramtanu Lahiri went to Krishnanagar, it had already attracted both converts and strong opponents in the orthodox community. At that time a great debate was raging in the Brahmo Samaj as to whether to accept the infallibility of the Vedas or not. Tattwabodhini Patrika had also engaged in a bitter debate with the Christian missionaries and had launched a tirade against Christianity. While Ramtanu Lahiri was in general agreement with the Brahmo principles, he had <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> reservations on certain points.|$|E
25|$|In the Sri Lankan innings, England {{got their}} first {{breakthrough}} when opening batsman and captain Bandula Warnapura was dismissed for 10 runs. However, Sidath Wettimuny along with Jayasekera took their team to 74. Sri Lanka were then in trouble when their third, fourth, and fifth wickets fell within 8 runs. Despite this, Ranjan Madugalle and Anura Ranasinghe put together a partnership of 68 runs, scoring {{at an average of}} 6 runs an over. <b>Some</b> <b>strong</b> hitting from the tail-end batsmen took Sri Lanka closer to their target, but they had managed only 206 for 8 wickets {{at the end of their}} innings, just 5 runs short of their target.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Chou–Fasman parameters found <b>some</b> <b>strong</b> tendencies among individual {{amino acids}} to prefer {{one type of}} secondary structure over others. Alanine, glutamate, leucine, and methionine were identified as helix formers, while proline and glycine, due to the unique conformational properties of their peptide bonds, commonly end a helix. The original Chou–Fasman parameters were derived from a very small and non-representative sample of protein structures due to {{the small number of}} such structures that were known {{at the time of their}} original work. These original parameters have since been shown to be unreliable and have been updated from a current dataset, along with modifications to the initial algorithm.|$|E
