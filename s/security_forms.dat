5000|$|Marie Barrow, born in 1918, remembered Jones {{as being}} {{the same age as}} her brother LC, who was born in 1913, and that {{therefore}} he was not a minor in 1933. She may have confused Jones's birthday with Ray Hamilton's, May 21, 1913. In 1950 Jones filled out Social <b>Security</b> <b>forms</b> stating that he was born May 12, 1916, the same date he gave Dallas police in his November 1933 confession; in 1968 he told Playboy he was 16 on Christmas Eve 1932 and that Clyde Barrow was seven years older than he. A news article noting an arrest in September 1973 gives his age as 59. His death certificate gives his age as 58 and lists his birthday as May 15. Since he filled out his Social <b>Security</b> <b>forms</b> himself, while a relative filled out his death certificate, it would be safe to assume that his birthday is May 12 — however, May 15, 1916 is the date on his gravestone.(NOTE added February 2015) — According to the 1920 federal census of Van Zandt County, Texas, J.Z. (James) and Tookie Jones were parents of the following children: Garrison - age 16; Slennie - age 13; Clyde - age 10; Herbert - age 7; and W.D. - age 3. [...] (Another son, Roy Lee, was born in 1920, after the census information was taken). This supports W.D. Jones' claim of 1916 as his year of birth. He was listed as three years old as of January 15, the day the census enumerator visited.|$|E

Human science has created the four-toed Nebish, a pallid, short-lived and highly programmable humanoid who has had the elements that do not facilitate an underground Hive existence (aggression, curiosity, etc.) bred out of it. The five-toed humans (called buckeyes) wander the biofarms that keep the trillions of Earth's Nebish population fed. All animals other than man are extinct, so meat comes from other humans (and the occasional rat). The conflict between the Hives and the roving bands of five-toed original Humans, who are reduced to savagery and hunted like vermin by Hive <b>Security,</b> <b>forms</b> the backdrop of this novel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{connections}} between development and security both within developing countries and globally. It interprets security as human security, and within this category focuses on political violence as {{an important source of}} insecurity. Three connections are hypothesised: that human <b>security</b> <b>forms</b> an important part of people’s wellbeing and is therefore an objective of development; that lack of human security has adverse consequences on economic growth and poverty and thereby on development; and that lack of development, or imbalanced development that involves sharp horizontal inequalities, is an important cause of conflict. Evidence supporting these relationships is surveyed for developing countries. A brief overview of the current global situation suggests similar relationships obtain. Hence for both developing countries and to prevent global terrorism, it is essential to promote inclusive development. A focus on military solutions alone – the usual interpretation of ‘security ’ – will not succeed. ...|$|E

40|$|In today’s world, <b>security</b> <b>forms</b> an {{integral}} part {{in every aspect of}} life. The detection of weapons concealed underneath a person’s clothing is very much important to the improvement of the security of the general public as well as the safety of public assets like airports, building and railway stations, etc. Manual screening procedures for detecting concealed weapons are common in controlled access settings like airports, entrance to sensitive buildings and public events. It is desirable sometimes to be able to detect concealed weapons from a standoff distance, especially when it is impossible to arrange the flow of people through a controlled procedure. In this project we propose an automated weapon detection using millimeter wave imagining method. The millimeter wave scans the entire body, without causing any side-effects, for concealed weapon. We enhance the millimeter wave image and follow it up with segmentation. The system has built-in intelligence to detect the concealed weapon after segmentation.
