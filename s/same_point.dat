5|$|Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years. After {{this period}} of time Venus and Earth have {{returned}} to very nearly the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in their respective orbits. During the Earth's 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.|$|E
5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the <b>same</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Part of the TxDOT's job is to measure traffic along the highway. These counts are taken using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT), a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles that travel along {{a portion of the}} highway. The TxDOT usually measures AADT near an intersection. In 2011, the highway's AADT count was 1500 vehicles, taken at a point just after the intersection with SH 87. This was an increase from the previous year, when the AADT at the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> was approximately 1400 vehicles. This was also an increase from 2009, when the route's AADT was just 1100 vehicles, also taken from the <b>same</b> <b>point.</b> No portion of the roadway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the <b>same</b> <b>point,</b> then any circle tangent at the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E

5|$|By the , {{the ninth}} {{race of the}} season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the {{following}} three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After his victories in Italy (in which Alonso had an engine failure) and China, in which Alonso had tyre problems, Schumacher led in the championship standings {{for the first time}} during the season. Although he and Alonso had the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> total, Schumacher was in front because he had won more races.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done at the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{consisted}} {{of five to}} ten Grands Prix contested on closed circuits, as opposed to public roads. Points earned in these events counted toward the drivers' and constructors' World Championships. The driver's and constructor's championship were separate championships, but {{were based on the}} <b>same</b> <b>point</b> system. The points systems used in the championship varied over the years. The first championship in 1962 awarded points from first to sixth place; a point was also awarded for the rider who completed the fastest lap. The last championship in 1989 awarded points from first to fifteenth place. Results from all Grands Prix counted towards the championships; however, in some seasons only a certain number of results were counted.|$|E

5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship are separate championships, but {{are based on}} the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many drivers are in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to score points for the team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The moons {{discovered}} by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are {{among the largest}} satellites in the Solar System. The orbits of three of them (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance; for every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbors at the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in every orbit it makes. The tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{controversial}} incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari {{was unable to}} put up a challenge regularly to Senna's frontrunning McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very <b>same</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and {{it has been suggested that}} it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|Around the <b>same</b> <b>point</b> as Hooker's approach, Hawker {{had been}} working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E
