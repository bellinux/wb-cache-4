40|$|Concerned by the {{overwhelming}} presence of vexatious federal securities-fraud class actions, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 {{to increase the}} procedural burden plaintiffs would face in filing these nonmeritorious suits. Instead of being deterred, plaintiffs simply brought their suits in state court. Congress responded with the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), making federal court the exclusive venue for securities-fraud class actions. However, Congress expressly saved from SLUSA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reach</b> claims that were traditionally brought in state court under corporate law through the Delaware carve-out. Though this exemption was meant to protect the historic dual federal-state securities-regulation regime, recent appellate court opinions have stretched SLUSA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reach</b> too far, leaving plaintiffs incapable of bringing many traditional state-law claims essential to the proper policing of corporate law regardless of the forum.
