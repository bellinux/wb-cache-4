Through no fault on the part of The <b>Scourer</b> (who, overcome by his feelings at the result of the above-mentioned frightful accident, has gone back to his native wilds a moody and broken-hearted man), she slipped from his hand while the three horses bestrode by the fiery but humane Arab were going at a gallop, and fell, shocking to relate, outside the Ring, on the boarded floor of the Circus. She was supposed to be dead. Mr. Jubber instantly secured the inestimable assistance of the Faculty, who found that she was still alive, and set her arm, which had been broken. It was only afterwards discovered that she had utterly lost her sense of hearing. To use the emphatic language of the medical gentlemen (who all spoke with tears in their eyes), she had been struck stone deaf by the shock.

40|$|International audienceAlterations to {{colonization}} {{or early}} post-settlement stages may cause {{the reorganization of}} communities under future ocean acidification conditions. Yet, this hypothesis has been little tested by in situ pH manipulation. A Free Ocean Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FOCE) system was used to lower pH by a ~ 0. 3 unit offset within a partially enclosed portion (1. 7 m 3) of a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow (11 m depth) between 21 June and 3 November 2014. Epibiont colonization and early post settlement stages were assessed within the FOCE setup, {{as part of the}} larger community-level study, to better understand the outcome for a multispecies assemblage and the ecological processes that result in reported community shifts under altered carbonate chemistry. Two types of artificial collectors (tiles and scourers) were placed within three treatments: a pH-manipulated enclosure, an un-manipulated control enclosure, and an open plot in the ambient meadow. Tiles and scourers were collected after one to four months. Additionally, to see whether the outcome differed for communities in a later successional stage, previously settled scourer-collectors were also placed in the same three treatments. Enclosures acted to reduce settlement and migrant colonization. Scourers deployed for one to four months within the open-plot contained a community assemblage that could be distinguished from the assemblages within the enclosures. However, a comparison of enclosure assemblages on tiles showed evidence of a pH effect. There was lowered coverage of crustose coralline algae and fewer calcareous tube-forming polychaetes (Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus sp.) on tiles placed in the pH-manipulated enclosure compared to the un-manipulated enclosure. For assemblages in <b>scourer</b> collectors, shared and common taxa, in all treatments, were invertebrate polychaetes Psamathe fusca, Sphaerosyllis sp., Chrysopetalum sp., arthropods Harpacticoida, and Amphipoda, and the juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp. Similar organism composition and abundance, as well as taxonomic richness and evenness, were found in scourers from both enclosures. Pre-settled scourers contained greater numbers of individuals and more calcified members, but the assemblage, as well as the growth rate of a juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp., appeared unaffected by a two-month exposure to lowered pH and calcium carbonate saturation state. Results from this case study support the hypothesis that early stages of specific calcifiers (crustose coralline algae and calcareous tube-forming polychaetes) are sensitive to near future ocean acidification conditions yet suggest that negative effects on sessile micro-invertebrate assemblages will be minimal...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if marine species diversity was influenced by geographical location and whether it was higher at lower latitudes. Artificial collectors (made of nylon pan <b>scourers)</b> were employed as a standard substratum for the colonisation of marine invertebrates inhabiting subtidal (12 to 15 m) hard, rocky bottom substrata. These artificial substrate units (ASUs) were deployed at different latitudes including northern and southern temperate (South West England, UK and New Zealand), tropical (Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies) and polar (Signy Island, Antarctica) areas. The polychaetes, representative of the macrofauna and the nematodes, representative of the meiofauna fractions of the total invertebrate fauna collected were analysed. Neither polychaete nor nematode species diversity showed a trend based on latitude and each taxon showed a different pattern of diversity variation in relation to location. Polychaete diversity varied from area to area with highest species diversity occurring in the southern temperate (New Zealand). Nematode species diversity however was similar for the northern and southern temperate (UK and New Zealand) and the tropical area (Trinidad and Tobago). Thus, although the number of locations studied was limited, these data do not conform to a gradient in species diversity with latitude as has been previously supposed. The success of ASUs to compare species diversities in standardised habitat units augurs well for their future use in other ecological areas such as biogeographical or pollution studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{relations}} of lung function and chest radiographic appearances with exposure to inspirable dust {{were examined in}} 634 workers in five wool textile mills in west Yorkshire, randomly selected to represent fully the range of current exposures to wool mill dust. Most of these workers could be categorised into three large sex and ethnic groups; European men, Asian men, and Asian women. Exposures to inspirable dust had been measured at a previous survey and time spent in current job, and in the industry were used as surrogates for lifetime cumulative exposures. Chest radiographs were interpreted on the International Labour Office (ILO) scale by three medically qualified readers, and the results combined. Profusions of small opacities of 0 / 1 on the ILO scale, or greater, were present in only 6 % of the population, and were not positively associated with current exposure to wool mill dust, or duration of exposure. In general, statistically significant relations between exposure and lung function indices were not found, {{with the exception of}} an inverse relation between the forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity ratio and dust concentration in European women. A suggestive but not statistically significant inverse relation between FVC and current dust concentration was seen in Asian men. Substantial differences were found between mills in mean values of lung function variables after adjustment for other factors but these were not apparently related to the differences in dust concentrations between these mills. Dyeworkers and wool <b>scourers</b> (mostly European men in relatively dust free jobs) on average experienced an FEV 1 251 ml lower than other workers when age, height, smoking habits, and occupational factors had been taken into account. Twenty four per cent of the workforce responded to intracutaneous application of one or more common allergens (weal diameter at least 4 mm), only 12 (7. 9 %) of these responding to wool extracts. Atopic subjects did not appear to have an increased susceptibility to the effects of inspirable wool dust on lung function. These studies suggest that exposure to wool mill dust may cause functional impairment in some workers but there is little indication from these data of frequent or severe dust related functional deficits. More detailed estimates of cumulative dust exposure by reconstruction of exposure histories might clarify associations between exposure to dust and lung function. These chest radiographic findings provide no evidence that exposure to wool mill dust is related to lung fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|The Turbo 500 still {{produced}} by imake Limited {{was designed to}} make home-distilled alcoholic beverages on a 23 L volume scale. The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyse the distillation performance of the Turbo 500 still, and to compare it with a competitor still, the essencia. The distillate fractions from the imake-recommended 60 to 65 °C water outlet temperature treatment contained stable and high ethanol concentrations of around 90 % (v/v), although the other distillation properties (distillation time, percent total recovery) were usually not as good as with a warmer 75 to 80 °C cooling treatment. The stills performance comparison was done with a 15 % ethanol wash. The essencia still generally produced distillates with lower ethanol concentrations and lower total ethanol recoveries. The essencia’s performance was more affected by the cooling treatment than that of the T 500 still. The mean theoretical plates value of the T 500 was 5. 08, which was higher than that of the essencia still (4. 92). The gas chromatograph (GC) results of the distillates fractions from a 15 % synthetic wash containing seven congeners showed essencia’s recovery curves were more scattered from the ethanol recovery curve when compared with the equivalent curves of the T 500 still. Ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde were better resolved than those of the other congeners by both stills. 2 -Methylpropan- 1 -ol was be better resolved by the essencia still. The GC-mass spectrometer (GCMS) results indicated that more esters were found in essencia’s distillates from one of two fermentation recipes (Recipe B as recommended by imake). The reason for this is unknown. Sensory trials showed that, numerically, more panellists preferred the essencia distillate from Recipe B than the T 500 distillate, but the difference was statistically insignificant (29 of 50, where 33 of 50 was P = 0. 05). No differences were observed for Recipe A. The copper saddles (T 500) and brass <b>scourers</b> (essencia) turned black after distillation. The results from scanning electron microscopy showed that copper, and copper and zinc (brass), became surface oxidised during distillation. Sulphur was also detected, and could be smelt after the materials were acid treated.

40|$|The Lost and Found in Decoration & Ornamentation:a studio {{exploration}} of memory, shadow, repetition and transformation explores, through {{the making of}} visual works and a contextual examination of relevant artists and writers, the proposition that both the physical world and the metaphysical universe are shaped by the whisper of memories. It is my belief that ideas and memories are frequently lost in one plane, only to be discovered in a new form on a fresh plane. This is the whisper of memory murmured into new physical forms. It is, for example, the secondary presence of the everyday embroidery that tumbles out of the cupboard like emotions. I explore the lost and found, the before and after, the non-linear path of memories, of items long lost or ideas forgotten reawakened in found objects. Fragments of china and shards of glass emerge from the dusty earth to be found long after their owners have disappeared and their original purpose was lost. Time, for these changed memories of lost lives, has not moved on, it has just moved. The marks and patterns I make are evocations of people no longer present, of functions no longer relevant. They represent the decorative in a domestic context; the patterns on china, carpets, curtains, the fabric of clothing. These marks and patterns are set in the landscape of memory and changed perception. And in the Australian landscape, which, while bleached and rusted in its dusty exterior, is in the homely interior lushly brushed with the fecundity of English and Oriental imagery – imaginings of an un-experienced world, and memories waiting to be found. In my artworks materials are sought for their quality, texture, domestic usage and opportunity for ornamentation and pattern, all of which I use to enrich the work and contribute to a new vocabulary. I strive to create {{a challenge to the}} obvious or immediate impression by using contradictory techniques or materials that cause the familiar to become something more difficult to decipher, investing the commonplace with the unsettling. Since each material selected has been chosen for its intrinsic nature, common usage and/or its relevance to the artwork itself, each layer of meaning adds to the overall voice of the piece. Materials include cast liquid latex, flywire, embroidery thread, plastic and metal kitchen <b>scourers,</b> safety pins and sewing pins. The artworks, which very often take the form of unwearable garments, use collected materials, scale and form to push the poetic possibilities of expression on the surface or hidden within ornamentation, embellishing the work and the meaning. Through the individual forms or materials (such as safety pins) used in my sculptures, I work to create a pattern that becomes the point of focus in the work. It is this strange tension between the beauty and banality of the actual material that creates the paradox between the everyday nature of a product such as flywire or safety pins and the visceral and perceptual reading of the viewer. Essentially, the artworks and the words explore the conversation between an external masculine world and its changing relationship to the new vocabulary emerging on the inside. Outside, rusted flywire—that symbol of separation between the outside and inside—is lost to the large world only to re-emerge on the inside with new purpose {{in the shape of a}} female garment. While the original function is lost, the memories survive, constantly rediscovered as gendered metaphors. This is the vocabulary of woman; filled with the language of yearning and hope, of an indestructible spirit. This exegesis probes, both figuratively and literally, the before and after. It explores the thinking, the writing, the artists and the artworks that have come before, placing them in a context for my own work and it discovers how my own work may have extended what came before and what has been found anew.
