5|$|A {{variety of}} microgenres have {{subsequently}} emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including goregrind, focused on themes of gore, and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates electronic music {{elements such as}} <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted.

Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for <b>sampling,</b> <b>and</b> it must be thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E

5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The aims of {{this article}} are twofold: first {{estimate}} {{the parameters of the}} superpopulation model for two-stage cluster sampling from a finite population when the sampling design for the both stages is informative. Second predict the finite population total, cluster-specific effects for clusters in the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> clusters not in the <b>sample,</b> <b>and</b> predict the cluster totals for clusters in the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> clusters not in the sample. To achieve this we derive the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> complement-sample distributions and the moments of the first stage and second stage measurements. Also we derive the conditional <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> conditional sample-complement distributions and the moments of the cluster-specific effects given the cluster measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Different from {{traditional}} one-sided clustering techniques, coclustering {{makes use of}} the duality between <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> features to partition them simultaneously. Most of the existing co-clustering algorithms focus on modeling the relationship between <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> features, whereas the intersample and interfeature relationships are ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel coclustering algorithm named Locally Discriminative Coclustering (LDCC) to explore the relationship between <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> features {{as well as the}} intersample and interfeature relationships. Specifically, the sample-feature relationship is modeled by a bipartite graph between <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> features. And we apply local linear regression to discovering the intrinsic discriminative structures of both <b>sample</b> space <b>and</b> feature space. For each local patch in the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> feature spaces, a local linear function is estimated to predict the labels of the points in this patch. The intersample and interfeature relationships are thus captured by minimizing the fitting errors of all the local linear functions. In this way, LDCC groups strongly associated <b>samples</b> <b>and</b> features together, while respecting the local structures of both <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> feature spaces. Our experimental results on several benchmark data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. Index Terms—Coclustering, clustering, bipartite graph, local linear regression.

5|$|The actors {{selected}} {{to portray the}} protagonists invested much time and research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a fundamental visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received <b>sampling,</b> <b>and</b> fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|Detractors further {{blamed the}} school for the accident, saying that, {{in the name of}} tradition, administrators {{turned a blind eye to}} an unsafe {{structure}} being constructed with minimal engineering and safety protocols. Before the collapse, some people expressed concerns about the safety of the Bonfire, citing the partial collapse that occurred in a previous Bonfire, the progressively shorter Bonfire burn times (collapse of the stack after lighting) which had dropped from several hours to less than 20minutes, and numerous incidents involving alcohol or unsafe horseplay at the Bonfire site. One of the students killed in the 1999 Bonfire collapse was under the legal drinking age yet a toxicology test showed high blood-alcohol levels; however, lower readings in a second test and inconsistencies in the initial <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> annotation methods led to questions about the accuracy of the original tests.|$|E

The LTA's ACE Magazine advertised Power Tennis and featured competitions offering the game as a prize. Nintendo also released an online questionnaire regarding players' habits and preferences in relation to tennis {{as a part of}} their Who Are You? campaign. Nintendo announced in 2008 that they would be re-releasing the title as part of their New Play Control! selection, which feature added Wii controls. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and optional Nunchuk attachment, allowing the player to trigger actions such as forehands and backhands by swinging the Remote like a tennis racket. It was released on January 15, 2009 in Japan and on March 2009 in other countries. It was later re-released in North America on June 10, 2012 along with Pikmin 2 as Nintendo Selects titles.|$|E
5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E

For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal quantization.|$|E
