5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government</b> allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

On 25 February, both LJM and JEM announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha.

50|$|The {{contemporary}} left, {{according to}} Levy, believes that any opponent of America or capitalism is good by definition. It is this reasoning {{that has led}} the left to support the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein; to turn the World Conference against Racism 2001 into a forum for anti-Semitic hatred, and to the <b>Sudanese</b> <b>government's</b> attacks first on southern Sudan and now {{on the people of}} Darfur because that government is anti-American and no anti-American government is to be criticized.|$|R
