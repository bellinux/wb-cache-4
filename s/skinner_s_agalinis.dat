40|$|ABSTRACT: Although {{culturally}} prominent modernist influences {{account for}} much of Skinner’s early behaviorism, the subsequent changes in his views are appropriately considered as postmodern and are indebted to other sources. These changes are strikingly apparent in his 1945 publication, “The Operational Analysis of Psychological Terms. ” In that publication, Skinner introduced a probabilistic three-term contingency for verbal behavior with an expanded contextualism and an increased emphasis on consequences with a clear alignment to pragmatism. Instead of reaffirming the mechanistic and necessitarian values of modernism that he had previously embraced, Skinner was aligning himself with the postmodern values of pragmatism and selectionism. Key words: B. F. <b>Skinner,</b> Charles <b>S.</b> Peirce, modernism, postmodernism, pragmatism, selectionism, three-term contingency. Philosophical modernism and literary modernism contributed to Skinner’s early behaviorism, which was largely in the modernist tradition. In “The Operational Analysis of Psychological Terms, ” however, Skinner (1945 / 1972) turned to a selectionist view of behavior that belonged to a different tradition...|$|R

40|$|Egg {{weights and}} total eggs {{produced}} by nine Speyeria spp. (Nymphalidae) in California allowed estimates of per-egg and lifetime reproductive effort. Interpopulation reproductive effort in four species and intrapopulation reproductive effort of two species in different years were documented. Female body weight was uncorrelated with either individual egg weight or total lifetime egg weight. Smallest eggs (mean dry wt/egg = 0. 05 - 0. 06 ug), {{and the greatest}} number of eggs, were from <b>S.</b> coronis (<b>Skinner)</b> and <b>S.</b> zerene (Boisduval) whose females undergo summer reproductive diapause in dry habitats. Largest eggs (mean dry wt/egg = 0. 10 ug) were from <b>S.</b> nokomis (<b>Skinner),</b> a wet habitat species. The greatest relative reproductive effort was made by dry habitat species lacking reproductive diapause. Reproductive effort and duration of first instar exposure to summer temperatures were positively correlated. Intrayear variation in total egg weight did not vary significantly among populations of S. callippe (Boisduval), S. hesperis (Boisduval), S. nokomis, or S. zerene but mean total egg weights were significantly different in females from the Donner Pass, CA population of S. mormonia (Boisduval) in two years. S. zerene from high elevations lacked the reproductive diapause characteristic of lower elevation populations. The reproductive strategies of Speyeria spp. are adaptive responses to the desiccation stress that their habitats impose on diapausing first instars...|$|R

40|$|Tikiguania estesi {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{to be the}} earliest member of Squamata, the reptile group that includes lizards and snakes. It {{is based on a}} lower jaw from the Late Triassic of India, described as a primitive lizard related to agamids and chamaeleons. However, Tikiguania is almost indistinguishable from living agamids; a combined phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular data places it with draconines, a prominent component of the modern Asian herpetofauna. It is unlikely that living agamids have retained the Tikiguania morphotype unchanged for over 216 Myr; it is much more conceivable that Tikiguania is a Quaternary or Late Tertiary agamid that was preserved in sediments derived from the Triassic beds that have a broad superficial exposure. This removes the only fossil evidence for lizards in the Triassic. Studies that have employed Tikiguana for evolutionary, biogeographical and molecular dating inferences need to be reassessed.

40|$|Signalling {{activated}} by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{can result in}} the production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) which is implicated in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No study has examined or compared hepatic expression of TLRs in both HCV and HCV/HIV. Liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from HCV & HCV/HIV-infected patients and PBMCs from HIV-infected patients. Liver RNA was analysed by microarray and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). PBMCs were analysed by flow cytometry. Associations with hepatic histology and infection type were sought. Forty-six HCV, 20 HIV and 27 HCV/HIV-infected patients were recruited. Increasing Metavir inflammatory activity score was associated with increased hepatic TLR mRNA by RT-qPCR: TLR 2 (P ≤ 0. 001), TLR 4 (P = 0. 008) and TNF-α (P ≤ 0. 001). A high degree of correlation was seen between hepatic mRNA expression of TNF-αvs TLR 2 (r(2) = 0. 66, P < 0. 0001) and TLR 4 (r(2) = 0. 60, P < 0. 0001). No differences in TLR gene or protein expression was observed between HCV, HCV/HIV- or HIV-infected groups. Hepatic TLR 2, TLR 4 and TNF-α mRNA are associated with hepatic inflammation in both HCV and HCV/HIV infection. High correlation between TNF-α and TLR 2 /TLR 4 suggests a role for the innate immune response in TNF-α production. Activation of the innate immune response appears to be independent of infection type. M. D. Berzsenyi, S. K. Roberts, S. Preiss, D. J. Woollard, M. R. Beard, N.

50|$|This is now {{sometimes}} called the four-term contingency model with setting conditions added as a fourth term. This consists of a motivating operation (MO), discriminative stimulus (S), response (R), and reinforcement (<b>S).</b> <b>Skinner's</b> Verbal Behavior also introduced the autoclitic and six elementary operants: mand, tact, audience relation, echoic, textual, and intraverbal. For Skinner, the proper object of study is behavior itself, analyzed without reference to hypothetical (mental) structures, but rather {{with reference to the}} functional relationships of the behavior in the environment in which it occurs. This analysis extends Ernst Mach's pragmatic inductive position in physics, and extends even further a disinclination towards hypothesis-making and testing. Verbal Behavior is divided into 5 parts with 19 chapters. The first chapter sets the stage for this work, a functional analysis of verbal behavior. Skinner presents verbal behavior as a function of controlling consequences and stimuli, not as the product of a special inherent capacity. Neither does he ask us to be satisfied with simply describing the structure, or patterns, of behavior. Skinner deals with some alternative, traditional formulations, and moves on to his own functional position.|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{approaches}} to inferring ancestral character states {{are becoming increasingly}} sophisticated; however, the potential remains for available methods to yield strongly supported but inaccurate ancestral state estimates. The consistency of ancestral states inferred for two or more characters affords a useful criterion for evaluating ancestral trait reconstructions. Ancestral state estimates for multiple characters that entail plausible phenotypes when considered together may reasonably be assumed to be reliable. However, the accuracy of inferred ancestral states for one or more characters may be questionable where combined reconstructions imply implausible phenotypes for a proportion of internal nodes. This criterion for assessing reconstructed ancestral states is applied here in evaluating inferences of ancestral limb morphology in the scincid lizard clade Lerista. Ancestral numbers of digits for the manus and pes inferred assuming the models that best fit the data entail ancestral digit configurations for many nodes that differ fundamentally from configurations observed among known species. However, when an alternative model is assumed for the pes, inferred ancestral digit configurations are invariably represented among observed phenotypes. This indicates that a suboptimal model for the pes (and not the model providing the best fit to the data) yields accurate ancestral state estimates. Adam <b>Skinner</b> and Michael <b>S.</b> Y.

40|$|Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009 The scincid lizard clade Lerista {{provides}} an exceptional model {{for studying the}} mode of substantial evolutionary transformations, comprising more than 90 species displaying a remarkable variety of body forms. Patterns of character evolution in this clade, inferred from reconstructed ancestral states, are at least partly consistent with the correlated progression model of macroevolutionary change. At each stage in {{the transition to a}} highly elongate, limb-reduced body plan, alterations to the lengths of the forelimb and hind limb are accompanied by compensatory changes in snout-vent length (or vice versa), preserving locomotory ability. Nonetheless, there is evidence for moderate dissociation of hind limb evolution in some lineages, while tail length has evolved effectively independently of the substantial alterations to the lengths of the body and limbs. This indicates a significant role of evolutionary and developmental modularity in the divergence of body form within Lerista, and emphasises the potential variability of the strength of functional constraints within organisms and among lineages. Trends toward a highly elongate, functionally limbless body plan may be attributed primarily to a combination of the interdependence of changes in snout-vent length and limb lengths and the very low probability of re-elaborating structurally reduced limbs. Similar asymmetries in the probabilities of interrelated phenotypic changes may be a significant cause of evolutionary trends resulting in the emergence of higher taxa.

His brother Alfred being attached to the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, he traveled to Fort Leavenworth, arriving on May 8, 1849, and attached himself to the Regiment which was then under the command of Colonel William W. Loring, its previous commander, Brigadier General Persifor F. Smith, having been given command of the Pacific Division of the Army. [...] The Regiment had been dispatched to the Oregon Territory, and both Gibbs and Major Osbourne Cross documented its overland travel along the Oregon Trail to Fort Vancouver to which they arrived on October 4 of that year. In addition to a diary, Gibbs recorded the journey on a copy of John Charles Frémont's map Map of an Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842, Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-44. Gibbs may also have met Peter Skene Ogden during his first days in Fort Vancouver and Oregon City; later correspondence indicates he was well acquainted with Ogden.

40|$|C-Repeat Binding Factors (CBFs) are DNA-binding {{transcriptional}} activators of gene pathways imparting freezing tolerance. Poaceae contain three CBF subfamilies, two of which, HvCBF 3 /CBFIII and HvCBF 4 /CBFIV, {{are unique}} to this taxon. To gain mechanistic insight into HvCBF 4 /CBFIV CBFs we overexpressed Hv-CBF 2 A in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivar ‘Golden Promise’. The Hv-CBF 2 A overexpressing lines exhibited stunted growth, poor yield, and greater freezing tolerance compared to non-transformed ‘Golden Promise’. Differences in freezing tolerance were apparent only upon cold acclimation. During cold acclimation freezing tolerance of the Hv-CBF 2 A overexpressing lines increased more rapidly than that of ‘Golden Promise’ and paralleled the freezing tolerance of the winter hardy barley ‘Dicktoo’. Transcript levels of candidate CBF target genes, COR 14 B and DHN 5 were increased in the overexpressor lines at warm temperatures, and at cold temperatures they accumulated to much higher levels in the Hv-CBF 2 A overexpressors than in ‘Golden Promise’. Hv-CBF 2 A overexpression also increased transcript levels of other CBF genes at FROST RESISTANCE-H 2 -H 2 (FR-H 2) possessing CRT/DRE sites in their upstream regions, the most notable of which was CBF 12. CBF 12 transcript levels exhibited a relatively constant incremental increase above levels in ‘Golden Promise’ both at warm and cold. These data indicate that Hv-CBF 2 A activates target genes at warm temperatures and that transcript accumulation {{for some of these}} targets is greatly enhanced by cold temperatures.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc. IL- 10 {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in the uterus and placenta and is implicated in controlling inflammation-induced pathologies of pregnancy. To investigate the role of IL- 10 in regulating preterm labor, the response of IL- 10 null mutant mice to low-dose LPS in late gestation was evaluated. When IL- 10 null mutant C 57 BL/ 6 (IL- 10 –/–) and control (IL- 10 +/+) mice were administered LPS on day 17 of pregnancy, the dose of LPS required to elicit 50 % preterm fetal loss was 10 -fold lower in IL- 10 –/– mice than in IL- 10 +/+ mice. Surviving fetuses in IL- 10 –/– mice exhibited fetal growth restriction at lower doses of LPS than IL- 10 +/+ mice. Marked elevation of LPS-induced immunoactive TNF- and IL- 6 {{was evident in the}} serum, uterus, and placenta of IL- 10 –/– mice, and TNF- and IL- 6 mRNA expression was elevated in the uterus and placenta, but not the fetus. Serum IL- 1, IFN-, and IL- 12 p 40 were increased and soluble TNFRII was diminished in the absence of IL- 10, with these changes also reflected in the gestational tissues. Administration of rIL- 10 to IL- 10 –/– mice attenuated proinflammatory cytokine synthesis and alleviated their increased susceptibility to preterm loss. Exogenous IL- 10 also protected IL- 10 +/+ mice from fetal loss. These data show that IL- 10 modulates resistance to inflammatory stimuli by down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines in the uterus and placenta. Abundance of endogenous IL- 10 in gestational tissues is therefore identified as a critical determinant of resistance to preterm labor, and IL- 10 may provide a useful therapeutic agent in this common condition.

Design: Prospective, assessor-blinded, randomised crossover trial. Participants: Twenty-four physiotherapy students {{in the third year}} of a 4 -year undergraduate degree. Intervention: Participants each completed 5 weeks of clinical placement, utilising a peer-assisted learning model (a standardised series of learning activities undertaken by student pairs and educators to facilitate peer interaction using guided strategies) and a traditional model (usual clinical supervision and learning activities led by clinical educators supervising pairs of students). Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was student performance, rated on the Assessment of Physiotherapy Practice by a blinded assessor, the supervising clinical educator and by the student in self-assessment. Secondary outcome measures were satisfaction with the teaching and learning experience measured via survey, and statistics on services delivered. Results: There were no significant between-group differences in Assessment of Physiotherapy Practice scores as rated by the blinded assessor (p =  0. 43), the supervising clinical educator (p =  0. 94) or the students (p =  0. 99).

40|$|At the {{beginnings}} of the 1960 <b>s</b> <b>Skinner’s</b> teaching machine reached the Netherlands. This machine used programmed instruction to guide children in small steps through the teaching materials. It provided them with carefully chosen questions and automatic feedback, fitting the principles of behavioristic learning psychology. In the USA the machine was a big hit, since it was a promise for effective learning and a probable solution for the shortage of teachers. Its technological nature was appealing to the Americans, within the Cold War sentiments, and fitted the popular paradigm of scientific management. Skinner aimed for providing an alternative for traditional whole-class teaching, {{as well as for the}} child-centered progressive approach of education, in which, according to Skinner, the expectations on what children had to learn were completely unclear. The Netherlands also had to deal with a shortage of teachers and Dutch educationalists also tried to find alternatives for whole-class teaching, but for the rest the circumstances were very different. The Cold War tensions were not that present and educational sciences were still dominated by the German academic ideals in which the notion of “Verstehen” in stead of measuring outcomes, dictated the academic approach to educational issues. Nevertheless, the Dutch educationalist were very interested in this technological innovation. This paper describes the Dutch expectations of the teaching machines. Did Dutch educationalists understand it as a practical solution for the shortage of bodily teachers, or as a suitable device to organize individual instruction or were their motives of a different nature? And did their curiosity resulted in enthusiasm or in fear? The answer to these questions is provided based on an analysis of articles on the teaching machines and on programmed instruction as published in Dutch educational journals in the 1960 s and on archive materials on a conference on programmed instruction of the Werkgemeenschap voor Vernieuwing van Opvoeding en Onderwijs (W.
