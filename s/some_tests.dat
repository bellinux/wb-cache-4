25|$|Similar to the {{discussion}} above, clitics {{must be able to}} be distinguished from words. There {{have been a number of}} linguistic tests proposed to differentiate between the two categories. <b>Some</b> <b>tests,</b> specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories in the sense that they share certain properties with them. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins {{are often}} {{regarded}} as one of Earth's most intelligent animals, though it is hard to say just how intelligent. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See cetacean intelligence for more details.|$|E

25|$|Selecting a {{different}} test usually identifies {{a different}} list of significant genes since each test operates under a {{specific set of}} assumptions, and places a different emphasis on certain features in the data. Many tests begin with the assumption of a normal distribution in the data, because that seems like a sensible starting point and often produces results that appear more significant. <b>Some</b> <b>tests</b> consider the joint distribution of all gene observations to estimate general variability in measurements, while others look at each gene in isolation. Many modern microarray analysis techniques involve bootstrapping (statistics), machine learning or Monte Carlo methods.|$|E
25|$|At {{least three}} {{projects}} {{were related to}} the IA-58 development. The first was an extended Pucará airframe with pressurized cabin for six passengers, equipped with Astafan turbofan engines for light transport and photography duties. The second was an observation and reconnaissance aircraft having the same configuration as the Fairchild-Republic A-10. The third was denominated IA-60 and was an advanced trainer and light attack platform powered by two Astafans conserving the basic airframe and canopy of the Pucará with T-tail incorporating high wings. <b>Some</b> <b>tests</b> were made on wind tunnels but no further development was made in order to proceed with the IA-63 Pampa program.|$|E

25|$|In 1986-87 {{more than}} 1000 Faroese {{children}} {{were enrolled in}} a long-term study of fish consumption and children's development in the Faroe Islands. The study was led by Philippe Grandjean from the University of Southern Denmark. The researchers took hair samples from the mothers of unborn children and a sample of umbilical cord blood {{in order to measure}} prenatal exposure to mercury. At the age of seven, the children participated in <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> which showed that the higher the level of mercury was, the worse the performance. The mercury found in the tested Faroese women and children comes mainly from the consumption of pilot whale.|$|E
25|$|Pye Wacket {{was planned}} to be tested using a rocket sled launcher, with a Mach 5 booster rocket being used later in the test program. There are {{unconfirmed}} reports that <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted in 1960. However the high cost and perceived vulnerability of the B-70 against the projected performance of Soviet air defenses, combined with the 1960 U-2 incident in which a high-flying spyplane had been shot down, led to the decision that intercontinental ballistic missiles would, in the future, be the primary nuclear delivery force of the United States, and therefore the B-70 project was cancelled in early 1961. Pye Wacket, its delivery vehicle no longer available, {{is believed to have}} been cancelled soon after, although the ultimate fate of the program remains classified.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ALT test flight program, on March 13, 1978, Enterprise was flown once again, but this time halfway across the country to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama for the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Testing (MGVT). The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the Dynamic Test Stand building, and there mated to the Vertical Mate Ground Vibration Test tank (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked {{the first time in the}} program's history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together. During the course of the program, Enterprise and the rest of the launch stack would be exposed to a punishing series of vibration tests simulating as closely as possible those expected during various phases of launch, <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> with and others without the SRBs in place.|$|E
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
25|$|Lou has a tempestuous {{relationship}} with her children-in-law Kathy and Arthur, blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou isn't adverse to speaking her mind or scolding her family if she disapproves of their actions, but she soon comes to celebrate her grandson Martin's (Jon Peyton Price) birth – although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. She is a strict traditionalist and moralist but she believes in strong family-values most of all, and will defend her family if any outsider dares to criticise them. She provides a warm shoulder to cry on when 16-year-old Michelle finds out she is pregnant in late 1985 and is supportive of her favourite grandchild, Ian, on his plans {{to work within the}} catering trade rather than following in his father's footsteps in a more masculine occupation. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for <b>some</b> <b>tests</b> and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.|$|E
