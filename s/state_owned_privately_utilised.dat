40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{the hypothesis that}} the co-existence of <b>state</b> <b>owned</b> banks with <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> banks together tends to raise interest rates spreads and profitability of <b>privately</b> <b>owned</b> banks. This hypothesis can help explain the relationship between the share of <b>state</b> <b>owned</b> banks and total banking assets and economic growth, as reported in the literature. Three empirical tests of the two parts of the main hypothesis are presented. Two of them rely on Brazilian monthly time series data and the other one uses a cross section regression with data for a sample of countries. One of them builds on an estimation of an expanded version of the composition of a rate of return of an asset under the market efficient hypothesis. Another one estimates a factor augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. All of these tests give support to the hypotheses tested. <b>state</b> <b>owned</b> banks, interest rate spreads, banking profitability, FAVAR. ...|$|R
