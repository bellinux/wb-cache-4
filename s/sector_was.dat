5|$|In the 1980s, the <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> transferred from the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> {{estimated}} to employ nearly 12,000 people and directly contribute £1.4billion to the UK economy in 2005, making it roughly sevenpercent {{of the size}} of the CAT industry. Nearly half of the economic contribution was generated by business aviation.|$|E

50|$|Each <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> {{assigned}} a <b>sector</b> number which <b>is</b> used when co-ordinating {{the passage of}} aircraft between each other. Colloquial names are also in use for each group of <b>sectors</b> and <b>are</b> sometimes used within the co-ordination process when <b>sectors</b> <b>are</b> bandboxed together to indicate that one <b>sector</b> team <b>is</b> operating {{a whole group of}} sectors.|$|R
5|$|On October 11, the Port Said <b>Sector</b> <b>was</b> {{reinforced}} with the 103rd Sa'iqa battalion of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new fiberglass boats from Alexandria. The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance of the boats themselves or their engines. With the arrival of these reinforcements and equipment, Salah began to lay a plan of attack.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May SS-Standarte Deutschland {{approached}} the Zanddijk Position. A first attack around 08:00 on outposts of the northern <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> easily repulsed, as the Germans had to advance over a narrow dike through the inundations, despite supporting air strikes by dive bombers. However, the bombardment caused the battalions in the main positions to flee, and the entire line had to be abandoned around 14:00 despite the southern part being supported by the French torpedo boat L'Incomprise.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{along the}} Vimy Ridge were {{accompanied}} by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> conducive to tunnelling owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.|$|E

30|$|Regarding the sectors, the {{manufacturing}} <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> {{the highest in}} the number of existed firms. Specifically, in Addis Ababa, {{the manufacturing}} <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> approximately equal to the summation of all other <b>sectors.</b> That <b>is,</b> the manufacturing <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> more successful in larger cities. In the last 5 years, only a few of small firms have grown to a medium enterprise, in which most of them are involved with manufacturing and construction.|$|R
5|$|Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, {{suffered}} {{damage to the}} roofs of the psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also spread into the maternity ward and damaged the electrical system. All of the patients had been evacuated before the storm arrived. Because most equipment and supplies had also been removed, the hurricane's cost to the health <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> limited to the EC$3million of structural damage.|$|E
5|$|The Mura <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> {{quiet on}} 9 April. The 42nd Infantry Division Murska took the 39th Infantry Regiment under command, but the 105th Infantry Regiment and 341st Reserve Regiment began to {{disintegrate}} due to desertions. Due {{to the situation}} on the right flank of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment Ormozki to withdraw from the Drava to behind the Bednja to conform to the line being held by the 27th Infantry Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
5|$|The Second Army was {{commanded}} by General Charles Huntziger, {{who was responsible}} for the defense of the Ardennes region of the frontier, including the Fortified Sector of Montmédy. The <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> composed of two parts. The eastern portion was defended by the Maginot positions of La Ferté, Chesnois, Thonnelle and Vélosnes, widely spaced and small, compared to the massive fortifications of other sectors like Thionville. The western portion of the Montmédy <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> even more lightly defended, with several lines of fortifications ranging from fortified houses near the border to small blockhouses farther back. None of the western defenses were of a scale sufficient to support La Ferté or to act as a significant block to an invading force without the organized support of mobile army formations. The relatively weak La Ferté position effectively acted as the western end of fixed fortifications.|$|E

5|$|The {{galvanization}} of Mogadishu's {{real estate}} <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> in part {{facilitated by the}} establishment of a local construction yard in November 2012 by the Municipality of Istanbul and the Turkish Red Crescent. With 50 construction trucks and machines imported from Turkey, the yard produces concrete, asphalt and paving stones for building projects. The Istanbul Municipality was also scheduled to bring in 100 specialists to accelerate the construction initiative, which ultimately aims to modernize the capital's infrastructure and serve it over the long-term.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{unit of the}} 1stCavalry Division's <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> GCompany of the 5th Cavalry Regiment. It held Hill 303, {{the furthest}} {{position}} on the Eighth Army's extreme right flank. To the north lay the ROK 1st Division, the first unit {{in the line of}} the South Korean Army.|$|E
5|$|The private <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> not {{the only}} source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
50|$|In the model, the {{subsistence}} agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> typically {{characterized by}} low wages, {{an abundance of}} labour, and low productivity through a labour-intensive production process. In contrast, the capitalist manufacturing <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> defined by higher wage rates {{as compared to the}} subsistence sector, higher marginal productivity, and a demand for more workers. Also, the capitalist <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> assumed to use a production process that is capital intensive, so investment and capital formation in the manufacturing <b>sector</b> <b>are</b> possible over time as capitalists' profits are reinvested in the capital stock. Improvement in the marginal productivity of labour in the agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be a low priority as the hypothetical developing nation's investment is going towards the physical capital stock in the manufacturing sector.|$|R
50|$|The Tertiary sector {{corresponds}} to 59,08% of the Palestina GDP. The Secondary <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> 6.47% of the GDP. The Primary <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> relevant, with 34.4% {{of the city}} GDP.|$|R

5|$|The stay of the {{division}} in this <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> marked by several serious encounters with the enemy, where considerable forces were engaged. There were furthermore almost nightly encounters between patrols or ambush parties, and the harassing fire of the artillery on both sides was very active.|$|E
5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> to be again the Thomas gate, {{to take full}} advantage of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps so that they could not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} Sa'iqa company to perform its landing, the Port Said <b>Sector</b> <b>was</b> to be {{supplied}} 24 assault dinghies. Only ten were received however, and on October 3, Second Army informed Khalid {{that there were no}} more dinghies available, and {{that he would have to}} improvise. Khalid resorted to renting two fishing boats. Consequently, the Sa'iqa company was tasked with simply isolating the fort; no attack from the east would be carried out.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} {{human rights and}} {{development}} groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended {{due to lack of}} access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed {{with tens of thousands of}} laborers out of work. The agriculture <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.|$|E
5|$|After being re-established in December 1940, I./JG 1's primary {{responsibility}} was the air defence of Germany and its Northern occupied territories. In this role, the unit almost exclusively {{worked in the}} Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany. Its main opponents through 1940–41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this <b>sector</b> <b>was</b> considered relatively safe compared to other theaters.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{prevented}} {{this action}} and on 24 December, Jhangar, a strategically advantageous {{position in the}} Naushahra <b>Sector,</b> <b>was</b> captured by the Pakistanis which gave them control over the communication lines between Mirpur and Poonch and provided a starting point from which attacks could be made on Naushahra. The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces. Brigadier Mohammad Usman, the commanding officer of the 50th Para Brigade, had made necessary arrangements to counter the expected attack. Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E

40|$|The Space and Aeronautics <b>Sectors</b> <b>are</b> {{high tech}} {{manufacturing}} sectors. Between Space and Aeronautics <b>Sectors</b> <b>are</b> linkages and parallels. All major systems assemblers {{are active in}} both <b>sectors.</b> Examples <b>are</b> EADS but also Boeing, BAE Systems and manufacturers of propulsion systems and other components (e. g. the SAFRAN group). Safety regulation and high performance criteria are crucial for commercial success in both sub-sectors with reliability of equipment being a key factor. The military and defence technology {{play an important role}} for innovation in both sub-sectors. There are however also differences. The European Space <b>Sector</b> <b>is</b> internationally structured, but with a main focus in Europe, while the Aeronautics <b>Sector</b> <b>is</b> increasingly globally oriented. In the Space sector national procurement and institutional structures heavily influence the Space markets, but in civilian Aeronautics the share of institutional customers is much smaller. Moreover, the Aeronautics <b>Sector</b> <b>is</b> characterized by a small number of very large firms, a large number of medium-sized companies and {{a very large number of}} small companies. The Space <b>Sector</b> <b>is</b> also dominated by a few very large firms, but has a smaller number of SMEs and a large number of small space units within large companies...|$|R
