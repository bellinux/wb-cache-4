5|$|On 28 August 1943, Mackay {{once again}} assumed command of New Guinea Force. This time, {{important}} operations were being {{undertaken in the}} Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Junior commanders felt that Mackay <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> forceful, and should have {{enlisted the help of}} his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea. Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Rendell {{admitted}} that during his term as Governor of Pennsylvania, he underperformed when {{he dealt with}} {{the growing popularity of}} shale gas in Pennsylvania. Rendell stated, “I made a mistake in the rush to get the economic part of fracking delivered to Pennsylvania” saying that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> concerned with the effect shale gas has on Pennsylvania's environment and not with how Pennsylvania could benefit financially from shale gas.|$|E

25|$|Brot af Sigurðarkviðu is the {{remaining}} 22 stanzas of a heroic Old Norse poem in the Poetic Edda. In the Codex Regius, {{there is a}} gap of eight leaves where {{the first part of}} the poem would have been found, and also the last part of the Sigrdrífumál. The missing narrative is preserved in the Völsunga saga in prose form with four stanzas of poetry. According to Henry Adams Bellows, the original size of the poem <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> than 250 stanzas.|$|E
25|$|The {{parents of}} Igor Suprunyuk and Viktor Sayenko {{repeated}} {{their belief in}} the innocence of their sons. Vladimir Suprunyuk claimed that Igor had been tortured to extract his confession, with the police covering his head and forcing him to inhale cigarette smoke. Speaking at a televised press conference, he cited irregularities in the investigation, {{and said that the}} case against his son was false. Viktor Sayenko claimed that his son was a scapegoat, and that the crimes were committed by relatives of senior officials. The parents plan to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights. The parents of Suprunyuk and Sayenko also argued that the sentence on Alexander Hanzha was too lenient. An opinion poll conducted in Dnepropetrovsk found that 50.3% of people believed that the sentence was fair, and 48.6% believed that the sentence <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> severe. In April 2011, a poll found that nearly 60% of Ukrainians wanted the death penalty available for serial killings where judicial error had been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Guan Xiao-tong {{has been}} dealing with Murphy's Law {{from the moment she}} was conceived. Just as she was {{starting}} to imagine a future with her boyfriend he dumps her, telling her he is set to marry someone he doesn't love but is wealthy. That same night at the same place Ji Jia-wei gets rejected when he proposes marriage to his celebrity girlfriend He Zhi-yu, who cares more about her career than him. Heartbroken, Jia-wei gives the engagement ring to a drunk Xiao-tong. A year later Xiao-tong and Jia-wei meet again in the most unpleasant circumstances and become instant enemies when his umbrella accidentally splashes puddle water on her. She becomes annoyed with his unapologetic behavior while he thinks she <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> observant of her surroundings. Their hatred for each other grows when they find out that they're in the opposite business of love. She's a Love Doctor that helps people find love at a matchmaking service while he's the boss and owner of a divorce firm that helps couples walk away from their broken marriages amicably.|$|E

25|$|Fear {{of adverse}} Chinese, Soviet and public {{reaction}} also caused US policymakers to put numerous restrictions on American forces until comparatively {{late in the}} war. Plans drawn up by the military Joint Chief of Staff, US MACV commander General Westmoreland, and naval chief Admiral Sharp proposed bolder strategic action. This included airborne-amphibious landings north of the DMZ, corps-sized thrusts to liquidate enemy sanctuaries in the DMZ, Laos and Cambodia, a shutdown of incoming war material by mining the vital Haiphong harbor and more bombing of key targets in the Hanoi/Haiphong zone. All of these were rejected by civilian policymakers, {{with one or two}} implemented very late in the American War. By that time, the focus was on withdrawal of US forces. Some critics have argued that the Joint Chiefs in particular <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> forceful in standing up to civilian leadership about their misgivings, but whether this would have made any difference is unknown. All of the more ambitious plans above had their own technical and political difficulties, some historians argue – including the threat of Chinese intervention, a repeat of the guerrilla warfare in the North as the Viet Minh did with the French, or other countermeasures by the North Vietnamese, who, in conjunction with allies such as the Pathet Lao, could have simply widened the war in Cambodia, Laos and even into Thailand as a reaction to American moves elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for a Writers Guild Award in 1991. Holly E. Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on not just this episode, but the whole of the first season, saying, [...] "What's not to like about an episode like 'The Stakeout,' in which (among other things) we are witness to the invention of George's alter ego, Art Vandelay (and his import/export business)?" [...] Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly also liked the episode but had some doubts, saying it was, [...] "A painfully realistic take on the lovers-to-friends transition that <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> comically fruitful." ...|$|E
500|$|Kondracki's graphic {{depiction}} of violence was controversial. Bob Mondello of NPR called it [...] "sobering", but felt the scenes detracted {{from the film}} and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> subtle. Ryan Rojas of Tonight at the Movies described the film as [...] "gritty and merciless", and cautioned that certain scenes might offend some viewers: [...] "While the scenes do work as reinforcing {{the horror of the}} events, it really just made it obvious that the way that the director was going to win over fans was to simply shock them into numbness, as scenes showing rape, mutilation, and murder are shown in very disturbing fashion."

5000|$|The {{game was}} poorly received. Eurogamer {{said it was}} [...] "broken in the literal sense of not working as sold and, as such, must be scored appropriately. That the game {{underneath}} the bodged localisation is also, figuratively, a broken shell of what it once was and absolutely nowhere near {{as good as it}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> than anything, deeply, deeply sad."

Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly stated that the video <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> creative and called it offensive, stating that Minaj's appearance was the best part. Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone commented that the video was morbid, comparing it to [...] "Thriller", though noted that [...] "instead of dancing zombies, he gives us undead, barely dressed and occasionally dismembered models". Perpetua called Minaj's appearance [...] "cameo of the year" [...] describing her appearance in the video: ...|$|E
500|$|Reception to Nebulous was {{generally}} positive: a reviewer from The Times described the first series as [...] "a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult {{written all over}} it", while the second series was described as [...] "cool and cultish". However, The Daily Telegraph was more guarded, comparing the show to [...] "Hitchhiker's without the philosophy or Red Dwarf without the energy", going {{on to say that}} show is [...] "funny, but not seriously so". A reviewer for Doctor Who website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed [...] "I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> patient because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny".|$|E
500|$|In the Test series, Crawford scored 281 runs at {{an average}} of 31.22 and took nine wickets at 35.77. England lost the series 4–1, finding it {{difficult}} to bat against the South African googly bowlers. Wisden's tour report described Crawford's batting {{as one of the few}} positives for his side. Writing home during the tour, the MCC captain Pelham Warner frequently praised Crawford and the extent of his ability at a young age. The English press even parodied what Crawford's biographer, Michael Burns, describes as Warner's [...] "near-obsession" [...] with Crawford. Other critics believed that Crawford <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> successful as a bowler but was distracted by the matting surfaces used in South Africa; because he was able to make the ball bounce and turn extravagantly from the surface, he tried to spin the ball too much and lost accuracy as a result.|$|E

500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{described}} the video as a [...] "fitting soundtrack" [...] to the choreographed dance between Madonna and Howard, and complimented the last scene. Eliana Dockterman from Time believed that since Howard had been acting and dancing on Empire, he was signed for the video. Brett Mallec from E! shared this view {{but added that}} the duos [...] "dancing skills aren't half bad". Louis Virtel from HitFix made 10 observations about the video, but concluded that there <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> dance sequences to liven up the visuals, and hence could {{not live up to}} other [...] "all-time great" [...] Madonna releases. Kory Grow from Rolling Stone complimented the visual, saying that the [...] "better part of the video is a mostly harrowing scene for the pop star" [...] and compared it to the TV series The Last Man on Earth. James Elliot from Complex found the video to be [...] "captivating" [...] and keeping one [...] "surprised" [...] in spite of feeling it to be long.|$|E

You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have learned something! They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{investigators}} {{found that the}} weather data that the flight crew received in Medellín was nine to ten hours old. Additionally, the alternate airport on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the safe minima for landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also {{found no evidence that}} the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 52 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express any concern to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication of worry came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the [...] "expect further clearance" [...] (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, burning up its reserve fuel {{to the point where it}} could no longer divert to Boston.|$|E
