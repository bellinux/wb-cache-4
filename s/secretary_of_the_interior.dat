5|$|On February 6, 2013, Jewell was {{nominated}} by President Barack Obama to succeed Ken Salazar as United States <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior.</b> Her nomination {{was approved by}} the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 21, with only three of the committee's 22 members opposed. On April 10, 2013, the Senate confirmed Jewell to be <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> in an 87–11 vote. She was sworn in as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> on April 12, 2013.

5|$|In 1850, Sherman was {{promoted}} to the substantive rank of Captain and married his foster sister, Ellen Boyle Ewing, four years younger, in a Washington ceremony attended by President Zachary Taylor and other political luminaries. Thomas Ewing was serving as the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the {{waterfront}} area {{was among the}} earliest National Historic Landmarks designated by the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior.</b> Five years later, in 1971, WHALE succeeded in getting today's historic district designated as the Bedford Landing Waterfront Historic District. The city later enacted zoning regulations to preserve its character.|$|E
5|$|Jewell was the 51st <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> and {{the second}} woman to hold the position. Unlike many of her predecessors, Jewell never held elected office. Because she {{acquired}} her U.S. citizenship by naturalization rather than being a natural-born citizen, Jewell was not eligible to hold a place within the presidential line of succession.|$|E

5|$|The Leopold Report, officially {{known as}} Wildlife Management in the National Parks, is a 1963 paper {{composed}} {{of a series of}} ecosystem management recommendations that were presented by the Special Advisory Board on Wildlife Management to United States <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Stewart Udall. Named for its chairman and principal author, zoologist and conservationist A. Starker Leopold, the report proved influential for future preservation mandates.|$|E
5|$|The National Historic Landmark Program is {{administered}} by the National Park Service, a branch of the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process. The <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> can only designate a site as eligible for designation.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} objections, United States <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Stewart Udall {{formally}} opposed {{construction of the}} dam in 1967, and the project was shelved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nevertheless completed its engineering study of the project in 1971, and the final report was {{released to the public}} in 1979. In 1980, U.S. President Jimmy Carter created the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Sanctuary, which formally protected the area from development and disallowed any similar project.|$|E
50|$|As <b>of</b> , nine former <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> are alive, <b>the</b> oldest being Manuel Lujan, Jr. (served 1989-1993, born 1928). The {{most recent}} to die was William P. Clark, Jr. (served 1983-1985, born 1931), on August 10, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, {{enacted in}} 1975, it {{authorized}} <b>the</b> <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> Health, and Education {{to enter into}} contracts under which the tribes themselves would assume responsibility for <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> federal Indian programs.|$|R

5|$|In 1963, {{after several}} years of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone, United States <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Stewart Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. In a paper known as the Leopold Report, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended management of Yellowstone's elk population.|$|E
5|$|The City furthered {{its plan}} of {{renewing}} {{the area and}} took no heed of the PAC. In response, the PAC secretly submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places for the Milwaukee Avenue district. It was approved on May 2, 1974 by <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Rogers CB Morton. This meant that the City could not alter or destroy the houses using federal funds without a public hearing.|$|E
5|$|The city of Las Vegas had lobbied {{hard to be}} the {{headquarters}} for the dam construction, closing its many speakeasies when the decision maker, <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Ray Wilbur came to town. Instead, Wilbur announced in early 1930 that a model city was {{to be built in}} the desert near the dam site. This town became known as Boulder City, Nevada. Construction of a rail line joining Las Vegas and the dam site began in September 1930.|$|E

50|$|After <b>the</b> {{bankruptcy}} <b>of</b> Montgomery Ward in 2001, {{the earliest}} buildings were converted into upscale condominiums. The project met <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior's</b> Standards with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balconies. In 2004, the office tower also was converted to condominiums, now called The Montgomery.|$|R
50|$|Title VII: Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee This title would {{amend the}} Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act to {{establish}} the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council Advisory Committee to advise <b>the</b> <b>Secretaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> and Agriculture (USDA) on wildlife and habitat conservation, hunting, and recreational shooting.|$|R
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|In January 1965, the Department of the Interior {{completed}} its three-volume, 1,000-page {{study of the}} Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies of {{the impact on the}} region's Alaska Native population. United States <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Stewart Udall then created a task force to review the findings before he made a final decision. Throughout 1965 and 1966, opponents and proponents of the project funded studies of their own, aimed either at supporting or rejecting the arguments for the dam.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{have lived}} in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000years. Aside from visits by {{mountain}} men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell {{under the jurisdiction of the}} <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> the first being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was subsequently commissioned to oversee management of Yellowstone for a 30-year period between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.|$|E

5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{was born}} in 1820 in Lancaster, Ohio, near {{the banks of the}} Hocking River. His father, Charles Robert Sherman, a {{successful}} lawyer who sat on the Ohio Supreme Court, died unexpectedly in 1829. He left his widow, Mary Hoyt Sherman, with eleven children and no inheritance. After his father's death, the nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing, Sr., a prominent member of the Whig Party who served as senator from Ohio and as the first <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior.</b> Sherman was distantly related to American founding father Roger Sherman and grew to admire him.|$|E
5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
