60|$|I had {{not spoken}} to Miss Fairlie--I had not even seen her--all that day. The first meeting with her, when I entered the drawing-room, was a hard trial to her {{self-control}} and to mine. She, too, had done her best to make our last evening renew the golden bygone time--the time that could never come again. She had put on the dress which I used to admire {{more than any other}} that she possessed--a dark blue silk, trimmed quaintly and prettily with old-fashioned lace; she came forward to meet me with her former readiness--she gave me her hand with the frank, innocent good-will of happier days. The cold fingers that trembled round mine--the pale cheeks with a bright red <b>spot</b> <b>burning</b> in the midst of them--the faint smile that struggled to live on her lips and died away from them while I looked at it, told me at what sacrifice of herself her outward composure was maintained. My heart could take her no closer to me, or I should have loved her then as I had never loved her yet.|$|E

30|$|Parthenium has {{mammalian}} toxicity as well. It causes dermatitis, eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, black <b>spots,</b> <b>burning,</b> and blisters around eyes in mammals, including humans (Gunaseelan 1987; Towers and Rao 1992; Maishi et al. 1998; Morin et al. 2009; Akhtar et al. 2010). Exposure to parthenium also causes {{systemic toxicity}} including loss of skin pigmentation, dermatitis, diarrhea, and degenerative changes in liver and kidneys in livestock who accidentally graze upon parthenium (Gunaseelan 1987; Rajkumar et al. 1988; Lakshmi and Srinivas 2007).|$|R

60|$|Standing thus, {{he passed}} {{a hand over his}} eyes and stared again, two hectic <b>spots</b> <b>burning</b> now in his white cheeks. Abruptly, {{disregarding}} the superscription, his trembling fingers snapped the blank seal and unfolded the letter addressed to his royal master. He was still reading when the chamberlain returned to announce that the King was pleased to see the Baron at once. He did not seem to hear the announcement. His attention was all upon the letter, his lips drawn back from his teeth in a grin, and beads of perspiration glistening upon his brow.|$|R

40|$|Although a {{many studies}} {{concerning}} crop residue burning have been conducted, {{the influence of}} crop residue burning on local PM 2. 5 concentrations remains unclear. The number of crop residue <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> was the highest in Heilongjiang province and we extracted crop residue <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> for this region using MOD 14 A 1 (Thermal Anomalies & Fire Daily L 3 Global 1 km) data and national land cover data. By analyzing the temporal variation of crop residue burning and PM 2. 5 concentrations in Heilongjiang province, {{we found that the}} total number of crop residue <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> was not correlated with the variations of PM 2. 5 concentrations at a provincial (regional) scale. However, crop residue burning exerted notable influence on the variations of PM 2. 5 concentrations at a local scale. We experimented with a set of buffer zone radiuses to examine the influencing area of crop residue burning. The results suggest that the valid influencing area of crop residue burning was between 50 and 80 km. The mean PM 2. 5 concentration measured at stations close to crop residue <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> was more than 60 μg/m 3 higher than that measured at stations not close to crop residue <b>burning</b> <b>spots.</b> However, no consistent, significant correlation existed between the existence of crop residue <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> and local PM 2. 5 concentrations, indicating that local PM 2. 5 concentrations were influenced by a diversity of factors and not solely controlled by crop residue burning. This research also provides suggestions for better understanding the role of crop residue burning in local and regional air pollution...|$|R
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} not to touch {{the side of a}} plastic spottle with a hot knife when inhaling <b>spots,</b> as <b>burning</b> plastic gives off many toxic chemicals, {{including}} (in the case of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics) dioxin, a carcinogen. For this reason, many smokers prefer to use a glass bottle.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, any method {{can fail}} {{in the face}} of erratic or high-intensity winds and {{changing}} weather. Changing winds may cause fires to change direction and miss control lines. High-intensity winds may cause jumping or <b>spotting</b> as <b>burning</b> embers are carried through the air over a fireline. Burning trees may fall and burning materials may roll across the line, effectively negating the barrier.|$|R
50|$|In 1536, {{a strong}} and {{persistent}} belief in witchcraft led to the city's first witch-hunt. The {{need to find a}} scapegoat for calamities such as the Black Plague, which claimed 2,000 area residents (25% of the city population) in 1564, led to an escalation in witch-hunting that reached its peak in 1599. A plaque on the old city wall marks the <b>spot</b> where <b>burnings</b> were carried out.|$|R

Indeed, while Theodora delayed Percy with cautions, impatience, and the fear of being disappointed, were colouring each sunken cheek with a <b>spot</b> of <b>burning</b> red, the hands were shaking uncontrollably, and the breath was shorter than ever, so that she was on the point of going to hasten the visitor, when he knocked at the door.|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Brooks that a smothered exclamation {{of some sort}} broke from Lord Arranmore's tightly {{compressed}} lips, but his face was so completely in the shadow that its expression was lost. But he himself now revealed it, for touching a knob in the wall a shower of electric lamps suddenly glowed around the room. He leaned forward and looked intently {{into the face of}} the girl who had become his accuser. She met his gaze coldly, without flinching, the pallor of her cheeks relieved by a single <b>spot</b> of <b>burning</b> colour, her eyes bright with purpose.|$|R
60|$|She {{left him}} and swept from the room, a <b>spot</b> of colour <b>burning</b> in her cheeks, her eyes lit with fire. The pride of her race had {{asserted}} itself. She felt {{no longer any}} fear. She only desired to sever herself at once and completely from all association with this man. In the hall she sent for her maid.|$|R

Oskanian leads a suicide cult, {{for those who do}} not want to die in enemy hands, given the Turks' {{reputation}} for violent reprisals. The little teacher refuses to jump off a cliff, after fending off the last of his followers. Soon after, he discovers the large Red Cross distress flag, the Armenians flew to attract Allied ships and sights the French cruiser [...] in the fog. It had diverted course after its watch <b>spotted</b> the <b>burning</b> of the Armenian camp on Musa Dagh. As Oskanian waves the flag, the warship begins shelling the coast. Soon more ships come. The Turks withdraw and the Armenians are rescued.|$|R
40|$|Backscattered {{scanning}} {{electron micrograph}} and ultra small- and small-angle neutron scattering data have been combined to provide statistically meaningful {{data on the}} pore/grain structure and pore evolution of combustion metamorphic complexes from the Hatrurim basin, Israel. Three processes, anti-sintering roughening, alteration of protolith (dehydration, decarbonation, and oxidation) and crystallization of high-temperature minerals, occurred simultaneously, leading to significant changes in observed pore/grain structures. Pore structures in the protoliths, and in low- and high-grade metamorphic rocks show surface (D-s) and mass (D-m) pore fractal geometries with gradual increases in both Ds and Dm values {{as a function of}} metamorphic grade. This suggests that increases in pore volume and formation of less branching pore networks are accompanied by a roughening of pore/grain interfaces. Additionally, pore evolution during combustion metamorphism is also characterized by reduced contributions from small-scale pores to the cumulative porosity in the high-grade rocks. At high temperatures, small-scale pores may be preferentially closed by the formation of high-temperature minerals, producing a rougher morphology with increasing temperature. Alternatively, large-scale pores may develop at the expense of small-scale pores. These observations (pore fractal geometry and cumulative porosity) indicate that the evolution of pore/grain structures is correlated with the growth of high-temperature phases and is a consequence of the energy balance between pore/grain surface energy and energy arising from heterogeneous phase contacts. The apparent pore volume density further suggests that the localized time/temperature development of the high-grade Hatrurim rocks is not simply an extension of that of the low-grade rocks. The former likely represents the "hot <b>spots</b> (<b>burning</b> foci) " in the overall metamorphic terrain while the latter may represent contact aureoles. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|MacRae {{lived in}} Inverness and {{was married to}} Gordon MacRae, though the couple were separated. She had two sons, 9-year-old Gordon and 3-year-old Andrew. On Friday November 12, 1976, MacRae left her home in Cradlehall with both her sons. She dropped her elder son Gordon at her estranged husband's house and turned south on to the A9 in the {{direction}} of Perth to visit her sister in Kilmarnock. Neither MacRae nor her son Andrew have ever been seen again. Later the same night, 12 miles away, a train driver <b>spotted</b> MacRae's <b>burning</b> BMW car in an isolated lay-by. When the police reached the vehicle, it was charred and empty, apart from a rug stained with blood matching MacRae's blood type.|$|R
60|$|But how {{tranquil}} {{the wide}} lagoon, which mirrored the <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> in heaven! Deep down into its innermost heart penetrated the slanting rays of Hesperus like {{a shaft of}} light, sunk far into mysterious Golcondas, where myriad gnomes seemed toiling. Soon a light breeze rippled the water, and the shaft was seen no more. But the moon's bright wake was still revealed: a silver track, tipping every wave-crest in its course, till each seemed a pearly, scroll-prowed nautilus, buoyant with some elfin crew.|$|R

But Dorothy led the way upstairs, a <b>spot</b> of colour <b>burning</b> each of her cheeks. The stream of guests had been arrested until the hall was packed, and the curious were peering over the rail above.|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 February 1942, Jacob Jones {{departed}} New York harbor and steamed southward along the New Jersey coast to patrol and search the area between Barnegat Light and Five Fathom Bank. Shortly after her departure, she received orders to concentrate her patrol activity in waters off Cape May and the Delaware Capes. At 1530 she <b>spotted</b> the <b>burning</b> wreckage of tanker R. P. Resor, torpedoed the previous day east of Barnegat Light; Jones circled the ship for two hours searching for survivors before resuming her southward course. Cruising at a steady 15 knots through calm seas, she last reported her position at 2000 and then commenced radio silence. A full moon lit the night sky and visibility was good; throughout the night the ship, completely darkened without running or navigation lights showing, kept her southward course.|$|R
60|$|Darnley shuffled forward. His {{handsome}} face was pale {{save for the}} two <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> upon his cheekbones, and his eyes glittered feveredly. He had been drinking, so much was clear; {{and that he should}} seek the Queen thus, who so seldom sought her sober, angered those intimates who had come to share her well-founded dislike of him. King though he might be in name, into such contempt was he fallen that not one of them rose in deference, whilst Mary herself watched his approach with hostile, mistrusting eyes.|$|R

They begin to discuss the staffing problems stemming from the suspension of Bolander and Felton, and Giardello reveals that Russert's affair with Felton is common knowledge in the squad. They begin to argue, but they are interrupted by news of another arson attack. When Pembleton, Bayliss and Kellerman arrive at the scene, they are told that a body has been <b>spotted</b> inside the <b>burning</b> building, and Kellerman admits that Pembleton's theory about Landry's death may have been right.|$|R
60|$|The man withdrew {{with the}} note, and Felix crossed {{the hall and}} entered a small room nearly opposite. It was luxuriously {{furnished}} with easy chairs and divans; there were cigars, and cigarettes, and decanters upon a round table. Felix took note of none of these things, nor did he sit down. He stood with his hands behind him, looking steadily into the fire. His cheeks were almost livid, save for a single <b>spot</b> of <b>burning</b> colour high up on his cheek-bone. His fingers twitched nervously, his eyes were dry and restlessly bright. He was evidently {{in a state of}} great excitement. In less than two minutes the door opened, and a tall, distinguished-looking man, grey headed, but with a moustache still almost black, came softly into the room. His breast glittered with orders, and he was in full Court dress. He nodded kindly to the young man, who greeted him with respect.|$|R

After a thrilling all night chase, the new sail is found merely to be a Danish ship, and having no bones to pick {{with any of the}} world but Yankee vessels, Semmes lays off. The CSS Alabama returns to Corvo Island for the usual prisoner debarking, and the Weathergauge is put to the torch on September 10.|$|R
40|$|This work is an {{assessment}} of the degradation ofthe horizontal visibility in the city of Corumbá and its relationship with biomass <b>burning</b> <b>spots</b> derived by satellite A VHRR data. The studied area had approximately 10. 000 m 2 around the observation point. Observations were made from July to September (1998 - 99) between 1300 and 1600 local time. The results indicate a relatively poor overall correlation between the spots and the visibility degradation, except for certain sectors of the selected area. This was linked to effects of local versus long distant sources of biomass burning products. Pages: 3067 - 307...|$|R
5000|$|On September 8, 1934, {{the cruise}} ship SS Morro Castle caught fire off Long Beach Island {{as she was}} {{returning}} to New York from Havana. After the Morro Castle could no longer sail under her own power, the Coast Guard cutter Tampa attempted to tow the damaged ship from eight miles (13 km) {{off the coast of}} Sea Girt to New York. However, rough seas from a nor'easter snapped the tow lines, and the Morro Castle drifted toward shore. WCAP radio announcer Tom Burley was broadcasting from the station's Convention Hall studios on the second floor promenade at about 7:30 p.m. when he first <b>spotted</b> the <b>burning</b> hulk of the ship approaching the beach. As the wire services already knew about the disaster, which had started early that morning, Burley led off his newscast with a straight update about the Morro Castle.
