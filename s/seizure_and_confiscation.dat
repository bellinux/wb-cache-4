50|$|The {{official}} reception finally {{occurred on}} February 24, 1812. Poinsett {{was the first}} accredited agent of a foreign government to reach Chile. Poinsett’s main adversary in Chile was the junta of Peru. The Colonial Viceroy of Peru resented the Chileans’ disregard for Spanish authority. He declared {{the laws of the}} new Chilean government relative to free commerce null and void and sent privateers to enforce the old colonial system. <b>Seizure</b> of ships <b>and</b> <b>confiscation</b> of cargoes followed, to the dismay of foreign traders, especially Americans. Poinsett learned of the seizure of an American whaler searching for supplies from an intercepted letter from the governor of San Carlos de Chiloe to the viceroy of Lima. Furthermore, he received intelligence that ten other American vessels were seized at Talcahuano in the Bay of Concepción. With little guidance from the Madison administration, Poinsett decided that {{something had to be done}} to halt violations of American neutral rights.|$|R

The meeting was an opportunity for participants to work on case examples and practical exercises in groups and to share best practices in identifying, seizing, confiscating and managing proceeds of crimes. The discussions were also enhanced by experts from Portugal, South Sudan, Brazil and France, each representing an ARIN-type regional network. A resolution of the ARIN-WA network was approved {{at the end of}} the meeting and the delegations of Ghana and Ivory Coast have volunteered to provide respectively the Presidency and the new network Secretariat, which will hold the next meeting in 2015.

40|$|Criminal {{organisations such as}} mafia and camorra build network between affiliates, {{politicians}} and individuals to rule in the territories. They use social ties and network to construct a social consent which allows them to operate, uncontested, {{in the production of}} illegal wealth for their members. Mosca and Villani (2011) show that in order to break the vicious circle between the social and cultural impoverishment and the strengthening of an economy sustained by crime it is necessary to utilize the same determinants of the social consent used by criminal organisations. The social and economic development of the territories created by promoting initiatives that favour the accumulation of “pure” social capital such us those sustained by social economy can avoid criminal organizations to continue to gain the consent of {{a large part of the}} population living in the territories in which they operate. These strategies seem to be in action in some Italian regions promoted by social cooperatives that the law n. 109 / 1996 and the recent antimafia code (d. lgs n. 159 / 2011) recognise such as productive nonprofit organisation able to reuse illegal assets for social purposes. In Campania thanks also to the recent regional law for the reuse of illegal assets L. R. n. 7 / 2012 and a particular model of welfare promoted by the art. 46 of L. R. n. 1, illegal assets confiscated to criminal organisation represent inputs of a local development process based on the reconversion of the social capital used by mafia into a “pure” social capital useful for legal economic activities. The number of reutilised illegal assets can be a proxy of a process of independence from criminal organisation that can signal the force of the territory to faith it. The paper using the available data intends to show that the <b>seizure</b> <b>and</b> the <b>confiscation</b> of the illegal acquired assets, and suitable policies aimed at promoting and supporting the development of social cooperatives and non-profit organizations such us social cooperatives, which assume an important role in the labor market, can have a direct impact on the individuals’ choices, reducing the incentive for illegal activity...|$|R
