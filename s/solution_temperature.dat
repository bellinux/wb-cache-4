The <b>solution</b> <b>temperature</b> is then lowered to below 10°C. Solubility of ammonium chloride is higher than that of sodium chloride at 30°C and lower at 10°C. Due to this temperature-dependent solubility difference and the common-ion effect, ammonium chloride is precipitated in a sodium chloride solution.|$|E

25|$|Methylcellulose (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical <b>solution</b> <b>temperature</b> (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of polymer-polymer miscibility in the solid amorphous state are reviewed. The polymers include homopolymers and both random and block copolymers. Although present theoretical treatments of polymer-polymer miscibility all contain the random mixing hypothesis and are thus not applicable to mixtures that involve specific interactions between the components, most of the observed singlephase polymer-polymer mixtures involve hydrogen-bonding or other specific interactions between the components. Even {{in the absence of}} specific interactions, the composition of a random copolymer can often be tailored to provide miscibility with a particular homopolyner. Many polymer-polymer mixtures have lower critical <b>solution</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and a small number of such mixtures have given indications of upper critical <b>solution</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The special phenomena that may be observed when other polymers are mixed with block copolymers are discussed...|$|R
