5000|$|Austin also {{pioneered the}} design of the modern tennis racquet by inventing the 'Streamline' - a racquet with a shaft that splits into three {{segments}} - allowing for aerodynamic movement. [...] The design was manufactured by Hazells and at the time was mocked in the press for looking like a snow shoe. After Austin's retirement, the design was virtually forgotten until the reintroduction of the <b>split</b> <b>shaft</b> in the late 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|In archery, a [...] "Robin Hood" [...] is {{the term}} used for an arrow <b>splitting</b> the <b>shaft</b> of an arrow already in the target.|$|R
25|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socketed tang, or inserted into a <b>split</b> in the <b>shaft</b> and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. Split-shaft construction involves <b>splitting</b> the arrow <b>shaft</b> lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a ferrule, sinew, or wire.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer <b>shaft)</b> <b>split</b> into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two <b>split</b> axle <b>shafts.</b> The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "Sandwich" [...] type <b>split</b> <b>shaft</b> unit {{is mounted}} between engine and {{transmission}} and used on road maintenance vehicles, fire fighting vehicles and off-road vehicles. This unit gets the drive {{directly from the}} engine shaft and can be capable of delivering up to the complete engine power to the PTO. Usually these units come with their own lubricating system. Due to the sandwich mounting style the gearbox will be {{moved away from the}} engine requiring the driveline to accommodate the installation.|$|E
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional PTO output shaft. This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} <b>split</b> <b>shaft</b> PTO gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} no {{pressure}} available to operate the ram, the steering wheel will mechanically move the rack directly but with significant play through a <b>split</b> <b>shaft.</b> One side from the steering wheel drives a pin which mates with a slot on the output shaft connected to the rack. The free play in this emergency mechanical system {{is necessary for the}} normal play free pressure operated Diravi system to operate its feedback control loop. In practice this heavy & inaccurate manual steering character of Diravi is only required when the hydraulic system has failed, whence emergency system prioritisation firstly sacrifices the steering system. Added NOTE: The mechanical unpowered steering effort is very heavy. Driving the car without power to the steering should be used only to guide the car to a safe place to stop. Attempting to turn the steering wheel without power when the car is not moving may break the steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|Arrowheads may be {{attached}} to the shaft with a cap, a socket tang, or inserted into a <b>split</b> in the <b>shaft</b> and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. In medieval Europe, arrowheads were often anchored with nothing but candlewax minutes before firing, if not merely saliva - this ensured that the head would remain in enemy's body if the shaft was pulled out. Split-shaft construction involves <b>splitting</b> the arrow <b>shaft</b> lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using ferrule, sinew, rope, or wire.|$|R

The PV-PQ bus type switching strategy [24] should be implemented if the reactive power injection of PV bus violates the limits.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} Part A and {{discusses}} the hardware involved in gas turbines {{as well as}} operations and maintenance aspects pertinent to cogeneration plants. Different categories of gas turbines are reviewed such as heavy duty aeroderivative, single and <b>split</b> <b>shaft.</b> The {{pros and cons of}} different types are reviewed. Gas turbine component types - axial and centrifugal compressors and different turbine types, along with combustor types will be discussed. Important considerations during machine specifications are also reviewed. Practical aspects such as coatings, materials, fuel handling and auxiliary systems will also be highlighted. Operations and maintenance aspects including Preventative Maintenance, Repairs, Fuel and Air Filtration, Compressor Washing and Reliability is discussed. Typical operating and maintenance costs are provided. This paper presents an extensive bibliography to enable readers to follow up any topic in detail...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of space experiments with previous missions shows a common theme. Some {{of the recent}} experiments {{are based on the}} scientific fundamentals of instruments of prior years. However, the main distinguishing characteristic is the embodiment of advances in engineering and manufacturing in order to extract clearer and sharper images and extend the limits of measurement. One area of importance to future missions is providing vibration free observation platforms at acceptable costs. It has been shown by researchers that vibration problems cannot be eliminated by passive isolation techniques alone. Therefore, various organizations have conducted {{research in the area of}} combining active and passive vibration control techniques. The essence of this paper is to present progress in what is believed to be a new concept in this arena. It is based on the notion that if one active element in a vibration transmission path can provide a reasonable vibration attenuation, two active elements in series may provide more control options and better results. The paper presents the functions of a modular <b>split</b> <b>shaft</b> linear actuator developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and University of Massachusetts Lowell. It discusses some of the control possibilities facilitated by the device. Some preliminary findings and problems are also discussed...|$|E
50|$|Oscar rivets {{are similar}} to blind rivets in {{appearance}} and installation, but have splits (typically three) along the hollow <b>shaft.</b> These <b>splits</b> cause the <b>shaft</b> to fold and flare out (similar to the wings on a toggle bolt's nut) as the mandrel is drawn into the rivet. This flare (or flange) provides a wide bearing surface that reduces the chance of rivet pull-out. This design is ideal for high vibration applications where the back surface is inaccessible.|$|R
50|$|The G63 AMG 6×6 {{features}} six-wheel drive {{running on}} 5.5L, 536-hp, 561-lb-ft twin-turbo DOHC 32-valve V-8 AMG engine. The G63 AMG 6×6 was fitted with Mercedes' 7G-tronic seven-speed automatic transmission; its transfer case can alter between a 0.87:1 high-range ratio for on-road driving and 2.16:1 low-range ratio for off-road conditions to all six wheels in a nominal 30:40:30 <b>split.</b> An extra <b>shaft</b> delivers {{power to the}} rearmost axle. The vehicle had five electronic differential locks, which can deliver 100% lockup of all six wheels, operated by three switches on the dashboard.|$|R
40|$|Background: Hip {{arthroplasty}} is {{the most}} commonly performed adult reconstructive hip procedure. Not all the patients have extensive deformities of both the femoral head and acetabulum, for which a dual-assembly total hip prosthesis is required. The bipolar arthroplasty as used today has rather specific indications; but a young patient with an avascular head is considered the best candidate. Method: Thirty five bipolar arthroplasties were performed in 29 patients using Talwalkar&#x 2032;s bipolar prosthesis for non-infective hip arthritis and the patients were evaluated using Harris Hip Score. Twenty four hips in 21 patients (mean age = 36. 17 years) could be followed up for inclusion in this study. Results: At an average follow up of 3. 5 years, HHS on an average increased by 43. 50; from preoperative 39. 58 to post-operative 83. 08. Good-to-excellent results were obtained in 19 (excellent- 11; good- 8) hips. Anterior thigh pain, hip pain, deep infection, longitudinal <b>split</b> of femoral <b>shaft</b> and death was seen in one case each. Conclusion: We conclude that bipolar arthroplasty is a simple, reliable, viable and a cost-effective; primary surgical treatment modality in non-infective hip arthritis for young to middle aged patients, especially in our scenario where funds for the operative procedure, prosthesis as well as adequate infrastructure for the hospital are, by and large, limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} assessment of some advanced Stirling engine component concepts are presented. High performance piston rings, reciprocating oil scrapers and heat pipes with getters and with mechanical couplings were tested. The tests yielded the following results: (1) Bonded, split, pumping piston rings, in preliminary testing, proved a promising concept, exhibiting low leakage and friction losses. Solid piston rings proved impractical in view of their sensitivity to the operating temperature; (2) A babbit oil scraper in a compliant housing performed well in atmospheric endurance testing. In pressurized tests the scraper did not perform well as a containment seal. The latter tests suggest modifications which may adapt Ti successfully to that application; and (3) Heat pipe endurance tests indicated the adequacy of simple, inexpensive fabrication and filling procedures. Getters were provided to increase the tolerance of the heat pipes {{to the presence of}} air and commercially available couplings were demonstrated to be suitable for heat pipe application. In addition to the above tests, the program also included a design effort for a <b>split</b> <b>shaft</b> applicable to a swashplate driven engine with a pressurized crank-case. The design is aimed, and does accomplish, an increase in component life to more than 10, 000 hours...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of an unusually complex and regionally unique bone artefact in a Late Pleistocene archaeological assemblage (c. 35 ka [thousands of years ago]) {{from the site of}} Matja Kuru 2 on the island of Timor, in Wallacea. The artefact is interpreted as the broken butt of a formerly hafted projectile point, and it preserves evidence of a complex hafting mechanism including insertion into a shaped or <b>split</b> <b>shaft,</b> a complex pattern of binding including lateral stabilization of the cordage within a bilateral series of notches, and the application of mastic at several stages in the hafting process. The artefact provides the earliest direct evidence for the use of this combination of hafting technologies in the wider region of Southeast Asia, Wallacea, Melanesia and Australasia, and is morphologically unparallelled in deposits of any age. By contrast, it bears a close morphological resemblance to certain bone artefacts from the Middle Stone Age of Africa and South Asia. Examination of ethnographic projectile technology from the region of Melanesia and Australasia shows that all of the technological elements observed in the Matja Kuru 2 artefact were in use historically in the region, including the unusual feature of bilateral notching to stabilize a hafted point. This artefact challenges the notion that complex bone-working and hafting technologies were a relatively late innovation {{in this part of the}} world. Moreover, its regional uniqueness encourages us to abandon the perception of bone artefacts as a discrete class of material culture, and to adopt a new interpretative framework in which they are treated as manifestations of a more general class of artefacts that more typically were produced on perishable raw materials including wood...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about folding an {{ergonomic}} stall fork shaft in the middle. Reason for the folding {{of the shaft}} is partly a customer wish but the main reason is {{the high cost of}} shipping. The cost of shipping will be relatively low if the package size is kept below the size of which the shipping company recommends. If you want to transport a package that is larger than the recommend size, the shipping cost well rise drastically. In this case, the cost of a package with size of one meter is deemed to be a profitable shipping cost. The problem is that the total length of the entire stall fork is 1. 5 meters, which increases the shipping cost by about 100 SEK per package. Therefore, the stall fork must be folded in the middle to become cheaper to ship. The task is to get on a good and inexpensive solution to a clutch mechanism that allows customers to very easily and simply connect the two shafts together. Because of the shaft being ergonomic, it reduces physical abrasion damages and therefore is the main selling argument. That’s why it is very important not to bring any changes to the ergonomic design or, in worst case, as little as possible. The result was a coupling out of a polymer material that divides the shaft approximately from the middle, has a low weight and is easy for the consumer to assemble the two parts of the shaft. The work was carried out by studies of different couplings {{to be able to come}} up with a number of different proposals for <b>splitting</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> Furthermore were different materials closely examined and manufacturing methods that the coupling can be manufactured by. The result was a prototype of coupling out of a polymeric material that divides the shaft approximately in the middle, has a low weight and is easy for the consumer to assemble the two shaft halves. The coupling consists of parts, male, female and a core in the middle to make the link robust...|$|R
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one <b>split</b> second, a <b>shaft</b> of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|R
