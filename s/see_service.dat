5|$|Two {{submarine}} tenders were {{operated by}} the KJRM, one was converted from a German-built water tanker obtained from the Austro-Hungarians, {{and the other was}} a British commercial vessel converted to the role at the time British-built submarines were acquired. The latter ship was captured by the Italians in April 1941 but survived the war to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> in the post-war Yugoslav Navy.|$|E
5|$|Velebit (pennant number P-01) was a {{modified}} Una-class midget submarine {{and the only}} submarine to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> with the Croatian Navy. It was built for the Yugoslav Navy during the 1980s where it was named Soča. At {{the outbreak of the}} Croatian War of Independence Soča was being overhauled in the Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata division of Brodosplit shipyard in Split, Croatia. Although stripped of all equipment, it was preserved from the retreating Yugoslav forces by the shipyard workers.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, she was {{assigned}} {{to serve as a}} flotilla leader for torpedo boats. She participated in only one major action, Operation Albion, in October 1917. There, she shelled Russian gun batteries and troop positions and engaged Russian destroyers and gunboats. The ship also led a successful, albeit minor, operation against British shipping in the North Sea in December 1917. After the end of the war, she was interned {{with the rest of the}} German fleet in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, the interned fleet scuttled itself, though Emden was run aground by British ships before she could sink completely. Ceded to France in the Treaty of Versailles, she was too badly damaged by the attempted scuttling and beaching to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> with the French Navy, so was instead used as a target after 1922, and broken up for scrap in 1926.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Nürnberg {{was seized}} by the Royal Navy and {{ultimately}} awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to Tallinn, where she was renamed Admiral Makarov. She served in the Soviet Navy, first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt. Her ultimate fate is unclear, but by 1960, she had been broken up for scrap. Nürnberg was the second-largest warship of the Kriegsmarine to survive the war intact, after the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen, and she was the only vessel to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> after the war, albeit in a foreign navy.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{continued}} to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> in the Greek fleet {{until the early}} 1930s, with Kilkis serving as the flagship of the fleet. In 1932, Lemnos was disarmed and used as a barracks ship, and Kilkis {{was reduced to a}} training ship. Lemnos was used as a barracks ship after 1937, and Kilkis became a floating battery at Salamis Naval Base in 1940. During the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis. German Ju-87 Stuka dive-bombers bombed both ships in the harbor; Kilkis was sunk outright while Lemnos was beached to avoid sinking. Both ships were broken up {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|By 1909, {{the bulk}} of the castle was {{considered}} obsolete and the War Office transferred it to the Office of Works, who carried out restoration work and opened it to visitors. It reentered service during the First World War, equipped with two quick-firing guns to protect the harbour, but they did not <b>see</b> <b>service</b> during the conflict. After the war, the castle was restored and leased to the town, who again opened it to visitors. Between 1940 and 1943, during the Second World War, it was rearmed with two 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) quick-firing guns, dating from the First World War and housed in concrete gun houses, to protect merchant convoys and the Philips' shipyard. The castle was manned by members of the British Army; officers lived in a nearby cottage, non-commissioned officers in the castle itself, and other ranks in the 19th century fortifications, and later in temporary Nissen huts.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{served with}} the Mediterranean Fleet after a brief stint in the Channel Fleet. In 1905, she resumed service with a now re-organised Channel Fleet and was {{also part of the}} Atlantic Fleet for a time. In the service of the Home Fleet from 1907, she was placed in reserve in 1912. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Caesar returned to the Channel Fleet before being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in 1915 after a brief spell as a guard ship at Gibraltar. From 1918 to 1919 she served as a depot ship, firstly in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and then the Black Sea, in support of naval operations against the Bolsheviks. In this latter role, she was the last of the pre-dreadnought battleships to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> outside the United Kingdom. Returning to England in 1920, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, {{the crew}} {{returned}} to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day. The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; {{together with the}} ship's crew, {{they went on to}} <b>see</b> <b>service</b> in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck. All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry Götzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the Königsberg-Abteilung (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 would <b>see</b> <b>service</b> until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Jaguars did not <b>see</b> <b>service</b> in the 2003 Iraq War; {{they had}} been planned to operate from bases in Turkey, {{to the north of}} Iraq, but Turkey refused access to its airbases and the {{northern}} attack was cancelled. Demands by the UK Treasury to cut the defence budget led to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailing plans on 21July2004 to withdraw the Jaguar by 2007. An expected date of October 2007 for the out of service date was brought forward at just five days notice to 30 April 2007. On 20December2007, a Jaguar operated by Qinetiq undertook the last ever British military Jaguar flight.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Minsk in August 1941, Himmler {{witnessed}} an Einsatzgruppen mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care. He also decided a transition {{should be made to}} gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders. Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> by all four main Einsatzgruppen from 1942. However, the gas vans were not popular with the Einsatzkommandos, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma. Some of the early mass killings at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide gas.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{developed}} its own landing craft. Development of an Australian {{version of}} the Landing Craft Assault, the ALCV (Australian Landing Craft, Vehicle), {{was carried out by}} Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company. Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River. The initial version, known as the ALCV I was found to be too small, so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed. An Australian {{version of the}} Landing Craft Mechanized, the ALCM, was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong. Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing craft, so the ALCV III, an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity, was produced. The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs, a type of similar capacity to an American Landing Craft Tank, with five Ford V8 engines. Only four were delivered {{before the end of the}} war, but they arrived in time to <b>see</b> <b>service</b> in New Guinea.|$|E
