40|$|A {{teething}} {{device for}} exercising gums and deciduous teeth. Two hollow receptacles <b>sealingly</b> mate {{to form a}} body of the teething device. A plurality of hollow knobs extend outwardly from the receptacles. The hollow interior of each knob is in a fluid communication with the interior space of the teething device. The teething device may be filled with a cold liquid to cool the exterior surfaces of the knobs. The liquid may be periodically discarded, and the hollow interior of the teething device may be refilled with a liquid of a predetermined temperature...|$|E
40|$|An annular {{culture vessel}} for growing {{mammalian}} cells is constructed in a one piece integral and annular configuration {{with an open}} end which is closed by an endcap. The culture vessel is rotatable about a horizontal axis by use of conventional roller systems commonly used in culture laboratories. The end wall of the endcap has tapered access ports to frictionally and <b>sealingly</b> receive the ends of hypodermic syringes. The syringes permit the introduction of fresh nutrient and withdrawal of spent nutrients. The walls are made of conventional polymeric cell culture material and are subjected to neutron bombardment to form minute gas permeable perforations in the walls...|$|E
40|$|A magnetorheological device {{comprising}} {{a housing}} having a divider {{within the housing}} is disclosed and claimed. A rotary impeller having two paddles is rotatably mounted within the housing. The rotary impeller <b>sealingly</b> engages the divider and the paddles {{in combination with the}} divider forms a first chamber and a second chamber. Magnetorheological fluid resides in the chambers and a passageway interconnects the first and second chambers. A coil surrounds a portion of the passageway such that when energized the magnetorheological fluid solidifies plugging the passageway. As the impeller rotates, it pushes the incompressible fluid against the divider in the housing and the plug in the passageway and retards and/or stops the motion of the impeller...|$|E
40|$|A liquid-impermeable plate (10) having throughplate {{conductivity}} with essentially zero resistance comprises an insulator sheet (12) {{having a}} series of spaced perforations (14) each of which contains a metal element (16) <b>sealingly</b> received into the perforation (14). A low-cost plate can readily be manufactured by punching a thermoplastic sheet (40) such as polypropylene with a punching tool (52), filling the apertures with lead spheres (63) having a diameter smaller than the holes (50) but larger than {{the thickness of the}} sheet, sweeping excess spheres (62) off the sheet with a doctor blade (60) and then pressing a heated platen (74) onto the sheet to swage the spheres into a cylindrical shape and melt the surrounding resin to form a liquid-impermeable collar (4) sealing the metal into the sheet...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{thermography}} uses {{a housing}} configured for thermal, acoustic and infrared radiation shielding. For in-situ applications, the housing has an open side adapted to be <b>sealingly</b> coupled to a surface region of a structure such that an enclosed chamber filled with air is defined. One or more acoustic sources are positioned to direct acoustic waves {{through the air}} in the enclosed chamber and towards the surface region. To activate and control each acoustic source, a pulsed signal is applied thereto. An infrared imager focused on the surface region detects a thermal image of the surface region. A data capture device records the thermal image in synchronicity with each pulse of the pulsed signal such that a time series of thermal images is generated. For enhanced sensitivity and/or repeatability, sound and/or vibrations at the surface region can be used in feedback control of the pulsed signal applied to the acoustic sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a flat-bottomed vessel (1) for transporting persons or goods, the vessel comprising a drag reduction system {{attached to the}} bottom (2) of the vessel. The drag reduction system comprises: two or more turbulence members (3) extending perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the vessel for generating an area with turbulent flow downstream to the turbulence members {{at the bottom of}} the vessel during movement thereof, and for each turbulence member an air injector (6) adapted to inject an air flow at or near to the turbulence members. The drag reduction system further comprises a keel (4) adjacent to both sides of the turbulence members (3). The bottom of the vessel is flat without cavities and the turbulence members are ridges <b>sealingly</b> attached to the bottom of the vessel between the keels, and the turbulence members extend 2. 5 - 25 mm from the bottom of the vessel.

40|$|An {{inflatable}} module comprising {{a structural}} core and an inflatable shell, wherein the inflatable shell is <b>sealingly</b> {{attached to the}} structural core. In its launch configuration, the wall thickness of the inflatable shell is collapsed by vacuum. Also in this configuration, the inflatable shell is collapsed and efficiently folded around the structural core. Upon deployment, the wall thickness of the inflatable shell is inflated; whereby the inflatable shell itself, is thereby inflated around the structural core, defining therein a large enclosed volume. A plurality of removable shelves are arranged interior to the structural core in the launch configuration. The structural core also includes at least one longeron that, {{in conjunction with the}} shelves, primarily constitute the rigid, strong, and lightweight load-bearing structure of the module during launch. The removable shelves are detachable from their arrangement in the launch configuration so that, when the module is in its deployed configuration and launch loads no longer exist, the shelves can be rearranged to provide a module interior arrangement suitable for human habitation and work. In the preferred embodiment, to provide efficiency in structural load paths and attachments, the shape of the inflatable shell is a cylinder with semi-toroidal ends...|$|E
40|$|There is {{provided}} an assembly having a light guiding medium sealed to a holder. Preferably the holder is a metal shell {{and a light}} guiding medium is an optical fiber of glass or sapphire whisker.
