Sensory simulation on ground using advanced stereo graphics is supposed to predict the sensor based path refinement on board, while realtime fusion of stereo images and laser range information helps to predict the motion of floating objects to be grasped. The telesensorprogramming concept is explained as well as the learning schemes involved...|$|E

One wants to learn about the geometric parameters of the task and segment the total motion executed by the human into subtasks for the robot that can each be executed with simple compliant motion task specifications. The motion of the human demonstration tool is sensed with a 3 D camera, and the interaction with the environment is sensed with a force sensor in the human demonstration tool. Both measurements are uncertain, and do not give direct information about the geometric parameters of the contacting surfaces, or about the contact formations encountered during the human demonstration. The paper uses a Bayesian Sequential Monte Carlo method (also known as a particle filter) to do the simultaneous estimation of the contact formation (discrete information) and the geometric parameters (continuous information). The simultaneous contact formation segmentation and the geometric parameter estimation are helped by the availability of a contact state graph of all possible contact formations. The presented approach applies to all compliant motion tasks involving polyhedral objects with a known geometry, where the uncertain geometric parameters are the poses of the objects. This work improves {{the state of the art}} by scaling the contact estimation to all possible contacts, by presenting a prediction step based on the topological information of a contact state graph, and by presenting efficient algorithms that allow the estimation to operate in realtime. In real world experiments it is shown that the approach is able to discriminate in realtime between some 250 different contact formations in the graph.
