5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
25|$|She {{carefully}} ascribes {{the norms}} <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> {{those of the}} 'world' rather than herself, but steps back from challenging them, by advising her daughters {{of the dangers of}} being known for what you know.|$|E

50|$|Greer's Shakespeare and The Madwoman's Underclothes: Essays and Occasional Writings, a {{collection}} of articles written between 1968 and 1985, appeared in 1986. In 1989 came Daddy, We Hardly Knew You, a diary and travelogue about her father, whom <b>she</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> distant, weak and unaffectionate, which led to claims - which <b>she</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> inevitable - that in her writing she was projecting her relationship with him onto all other men.|$|R

25|$|The {{focus of}} hooks' writing {{has been the}} {{intersectionality}} of race, capitalism, and gender, and what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> their ability to produce and perpetuate systems of oppression and class domination. She has published over 30 books and numerous scholarly articles, appeared in documentary films, and participated in public lectures. She has addressed race, class, and gender in education, art, history, sexuality, mass media, and feminism.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{she made}} an {{estimated}} $500,000 on the speaking circuit, giving speeches on topics of modern conservatism, gay marriage, and what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the hypocrisy of modern American liberalism. During one appearance at the University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her. Coulter has, on occasion, in defense of her ideas, responded with inflammatory remarks toward hecklers and protestors who attend her speeches.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 {{with her}} husband Kevin Danaher and Kirsten Moller, Benjamin co-founded the San Francisco-based Global Exchange, which advocates fair trade {{alternatives}} to what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> corporate globalization.

25|$|In her own kitchen, {{she uses}} a KitchenAid mixer which <b>she</b> <b>{{describes}}</b> <b>as</b> {{being the one}} gadget she could not live without. She has always had an AGA cooker, and used to run cooking courses for AGA users.

25|$|Dayna Mellanby, {{played by}} Josette Simon (series 3–4). The {{daughter}} of former dissident Hal Mellanby, Dayna {{is an expert}} in weapons technology. She is adept at designing mechanized weapons, but also appreciates the nobility of what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> more 'primitive' combat. Brave and loyal, but at times reckless and naïve, she often successfully challenges men who are supposedly accomplished fighters. Her vendetta against Servalan (who murdered her father) motivates her to endorse Avon's fighting of the Federation.|$|E
25|$|While at Yale, Horn {{also began}} her drawing practice, which <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> “absolutely {{essential}} to me, although {{not to my}} viewer. My drawing was always about my relationship to it, not the audience’s.” Produced from the 1980s onwards, her drawings are collage-like blots of pigment applied to sometimes torn and (once again) diagrammatically pieced-together sheets of paper. Small markings – words and numbers – track the work’s progression built up with the recomposing of the image. In the 1990s, Horn's drawings grew in scale.|$|E

She is also a film aficionado, watching all kinds of movies but with a particular affinity for action films, conspiracy movies, movies starring her father, and movies with happy endings. Poe is a tennis player and also has a black belt in taekwondo, having competed in tournaments while in high school.|$|E
25|$|Her {{winning streak}} {{continued}} into the 2000 season, despite Pérec's return to the track. Freeman was the home favourite for the 400 m title at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, where she was expected to face-off with rival Pérec. This showdown never happened, as Pérec left the Games after what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> harassment from strangers. Freeman won the Olympic title {{in a time of}} 49.11 seconds, becoming only the second Australian Aboriginal Olympic champion (the first was Freeman's 4x400 teammate Nova Peris-Kneebone who won for field hockey 4 years earlier in Atlanta). After the race, Freeman took a victory lap, carrying both the Aboriginal and Australian flags. This was despite the fact that unofficial flags are banned at the Olympic Games and the Aboriginal flag, while recognised as official in Australia, is not a national flag, nor recognised by the International Olympic Committee. Freeman also made the final of the 200 m, coming sixth. In honour of her gold medal win in Sydney, she represented Oceania in carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremonies of the next Olympics, in Salt Lake City, joining Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Africa), John Glenn (The Americas), Kazuyoshi Funaki (Asia), Lech Wałęsa (Europe), Jean-Michel Cousteau (Environment), Jean-Claude Killy (Sport), and Steven Spielberg (Culture).|$|E
500|$|She has {{categorized}} the album's {{sound as}} punk-hop, which <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> Eurythmics-influenced [...] "modern, poppy, spooky music" [...] {{and stated that}} [...] "there's a mysterious, after-midnight vibe to [...] that's extremely visceral".|$|E

5000|$|Minnis's {{work was}} <b>described</b> <b>as</b> expressing a [...] "gurlesque" [...] {{aesthetic}} by Arielle Greenberg, which <b>she</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a feminine, feminist incorporating of the grotesque and cruel with the spangled and dreamy." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} SubGenius writers have {{authored}} stories {{to build their}} mythology, which have been compiled and published. Their core texts are disordered, presented {{in the style of}} a collage. Kirby notes that the group's texts are a bricolage of cultural artifacts, which is then remixed into a new creation. In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "web of references".|$|E
500|$|Dürer {{would have}} been aware of Hans Pleydenwurff's {{portrait}} of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "highly detailed representation of [...] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation".|$|E
500|$|Babbit made a {{conscious}} effort to cast people of color for minor roles, in an effort to combat what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "racism at every level of making movies." [...] From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph (Dante Basco) and Andre (Douglas Spain) to be African American, Asian and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered Arsenio Hall for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role. As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of drag.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{addresses}} her text to the middle-class, which <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "most natural state", and in {{many ways}} the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world. It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.|$|E
500|$|In July 2015, Bad Boy Entertainment artist Gizzle {{told the}} press that she is collaborating with Combs on what <b>she</b> <b>{{describes}}</b> <b>as</b> his last album, titled No Way Out 2, a sequel to his 1997 debut. She describes the music as unique: [...] "The mindset is to just be classic and to be epic. And to really live up to that... we know it's a tall order, but we welcome the challenge." [...] In April 2016, Combs announced that after this last album and tour, he plans to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.|$|E
500|$|Shelley differentiates her travel {{book from}} others by {{presenting}} her material from what <b>she</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a political point of view". In so doing, she challenges the early nineteenth-century convention {{that it was}} improper for women to write about politics, following {{in the tradition of}} her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lady Morgan. Shelley's aim was to arouse sympathy in England for Italian revolutionaries, such as Gatteschi. She rails against the imperial rule of Austria and France over Italy and criticises the domination of the Catholic Church. She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness and a desire for freedom.|$|E
