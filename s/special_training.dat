5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No <b>special</b> <b>training</b> was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E

While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.|$|E

They reported the road surface around the tracks was crumbling, raising further safety problems. In response, TiE promised to carry out repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund <b>special</b> <b>training</b> for cyclists., but the repairs were insufficient: in 2017, a woman was crushed to death by a passing bus when her bicycle wheel {{was caught in the}} tracks. Further {{safety concerns}} were raised by residents along the routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, and some property owners refused permission for cables to be attached.|$|E
5|$|Each police {{district}} may dictate that operational personnel {{have a higher}} amount of training, for instance 80 hours is required in Oslo. Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each {{police district}}, consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of <b>special</b> <b>training</b> per year. Higher levels are required for body-guard service (55 officers) and the Emergency Response Union (73 officers).

Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs' performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog-food to increase their range. During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either <b>special</b> <b>training</b> or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it was a slow and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{sought to}} {{dominate}} {{the internal affairs of}} countries that bordered it. During the war, Stalin had created <b>special</b> <b>training</b> centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control. Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties. Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.|$|E

5|$|With its {{unprecedented}} budget, IRIS {{was able}} to pioneer several firsts for Korean television dramas, particularly with its large scale action sequences. Throughout filming, the actors were often responsible for filming their own stunts and action sequences, including Lee Byung-hun jumping from the 130 meter-tall Tamagawa Dam in Semboku, Akita. To prepare for the demanding physical requirements of the series, {{several members of the}} primary cast, including Kim Tae-hee, underwent <b>special</b> <b>training</b> to lend authenticity to the action. During a break in filming, Lee Byung-hun appeared at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in support of the production in May.

5|$|Prior to the mission, Muc's {{soldiers}} had undergone {{nine months of}} <b>special</b> <b>training,</b> mainly focused on mountain fighting techniques and jungle operations. They also conducted physical conditioning, to improve their physical fitness and stamina to undertake operations in the most extreme conditions on Laotian territory. On 18December1967, following their intensive training, soldiers of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion launched {{the first phase of}} their operation by conducting terrain reconnaissance and watching activities on Lima Site 85 to learn their opponent's routines. As part of the second phase, commenced on 22 January 1968, six North Vietnamese sappers were sent out to climb Phou Pha Thi Mountain, in order to pinpoint opposing positions in and around Lima Site 85, as well as routes of withdrawal. On 28February1968, the North Vietnamese Special Forces completed their preparations, and they began marching towards their assembly point on 1March.|$|E
5|$|With Antón {{focusing}} on the Vuelta a España, Sánchez led the squad sent to the Tour de France. Team manager Igor González de Galdeano said that a stage win was an important objective, having come very close to one with Sánchez in the 2010 Tour de France, only to have him lose a two-up sprint to Andy Schleck. He also hoped Sánchez would finish in the top three. With the stage 2 team time trial presenting such a clear detriment to Sánchez' overall hopes, the team gathered for a <b>special</b> <b>training</b> session about two weeks prior to the Tour to focus solely on that discipline. Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Velasco, Urtasun, Izagirre, and Rubén and Alan Pérez were also named to the squad.|$|E
