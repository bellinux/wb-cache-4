5|$|<b>Spherical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E

25|$|In <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> {{every point}} in space is {{represented}} by its distance ρ from the origin, the angle θ its projection on the xy-plane makes {{with respect to the}} horizontal axis, and the angle φ that it makes with respect to the z-axis.

25|$|There are {{two common}} methods for {{extending}} the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the cylindrical coordinate system, a z-coordinate {{with the same}} meaning as in Cartesian coordinates {{is added to the}} r and θ polar coordinates giving a triple (r,θ,z). <b>Spherical</b> <b>coordinates</b> take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (r,z) to polar coordinates (ρ,φ) giving a triple (ρ,θ,φ).|$|E

25|$|The spherical {{harmonics}} {{turn out to}} be critical to practical solutions of Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> such as are used for mapping the sky, can be simplified, using the method of separation of variables into a radial part, depending solely on distance from the centre point, and an angular or spherical part. The solution to the spherical part of the equation can be expressed as a series of Laplace's {{spherical harmonics}}, simplifying practical computation.|$|E
25|$|If {{an insect}} wing is rigid, for example, a Drosophila wing is {{approximately}} so, its motion {{relative to a}} fixed body can be described by three variables: {{the position of the}} tip in <b>spherical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> (Θ(t),Φ(t)), and the pitching angle ψ(t), about the axis connecting the root and the tip. To estimate the aerodynamic forces based on blade-element analysis, it is also necessary to determine the angle of attack (α). The typical angle of attack at 70% wingspan ranges from 25° to 45° in hovering insects (15° in hummingbirds). Despite the wealth of data available for many insects, relatively few experiments report the time variation of α during a stroke. They include wind tunnel experiments of a tethered locust and a tethered fly, and free hovering flight of a fruit fly.|$|E
