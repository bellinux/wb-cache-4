40|$|We {{examine the}} use (and non-use) of list price {{information}} {{in the process of}} marketing commercial real estate. While housing market research suggests that list prices can serve as a strong anchor and/or <b>signal,</b> <b>list</b> price information is included in less than one-third of the commercial property sales and is less likely to be included as part of the sellers’ offering information for larger and more complex properties. Given the potentially powerful effect of list prices (first offers) on outcomes, the non-use of list price information is a puzzle. We speculate that the limited use of list prices {{may be due to the}} sellers’ interests in both maintaining their informational advantage and not truncating higher than expected offers, especially during periods of economic growth or with more complex properties. Using a two-stage selection correction model, we find that office properties which provide list price information are, on average, associated with lower price outcomes (ceteris paribus) and that these outcomes vary by price cohort and economic condition. It is important to note, however, that while these findings identify a correlation, they do not necessarily imply causation. Our results support the notion that asymmetric information and information signaling play a dominant role in explaining the sellers’ strategic non-use of list price {{information in the}} commercial real estate market and that the signaling effect is more pronounced in higher priced properties and during periods of strong economic growth...|$|E

40|$|The System Identification (SysID) Rack is a {{real-time}} hardware-in-the-loop {{data acquisition}} (DAQ) and control instrument rack {{that was designed}} and built to support inlet testing in the NASA Glenn Research Center 10 - by 10 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel. This instrument rack is used to support experiments on the Combined-Cycle Engine Large-Scale Inlet for Mode Transition Experiment (CCE LIMX). The CCELIMX is a testbed for an integrated dual flow-path inlet configuration with the two flow paths in an over-and-under arrangement such that the high-speed flow path is located below the lowspeed flow path. The CCELIMX includes multiple actuators {{that are designed to}} redirect airflow from one flow path to the other; this action is referred to as "inlet mode transition. " Multiple phases of experiments have been planned to support research that investigates inlet mode transition: inlet characterization (Phase- 1) and system identification (Phase- 2). The SysID Rack hardware design met the following requirements to support Phase- 1 and Phase- 2 experiments: safely and effectively move multiple actuators individually or synchronously; sample and save effector control and position sensor feedback signals; automate control of actuator positioning based on a mode transition schedule; sample and save pressure sensor signals; and perform DAQ and control processes operating at 2. 5 KHz. This document describes the hardware components used to build the SysID Rack including their function, specifications, and system interface. Furthermore, provided in this document are a SysID Rack effectors <b>signal</b> <b>list</b> (signal flow); system identification experiment setup; illustrations indicating a typical SysID Rack experiment; and a SysID Rack performance overview for Phase- 1 and Phase- 2 experiments.

Signals were primitive and rather ad hoc ("As soon as the Admiral shall loose his fore-top and fire a gun..."), and generally a one-way communication system, as only flagships carried a complete set of flags. In 1790 Admiral Lord Howe issued a new signal book for a numerary system using numeral flags to signal a number; the number, not the mast from which the flags flew, indicated the message. Other admirals tried various systems; it was not until 1799 that the Admiralty issued a standardized signal code system for the entire Royal Navy. This was limited to only the <b>signals</b> <b>listed</b> in the Signal-Book. In 1800 Captain Sir Home Popham devised a means of extending this: signals made with a special [...] "Telegraph" [...] flag refererred to a separate dictionary of numbered words and phrases.
