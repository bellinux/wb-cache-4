5|$|Matsumoto Castle has a {{virtually}} square foundation. Each level is slightly {{smaller than the}} one below but maintains the <b>same</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|E
5|$|A regular {{tessellation}} is {{a highly}} symmetric, edge-to-edge tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the <b>same</b> <b>shape.</b> There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the east}} wing is well-preserved, it has {{undergone}} many changes and its initial appearance is unknown. The wing has two levels overlooking the courtyard retaining their arcades (now glassed-in), {{which are the}} <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> {{as those in the}} south wing. The southeast end of the wing contained a kitchen (with a well) and a large pantry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the physics}} literature, the <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> {{are known as}} the {{paperclip}} model.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} spontoon-style axes. These used the <b>same</b> <b>shaped</b> blades {{mounted on the}} side of the weapon, and had a shorter handle.|$|R
25|$|The coptic churches {{maintained}} {{the tradition of}} being built in the <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> as older churches yet it is noticeable that modern Coptic churches are in general bigger than older ones.|$|R
5|$|During the Late Pleistocene, {{the more}} southerly {{occurring}} dire wolf (Canis dirus) had the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but the dire wolf subspecies C.dirusguildayi {{is estimated to}} have weighed on average , and the subspecies C.dirusdirus on average , with some specimens being larger. The dire wolf was heavier than the Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.|$|E
5|$|Shape {{has been}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category. Infants assume that objects that have the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> also share a name. Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and inappropriate extensions.|$|E
5|$|Built with a {{range of}} shops to both sides, the modernist design of the {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of a}} double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the <b>same</b> <b>shape.</b> The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E
50|$|Some of the vowels and consonants {{have the}} <b>same</b> <b>shapes,</b> {{but they are}} {{distinguishable}} from their context, as vowels are always written {{from the bottom up}} and consonants from the top down.|$|R
25|$|There are no lower or {{upper case}} letters, {{but the first}} letter of a proper name was often written a bit larger. Though the Unicode {{standard}} has upper and lowercase letters, which are <b>same</b> <b>shaped,</b> the difference is only their size.|$|R
50|$|He also starts {{using the}} <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> {{to develop a}} {{personal}} drawing language using iron wire, culminating in an exhibition in Brussels (Ouvrons les ateliers) where a 10 by 4-meter boat made out of hundreds of smaller iron wire boat shapes is displayed.|$|R
5|$|For the Royal Air Force, Proud had caves {{dug into}} the sides of a wadi to hide two of the Hurricanes. The third was hidden in a hole beside the runway, the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> as the {{aircraft}}, and covered by a lid and some tents. Dummy aircraft and hangars were constructed to draw fire; these were marked as real on marked-up air photographs captured with a Luftwaffe airman. The aircraft all survived the siege, important both for air defence and for maintaining {{the morale of the}} defending troops.|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Series 5 {{began on}} 27 September 1997 {{and saw a}} number of changes, the biggest saw the white set {{replaced}} with a new one which maintained the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> and layout, but was curvier and larger which coincided with the show moving into the larger Studio 6. This series also saw the introduction of Ben Ward, Richard Webb and Gerard Foster (known as Ben, Gez & Rich) of The Cheese Shop {{who took over the}} comedy from 'Trev and Simon'. With them came new sketches including The Staffroom which featured the three of them portray school teachers Mr Wazzock (Foster), Mr Moody (Ward) and Mr Slack (Webb). They also created a fictitious 60s pop group called The Krazees and even created a song called We're So Crazy even though it was never released.|$|E
50|$|The Black Ops soldiers' {{equipment}} are nearly {{equivalent to the}} HECU's, e.g. assault rifles and turrets. They also have the <b>same</b> <b>shaped</b> vehicles such as military vans and attack helicopters but black in color. They {{are the only ones}} that use Glock pistols (Glock 17 type).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known tokens {{are those}} from two {{sites in the}} Zagros region of Iran: Tepe Asiab and Ganj-i-Dareh Tepe. Schemandt-Besserat was able to work {{back in time and}} saw the <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> from cuneiform to pictographs to these tokens. Most of these tokens have no translation though.|$|R
50|$|Typically, a bi-level image {{consists}} {{mainly of}} {{a large amount of}} textual and halftone data, in which the <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> appear repeatedly. The bi-level image is segmented into three regions: text, halftone, and generic regions. Each region is coded differently and the coding methodologies are described in the following passage.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations {{have given}} rise to many types of tiling puzzle, from {{traditional}} jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the rep-tile, a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the <b>same</b> <b>shape.</b> Inspired by Gardner's articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. Squaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square (one whose sides have integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is squaring the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the <b>same</b> <b>shape,</b> length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store the energy, and would break before full draw.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, all coins were {{redesigned}} {{to feature}} Aung San on the obverse and were all changed in composition to aluminium. Furthermore, the coins were slightly reduced in size. However, they retained the <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> and overall {{appearance of the}} previous series of coins. These were circulated until being discontinued in 1983.|$|R

5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E

5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

25|$|Materials are {{important}} as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts {{the flow of}} water more than a clean pipe of the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> and size. Similarly, electrons can flow freely and easily through a copper wire, but cannot flow as easily through a steel wire of the <b>same</b> <b>shape</b> and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an insulator like rubber, regardless of its shape. The difference between copper, steel, and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and electron configuration, and is quantified by a property called resistivity.|$|E

50|$|These weren’t {{the only}} pre-Code gowns in America that {{departed}} from black. Hampden-Sydney started using gray gowns in 1893, and the University of the South approved gowns for its higher {{degrees in the}} <b>same</b> <b>shapes</b> and colors of Oxford. However, since the university at the time conferred only honorary master’s and doctoral degrees, it’s unknown if anyone ever wore the Oxford-style gowns.|$|R
