40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} packet chaining, {{a simple}} and effective method to increase allocator matching efficiency and hence network performance, particularly suited to networks with short packets and short cycle times. Packet chaining operates by chaining packets destined to the same output together, to reuse the <b>switch</b> <b>connection</b> of a departing packet. This allows an allocator to build up an efficient matching {{over a number of}} cycles, like incremental allocation, but not limited by packet length. For a 64 -node 2 D mesh at maximum injection rate and with single-flit packets, packet chaining increases network throughput by 15 % compared to a conventional single-iteration separable iSLIP allocator, outperforms a wavefront allocator, and gives comparable throughput with an augmenting paths allocator. Packet chaining achieves this performance with a cycle time comparable to a single-iteration separable allocator. Packet chaining also reduces average network latency by 22. 5 % compared to iSLIP. Finally, packet chaining increases IPC up to 46 % (16 % average) for application benchmarks because short packets are critical in a typical cache-coherent CMP. These are considerable improvements given the maturity of network-on-chip routers and allocators. Index Terms—On-chip interconnection networks, Interconnection architecture...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{systematically}} review {{risks of}} mechanical impact on peri-implant strain and prosthetic influence on stability across finite element studies. Material and Methods: An online literature search {{was performed on}} MEDLINE and EMBASE databases published between 2011 and 2016. Following keywords tiered screening and selection of the title, abstract and full-text were performed. Studies of finite element analysis (FEA) were considered for inclusion that were written in English and revealed stress concentrations or strain at peri-implant bone level. Results: There were included 20 FEA studies in total. Data were organized according to the following topics: bone layers, type of bone, osseointegration level, bone level, design of implant, diameter and length of implant, implant-abutment connection, type of supra-construction, loading axis, measurement units. The stress or strain at implant-bone contact was measured over all studies and numerical values estimated. Risks of overloading were accented as non-axial loading, misfits, cantilevers and the stability of peri-implant bone was related with the usage of platform <b>switch</b> <b>connection</b> of abutment. Conclusions: Peri-implant area could be affected by non-axial loading, cantilever prosthetic elements, crown/implant ratio, type of implant-abutment connection, misfits, properties of restoration materials and antagonistic tooth.

Results of these studies are comparable with other findings of in vitro, in vivo, prospective and retrospective studies...|$|E

Therefore, SSL protocol {{is more and more}} widely used in a variety of network services. But the SSL protocol itself is not perfect, in practice, there are also problems. For the deficiencies of endpoint authentication in the SSL handshake process, the paper analyzes two kinds of defects existing in the SSL hand-shake process. Firstly, handshake process, in the first stage of the SSL connection, using plaintexts, existing the possibility of being monitored and tampered. Secondly, SSL deployment of the actual application. Because of considering the factors about the performance of the network connection, that usually uses the way of <b>switch</b> <b>connection</b> based on HTTP protocol. In response to these deficiencies, this thesis adopts the two ways of forged certificates and converting the data stream from HTTPS to HTTP to attack them. In addition, a new attack mode against the data stream of HTTPS is designed and implemented. Experiments show that the above three methods cause significant security risks to HTTPS communications. Therefore, taking a static ARP table, enhanced certificate mechanism and mutual authentication of three different measures are proposed to enhance network security in the paper. It is shown that three ways can relative effectively defense against attacks on HTTPS in the experiments...|$|E

40|$|The 74 CBTLV 16211 {{provides}} a dual 12 -bit high-speed bus switch with separate output enable inputs (1 OE, 2 OE). The low on-state {{resistance of the}} switch allows connections to be made with minimal propagation delay. The switch is disabled (high-impedance OFF-state) when the output enable (nOE) input is HIGH. To ensure the high-impedance OFF-state during power-up or power-down, 1 OE and 2 OE should be tied to the VCC through a pull-up resistor. The minimum value of the resistor {{is determined by the}} current-sinking capability of the driver. Schmitt trigger action at control input makes the circuit tolerant to slower input rise and fall times across the entire VCC range from 2. 3 V to 3. 6 V. This device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using IOFF. The IOFF circuitry disables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the device when it is powered down. 2.

40|$|An N x N delta network, {{constructed}} from B x B crossbar switches, consists of (log(, 2) N) /(log(, 2) B) stages with N/B switches in each stage (N and B are integer powers of 2). The outputs of the switches in each stage, except the last, {{are connected to}} the inputs of the switches in the next stage by the Perfect Shuffle connection or one of its variants. When two or more packets arriving at different inputs of the switch must be forwarded to the same output, only one of these packets is forwarded and the rest are blocked. In buffered delta networks each switch has finite capacity buffers to store the blocked packets. Switches of unbuffered delta networks have no buffers and blocked packets are lost. In a single-stage shuffle-exchange network, a single stage of switches performs the function of all the stages of a delta network by using feedback paths provided from the outputs of this stage back to its inputs. The throughput of unbuffered delta networks is known to be the solution of a quadratic recurrence relation. Fairly tight lower and upper bounds on the solution of this recurrence relation are derived in this thesis. These bounds have a simple functional form. Throughput of unbuffered delta networks can be improved either by replacing each link of the simple delta networks by parallel links, or by combining multiple delta subnetworks in parallel. The improvements in performance obtained by these modifications are compared. The throughput of networks with four parallel links is almost equal to the throughput of crossbars. These modifications can also be applied to buffered delta networks to increase their throughput. It is shown that the throughput of buffered delta networks can also be increased substantially by modifying the structure and operation of their crossbar switches. The use of parallel links for each <b>switch</b> <b>connection</b> results in the highest throughput improvement. Three new switch structures are proposed for single-stage shuffle-exchange networks. These switches use extra buffers to enhance performance and avoid the possibility of deadlocks...|$|E
