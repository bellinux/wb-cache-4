50|$|There {{are many}} types and {{finishes}} of <b>springform</b> <b>pans.</b> While {{the most common}} bottom is smooth, bottoms can also be waffled or glass.|$|R
25|$|Cake tins (or cake pans in the US) include square pans, round pans, and {{speciality}} pans such as angel food cake <b>pans</b> and <b>springform</b> <b>pans</b> {{often used}} for baking cheesecake. Another type of cake pan is a muffin tin, which can hold multiple smaller cakes.|$|R
50|$|Timbale pans can {{be large}} (such as {{that used to}} bake a panettone), or they can be small enough to be single-portion (like a tartlet pan). Timbales {{typically}} narrow toward the bottom. Bundt pans, angelfood cake <b>pans,</b> and <b>springform</b> <b>pans</b> can be substituted for purpose-made timbale bakeware.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring latch}} (in {{this case a}} over-center-latch) is used to hold {{the walls of a}} <b>Springform</b> <b>pan</b> in place.|$|E
50|$|Tortes are {{commonly}} baked in a <b>springform</b> <b>pan.</b> A torte {{may be made}} with bizcochuelo base or with little to no flour, but instead with ground nuts or breadcrumbs, as well as sugar, eggs, and flavorings. It can be covered with meringue and almonds.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> is the nine-inch round. However, small {{circular}} pans are common along with squares, rectangles, and hearts. They {{come in a}} variety of materials including anodized aluminum, heavy-gauge steel, and glass. Optional features include a non-stick surface and a waterproofing seal around the base.|$|E
50|$|Although most cheesecakes are {{baked in}} a water bath, {{this does not mean}} that <b>springform</b> <b>pans</b> are {{waterproof}} around the base. Many may be waterproof initially. However, as the latch loosens and the coating wears off this waterproof feature will fade. For this reason many will wrap the pan in aluminum foil.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{all modern}} cheesecakes in the United States and Canada use cream cheese; in Italy, cheesecakes use ricotta and mascarpone; [...] Germany, the [...] Netherlands, and [...] Poland use quark. Cheesecakes are most easily baked in a {{leak-proof}} <b>springform</b> <b>pan,</b> often {{paired with a}} water bath to more evenly distribute the heat. Because of the high density of most cheesecakes, they continue baking for some time after removal from an oven.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, cheesecake is {{made from}} cream cheese, eggs, and egg yolks to add a {{richness}} and a smooth consistency. It is baked in a special 13 to 15 cm tall <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> in many restaurants. Some recipes use cottage cheese and lemon for distinct texture and flavor or add a drizzle of chocolate or strawberry sauce to the basic recipe. A list of some variations of cheesecakes in the US is below: ...|$|E
50|$|This pan {{is used to}} bake {{dishes that}} cannot be easily {{inverted}} for removal from the pan. Some {{of the most common}} recipes to call for springform pans are cheesecakes and tortes. The easy removal of the sides from a <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> lends itself to dishes with delicate bottom layers such as the graham cracker crumb crusts commonly constructed for cheesecakes. Springform pans, however, are also used in the preparation of pizzas, quiches, and frozen desserts.|$|E
5000|$|The dish is {{prepared}} in a dome or <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> and eggs or cheese {{are used as}} a binder. [...] Rice is commonly used as an ingredient in Emilia-Romagna, where the dish {{is referred to as}} a bomba and baked with a filling of pigeon or other game bird, peas, local cheese and a base of dried pasta. CrÃªpes are used as a base in Abruzzo, and other regions use ravioli or gnocchi. In Sicily, it's typically made with pasta and eggplant.|$|E
50|$|Frieling is {{well known}} for The Perfect Beaker (a {{measuring}} device), their Handle-It Glass Bottom <b>Springform</b> <b>Pan,</b> the Flow Glass Carafe (Best new product of the International Hotel/Motel & Restaurant Show NYC 2009), the Eleganza dishwasher safe insulated server, and their famous line of 4 different size stainless steel French Presses. Durgol Express and Durgol Swiss Espresso have become the market leader in countries around the world as one of the fastest (5-10 times faster than other brands) environmentally friendly decalcifier on the market.|$|E
50|$|A <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> {{is a type}} of {{bakeware}} {{that features}} sides that can be removed from the base. Springform refers to the construction style of this pan. The base and the sides are separate pieces that are held together when the base is aligned with a groove that rings the bottom of the walls. The pan is then secured by a latch on the exterior of the wall. This tightens the 'belt' that becomes the walls of the pan and secures the base into the groove {{at the base of the}} walls.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{there is}} a related {{confection}} called a checkerboard cake named because, as with a Battenberg cake, when it is sliced open it resembles the board for the game draughts, known in the U.S. as [...] "checkers", which is played on a [...] "checkerboard". A typical checkerboard cake is one that alternates between vanilla and chocolate flavoured sponge cake and has a very rich chocolate buttercream icing. Unlike the British Battenberg, it does not typically use marzipan and utilizes a special <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> to get the desired effect.|$|E
50|$|Some falsely {{believe that}} an Italian crust torta is a {{combination}} of layered cheeses and tomatoes to be spread onto bread. Italian torta is a pie similar to quiche and served as a brunch item. However, torta is different than quiche as the crust is mostly made of cheese, not egg. The crust can also be made from pizza dough. Ingredients vary as there are many variations of this torta. Traditional Italian torta usually includes ricotta cheese, parmesan, parsley, and onion. There are also variations that contain meat and some that are completely vegetarian. These vegetarian torte sometimes contain artichokes and spices for flavor. This torta is made in a <b>springform</b> <b>pan</b> instead of a traditional pie pan.|$|E
