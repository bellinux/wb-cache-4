5000|$|In 1952, UC Berkeley and {{subsequent}} UC San Diego SIO physicist Hugh Bradner, {{who is considered}} to be the original inventor and [...] "father of the modern wetsuit," [...] had the insight that a thin layer of trapped water could be tolerated between the <b>suit</b> <b>fabric</b> and the skin, so long as insulation was present in the fabric in the form of trapped bubbles. In this case, the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way. In the popular mind, the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation. But as his letter notes, Dr. Bradner clearly understood the suit {{did not need to be}} wet because it isn't the water that provides the insulation but rather the gas in the <b>suit</b> <b>fabric.</b> He initially sent his ideas to Lauriston C. [...] "Larry" [...] Marshall. Marshall was involved in a U.S. Navy/National Research Council Panel on Underwater Swimmers. However, it was Willard Bascom, an engineer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who suggested neoprene as a feasible material to Bradner.|$|E

40|$|Many {{polymeric}} materials used for thermal protection and insulation on spacecraft degrade significantly under prolonged bombardment by ionospheric atomic oxygen. The covering {{fabric of the}} multilayered shuttle space suit is composed of a loose weave of GORE-TEX fibers, Nomex and Kevlar- 29, which are all {{polymeric materials}}. The complete evaluation of <b>suit</b> <b>fabric</b> degradation from ionospheric atomic oxygen is of importance in reevaluating suit lifetime and inspection procedures. The mass loss and visible physical changes of each test sample was determined. Kapton control samples and data from previous asher and flight tests were used to scale the results to reflect ionospheric conditions at about 220 km altitude. It is predicted that the orthofabric loses mass in the ionosphere {{at a rate of}} about 66 % of the original orthofabric mass/yr. The outer layer of the two-layer orthofabric test samples shows few easily visible signs of degradation, even when observed at 440 X. It is concluded that the orthofabric could suffer significant loss of performance after much less than a year of total exposure time, while the degradation might be undetectable in post flight visual examinations of space suits...|$|E

40|$|There are two space {{suits in}} current usage within the space program: EMU [2] and Orlan-M Space Suit. The Shuttle space suit {{components}} are discussed elsewhere [2, 5, 6] {{and serve as}} a guide to development of the current model. The present model is somewhat simplified in details which are considered to be second order in their effects on exposures. A more systematic approach is ongoing on a part-by-part basis with the most important ones in terms of exposure contributions being addressed first with detailed studies of the relatively thin space <b>suit</b> <b>fabric</b> as the first example. Additional studies to validate the model of the head coverings (bubble, helmet, visors [...] .) will be undertaken in the near future. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the details of the model as it is now and to examine its impact on estimates of astronaut health risks. In this respect, the nonuniform distribution of mass of the space suit provides increased shielding in some directions and some organs.

40|$|Operational self {{contained}} atmospheric protective ensembles (SCAPE suits) and fabric from the suits {{were subjected to}} a series of tests designed to determine the amount of exposure a wearer of the suit would receive if a spill of the hypergolic oxidizer nitrogen tetroxide (N 2 O 4) should occur nearby. The results of these tests show that a wearer of a "stock" SCAPE suit equipped with a standard liquid air pack, if exposed to a spill resulting in a 26 percent increase of oxidizer in the surrounding atmosphere, will experiment no detectable concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) inside the suit for 15 minutes. Thereafter, the NO 2 concentration within the suit will increase for 35 minutes at a rate of 0. 07 ppm per minute and then at a gradually decreasing rate until an equilibrium concentration of 3. 4 ppm is attained after 100 minutes. Momentary increases of as much as 1. 6 ppm can be expected if the wearer were to rise quickly from a squatting position, but the additional NO 2 would be dissipated within three minutes.

40|$|Block Party: {{contemporary}} craft {{inspired by}} {{the art of the}} tailor, is a new touring exhibition from the Crafts Council curated by Lucy Orta - Professor of Art, Fashion and the Environment at London College of Fashion, and renowned visual artist whose own practice fuses fashion, art and architecture. Block Party explores the alchemy of the centuries-old skill of tailoring by presenting work by 15 UK and international artists who push pattern-cutting beyond the fashion garment. The artists Lucy Orta has selected take pattern-cutting as a starting point to produce sculpture, ceramics, textile, moving image and collage. Through experimentation the artists have found new ways to assemble pattern shapes, not to create garments but to manipulate shape to realise new outcomes. Block Party focuses on three themes; Storytelling, Embracing the Future, and Motif and Manipulation. In Storytelling artists use pattern-cutting as a means of expression. Turner Prize-nominated Yinka Shonibare MBE presents a child mannequin, dressed in a historically accurate Victorian outfit crafted from African fabric to reference culture, race and history. Claudia Losi’s 24 m whale made of woollen <b>suit</b> <b>fabric</b> was transported around the world to stimulate discussion and storytelling before being deconstructed and transformed into jackets in collaboration with fashion designer Antonio Marras. In Embracing the Future existing pattern-cutting methods are manipulated and challenged through the use of innovative processes and technologies. Simon Thorogood’s patterns are created using digital programmes whilst Philip Delamore of the Fashion Digital Studio at London College of Fashion seeks to apply the latest developments in 3 D digital design to the garment making process. In Motif and Manipulation the beauty of the paper pattern block is the visual inspiration. Ceramist Charlotte Hodes directly incorporates these familiar shapes into her ceramics whilst Raw Edges re-appropriate the use of a pattern block by creating a flat paper pattern of a chair which is then filled with expandable foam to create the 3 D ‘Tailored Wood Bench’...|$|E
40|$|Many {{previous}} {{studies showed that}} seam appearance as well as performance depends on the interrelationship of fabrics, threads, and the stitch/seam selection and lastly on the sewing conditions, which include the needle size, needle thread tension, stitch density, and the appropriate operation and maintenance of the sewing machine. Present investigation elucidates the effect of blend composition, sewing thread size, and sewing needle parameters on garment seam characteristics (i. e., seam strength, seam strength efficiency, seam puckering, seam stiffness, and drape coefficient). The seam quality characterization is studied through the L 9 orthogonal design methodology. In good quality apparels, compatibility of the seams with the functional requirement {{is very important for}} serviceability and life of the apparel. Reversibility as well as repairing of seams in the apparel is very limited in the condition of seam failure. Seam strength efficiency is higher for the uniform fiber matrix in the structure of fabrics. The polyester dominated <b>suiting</b> <b>fabrics</b> give minimum seam stiffness because polyester component has low flexural rigidity.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the fabric parameters, as independent variables, and the comfort related properties, as dependent variables, of commercial <b>suiting</b> <b>fabrics,</b> containing both natural and man-made fibres, have been studied. The fabric parameters measured {{in the study were}} mass, thickness, density, and air permeability. The comfort related properties, tested on a Permetest instrument, included water vapour permeability, water vapour resistance, and thermal resistance, with the moisture permeability index being derived. A total of 26 commercial <b>suiting</b> <b>fabrics,</b> covering a wide range of mass, as well as different fibre types and blends and fabric structures, was tested. The fibres covered, included wool, polyester, viscose, and cotton, while the fabric structures covered were 1 x 1 plain weave, 2 x 1 twill and 2 x 2 twill weave. The objectives of this study were to determine the empirical relationships between the measured fabric properties and the measured comfort related properties, and to determine the role, if any, of fibre type and fabric structure, since many claims are made in practice concerning the relative advantages, in terms of comfort, of a specific fibre type or blend, or fabric structure, over others, some of which being supported by research results. Since the fabrics covered, were commercial and were not engineered so that the different fabric parameters (independent variables) and fibre type and blend, as well as fabric structure could be varied independently of each other, the effects of the various fabric parameters on the fabric comfort related properties were determined and quantified by multiple regression analyses (multi-linear and multi-quadratic), and the best fit regression equations, and contribution of each parameter to the overall fit established. It was found that fabric thickness and fabric mass had the largest effect on the comfort related properties as measured here, fabric mass determining, to a large extent, water vapour permeability, and fabric thickness, thermal resistance. The rest of the fabric parameters included in the study had only a relatively small effect on the measured comfort related properties. The influence of fabric parameters, with particular reference to mass and thickness, on the measured comfort related properties, were much greater than that of fibre type or blend, or fabric structure.
