5|$|Despite {{the ferocity}} of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where Rheinland refueled and re-armed. Meanwhile, her three sisters <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the roadstead in defensive positions. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired thirty-five 28cm (11in) shells and twenty-six 15cm (5.9in) rounds. The two hits from Black Prince had killed 10 men and wounded 20. Repair work followed immediately in Wilhelmshaven and was completed by 10 June.|$|E

He had confined his efforts to jumps, hurdles and shot-puts, but now added pole vaulting, javelin, discus, hammer and 56lb weight. In the Olympic trials held at Celtic Park in New York, his all-round ability <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> all these events and so he riveted a claim to {{a place on the}} team that went to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E

5|$|The show {{takes place}} at the fictional Greendale Community College in Greendale, Colorado. Harmon based the show on his own {{experiences}} in community college, and partly modeled the character of Jeff Winger on himself. He emphasized the cast's importance to the show, and also credited some of the actors for their improvisational skills. The episode attracted generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised both the actors and the comedy writing. The show received good viewership, and <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> NBC's Thursday lineup, where the network's other shows suffered declines in ratings.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{competed in}} the Diva Search in 2004, {{deciding}} to enter the contest after seeing an advertisement while watching Raw.

She <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the contest by giving fellow contestant Carmella DeCesare the finger after being eliminated from the contest. Maria began making appearances in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), WWE's then-developmental territory. She contributed booking ideas, and her work at OVW earned her a spot on the Raw brand roster. Maria was brought on to Raw as a ditzy backstage interviewer and the host of WWE KissCam in November 2004. Her gimmick involved her asking wrong questions, irritating and amusing the roster.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> people's minds as unique, a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising internal standards. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late notice. It was decided that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E

25|$|Keynesian ideas also {{attracted}} considerable criticism {{in this time}} period. While from late 2008 to early 2010 there was broad consensus among international leaders concerning the need for coordinated stimulus, the German administration initially <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> their reluctance to fully embrace Keynesian policy. In December 2008, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück of Germany criticised Gordon Brown's advocacy of Keynesian stimulus, saying “The switch from decades of supply-side politics {{all the way to}} a crass Keynesianism is breathtaking.” However, by the end of January 2009 Germany had announced a second stimulus plan which, relative to GDP, was larger than Britain's.|$|E
