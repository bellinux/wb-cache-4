[...] Next, since 80% of payday borrowers will roll their loan over at least one time [...] because their income prevents them from paying the principal within the repayment period, they often report turning to friends or family members to help repay the loan [...] according to a 2012 report from the Center for Financial Services Innovation.

6000|$|During {{a portion}} {{of the first half of}} the present century, and more {{particularly}} during the latter part of it, there flourished and practised in the city of New York a physician who enjoyed perhaps an exceptional share of the consideration which, in the United States, has always been bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical profession. This profession in America has constantly been held in honour, and more successfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to the epithet of [...] "liberal." [...] In a country in which, to play a social part, you must either earn your income or make believe that you earn it, the healing art has appeared in a high degree to combine two recognised <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> It belongs to the realm of the practical, which in the United States is a great recommendation; and it is touched by the light of science--a merit appreciated in a community in which the love of knowledge has not always been accompanied by leisure and opportunity. It was an element in Dr. Sloper's reputation that his learning and his skill were very evenly balanced; he was what you might call a scholarly doctor, and yet there was nothing abstract in his remedies--he always ordered you to take something. Though he was felt to be extremely thorough, he was not uncomfortably theoretic, and if he sometimes explained matters rather more minutely than might seem of use to the patient, he never went so far (like some practitioners one has heard of) as to trust to the explanation alone, but always left behind him an inscrutable prescription. There were some doctors that left the prescription without offering any explanation at all; and he did not belong to that class either, which was, after all, the most vulgar. It will be seen that I am describing a clever man; and this is really the reason why Dr. Sloper had become a local celebrity. At the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him, he was some fifty years of age, and his popularity was at its height. He was very witty, and he passed in the best society of New York for a man of the world--which, indeed, he was, in a very sufficient degree. I hasten to add, to anticipate possible misconception, that he was not the least of a charlatan. He was a thoroughly honest man--honest in a degree of which he had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the complete measure; and, putting aside the great good-nature of the circle in which he practised, which was rather fond of boasting that it possessed the [...] "brightest" [...] doctor in the country, he daily justified his claim to the talents attributed to him by the popular voice. He was an observer, even a philosopher, and to be bright was so natural to him, and (as the popular voice said) came so easily, that he never aimed at mere effect, and had none of the little tricks and pretensions of second-rate reputations. It must be confessed that fortune had favoured him, and that he had found the path to prosperity very soft to his tread. He had married at the age of twenty-seven, for love, a very charming girl, Miss Catherine Harrington, of New York, who, in addition to her charms, had brought him a solid dowry. Mrs. Sloper was amiable, graceful, accomplished, elegant, and in 1820 she had been one of the pretty girls of the small but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and overlooked the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by the grassy waysides of Canal Street. Even at the age of twenty- seven Austin Sloper had made his mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly of his having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of high fashion, who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most charming eyes in the island of Manhattan. These eyes, and some of their accompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme satisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a very happy husband. The fact of his having married a rich woman made no difference in the line he had traced for himself, and he cultivated his profession with as definite a purpose as if he still had no other resources than his fraction of the modest patrimony which on his father's death he had shared with his brothers and sisters. This purpose had not been preponderantly to make money- -it had been rather to learn something and to do something. To learn something interesting, and to do something useful--this was, roughly speaking, the programme he had sketched, and of which the accident of his wife having an income appeared to him in no degree to modify the validity. He was fond of his practice, and of exercising a skill of which he was agreeably conscious, and it was so patent a truth that if he were not a doctor there was nothing else he could be, that a doctor he persisted in being, in the best possible conditions. Of course his easy domestic situation saved him a good deal of drudgery, and his wife's affiliation to the [...] "best people" [...] brought him a good many of those patients whose symptoms are, if not more interesting in themselves than those of the lower orders, at least more consistently displayed. He desired experience, and in the course of twenty years he got a great deal. It must be added that it came to him in some forms which, whatever might have been their intrinsic value, made it the reverse of welcome. His first child, a little boy of extraordinary promise, as the Doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasms, firmly believed, died at three years of age, in spite of everything that the mother's tenderness and the father's science could invent to save him. Two years later Mrs. Sloper gave birth to a second infant--an infant of a sex which rendered the poor child, to the Doctor's sense, an inadequate substitute for his lamented first- born, of whom he had promised himself to make an admirable man. The little girl was a disappointment; but this was not the worst. A week after her birth the young mother, who, as the phrase is, had been doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms, and before another week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a widower.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the recent}} {{concerns}} on financial inclusion have emanated {{from the results of}} the All-India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS), 2002. Over a period of 40 years, the share of non-institutional <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for cultivator households had declined sharply from about 93 per cent in 1951 to about 30 per cent in 1991, with the share of money lenders having declined from 69.7 per cent to 17.5 per cent. In 2002, the AIDIS revealed, however, that the share of money lenders had again increased to 27 per cent, while that of non-institutional sources overall rose to 39 per cent. In other words, notwithstanding the outreach of banking, the formal credit system {{has not been able to}} adequately penetrate the informal financial markets; rather it seems to have shrunk in some respects in recent years. Coincidentally, it is also true that the rate of agricultural growth during the last decade has slowed down and it is particularly striking in respect of foodgrains production. Since the green revolution, banks have been mainly focused on financing crop loans connected largely with food grains. There is, therefore, reason to believe that financial exclusion may actually have increased in the rural areas over the last 10-15 years.|$|E

50|$|These {{loans are}} {{typically}} short-term, {{and tend to}} carry higher interest rates than other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Lenders typically do not check the credit history of borrowers for these loans and only consider the value and condition of the vehicle {{that is being used}} to secure it.

40|$|The role {{of mental}} {{accounts}} in consumer credit decision making was investigated. First, in a conversation-based process-tracing study, 96 adults with experience <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{were presented with}} minimal descriptions <b>of</b> three instalment <b>credit</b> options in realistic consumer scenarios. They chose a credit option and a repayment plan, but before doing so could request further information. When choosing the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> participants usually sought and compared information on Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or total cost (TC), often using simple decision heuristics. When choosing repayment plans, they frequently asked about, and made trade-oVs between, monthly repayment amounts,TC, and loan duration. Second, in an independent groups experiment, TC and APR information were systematically varied. Participants chose from pairs of repayment plans conficting in loan duration and monthly repayment amount (ND 28). Although APR signifcantly infuenced choice, its effect was substantially moderated by TC information. It was concluded that: (i) although APR is an important attribute for <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> decisions, TC is more important for repayment plan decisions, since consumers often represent specific credit plans in terms of total mental accounts; (ii) recurrent budget period accounts are used to evaluate monthly repayments and anticipate future goals and hazards...|$|R
50|$|Before 1990 it {{was common}} to have subsidized <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for industries, mainly through the Bank of the Republic (Colombia's central bank), the Industrial Development Institute (Instituto de Fomento Industrial, or IFI), and the Export Promotion Fund (Fondo para la Promoci√≥n de las Exportaciones, or Proexpo).

50|$|Credit {{derivatives}} provide market signals {{regarding the}} risk of particular investments. For example, the cost of providing CDS protection for particular bonds is a signal regarding {{the risk of}} those bonds. CDS also allow particular credit risks to be hedged, as an entity can purchase protection from many <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk, much like an insurance policy. While total notional value related to CDS are enormous (estimated between $25-$50 trillion), the true exposure related to that notional value is approximately $2.5-$3.0 trillion. This amount would only be lost if the underlying assets lost their entire value (i.e., akin to all the cars insured by car insurance companies being totaled simultaneously; CDS insure bonds instead of cars), which is outside any reasonable scenario. Since many of these CDS provide protection against defaults of bonds in quality companies, true risk of loss related to CDS is considerably less.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the economy faltered as the {{international}} price of petroleum began a gradual decline and the country lost some foreign markets for its traditional agricultural products. Dramatic climatic changes caused by El Ni√±o during 1982-83 produced coastal floods, torrential rains, and severe drought, which were highly damaging to crops and to the transportation and marketing infrastructures. The economy also began to feel the pinch of the country's growing external debt, which amounted to US$8.4 billion in 1984. Debt servicing in that year absorbed approximately 60 percent of the country's export earnings. Foreign <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> began to dry up as early as 1982, leaving the national government and hundreds of state-owned companies short of capital. Inflationary pressures mounted during the early 1980s; consumer prices, which rose 14 percent in 1980, increased by 25 percent in 1982 and by 53 percent in 1983.|$|E
