40|$|A fully coupled thermo-mechanical finite-element {{analysis}} of the friction-stir welding (FSW) process developed in our previous work is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of two wrought aluminum alloys to predict/assess their FSW behaviors. The two alloys selected are AA 5083 (a <b>solid-solution</b> <b>strengthened</b> and strain-hardened/stabilized Al-Mg-Mn alloy) and AA 2139 (a precipitation hardened quaternary Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy). Both of these alloys are currently being used in military-vehicle hull structural and armor systems. In the case of non-age-hardenable AA 5083, the dominant microstruc-ture-evolution processes taking place during FSW are extensive plastic deformation and dynamic re-crystallization of highly deformed material subjected to elevated temperatures approaching the melting temperature. In the case of AA 2139, in addition to plastic deformation and dynamic recrystallization, precipitates coarsening, over-aging, dissolution, and re-precipitation had to be also considered. Limited data available in the open literature pertaining to the kinetics of the aforementioned microstructure-evolution processes are used to predict variation in the material hardness throughout the various FSW zones of the two alloys.

It is argued that due to the large width of FSW joints found in thick aluminum-armor weldments, the overall ballistic performance of the armor {{is controlled by the}} ballistic limits of its weld zones (e. g., heat-affected zone, the thermome-chanically affected zone, the nugget, etc.). Thus, in order to assess the overall ballistic survivability of an armor weldment, one must predict/identify welding-induced changes in the material microstructure and properties, and the operative failure mechanisms in different regions of the weld. Toward this end, a procedure is proposed in the present study which combines the results of the FSW process modeling, basic physical-metallurgy principles concerning microstructure/property relations, and the fracture mechanics concepts related to the key blast/ballistic-impact failure modes.

Within the numerical model of the FSW process, the FSW tool is treated as a Lagrangian component while the workpiece material is treated as an Eulerian component. The employed coupled Eulerian/Lagrangian computational analysis of the welding process was of a two-way thermo-mechanical character (i. e., frictional-sliding/plastic-work dissipation is taken {{to act as a}} heat source in the thermal-energy balance equation) while temperature is allowed to affect mechanical aspects of the model through temperature-dependent material properties.

40|$|Johnson-Cook {{strength}} material model is frequently used in finite-element analyses of various manufac-turing processes involving plastic deformation of metallic materials. The main attraction to this model arises from its mathematical simplicity {{and its ability}} to capture the first-order metal-working effects (e. g., those associated with the influence of plastic deformation, rate of deformation, and the attendant tem-perature). However, this model displays serious shortcomings when used in the engineering analyses of various hot-working processes (i. e., those utilizing temperatures higher than the material recrystallization temperature). These shortcomings are related to the fact that microstructural changes involving: (i) irre-versible decrease in the dislocation density due to the operation of annealing/recrystallization processes; (ii) increase in grain-size due to high-temperature exposure; and (iii) dynamic-recrystallization-induced grain refinement are not accounted for by the model. In this study, an attempt is made to combine the basic physical-metallurgy principles with the associated kinetics relations to properly modify the Johnson-Cook material model, so that the model can be used in the analyses of metal hot-working and joining processes. The model is next used to help establish relationships between process parameters, material microstructure and properties in friction stir welding welds of AA 5083 (a non-age-hardenable, <b>solid-solution</b> <b>strengthened,</b> strain-hardened/stabilized Al-Mg-Mn alloy) ...|$|R

Because of the stresses of operation, turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased {{in an effort to}} improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes more significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and superalloys with <b>solid-solution</b> <b>strengthening</b> and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs. Protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation. These coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup {{on the outside of the}} blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment. The nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase - a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium - promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure. Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the fatigue resistance, strength, and creep resistance.|$|E

Among this group, the nickel superalloys find wide applications in aero engines and land-based gas turbines. They are still being modified in chemical composition to meet the increasing demands of aircraft and energy producing industry. One such newly developed Ni-base alloy is Haynes 282. Haynes 282 showed sensitivity to heat treatment temperatures. The heat treatment temperatures were varied around the conventional heat treatment and within the typical tolerance limits. The microstructural development was systematically studied at intermediate stages through microscopy. To understand the influence of microstructural change on mechanical properties tensile testing was performed at room temperature. The gamma prime (γ׳) morphological change was observed to change from cuboidal to spherical to bimodal in three different heat treatment conditions. The carbide morphology changes from interconnected to discrete morphology. The strength of the material is affected by {{the size and shape of}} the cuboidal γ׳ precipitates, while the ductility at room temperature seem to be affected by interconnected morphology of the carbides at the grain boundaries. Haynes 282 are used in different forms such as forgings, bars, sheets in component applications. The important aspect of such alloy is to understand the structure/property relations at in-service conditions. Haynes 282 in form of forgings showed ductility variations in short transverse direction (ST) from 24 % to 12 % as compared to its longitudinal transversal (LT) direction. The lower limit of ductility is close to the design tolerance and thus creates a need to understand the variation in ductility. In this part, the study is focused to understand ductility variation by microscopic investigations. The influence of carbide segregation and banding is seen to influence the ductility when oriented perpendicular to the tensile axis.

Ab-initio calculations have been done to determine the thermodynamic stability parameters. The as-cast structures do not contain any local chemical order, but the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies reveal their locally distorted lattice. The local lattice distortion of the average structure in their as-cast and annealed state is quantified by refining atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) from single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and powder neutron diffraction (ND) studies. The static component of the ADPs appears to dominate over the thermal ADP, suggesting {{a high degree of}} local lattice distortion in the HEAs. The lattice distortions cause <b>solid-solution</b> like <b>strengthening,</b> which increases the hardness of the HEAs by a factor of 2 - 3 compared to the rule of mixture. The SRCs that form in the annealed HEAs have a planar profile perpendicular to the directions. The SRCs mainly are co-clustering of Zr and Hf. The SRCs have a higher atomic volume causing local tetragonal lattice distortions, which in terms produce diffuse streak-like intensities in the XRD datasets and in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the HRTEM lattice images. The presence of SRCs locally reduces the lattice potential energy of the structure and puts additional energy barrier to the movement of dislocations.

One of the basic high-temperature alloys investigated to fill this need is Ni(19. 5) Ti(50. 5) Pd 30. Initial testing has indicated that this alloy, while having acceptable work characteristics, suffers from significant permanent deformation (or ratcheting) during thermal cycling under load.
