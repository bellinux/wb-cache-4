40|$|Previously we {{presented}} {{a new approach}} to solving dynamic constraint satisfaction problems (DCSPs) based on features of the problem that remain stable after small- or moderate-sized change. We also showed that even small changes in a CSP can have profound effects on the search performance of ordinary heuristics. The present work extends this analysis. We show that despite a reduction in search effort, variability after change is still pronounced, as reflected in low correlation coefficients. This is still true when effects on failfirstness are <b>separated</b> from <b>promise</b> effects. Moreover, such variability does not depend on similarity in solution sets, reflected in the Hamming distance of the solution closest to the one found for the original problem, although this correlates well with efficiency of the local changes algorithm. Thus, methods based on identifying sources of contention improve average performance without reducing variation in performance after perturbation of individual problems...|$|R

40|$|Cooperation {{agreements}} and plea agreements are <b>separate</b> and independent <b>promises</b> by criminal defendants to: (1) assist the Government {{in the prosecution}} of another person and (2) plead guilty.

This intertwining undermines sentencing policy as set forth in the federal sentencing statute. Thus, a district court should continue to consider a defendant’s substantial assistance when imposing a criminal sentence even if a breach of the plea agreement alleviates the Government of its duty to move for a sentence reduction under an intertwined cooperation agreement...|$|R

40|$|Most {{software}} {{systems are}} inflexible. Reconfiguring a system’s modules to add or to delete a feature requires substantial effort. This inflexibility increases {{the costs of}} building variants of a system, amongst other problems. New languages and tools that are being developed to provide additional support for <b>separating</b> concerns show <b>promise</b> to help address this problem. However, applying these mechanisms requires determining how to enable a feature {{to be separated from}} the codebase. In this paper, we investigate this problem through an exploratory study conducted in the context of two existing systems: gnu. regexp and jFTPd. The study consisted of applying three different separation of concern mechanisms—Hyper/J, TM AspectJ, TM and a lightweight, lexically-based approach—to separate features in the two packages. In this paper, we report on the study, providing contributions in two areas. First, we characterize the effect different mechanisms had on the structure of the codebase. Second, we characterize the restructuring process required to perform the separations. These characterizations can help researchers to elucidate how the mechanisms may be best used, tool developers to design support to aid the separation process, and early adopters to apply the techniques...|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{from three}} {{invasive}} plant {{species of the}} Western Karoo region in South Africa, namely Kraalbos, Schotzbos and Asbos, was treated by vacuum pyrolysis. The influence of temperature, pyrolysis time, pressure and initial moisture content on the bio-oil and charcoal yields were investigated. Asbos with the largest ash content, 19. 9 wt. %, gave chars with an ash content between 40 wt. % and 44 wt. % {{making it difficult to}} use commercially. Vacuum pyrolysis of Kraalbos resulted in producing a biochar with a HHV of 23. 0 - 25. 5 MJ/kg and an ash content of 13 - 19 wt. % which compared favourable with commercial charcoal. The bio-oils from both Kraalbos and Schotzbos showed promise as potential heating oil with a HHV of 21. 6 - 26. 9 MJ/kg. The tarry phase contained a number of phenolic compounds that can be <b>separated</b> and shows <b>promise</b> as a feedstock for upgrading. Finally ageing which acts on the lignocellulosic structure of biomasses decreased the charcoal and oil yields from the vacuum pyrolysis of intruder plants. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

6000|$|That was {{the first}} of many talks with Dan, who told Harvey why he would {{transfer}} his dory's name to the imaginary Burgess-modelled haddocker. Harvey heard a good deal about the real Hattie at Gloucester; saw a lock of her hair--which Dan, finding fair words of no avail, had [...] "hooked" [...] as she sat in front of him at school that winter--and a photograph. Hattie was about fourteen years old, with an awful contempt for boys, and had been trampling on Dan's heart through the winter. All this was revealed under oath of solemn secrecy on moonlit decks, in the dead dark, or in choking fog; the whining wheel behind them, the climbing deck before, and without, the unresting, clamorous sea.

40|$|Every power {{structure}} needs a façade: {{a cover for}} strife and contradiction, a story that provides firm and straightforward answers to complicated questions. We long for simple solutions, but these are often based in sweeping, false generalizations. Shiny and alluring, the façade of {{power structure}}s blind us when control of our lives is seized and overtaken. "Over & Over the Rainbow” is an exhibition that examines the crude seams connecting this false façade, a thin veneer of nothing, to its true contents. It exists in the gap <b>separating</b> what is <b>promised,</b> marketed, and consumed, from a trauma-ridden reality. This is the arena of action for the exhibition artists: the chasm between what is and what could be, between promises and broken promises, between longing and disappointment. Tackling this challenge, there were artists who chose to delineate the boundaries of this arena, revealing its scarred underbelly, while others transformed it into their private playground, constructing new and replicated identities from scraps of damaged tissue and thus unfolding new, incredibly intimate anti-tales. They trace the gap between personal identity and those identities dictated from on high by hegemonic systems.

40|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of Malaysia, Sarawak was a poor state with scarce physical infrastructure and slow economic growth. The Malayan leaders took advantage of this appalling condition by offering various development promises as an inducement for Sarawak to help form Malaysia. Development, therefore, became a ‘commodity’ which the state, as the ‘producer’, traded with the people of Sarawak in return for their support towards {{the formation}} of the new state. The politicisation of development has persisted in post-Independence Sarawak and becomes especially rampant during the present state leadership. This article dissects the state’s practice of politicising development by looking at the negeri government’s expenditure on minor rural projects and the practice of electoral patronage espoused by the ruling party from 1970 to 2006. Unlike the existing literature, this article analyses the ruling party’s strategy of electoral patronage by dividing it into four <b>separate</b> forms, namely <b>promises</b> of new development projects, issuance of financial grants and other ‘goodies’, opening ceremonies of completed projects, and ground-breaking ceremonies of new projects. It is argued that development has been exploited by the state as a tool of domination, thus hampering the growth of democracy and economic parity. As a result, the electoral domination of the ruling party, Barisan Nasional, has persisted in Sarawak including in the most recent 2008 election. To conclude, this article will discuss the future of the politics of development in Sarawak {{and its impact on the}} electorate and the ruling party...|$|R

No flocking coracles surrounded our steamer, with crews eager to plunge into the hissing brine for shillings or equivalent quarters.

But, once {{in the lee of}} the rocky Africa breathed a genial warmth across the strait beyond which its summits faintly shimmered; or was it the welcome of Cook's carriages which warmed us so? We were <b>promised</b> <b>separate</b> vehicles for parties of three or four, with English-speaking drivers, and the promise was fairly well kept. The carriages bore a strong family likeness to the pictures of Spanish state coaches of the seventeenth century, and were curtained and cushioned in reddish calico. Rubber tires are yet unknown in southern Europe, and these mediaeval arks bounded over the stones with a violence which must once have been characteristic of those in the illustrations. But the English of our English-speaking driver was all that we could have asked for the shillings we paid Cook for him, or, if it was not, it was all we got. He was an energetic young fellow and satisfyingly Spanish in coloring, but in his eagerness to please he was less grave than I could now wish; I now wish everything in Spain to have been in keeping.|$|R
40|$|Tare soil is soil {{attached}} to harvested products like potato tubers. Tare soil becomes a considerable waste stream after storage, washing and processing of harvested products. There {{is a high}} risk on contamination of tare soils with (quarantine) phytopathogens, because of import of harvested products from {{different regions of the}} world. Disinfestation is necessary to make tare soils applicable for agricultural production. Anaerobic (non-chemical) soil disinfestation (ASD) and inundation are suitable methods to disinfest tare soils. Two different soils (marine loam and glacial sand) were either treated with five (2011) or four (2012) treatments and these were: (i) no treatment (control), (ii) freshly cut grass, (iii) Herbie 7025, (iv) inundation (five cm water on top of the soil surface), and (v) combination of Herbie 7025 and inundation (2011 only). Containers with treated and untreated soils were inoculated with two quarantine phytopathogens, Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 2 and Globodera pallida. After soil inoculation, the containers were airtight closed and only opened for destructive sampling after 84 days. Then, soils were analysed for the presence of R. solanacearum biovar 2, using immunofluorescence colony staining, and for the presence of viable G. pallida eggs, determined by the number of juveniles hatched from eggs and lured to potato root exudate. Strong (> 99. 4 %) declines of both pathogens in treated versus the appropriate control soils were observed. Repetition of the experiment revealed the same pattern and therefore it was concluded that ASD and inundation, as <b>separate</b> treatments, have <b>promise</b> for remediation of tare soils from contaminating quarantine pathogen...|$|R
