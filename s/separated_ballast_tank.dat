5000|$|The {{saddle tank}} {{was formed by}} moving the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> outside the {{pressure}} hull. Early designs raised the weather deck and casing above the pressure hull, producing a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> that wrapped around {{the upper part of}} the pressure hull (diagrams A & B). Following the terminology of steam railway locomotives, this was termed a [...] "saddle tank". Later designs, notably those of the US Fleet submarines and German U-boats, placed two <b>separate</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> lower down on the sides of the hull (diagram C). In railway practice this would have been a [...] "pannier tank", but for submarines the [...] "saddle" [...] label remained.|$|R
50|$|When on {{the surface}} a submarine's <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> are filled with air which gives the vessel its {{buoyancy}} and {{in order for the}} submarine to submerge water is taken into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> through the flood ports {{at the bottom of the}} tanks, effacing this excess buoyancy. As the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> contain air when {{on the surface}} it is necessary to allow this air to escape, so that water may then enter the tanks, and this air is allowed to escape via the opened vents in the top of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Corrosion in <b>Ballast</b> <b>Tanks</b> is the {{deterioration}} process where {{the surface of}} a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> progresses from microblistering, to electroendosmotic blistering, and finally to cracking of the tank steel itself.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> in New Zealand carry {{animals and}} plants that kill ecosystems. <b>Ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> are only used in cargo ships there. Ballast water is {{controlled}} under the Biosecurity Act 1993 in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} among vessel construction and maintenance is the corrosion that takes place in the double hull space <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> have in merchant vessels. Bio-degradation takes place in <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> coatings in marine environments. <b>Ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> can carry more than ballast water, most of the time <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> are filled with other bacteria or organisms. Some of these bacteria can that can be picked up {{from other parts of the}} world can cause the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> to get damaged. Bacteria from different regions plus the natural bacteria can cause <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> to break down. The natural bacteria community has an interaction of the natural bio-films with the coating, an aspect which is not covered in standard procedures. Researchers have shown that biological activity indeed significantly affects the coating properties. Micro-cracks and small holes have been found in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> Acidic bacteria created holes with 0.2-0.9 μm in length and 4-9 μm in width. The natural community caused cracks of 2-8 μm in depth and 1 μm in length. The EIS technique was used to examine the degradation. The bacterial affected coatings decreased in corrosion resistance. The natural community, has a clear loss in coating resistance over time. Also, coating corrosion resistance declines after 40 days of exposure to the natural community, resulting in blisters in the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> Bacteria might be linked to certain bio-film patterns affecting various types of coating attacks.|$|R
50|$|These {{models have}} the ability to alter their {{displacement}} by taking on or pumping out water. This can be accomplished {{through the use of a}} piston, inflatable bladder, or through a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> Boats that use a <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> generally fill the tank by opening a vent at the top, and force the water out by using compressed gas. There are variants that use water pumps for both processes. A liquid gas is dosed into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> to push water out. Gas-Snort Liquid gas is used to surface the boat in an emergency, otherwise the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> is blown by the use of a snorkel tube at periscope depth and the boat is trimmed to surface to periscope depth with a full <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> RCABS -Recirculated Compressed Air Ballast System. Originally developed by Darnell (UK) in the 1950s, this system uses a rubber bladder as the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> and this is filled with compressed air supplied by a small compressor. The air is taken from the water-tight container (WTC) aft dry space to inflate the bladder.|$|R
50|$|On vintage submarines, Kingston valves are fitted at {{the bottom}} of certain <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks,</b> such as safety, negative, and bow {{buoyancy}} <b>tanks.</b> The submarine's <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> valves are used to admit water when the submarine dives. The valves allow water to enter the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks,</b> while the enclosed air escapes through the open main vents {{at the top of the}} <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> During peacetime the Kingston valves are closed when the submarine is on the surface, the valves and vents being opened to dive, but to reduce the time required for diving in wartime the Kingston valves are left permanently open when at sea, the water being kept out of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> by the air pressure of the trapped air. This pressure is released when the vents are opened for diving, allowing the water to enter through the open Kingston valves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> do not corrode uniformly {{throughout}} the tank. Each region behaves distinctively, according to it electrochemical loading. The differences can especially {{be seen in}} empty <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> The upper sections usually corrode but the lower sections will blister.|$|R
25|$|Water <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> were {{fitted to}} {{each end of}} the vessel which enabled her to be trimmed to any desired draught. There were also large water <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> in the holds in order for {{trimming}} the vessel in rough weather.|$|R
5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties in <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> ventilation, {{the fact that}} <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> is more difficult for double hull ships.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{maritime}} accidents {{have been}} caused by corrosion, and this has led to stringent regulations concerning protective coatings for <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> The Coating Performance Standard for <b>Ballast</b> <b>Tank</b> Coatings (PSPC), became effective in 2008. It specifies how protective coatings should be applied during vessel construction with the intention of giving a coating a 15-year service life. Additional regulations, such as those established by The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water & Sediments (SBWS) sought to avoid introducing invasive species throughout the world through ship's <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> [...] The methods used to avoid having these invasive species surviving in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> however greatly increased the rate of corrosion. Therefore ongoing research attempts to find water treatment systems that kill invasive species, while not having a destructive effect on the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> coatings. As double-hulled tankers were introduced it meant that there was more <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> area had to be coated and therefore a greater capital investment for ship owners. With the onset of the OPA 90 and later the amendments to MARPOL annex 1, single hull tankers (without alternative method) have basically phased out.|$|R
50|$|An {{emergency}} main <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> blow is {{a procedure}} used aboard a submarine that forces high-pressure air into its main <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks.</b> The high-pressure air forces ballast {{water from the}} tanks, quickly lightening the ship so it can rapidly rise to the surface.|$|R
50|$|Some submersibles, such as bathyscaphes, dive and re-surface {{solely by}} {{controlling}} their buoyancy. They flood <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> to submerge, then to re-surface either drop discardable ballast weights, or use stored compressed air to blow their <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> clear of water, becoming buoyant again.|$|R

5000|$|In {{submarine}} technology a vent [...] is a valve {{fitted to}} the top of a submarine's <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> to let air escape from the top of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> and be replaced by water entering through the opening(s) called [...] "flood ports" [...] or [...] "floods" [...] at the bottom of the tank. In earlier times, the openings at the bottom of the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> were fitted with valves known as Kingston valves. These valves were eliminated in the U.S. Navy between the World Wars.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the boat}} {{had not been}} {{prepared}} to dive, instrumentation valves were not aligned properly, {{and even though the}} main <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> were filling, their indicators read empty. Confused, Suvorov ordered auxiliary <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> filled. Over-ballasted to about 60 tons negative buoyancy, the boat dove very quickly.|$|R
50|$|Another system gaining {{popularity}} is the 'Snort System'. A <b>ballast</b> <b>tank</b> allows water to enter by releasing a vent valve {{on the top}} of the cylinder, allowing the boat to submerge. To surface, a small pump 'Snorts' air from the snorkel tube in the conning tower (sail) into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> expelling the water. This system is also equipped with a small tank of compressed gas, which in the event of a fail-safe system operating, usually due to loss of radio signal, the gas is released into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank,</b> surfacing the boat.|$|R
50|$|The {{coatings}} in the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> {{are protected}} by two features, a full-time double-scrubbing system supplying drier inert gas to the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks,</b> and also by the white painted upper hull reflecting the sun’s energy. The inert gas system also increases safety. Keeping down the cargo temperatures also minimizes hydrocarbon emissions.|$|R

It should be design in such a way that the submarine should submerged by partially filling the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> In this project, we have designed and developed a density variation mechanism of submarine using air chamber and <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> We use the rolling pump which plays a vital role in this mechanism which helps to suck and discharge water into the <b>ballast</b> <b>tank.</b> This helps the submarine to sink inside the water and float it back to surface. In addition, we also implement the pressure relief valve to overcome the drawback of the excess pressure generated in the air chamber and the navigation system which will help the submarine to take a turn in left and right direction.

40|$|Recent {{regulation}} {{mandates that}} ships conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchange (BWE) prior to discharging foreign ballast in U. S. territorial waters. We investigated {{the utility of}} dissolved concentration measurements for 6 elements (Ba, P, Mn, U, V and Mo) in the <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> of ships operating in the North Pacific and Atlantic oceans as tracers of mid-ocean BWE. Relatively conservative elements Me, U and V provided little additional information beyond that obtained from salinity, whereas nonconservative Ba, P and Mn offered greater resolution. The utility of Ba, P and Mn was further examined {{in the context of}} three criteria: (1) stability, or whether tracers maintain stable concentrations in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> over time; (2) fidelity, or the degree to which tracer concentrations in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> faithfully reflect concentrations at their ocean source; and (3) predictability, or the degree to which <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> have a predictable and restricted range of tracer concentrations following BWE. We found that in water held in <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> over time, average stability increased for Mn 21 %> 3 %) and fidelity increased in the same direction. While Ba and P usually increased discrimination at high salinities, Mn was typically the most sensitive indicator of BWE and the presence of residual port water in partially exchanged tanks. Ba, P and Mn in tanks exchanged in the Atlantic exhibited different concentration ranges compared to tanks exchanged in the Pacific, suggesting that if trace elements are to be used to verify BWE, criteria for discriminating between exchanged and unexchanged <b>ballast</b> <b>tanks</b> may need to be basin-specific.
