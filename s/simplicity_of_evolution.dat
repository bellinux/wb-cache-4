Explaining the reasoning behind the genus name, lead researcher Rohan Pethiyagoda was quoted as stating that Richard Dawkins has, through his writings, helped us understand {{that the universe is}} far more beautiful and awe-inspiring than any religion has imagined [...] We hope that Dawkinsia will serve as a reminder of the elegance and <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> the only rational explanation there is for the unimaginable diversity of life on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|Pokémons {{history has}} been marked at times by rivalry with the Digimon media {{franchise}} that debuted at a similar time. Described as [...] "the other 'mon by IGN's Juan Castro, Digimon has not enjoyed Pokémons level of international popularity or success, but has maintained a dedicated fanbase. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas stated that Pokémon is Digimons [...] "constant competition and comparison", attributing the former's relative success to the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> its <b>evolution</b> mechanic as opposed to Digivolution. The two have been noted for conceptual and stylistic similarities by sources such as GameZone. A debate among fans exists over {{which of the two}} franchises came first. In actuality, the first Pokémon media, Pokémon Red and Green, were released initially on February 27, 1996; whereas the Digimon virtual pet was released on June 26, 1997.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{physical}} {{considerations and}} past tests {{suggest that there}} may be a problem with discreteness error in N–body methods widely used in cosmological clustering studies. This could cause problems with accuracy when coupled to hydrodynamics codes. We therefore investigate some of the effects that discreteness and two–body scattering may have on N-body simulations with “realistic ” cosmological initial conditions. For the initial power spectrum of the density fluctuations we choose a pure power-law with the form P(k) ∝ k − 1. Such a spectrum approximates many candidate cosmological models on scales of order 10 – 100 h − 1 Mpc while keeping the <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> self-similar <b>evolution.</b> We use an identical subset of particles from the initial conditions for a 128 3 Particle–Mesh (PM) calculation as the initial conditions for a variety of Particle– Particle–Particle Mesh (P 3 M) and Tree code runs.

40|$|The semiclassical long-time limit <b>of</b> free <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> quantum wave packets on the torus {{is under}} consideration. Despite <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> this system, {{there are still}} open {{questions}} concerning the detailed description <b>of</b> the <b>evolution</b> on time scales beyond the Ehrenfest time. One of the approaches {{is based on the}} limiting Wigner or Husimi distributions of time-evolved wave packets as the Planck constant tends to zero and time tends to infinity. We derive explicit expressions for semiclassical measures corresponding to all time scales and the corresponding stages of evolution: classical-like motion, spreading of the wave packet, and its revivals. Also we discuss limitations of the approach based on semiclassical measures and suggest its generalization. Comment: 21 page...|$|R
40|$|Simplicity {{is often}} {{mentioned}} as a criterion to accept one theory out {{of a set of}} mutual exclusive theories which are able to explain and predict the same data. There are accounts <b>of</b> ontological <b>simplicity,</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the conceptual framework of a theory, and <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the laws of a theory. All these notions are less than explicated. I give an overview on different proposals and confront the notion <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> with Eli Hirsch´s division problem. Ontological <b>simplicity</b> and <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> conceptual framework seem to fail. <b>Simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the laws of a theory as a criterion is also in trouble. <b>Simplicity</b> <b>of</b> laws might be nothing more than a feature of explanatory power. And <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> laws is beset with the division problem as well. Only a naturalistic theory <b>of</b> <b>simplicity</b> might save the concept. I close by looking at some empirical theories concerning simplicity built into our cognitive architecture. § 1 Ontological <b>Simplicity</b> Quine´s definition <b>of</b> ontological <b>simplicity</b> tells us to take as the ontological commitment of a theory those entities which it quantifies over. Ontological economy is measured by the number of kinds of entities which are quantified over: “To be is to be the value of a bound variable. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{proliferation}} of models seeking to explain the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> altruism {{over the past few}} years, and Lehmann and Keller should be commended for this very well-reasoned and clearly written attempt to bring order out of chaos.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of plasma turbulence in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) [Gekelman et al, Rev. Sci. Inst., 62, 2875, 1991] is presented. The model, {{implemented in the}} BOUndary Turbulence (BOUT) code [M. Umansky et al, Contrib. Plasma Phys. 180, 887 (2009) ], includes 3 -D collisional fluid equations for plasma density, electron parallel momentum, and current continuity, and also includes the effects of ion-neutral collisions. In nonlinear simulations using measured LAPD density profiles but assuming constant temperature profile for <b>simplicity,</b> self-consistent <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> instabilities and nonlinearly-generated zonal flows results in a saturated turbulent state. Comparisons of these simulations with measurements in LAPD plasmas reveal good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement, in particular in frequency spectrum, spatial correlation and amplitude probability distribution function of density fluctuations. For comparison with LAPD measurements, the plasma density profile in simulations is maintained either by direct azimuthal averaging on each time step, or by adding particle source/sink function. The inferred source/sink values {{are consistent with the}} estimated ionization source and parallel losses in LAPD.
