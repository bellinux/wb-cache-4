5000|$|A red-green {{alliance}} of sorts {{occurred during the}} campaign {{leading up to the}} London mayoral election, 2008.

50|$|The Warwickshire turnout for the {{election}} was 15.65%, reflecting a poor figure nationally across England and Wales, and the Electoral Commission launched an investigation into why voting had been so low. The poll was conducted under the <b>supplementary</b> <b>voting</b> system in which voters choose a first and second preference, and saw him score 898 fewer votes than the Labour Party candidate and former government minister, James Plaskitt, but falling short of the 50% required for an overall majority. The second-preference votes {{for those who had}} voted for the third-place candidate, the Conservative Party's Fraser Pithie were then counted, giving Ball a clear majority. He had expected to secure around 20% of the vote. His election made him the Police and Crime Commissioner of England's smallest police force.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the votes}} of the {{cardinals}} have been counted after the first balloting and the two-thirds majority has fallen to none of those voted for, at the following vote opportunity is granted for a cardinal to change his vote, by writing [...] "Accedo domino Cardinali", mentioning {{one of those who}} have been voted for, but not the cardinal for whom he has already voted. If he should not wish to change his vote, the cardinal can vote [...] "Nemini" [...] ( [...] "for no one" [...] ). If these <b>supplementary</b> <b>votes</b> of accession, added to those a candidate has received, equal two-thirds of the total vote, then there is an election. If not, the ballots are burned, and the usual ballot takes place the next day.|$|R
50|$|Under the <b>supplementary</b> <b>vote</b> (SV), voters {{express a}} {{first and second}} choice of {{candidate}} only, and, if no candidate receives an absolute majority of first-choice votes, all but the two leading candidates are eliminated and the votes of those eliminated redistributed according to their second-choice votes to determine the winner.

50|$|Like {{other forms}} of the Contingent Vote, the <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Vote</b> is not a form of {{proportional}} representation and so, were it used to elect a council or legislature, it {{could be expected to}} produce results similar to other systems involving single seat constituencies such as the 'first past the post' (plurality) system.|$|E
50|$|The 2016 London mayoral {{election}} {{was held on}} 5 May 2016 to elect the Mayor of London, {{on the same day}} as the London Assembly election. It was the fifth election to the position of Mayor, which was created in 2000 after a referendum in London. The election used a <b>supplementary</b> <b>vote</b> system.|$|E
50|$|However, {{legislation}} for a referendum was not put forward.

50|$|The {{electoral system}} used for London mayor {{elections}} is the <b>supplementary</b> <b>vote,</b> where voters express a {{first and second}} choice of candidate, if no candidate receives an absolute majority of first choice votes, all but the two leading candidates are eliminated, and the votes of those eliminated redistributed according to their second choice votes to determine the winner.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the other}} methods that fail the {{criterion}} are the Borda count, minimax, the Kemeny-Young method, Copeland's method, Bucklin voting, the plurality vote, and the two-round system. Variants of Instant-runoff voting that eliminate multiple candidates per round (e.g. the contingent vote) or forbid the voters from ranking all the candidates (e.g. the <b>supplementary</b> <b>vote)</b> also fail the criterion.|$|E
50|$|Under the <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Vote</b> system, if no {{candidate}} receives 50% of 1st choice votes, 2nd choice {{votes are}} added to the result for the top two 1st choice candidates. If a ballot gives a first and second preference to the top two candidates in either order, then their second preference is not counted, so that a second preference cannot count against a first.|$|E
