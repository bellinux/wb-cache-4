40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the spatial dependence of physical attributes in a soil cultivated with Brachiaria grass. A 12 -m regular sampling grid was established within an area of 3. 500 m 2. Thirty-five soil samples were collected at 0 - 30 cm depth for particle density, bulk density, texture and total porosity analysis. These data were evaluated using statistical methods of indicator kriging and the GS+ software. The GS+ software was used to develop three-dimensional maps and evaluate <b>semivariograms.</b> The spatial dependence was evaluated using experimental <b>semivariograms.</b> The analyzed attributes indicated the occurrence of spatial dependence when fit to the exponential model. Areas with higher porosity occurred in the regions with lower bulk densities and higher particle densities...|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, some {{variables are}} more continuous along a particular direction than others. The only approach {{to identify the}} anisotropy direction is to calculate several <b>semivariograms</b> and determine the maximum and minimum continuity ranges or {{it is possible to}} create a variogram map and find the general trend of anisotropy which is the direction at which the variogram map is elongated (Fig.  16). The <b>semivariograms</b> for the porosity in the horizontal directions were calculated in 19 directions. These <b>semivariograms</b> have almost the same sill value which is equal to one because sill is identical to square of variance and as the data have been normalized before. Therefore, the variograms have to show sill values more or less equal to one but they have different ranges in different directions showing structural anisotropy in the case of porosity. It also shows that the directions of continuity are toward N 75 W for the maximum range and N 15 E direction for the minimum range as confirmed by the variogram map of porosity. The experimental variogram parameters, their directions, and the best fitting theoretical model are listed in Table  3, some of them (direction 0, 45, 90, 135) are shown in Fig.  17 a–d.|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} {{problem of}} interest in remote sensing {{is to increase the}} spatial resolution of a coarse spatial resolution image by fusing the information of that image with another fine spatial resolution image (from the same sensor or from sensors on different satellites). Thus, the problem is how to introduce spatial ‘detail’ into a coarse spatial resolution image (decrease the pixel size) such that it is coherent with the spectral information of the image. Cokriging provides a geostatistical solution to the problem and has several interesting advantages: it is a sound statistical method by being unbiased and minimizing a prediction variance (c. f. ad hoc procedures), it takes into account the effect of pixel size, and also autocorrelation in each image as well as the cross-correlation between images, it may be extended to incorporate extra information from other sources and it provides an estimation of the uncertainty of the final predictions. When formulating the cokriging system, <b>semivariograms</b> and cross-semivariograms (or covariances and cross-covariances) appear, some of which cannot be estimated from data directly. Cross-variograms between different variables as well as crosssemivariograms between different supports for the same variable are required. The problem is solved by using linear systems theory in which any variable for any pixel size is seen as the output of a linear system when the input is the same variable on a point support. In remote-sensing applications, the linear system is specified by the point-spread function (or impulse response) of the sensor. Linear systems theory provides the theoretical relations between the different <b>semivariograms</b> and cross-semivariograms. Overall, one must ensure that the whole set of covariances and crosscovariances is positive-definite and models must be estimated for non-observed <b>semivariograms</b> and cross-semivariograms. The models must also be realistic, taking into account, for example, the parabolic behaviour close to the origin presented in regularized <b>semivariograms</b> and cross-semivariograms. The solution proposed is to find by numerical deconvolution a positive-definite set of point covariances and cross-covariances and then any required model may be obtained by numerical convolution of the corresponding point model. The first step implies several numerical deconvolutions where some model parameters are fixed, while others are estimated using the available experimental <b>semivariograms</b> and crosssemivariograms, and some goodness-of-fit measure. The details of the proposed procedure are presented and illustrated with an example from remote sensing...|$|R
30|$|This method so efficient, {{effective}} and popular with geoscientists {{has a very}} important preliminary step upon which the reliability of interpolation and prediction depends: that is the structural analysis focused on the <b>semivariogram.</b> This step is so important that for many versions of Golden Surfer and ArcGIS, it is of {{the responsibility of the}} user to select the suitable model of <b>semivariogram.</b> For this reason, van Groenigen (2000) studied the influence of <b>semivariogram</b> parameters on optimal sampling schemes for mapping by kriging; Cressie (1993) advised the use of cross-validation to check the validity of a <b>semivariogram</b> model; Crujeiras et al.
