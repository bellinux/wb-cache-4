40|$|Knowledge of {{the degree}} of damage to {{residential}} structures expected from severe wind is used to study the benefits from adaptation strategies developed in response to expected changes in wind severity due to climate change. This study will inform government, the insurance industry and provide emergency services with estimates of expected damage. A series of heuristic wind vulnerability curves for Australian residential structures has been developed. In order to provide rigor to the heuristic curves and to enable quantitative assessment to be made of adaptation strategies, work has commenced to produce a simulation tool to quantitatively assess damage to buildings from severe wind. The simulation tool accounts for variability in wind profile, shielding, structural strength, pressure coefficients, building orientation, component <b>self</b> <b>weights,</b> debris damage and water ingress via a Monte Carlo approach. The software takes a component-based approach to modelling building vulnerability. It is {{based on the premise that}} overall building damage is strongly related to the failure of key components (i. e. connections). If these failures can be ascertained, and associated damage from debris and water penetration reliably estimated, scenarios of complete building damage can be assessed. This approach has been developed with varying degrees of rigor by researchers around the world and is best practice for the insurance industry...|$|R

ABSTRACT: An {{attempt was made to}} design a low cost floating house suitable for people in low lying areas such as Bangladesh. The prototype house considered for the present study has the carrying capacity of 1850 kg loads with sufficient freeboard of 30 % excluding the <b>self</b> <b>weights</b> of the supporting ten airtight empty steel drums in water and having a floor area of 120 ft 2. These steel drums that are locally available and provide an atmosphere to live in without the fear of losing possession during flood. The value of metacentric height (10. 22 ft) of the designed house was found to be positive indicating its stability at floating condition. The angular displacement of the house due to wind action was also calculated and this floating structure would be stable up to the wind speed of about 160 km/hr. To provide sanitation a floating toilet can be hinged with the structure. It would definitely give an eco-friendly out look to the structure. For variable fencing, flooring, roofing and floating elements costs were estimated to determine the most economic feasibility. The most economic house was supposed to be made of locally available materials such as chhon and golpata. But from the engineering point of view the most stable and durable house was found to be CI- sheet and angle bar. Above all, the house made of Bamboo could be used on the basis of availability and durability. This house could be used all the round year as a permanent address fo...|$|R

Estimated body mass index, BMI (kg/m 2) varied from true (measured) BMI by + 0. 19 (1. 40) for men and by + 0. 17 (1. 34) for women. The only age/sex group in which BMI was under-estimated from self reports (mean 0. 2) was the 55 - 64 year old women. Prediction equations that explained 90 % (men) and 88 % (women) {{of the difference between}} self reported and measured height included age and <b>self</b> reported <b>weight.</b> The equivalent prediction equations for weight explained 93 % of the difference between self reported and measured weight for men and included smoking and diabetic status, while for women 96 % of the variance was explained with no further variables being significant. Sensitivity and specificity for determining clinical obesity (BMI⩾ 30) were 83 % and 96 % respectively for men, and 89 % and 97 % for women.  CONCLUSIONS—This Scottish population was unique in the under-reporting of height as well as weight, which resulted in BMI estimates with low error. These data suggest that <b>self</b> reported <b>weights</b> and heights would be satisfactory for the monitoring of obesity prevalence in Scotland.    Keywords: obesity measurement; obesity prevalence; self report...|$|R

This {{new type}} of masonry block uses special {{curvature}} to allow the masonry block to stabilize through <b>self</b> <b>weight</b> when constructed as a panel. The principal practice of this panel is to help dissipate external energy, primarily due to seismic loadings. The basic concept is to generate friction between each element of the panel through movements to dissipate energy. SIM blocks were created by Dr Yuri Totoev from University of Newcastle, first introduced in print in 2011 in the Advance Material Research Journal. This theory was based on principles of dry stack masonry wall construction, where energy dissipation depends significantly on the textural arrangement of the stones. The idea of SIM panel is to improve on the traditional reinforced masonry. The design principal is to allow construction without the requirements of traditional reinforced masonry.|$|E

The focus of investigations is put on the mechanisms of the interaction of teaching input and structural changes. A wellknown concept for this interaction is Hebbian learning, which is regulated by ANMs in the presented approach.

40|$|Policymakers, politicians, {{and media}} outlets have {{declared}} an obesity epidemic. In doing so, they have named {{a variety of}} villains, including fast food. Despite the framing of fast food as being a leading contributor to weight gain and obesity, {{we have yet to}} understand the impact that fast food has on those who work with it every day. The purpose of this dissertation is to understand the food choices, BMIs, and <b>self</b> perceived <b>weights</b> of the food service worker population. Using Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus and field, I investigate the role of the workplace and external cultural influences, such as the family, in navigating an obseogenic workplace environment that is centered on selling highly caloric food to the Canadian public in a quick and cost effective manner. The first stage of this research addresses the question: Are food service workers more likely to be overweight or obese and perceive themselves as being overweight compared to the general population? In order to do this, I analyzed secondary survey data from the Canadian Community Health Survey cycle 5. 1 (2009 - 2010). I used logistic regression techniques to construct models that analyze the likelihood of having high BMIs and high <b>self</b> perceived <b>weights</b> in both the food service worker and general Canadian populations. In addition to this, I sought to understand the food choices that contribute to weight gain in fast food workers. To do this, I conducted forty semi-structured qualitative interviews with workers from a variety of fast food chains. The results of my research disprove my original hypothesis that food service workers {{are more likely to be}} overweight or obese because of their frequent exposure to fast food. Instead, I found that they are less likely to be overweight or obese than the general Canadian population. Additionally, they are also less likely to perceive themselves as being overweight or obese. Through the qualitative interviews, I found that these individuals participate in a process of regulation where they monitor their food intake at work. Additionally, I found that their consumption patterns stemmed from habitus generated through cultural exposures in other areas of their lives. Pierre Bourdieu (1984) argues that we develop habitus through meaningful cultural exposure. We use our habitus, or engrained dispositions, to navigate hierarchical spaces or fields. Through this research, I found that workers viewed their jobs as being temporary and their cultural consumption patterns did not seem to change from their exposures to their workplaces. The majority were part time students, working in this industry to pay for living expenses and tuition. For the most part, they were raised in middle class homes where their mothers prepared food for their families from scratch on a daily basis. Fast food was viewed as a special treat and not an item to consume on a regular basis. I conclude that the meaningful exposures we have to food and cultural norms throughout life are more important in determining our food choices than our exposure to fast food restaurants...|$|R
