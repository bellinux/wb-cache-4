The character transitions in one second from walking to skipping in a seamless, natural way. We invite the reader to view this animation in the accompanying movie. Many applications require character animation that is both natural-looking and controllable. These two requirements are often in opposition. For example, motion graphs (e. g., [Kovar et al. 2002]) are a popular technique that can create realistic-looking transitions between frames of motion. However, the technique is not very controllable because: (1) {{it may take a}} long time (proportional to the square of the number of frames for a dense graph using Djikstra’s algorithm) to find the <b>shortest</b> <b>transition</b> between the character’s current frame of motion and a desired frame; and (2) the <b>shortest</b> <b>transition</b> may be too long.

50|$|The Euler spiral has two advantages. One {{is that it}} is {{easy for}} {{surveyors}} because the coordinates can be looked up in Fresnel integral tables. The other is that it provides the <b>shortest</b> <b>transition</b> subject to a given limit on the rate of change of the track superelevation (i.e. the twist of the track). However, as has been recognized for a long time, it has undesirable dynamic characteristics due to the large (conceptually infinite) roll acceleration and rate of change of centripetal acceleration at each end. Because of the capabilities of personal computers it is now practical to employ spirals that have dynamics better than those of the Euler spiral.|$|R
