40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) should ideally have {{mechanical properties}} {{similar to those}} of the bone tissue the material is used to replace or repair. Usually, the compressive strength of the CPCs is reported and, more rarely, the elastic modulus. Conversely, scarce or no data are available on Poisson's ratio and strain-to-crack-initiation. This is unfortunate, as data on the elastic response is key to, e. g., numerical model accuracy. In this study, the compressive behaviour of brushite, monetite and apatite cements was fully characterised. Measurement of the surface strains was done using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique, and compared to results obtained with the commonly used built-in displacement measurement of the materials testers. The collected data showed that the use of fixed compression platens, as opposed to <b>spherically</b> <b>seated</b> ones, may in some cases underestimate the compressive strength by up to 40 %. Also, the built-in measurements may underestimate the elastic modulus by up to 62 % as compared to DIC measurements. Using DIC, the brushite cement was found to be much stiffer (24. 3 ± 2. 3  GPa) than the apatite (13. 5 ± 1. 6  GPa) and monetite (7. 1 ± 1. 0  GPa) cements, and elastic moduli were inversely related to the porosity of the materials. Poisson's ratio was determined to be 0. 26 ± 0. 02 for brushite, 0. 21 ± 0. 02 for apatite and 0. 20 ± 0. 03 for monetite. All investigated CPCs showed low strain-to-crack-initiation (0. 17 – 0. 19 %). In summary, the elastic modulus of CPCs is substantially higher than previously reported and it is concluded that an accurate procedure is a prerequisite in order to properly compare the mechanical properties of different CPC formulations. It is recommended to use <b>spherically</b> <b>seated</b> platens and measuring the strain at a relevant resolution and on the specimen surface. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R

The hard boride based coatings on steels and alloys obtained through the thermal diffusion process have a high potential for these severe application conditions over many other types of coatings as they can be obtained on the entire working surfaces of large size and complex shape products. Intensive tribological studies of the iron boride based coatings on carbon steel obtained at Endurance Technologies Inc. have been conducted using the Cameron-Plint testing unit (reciprocating sliding of the metallic rod under the load over a flat surface of the coated samples). The friction wear loss, friction coefficient and structural changes of the coatings have been studied in dry and lubricating (water-oil) friction conditions, which simulate actual application conditions. It was demonstrated that the obtained boride coatings have the friction loss significantly smaller than untreated steel (e. g. 2 ̆ 23 c 10 - 30 times in the dry conditions and at least 5 times in the lubricating conditions) with no peeling and flaking-off. The friction coefficients of the boride coatings are steady over the test duration. The influence of the thickness on the boride coatings performance is demonstrated. The encouraging results are explained by the specific coating structure of the hard coating obtained through the thermal diffusion process and the thin 'tribofilm' formed during a friction mode.

The research samples are 39 truck drivers. The characteristic of this research is analytic using cross sectional design. The data analysis used are univariate, bivariate using Exact Fisher test and multivariate using Binary Logistic Regression test with backward stepwise method. The result of the research shows that truck drivers who ever got work accident are 14 drivers (35. 9 %) and 25 drivers (64. 1 %) are never got work accident. The result of exact fisher test show that the condition of the vehicle, the condition of the road and the condition of the body physical have a corellation to the potential of the work accident. The result of binary logistic regression test with backward stepwise method show that the most significant variable influence is the condition of the body physical with value p= 0, 003 and Exp (/ 6) = 0, 065.

40|$|Lecturepg. 33 - 45 This paper reviews a long {{standing}} issue {{related to the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of tilting-pad (TP) bearings; namely, What {{is the nature of}} their frequency dependency? A research project was implemented at the Turbomachinery Laboratory (TL) at Texas A&M University (TAMU) around 2003 to examine the issue, applying procedures that had been developed and used to investigate the rotordynamic characteristics of annular gas seals. Those seals, using a smooth rotor and a honeycomb or hole-pattern stator were predicted to have strongly frequency-dependent reaction forces that could not be modeled by a combination of stiffness, damping, and inertia coefficients. Measurements confirmed the strongly frequency dependent nature of their stiffness and damping coefficients. Subsequent test have examined the following bearing types: (i) Two-axial-groove bearing, (ii) pressure dam bearings, (iii) Flexure-pivot-pad tilting-pad bearing (FPTP) in load-on-pad (LOP) and load-between-pad (LBP), (iv) Rocker-pivot-pad TP bearing in LOP and LBP configurations at two different preloads and 50 and 60 % offsets, and (v) a spherical <b>seat</b> <b>bearing</b> in LOP and LBP configurations. Representative test results are presented for some of these bearings. In addition, this paper includes experimental results for 5 -pad and 4 -pad tilting pad bearings (with similar features to TAMU configuration iv) tested at the GE Global Research Facility (GRC) as part of an independent research initiative from GE Oil and Gas. Frequency effects on the dynamic-stiffness coefficients were investigated by applying dynamic-force excitation over a range of excitation frequencies. Generally, for all bearings tested at TAMU and GRC, the direct real parts of the dynamic-stiffness coefficients could be modeled as quadratic functions of the excitation frequency and accounted for by adding a mass matrix to the conventional [C][K] model to produce a frequency-independent [M][C][K] model. Additionally, the direct damping could be modeled by a constant, frequency-independent coefficient. Consequently, these experimental findings from two independent sources support the use of synchronously reduced force coefficients for characterizing the dynamic performance of tilting pad bearings in Oil and Gas applications, as prescribed by API 617 7 th edition (Process Centrifugal Compressors) and more generally by API 684 Rotordynamic Tutorial...|$|R

5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent development, integrated headsets {{do away with}} the upper and lower bearing cups on threadless headsets and instead <b>seat</b> the <b>bearings</b> directly against the head tube of the frame. Favored sometimes for their aesthetic appeal, integrated headsets reduce the number of parts involved in the headset assembly. Prominent standards for integrated headsets include Cane Creek's [...] "IS" [...] and Campagnolo's standard, which is nameless apart from the manufacturer name. Chris King, a leading headset manufacturer, offers a vehement argument against the implementation of integrated headsets. The basis of King's argument is that headtubes with bearing [...] "seats" [...] are far from being machined with reasonable precision. The headset cartridge bearings therefore sit somewhat loosely in the headtube of the bicycle (as opposed to being press fit). During use, the bearings, under thrust loads, will rock in their seats and will easily damage the softer frame material (often aluminum, although some titanium frames are manufactured for integrated headsets). Given enough damage to the frame, there would be no choice but to replace the frame, especially if the frame is made of an aluminum alloy (titanium and steel can potentially be repaired, but usually at great cost to the consumer).King also argues that the integrated headset is largely a cost-cutting measure for many of the larger bicycle manufacturers, since integrated headsets are somewhat cheaper and take less time to install.|$|R
