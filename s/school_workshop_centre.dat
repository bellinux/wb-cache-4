40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Workshop {{educators}} {{have a legal}} duty with regard to health and safety in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> {{for the protection of}} the learners in their care. It is expected of the workshop educators to look after the learners placed in their care as a conscientious and solicitous parent would. The workshop educator's discretion and conduct should always be based on predictable and preventable action. Because learners cannot possibly have the discernment of adults concerning more or less dangerous situations, the workshop educator should make provision for this possibility in the health and safety management of the <b>school</b> <b>workshop.</b> Common law principles such as duty of care, predictability and preventability, in addition to requirements for delictual liability (an act, unlawfulness, fault, causality and damage) demarcate and elucidate the role of the workshop educator who is responsible for the safety management of the <b>school</b> <b>workshop.</b> Workshop educators should ascertain that they are familiar with all these principles. A literature survey was undertaken with regard to these matters. Although workshop educators are responsible for the health and safety of the learners in their care, the literature survey revealed that health and safety in workshops in general is addressed and made compulsory by legislation, but that the specific needs of the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> are not adequately addressed. The aims of the empirical research were to determine: • the functioning of health and safety management in the contemporary <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> and • to what extent the workshop educator is equipped for his duty of care responsibility with regards to the health and safety of the learners placed in his care. Questions were asked on the knowledge and execution of health and safety rules laid down by legislation, as well as the knowledge and execution of safety rules which are not necessarily laid down by legislation. Questions on safety rules devised by the respondents to improve the health and safety in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> were also included in the questionnaire. The empirical study lead to the following: • The respondents seemed to have a reasonable knowledge of general health and safety rules laid down by legislation but in questions asked to verify the above mentioned answers, it seemed that the respondents were in some cases ignorant about these health and safety rules. Some of the respondents seem to ignore the safety rules in the execution of the health and safety rules. • A small number of the respondents seem to have a good knowledge of health and safety rules which are not necessarily laid down by legislation. • Quite a number of the respondents reported health and safety rules specifically devised for <b>school</b> <b>workshops</b> by their respective schools. Specific recommendations have been made and a model for health and safety management in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> has been devised. This model should lead to better health and safety management in the <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> and should thus ensure a safer <b>school</b> <b>workshop</b> for learners. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|The <b>workshop</b> <b>school</b> was a {{particular}} form {{of education in the}} Swedish vocational education system of 1918. It was established and developed over a period of 50 years before it disappeared in the upper secondary reform of 1968. The <b>workshop</b> <b>school</b> differed, in many respects, from the kind of <b>school</b> <b>workshops</b> of today where students attain most of their vocational practice. It was not unusual that the <b>workshop</b> <b>schools</b> operated as small business enterprises on the local market, even when the municipality was the organizer of the education. The wide scope of this article is about this historical phenomenon. The aim is to investigate the production as a pedagogical tool through the artefacts and spaces of the <b>workshop</b> <b>school.</b> This is done within the theoretical framework materiality of schooling, a perspective that can be described as school archaeology. City- or municipal archives hold a treasure trove of photographs and narratives from the era of <b>workshop</b> <b>schools</b> in Sweden. They reveal how production shaped the content and relations to society in a very different way from the vocational training that takes place in the modern <b>school</b> <b>workshop...</b>|$|R
