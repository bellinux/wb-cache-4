25|$|Cooking and {{crushing}} tomatoes (as in the canning process) {{and serving}} in oil-rich dishes (such as <b>spaghetti</b> <b>sauce</b> or pizza) greatly increases assimilation from {{the digestive tract}} into the bloodstream. Lycopene is fat-soluble, so the oil is said to help absorption. Gac is a possible commercial source of lycopene {{for the purposes of}} extraction and purification, as its seed content of lycopene is high. Another source of lycopene is the fungus Blakeslea trispora.|$|E
25|$|Garlic & Onions* are {{toxic to}} dogs. Onions, Garlic, Chives - {{can cause the}} {{destruction}} of red blood cells known as Heinz body anemia, a form of hemolytic anemia.

2500|$|Alpert's style {{achieved}} enormous {{popularity with}} the national exposure The Clark Gum Company gave {{to one of his}} recordings in 1964, a Sol Lake number titled [...] "The Mexican Shuffle" [...] (which was retitled [...] "The Teaberry Shuffle" [...] for the television advertisements).

In concerts, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, [...] "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you." [...] The art was parodied by several groups including one-time A band Soul Asylum and by comedian Pat Cooper for his album <b>Spaghetti</b> <b>Sauce</b> and Other Delights. The singles included the title cut, [...] "Lollipops and Roses", and [...] "A Taste of Honey". The latter won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Going Places produced four more singles: [...] "Tijuana Taxi", [...] "Spanish Flea", [...] "Third Man Theme", and [...] "Zorba the Greek". [...] "Tijuana Taxi" [...] and [...] "Spanish Flea" [...] would be used in the 1966 Academy Award-winning animated short A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} sensory differences in high pressure vs. heat processed food systems after storage at ambient and refrigerated temperatures as determined by a trained sensory panel. Spanish rice and <b>spaghetti</b> with meat <b>sauce</b> were prepared and treated with heat and with high pressure processing (HHP). A citrus fruit mix consisting of pieces of orange, grapefruit, and pineapple was processed by mild heat and HHP, and heat alone. One day after processing, treated products were tested along with untreated controls. Products were stored at either 22 °C or 3 °C, and tested at 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Sensory testing was done by a panel trained in a QDA-type method, and data was analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods. For <b>spaghetti</b> with meat <b>sauce,</b> significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found between processing methods stored at the same temperature in appearance and texture attributes, with the high pressure processed samples closer to unstored product than those treated by heat. Differences in treatments first appeared in 'dry appearance' at 10 days, and by 120 days there were differences in 'tomato integrity', 'pasta integrity', 'brightness of color', and 'firmness of pasta' as well. Most of these differences were due to the stickiness caused by the extra amylose leaking out of the heat treated pasta over time. For Spanish rice, there were {{no statistically significant differences}} between samples processed by the two methods and stored at the same temperature. The Spanish rice was formulated with parboiled rice, which allows very little amylose leakage, so it did not show amylose-related effects as the <b>spaghetti</b> with meat <b>sauce</b> did. The fruit mix processed with HPP and mild heat had significantly higher ratings in appearance attributes 'brightness of color' and piece integrity', and lower ratings in 'cooked' descriptors than product treated with heat alone stored at the same temperature...|$|R
