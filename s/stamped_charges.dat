40|$|An {{abstract}} of no {{more than}} 200 words The blending of coals as practiced for <b>stamp</b> <b>charged</b> coke making is determined primarily by technical factors and secondary by economic factors. The most common problem in <b>stamp</b> <b>charged</b> coal blending is whether to adjust an operational blend, a common need is to predict the effect on oven health. In <b>stamp</b> <b>charged</b> coke making, push force is a bottleneck for smooth operation of coke oven battery to produce superior quality of coke. In the present study, the relation between dilation characteristics of the coal blends has been investigated by the Audibert-Arnu Dilatometry test. The behavior of different coal blends has been studied {{to determine the effects of}} dilation of coal blend on coke CSR and push force. Coke plant data have been used for assessing the impact of dilation of coal blend on coke CSR and oven health. Results showed that dilation of coals blend is important parameters for controlling the coke quality and push force. The influence of some other important parameter on coke quality was also made in this study...|$|R
40|$|A nanolithographic technique, electrophoretic {{printing}} lithography (EPL), {{is developed}} to generate heterogeneous biomolecular nanopatterns. By applying electric potentials on metal nanoelectrodes on a <b>stamp,</b> <b>charged</b> nanoparticles coated with distinct biomolecules are assembled onto the nanoelectrodes by electrophoretic deposition to generate heterogeneous biomolecular nanopatterns, which {{can then be}} printed from the stamp to a biocompatible polymer film (see image) ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that John Bourke, Receiver General of Stamp Dues in Ireland was the first collector. In 1774 he assembled a book of the existing embossed revenue stamps, ranging in value from 6 pounds to half a penny, as well as the hand <b>stamped</b> <b>charge</b> marks that were used with them. His collection is preserved in Dublin.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, two Airport <b>Charge</b> <b>stamps</b> with face values 800/- and US$10 and two Seaport <b>Charge</b> <b>stamps</b> wiith face {{values of}} 300/- and US$5 were issued. The Airport Charge 800/- (and {{possibly}} the other value) also exist with a handstamped surcharge 1000/-.|$|R
50|$|In 1825 Beaumont {{fought against}} the Board of <b>Stamps,</b> which <b>charged</b> his company with defrauding the Inland Revenue, and came off victorious. In 1835 he founded the Provident Institution or Bank for Savings in London's Covent Garden district.|$|R
50|$|The {{provisional}} {{government of the}} territory also established or licensed a private dispatch service, which provided mail service from the Territorial Post Office to the nearest U.S. Post Office. This private service issued a two cent <b>stamp</b> to <b>charge</b> for its services.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{density of}} the coal charge plays an {{important}} role in the coke quality. The increase of the bulk density usually improves the coke strength due to increased coal particle contact and increased coke density. There are a few possibilities to increase the coal charge bulk density: adjusting the grain size distribution or moisture content (drying), oil addition and mechanical treatment (e. g., partial briquetting or stamping). A renewed interest in <b>stamp</b> <b>charging</b> cokemaking technology has been observed in recent years, especially in Asia, but also in Europe (Poland, Germany and Ukraine). The paper presents the results of studies on the effects of selected factors on the coal cake density and mechanical strength i. e. stamping energy, coal type, water content and crushing fineness. There is possibility to influence these parameters in industrial conditions. The investigations were carried out with use of mechanical stamping apparatus and strength testing machine specially designed for this purpose...|$|R
25|$|Hill’s {{ideas for}} postage <b>stamps</b> and <b>charging</b> paid-postage based upon weight soon took hold, and were adopted in many {{countries}} throughout the world. With the new policy of charging by weight, using envelopes for mailing documents became the norm. Hill’s brother Edwin Hill invented a prototype envelope-making machine that folded paper into envelopes quickly enough to match {{the pace of the}} growing demand for postage stamps.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stamp</b> duty is <b>charged</b> on the {{conveyance}} {{of residential}} property, non-residential property, and long leases, {{and also on}} company share transfers, bank cheques and cards (i.e. ATM cards and credit cards), and insurance policies.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stamp</b> duty is <b>charged</b> as a {{percentage}} of the consideration paid for immovable property, including goodwill attached to a business. A stamp duty return must be completed online for all such conveyances; physical stamps are no longer attached to documents.|$|R
5000|$|Sweden {{currently}} issues three {{forms of}} NVI valid for letters within Sweden {{of up to}} 20 g. These stamps may be combined when {{the weight of a}} letter exceeds 20 g. For up to 100 g - use two stamps; for up to 250 g - use 4 stamps; 500 g - 6 stamps; 1 kg - 8 stamps; 2 kg - 12 <b>stamps.</b> These <b>charges</b> only apply to regular letters - surcharges apply to bulkier letters. The Swedish name for NVI stamps is [...] "valörlösa frimärken".|$|R
5000|$|Justice Mulk presided {{and heard}} the Mukhtār Mā'ī case—the {{controversial}} and highly publicized case regarded a gang rape that occurred in 2002. Mulk's judgement held Jirga, facilitated by four male, responsible for the rape while assisted the main accused but didn’t find sufficient evidence to <b>stamp</b> the <b>charge</b> of gang-rape on the accused. He reportedly penned his judgement that [...] "Jirgas cannot be allowed to arbitrarily punish {{in the form of}} watta satta marriages and gang-rape to settle disputes without being answerable to the law.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stamp</b> duty is <b>charged</b> on the {{transfer}} of shares and certain securities {{at a rate of}} 0.5 percent. Modernised versions of stamp duty, stamp duty land tax and stamp duty reserve tax, are charged respectively on {{the transfer}} of real property and shares and securities, at rates of up to 4 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.|$|R
50|$|With these <b>stamps,</b> {{additional}} delivery <b>charges</b> to addresses in rural villages, not {{served by a}} local post office, were paid. The sender could choose to pre-pay the <b>charge.</b> The Landpost <b>stamps</b> were not regular Postage Due stamps, although their use as such, and for other charges, is also known. They should have been stuck on the reverse, but are often seen on the front.|$|R
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper examines eight potential measures {{to encourage the}} uptake of more fuel efficient, low carbon emission vehicles. They are: • CO 2 emission targets for new light vehicles (voluntary or mandatory) • Differential registration and <b>stamp</b> duty <b>charges</b> for new light vehicles based on CO 2 emissions • Direct financial incentives for low emission vehicles • Fleet purchasing frameworks which incorporate CO 2 reduction objectives • Inclusion of fuel consumption and CO 2 data in new vehicle advertisements • International standards/labelling requirements for non-engine components which impact on CO 2 emissions • An environmental rating scheme for heavy vehicles • A technology demonstration scheme for Australian commercial road transport fleets linked to CO 2 outcomes...|$|R
50|$|Taking a cash or {{personal}} loan from {{a financial institution}} in Namibia is particularly very expensive because the loan repayment includes several fees such as <b>Stamp</b> duties, Namfisa <b>Charges,</b> Credit life insurance, Bank admin fees, Administration fees, Finance charges and Value Added Tax (VAT)". The banking business in Namibia {{is one of the}} most profitable business and banks are making hundreds of millions out of a tiny 2.1 Million Namibian population.|$|R
25|$|Property {{taxes are}} usually charged on a {{recurrent}} basis (e.g., yearly). A {{common type of}} property tax is an annual charge on the ownership of real estate, where the tax base is the estimated value of the property. For a period of over 150 years from 1695 a window tax was levied in England, {{with the result that}} one can still see listed buildings with windows bricked up in order to save their owners money. A similar tax on hearths existed in France and elsewhere, with similar results. The two most common type of event driven property taxes are <b>stamp</b> duty, <b>charged</b> upon change of ownership, and inheritance tax, which is imposed in many countries on the estates of the deceased.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, for {{the first}} time in his life, Sperati came into {{conflict}} with the law. A shipment marked as valuable from Sperati to a stamp dealer in Lisbon, Portugal was intercepted by French customs. It contained several falsified German <b>stamps.</b> They <b>charged</b> him with [...] "exporting capital" [...] without a licence and trying to avoid customs payments. He protested his innocence, and explained to the police that it contained only copies of valuable stamps, which he himself had prepared, whereupon the police called in the country's best stamp experts to clear up the facts of the case. These experts came to the judgment that the stamps in question were all originals, and very valuable ones at that. Sperati still managed to convince the police that they were fakes, and was therefore charged with fraud. His trial took place in April 1948.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Hüffelsheim gave {{itself a}} new coat of arms. Hüffelsheim {{had had no}} arms of its own until that time. All that was known before these arms was an old court seal with Saint Lambert’s image. In Prussian times, the Prussian Eagle graced the seal and the {{municipal}} <b>stamps.</b> The <b>charges</b> borne in the arms refer to Hüffelsheim’s only local legend, the one that tells of the drink from the boot. The bunch of grapes also stands for the wine made in Hüffelsheim. The three buckles stand for the Family Boos von Waldeck, one of whose members figures in the legend. The boot, according to legend, was the drinking vessel used by a knight Boos to partake of wine - a fair amount, given that the legend says that he drank a whole bootful - and he thereby {{earned the right to}} acquire Hüffelsheim for himself and his family.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food <b>stamp</b> program for <b>charging</b> families {{that had no}} income. Freeman deflected, [...] "Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income." [...] Kennedy replied, [...] "I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [...] here back down there with some of your people... Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?" [...] Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to SDLT on {{the purchase price}} for land, SDLT is also charged when a lease is granted. Any premium for the grant is charged to SDLT at the same rates as for the purchase price for a sale of land; SDLT is also charged on the rent payable under the lease, {{at the rate of}} 1% of the (discounted) net present value of rent passing under the whole term of the lease. Previously, <b>stamp</b> duty was <b>charged</b> at rate of up to 24% of the annual rent. The amount of SDLT due on the grant of a typical commercial lease generally amounts to a substantial increase from the amount of stamp duty that would have been due previously.|$|R
5000|$|Karadi {{approaches}} {{painting with}} a self-conscious intuition; recently her monographic technique lends to a magnetic immediacy composed of kinetic gesture and mark making. The residue of masking tape, cardboard and oil based black ink leaves a highly <b>charged</b> <b>stamp</b> on the canvas, a painting once removed yet-recognizable in its notably loaded entropy. Her {{body of work}} using this process refers to the abandoned Oak Park Mall in Austin, Minnesota where the artist has maintained her studio since early 2014. The [...] "OPM" [...] series reflects on the ghostlike and ephemeral narrative that is often the conceptual root of Karadi's practice. The artist's paintings account for and retain a distilled mystery with a visual language of striking gesture that claims the essence from something perhaps esoteric yet sharply felt.|$|R
50|$|Stamp duty {{remains in}} force for shares and {{securities}} that {{are held in}} certificated form {{which can only be}} transferred by using a physical stock transfer form, and runs in parallel to SDRT on agreements to transfer shares. Since 1986, both stamp duty and SDRT have been charged at a rate of 0.5% of the consideration for the transfer of shares (in the case of stamp duty, rounded up to the nearest £5). The same transaction may include an agreement to transfer shares which may trigger a liability to SDRT, and the agreement may later be completed by a transfer of the shares which is liable to stamp duty. Provided that the transfer is stamped within 6 years, the charge to SDRT is cancelled to avoid a double <b>charge.</b> <b>Stamp</b> duty on repurchases of shares with a value of less than £1000 was abolished from 13 March 2008.|$|R
40|$|Citation: Carnell, Fannie. The free coinage of silver. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1897. Introduction: It is {{important}} to understand clearly and exactly what the free coinage of silver under present conditions means. It is the right of anyone to deposit silver at the limited State’s mint and have every 3711 / 4 grains of pure silver <b>stamped</b> free of <b>charge,</b> One Dollar, which dollar shall be full legal tender at its face value in payment of debts and obligations of all kinds, public and private in the United States. Why do we need this free and unlimited coinage of silver? Is it going to benefit the American people? If so, how? Let us first consider how it will benefit the West. There are a great many reasons peculiar to its resources and environment which justify the desire of the west for free silver. The term “The West” comprises by far the vaster portion of the union, tuning with unbounded natural resources, and occupied by millions of enterprising and industrious peoples. Conceded to be the granary of the world, it is at once the metallic treasure house of the nation and the principal source of food supply. Its annual yield of grain, livestock, wool, and metals, is far in excess of two billion dollars. It furnishes the great lines of transportation with the bulk of their business and equips our manufactories with much of the raw material essential to their continued exploration...|$|R
40|$|It became {{necessary}} to liberalise or introduce competition principles {{to the electric}} energy and gas sectors due to their organisational form (monopolies) and burdens carried by their customers. Generally speaking, the liberalisation process in most EU countries was commenced when the directive concerning common principles governing the internal electricity market No. 96 / 92 /EC and the directive concerning common principles of the internal gas market No. 98 / 30 /EC were adopted. The directives regulated, in particular, such issues as transmission, distribution and trade in electric energy and gas, principles of organisation of sectors, a principle {{of access to the}} market (negotiated access to the system, regulated access to the system, and the single buyer model), rights and duties of distribution systems operators. The directives introduced a principle of gradual opening oľ markets, however, some member countries decided to accept considerably bigger quantities in comparison with those specified in the directives. Implementation of provisions contained in the directives released a downward trend in dynamics of electric energy and gas prices in most member countries. Despite it the introduction of competition rules to these sectors comes across difficulties. It is due not only to technical barriers (lack of a sufficient number of cross-border links) but also, for instance, to the fact that electric energy and gas are treated as goods the access to which should be guaranteed for all those interested in it. An additional problem is also the cost of access to a network, level and differentiation of transmission <b>charges</b> (post <b>stamp</b> model, distance <b>charges,</b> zone payments) in particular countries, which leads to the pancaking of transmission charges. It should be noted that liberalisation brings about major changes in economic situation of particular companies operating in the market of electric energy and gas, which involves their restructuring and primarily reduction of employment in these sectors. The liberalisation process is spread over years and necessitates numerous adjustments in organisational and legal fields. Its expression is a cycle of regulators’ meetings focussed on assessing steps taken by the member countries. Zadanie pt.
