5000|$|Entering {{their final}} regular-season {{game against the}} Colorado Rockies on October 3, the Astros needed a win to clinch a playoff spot. Although Roger Clemens was {{scheduled}} as the starting pitcher for that game, he was sidelined by a stomach virus, forcing manager Phil Garner to press Backe into <b>starting</b> <b>duty</b> {{the morning of the}} game. Backe performed well on his short notice, surrendering only 2 runs over 5 innings as the Astros beat the Rockies 5-3 and edged out the San Francisco Giants for the team's first playoff berth since [...]|$|E

In 2002, he was injured again, {{prompting}} him to petition the NCAA for a medical redshirt, giving him a sixth year of eligibility.

5000|$|He {{made the}} Pittsburgh Steelers roster after the team's 1990 {{training}} camp {{and moved to}} Plum. Strzelczyk played on the Steelers special teams during his first two seasons. However, when right tackle Tunch Ilkin was injured and missed four games in 1992, Strzelczyk leaped into <b>starting</b> <b>duty.</b> He then started 75 of the 133 games he played and started at every line position, except center. During games, he would pick up the red phone on the Steelers' sideline and scream at the team's offensive coordinator, from Ron Erhardt to Chan Gailey to Ray Sherman: [...] "Run the damn ball!" [...] He {{played a key role}} in getting the Steelers to Super Bowl XXX.|$|E

5000|$|In August 1940, the Reds {{were stunned}} when Willard Hershberger, backup catcher to future Baseball Hall of Famer Ernie Lombardi, {{committed}} suicide in his Boston hotel room. The 40-year-old Wilson came off the coaching lines and joined the active roster, serving as the club's third catcher behind Lombardi and rookie Bill Baker. He played three games in August, but then in September Lombardi injured his ankle, and Wilson was pressed into <b>starting</b> <b>duty.</b> Splitting time with Baker and Dick West, Wilson played in 16 games during the pennant race, batting [...]243. When Lombardi was unable to return for more than spot duty in the 1940 World Series, Wilson came through, batting [...]353 in six games and playing {{a key role in}} Cincinnati's defeat of the Detroit Tigers, four games to three, for the world championship.|$|E
5000|$|Piazza {{was signed}} to a {{long-term}} deal, Hundley finally became healthy {{enough to catch}} again and was packaged in a three-team deal that netted the Mets Armando Benitez and Roger Cedeno, Castillo {{was traded to the}} St. Louis Cardinals to serve as a part-time starter behind the plate, and the Mets re-signed Pratt to a minor league contract with an invitation to Spring Training. Without anyone else in his way, Pratt easily won the backup job to Piazza. He played in 71 games and batted [...]293. The Mets finished the season with 96 wins, behind the Braves but tied with the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card race. The two teams played a one-game playoff which the Mets won on the strength of a complete game, two-hit shutout by Al Leiter, allowing the Mets to win the National League Wild Card. Piazza injured his thumb in the NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, pressing Pratt into <b>starting</b> <b>duty</b> for the final two games of the series. The Mets won game three behind Rick Reed, and Pratt came up big in game four, hitting a walk-off solo homer against Matt Mantei in extra innings to clinch the series for the Mets and send them to the NLCS. In game five of the NLCS, Robin Ventura hit {{what appeared to be a}} game-winning grand slam in the 16th inning that would have sent the series back to Atlanta. Pratt (who was supposed to be running the bases) was the first Met to embrace Ventura. Since Ventura only touched first base, he was officially credited with a single, referred to jokingly as a [...] "Grand Slam Single". The Mets, however, lost the NLCS to the Braves in six games. Pratt became a free agent at the end of the year.|$|E

50|$|Before the 2012-13 {{campaign}} started, Unnerstall {{agreed to}} a new deal until 2015.

50|$|The {{following}} season saw Gibson {{traded to}} the Islanders {{as part of a}} package deal for Michael Grabner, leaving an empty roster spot on the Marlies. Sparks succeeded in retaining the job, and served as the backup to Bibeau to start the season. However, an injury to Jonathan Bernier on the Leafs forced management to call up Bibeau, leaving Sparks with the <b>starting</b> <b>duties.</b> Sparks took off with the job, and was named the AHL's 1st star of the week for November 8, 2015. Sparks had stopped 96 of 101 shots faced during his time as the starter in Bibeau's absence, which was good enough to hold <b>starting</b> <b>duties</b> once Bibeau returned. When injury once again plagued the Maple Leafs, this time falling on James Reimer, Sparks was called up, in reward for his recent solid play.|$|R

50|$|In {{training}} camp the next season, Legace beat out Wregget to establish {{himself as the}} backup goaltender to Chris Osgood.

However, Osgood regained his stride and resumed <b>starting</b> <b>duties</b> in the playoffs.|$|R
