5|$|Auburn, like Virginia Tech, {{had gone}} 8–5 during the 2003 college {{football}} season, {{and entered the}} 2004 season with high expectations. The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme—the West Coast offense—and boasted two highly rated running backs on offense. In its {{first game of the}} 2004 season, the 18th-ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the University of Louisiana-Monroe, 31–0. It was Auburn's first shutout since 2002. One week later, the Tigers backed up their good <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> emphatic 43–14 victory over Southeastern Conference foe Mississippi State University. In the third week of the season, Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season, against the fourth-ranked Louisiana State Tigers. In a hard-fought defensive struggle, Auburn won, 10–9, when a missed extra point was replayed after a penalty.|$|E

He returned to Lancashire League cricket with Todmorden in the 1957 season.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of actions}} on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an {{arbitrary}} category: <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> object X of some category, and then define an action on X as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of X. If X has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above {{can be carried}} over. For example, if we take the category of vector spaces, we obtain group representations in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|To achieve {{high-resolution}} in electron microscopes {{and other}} electron beam instruments (such {{as those used}} for electron beam lithography), {{it is helpful to}} <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first electron microscope (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970, using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an early field emission gun.|$|E

25|$|A {{completely}} different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise {{take too much}} time or memory. The idea is to <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> initial approximation to the solution (which {{does not have to}} be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of iterative methods.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies won the tost {{and decided}} to field. New Zealand {{got off to a}} good <b>start,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> opening {{partnership}} of 106 between Lou Vincent and captain Stephen Fleming. Nathan Astle continued his fine form, with 81 runs. Debutant Ross Taylor made 15 off ten balls before being runout. Some late hitting from Brendon McCullum got New Zealand past the 300 mark. Chris Gayle and Fidel Edwards were the West Indies best bowlers, with respective figures of 3-50 and 0-23, with each bowling 10 overs.|$|E
25|$|In the semifinals, India {{played the}} {{surprise}} package of the tournament, Kenya, at Durban. The match was not dramatic. Tendulkar (83 from 101 balls, 5 fours, 1 six) and Ganguly (111 from 114 balls, 5 fours, 5 sixes) took India to 270/4 in their 50 overs, from where a combined bowling effort from India's bowlers got Kenya all out for 179.

25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{provides a}} more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a tosylate or triflate). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a dehydrohalogenation. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see Zaitsev's rule). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is anti to the leaving group, even though {{this leads to the}} less stable Z-isomer.|$|E
25|$|The Kadambas were {{followers}} of Vedic Hinduism. The founder, Mayurasharma was a Brahmin by birth but later his successors changed their surname to Varma {{to indicate their}} Kshatriya status but they used to marry brahmins only. Some Kadamba kings like Krishna Varma performed the Ashwamedha (horse sacrifice). Their Talagunda inscription starts with an invocation of Lord Shiva while the Halmidi and Banavasi inscriptions <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> invocation of Lord Vishnu. They built the Madhukesvara temple which is considered their family deity. Many records like the Kudalur, Sirsi records speak of grants made by them to scholarly Brahmins. Grants were also made to Buddhist viharas.|$|E

In addition, if the first name or initial is mentioned, 'de' or 'van' <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower case letter. If the first name or initial is absent, the prefixes <b>start</b> <b>with</b> capitals (Jan de Vries/J. de Vries versus meneer ('Mister') De Vries/De Vries).|$|R
