5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E

5|$|Obama {{and others}} paid homage to Lincoln {{in the form}} of tributes and {{references}} during several of the events, starting with a commemorative train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Washington,D.C. on January 17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21, 2009, included concerts, a national day of community service on MartinLuther King,Jr. Day, the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith inaugural prayer service. The presidential oath as administered to Obama during his <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the United States Constitution, which led to its re‑administration the next day.|$|E
5|$|The pier's {{primary role}} was ceremonial. It was the {{traditional}} landing place of successive governors, who would arrive at Central {{on board the}} official Governor's Yacht which would dock at Queen's Pier. From the 1960s, governors would inspect a guard of honour at Edinburgh Place, followed by the <b>swearing-in</b> at City Hall.|$|E

5000|$|On January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence {{became the}} 48th Vice President of the United States, sworn {{into the office}} by Justice Clarence Thomas, using Ronald Reagan's Bible, opened to , [...] "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land", {{which is the same}} verse Reagan used for his <b>swearing-ins</b> as {{governor}} and President. Pence also used his personal Bible which he opens every morning.|$|R
500|$|By 2015, {{a series}} of <b>swearings-in</b> and other events where Biden placed his hands on women and girls and talked closely to them had {{attracted}} the attention of both the press and social media. In one case, a senator issued a statement afterward saying about his daughter, [...] "No, she doesn't think the vice president is creepy." [...] On January 17, 2015, Secret Service agents heard shots were fired as a vehicle drove near Biden's Delaware residence at 8:28p.m. outside the security perimeter, but the vice president and his wife, Jill were not home. A vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed.|$|R
50|$|Today, the Istana is the {{official}} residence of the President of Singapore. However, no presidents nor cabinet ministers have lived there since 1959. The villas, which {{are meant to be}} used for foreign heads of state, are used rarely. The Istana building and its grounds {{are open to the public}} on five selected statutory holidays - Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, Labour Day and National Day. Due to the closeness of Deepavali and Hari Raya Puasa in some years, the grounds of the Istana are sometimes open only once during this period in commemoration of both public holidays. The grounds are also often used for state functions and ceremonial occasions such as <b>swearings-in,</b> investitures and the presentation of credentials by heads of foreign missions. The Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Minister Mentor have their offices in the Istana Annex.|$|R
5|$|He {{was sworn}} into the 107th Congress on October 23, 2001. The {{ceremony}} had been delayed for a weekend, as the 2001 anthrax attacks {{had led to}} a shutdown of Congressional office buildings.

5|$|In July 2003 general {{elections}} were held again, and the CPP won. However, {{they failed to}} secure two-thirds of all parliamentary seats, {{as required by the}} constitution to form a new government. The two runner-up parties of the election, FUNCINPEC and SRP, blocked the CPP from doing so. Instead, in August 2003 they filed complaints with the Constitutional Council over alleged electoral irregularities. After their complaints were rejected, FUNCINPEC and SRP threatened to boycott the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony of parliamentarians. Sihanouk coaxed both parties to change their decision, stating that he would abstain from presiding over the ceremony as well if they did not comply with his wishes. Both parties eventually backed off from their threats, and the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony was held in October 2003, with Sihanouk in attendance. The CPP, FUNCINPEC, and SRP held additional talks into 2004 to break the political stalemate, but to no avail. At the same time, Sihanouk proposed a unity government jointly led by politicians from all three political parties, which Hun Sen and Ranariddh both rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|The new plaza {{created in}} 1967 {{is used for}} worship and public gatherings, {{including}} Bar mitzvah celebrations and the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces.

25|$|Today, the Istana is the {{official}} residence of the President of Singapore. However, no presidents nor cabinet ministers have lived there after the tenure of Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore. The villas, which {{are meant to be}} used for foreign heads of state, are used rarely. The Istana building and its grounds {{are open to the public}} on five selected statutory holidays– Chinese New Year, Deepavali, Hari Raya Puasa, Labour Day and National Day.

5|$|The <b>swearing-in</b> {{ceremony}} and the inaugural luncheon for President-elect Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of United States Senators Dianne Feinstein, committee chair, Bob Bennett and Harry Reid, and United States Representatives John Boehner, Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi. The committee is {{overseen by the}} U.S.Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.|$|E
5|$|Based on its {{fundraising}} {{efforts and}} crowd {{estimates for the}} Obama inauguration, the presidential committee set its budget at $160–$170million for the inauguration, including about $45million for the gala events. The federal government contributed about $49million, including $1.2million to cover the actual <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony. The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million alone for police, fire and medical services. To help fund the efforts, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency as a precaution so that funds could be sought from Federal Emergency Management Agency.|$|E
5|$|Nine weeks later, {{with neither}} side winning the {{majority}} of electors, the House (now Republican-controlled) will decide the President and the Senate (Democrat-controlled) for the Vice President, the first instance of this happening since the 1824 presidential election aftermath. Claire eventually wins when Donald Blythe issues a bill to block any filibuster of coming onto the floor; while the house couldn't reach a majority. In the meantime, Claire is sworn in as Acting President of the United States and begins to exert her limited power by excluding Frank from certain presidential functions, such as the <b>swearing-in</b> of the new Justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} company Akamai reported that 5,401,250web users logged on news sites {{in less than}} one minute, the fifth highest peak among news websites since the company started tracking data in 2005. During at-peak usage, news websites served seven million simultaneous video streams, which was {{the highest number of}} simultaneous video streams in Akamai's history. The Obama inaugural ceremony not only achieved the highest Internet viewership for a U.S.presidential inauguration, the inaugural event was the first to feature a live audio description of a <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony and the first to include closed captioning in the live webcast of the event.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the Presidential Inaugural Committee increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened {{the entire length of}} the National Mall as the public viewing area for the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|Julie Couillard {{began dating}} Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier in April 2007. The media started {{covering}} her in August, when {{she wore a}} revealing dress to Bernier's <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant-dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007 but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Their relationship {{became the subject of}} a political scandal which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography, telling her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; {{and with the help of}} journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she wrote My Story in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Inaugural Committee {{and members}} of the 111th U.S.Congress {{distributed}} invitations and color-coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections on or near the U.S.Capitol grounds to view the <b>swearing-in</b> ceremony. Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses, but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S.politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry. House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‑come, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{mandatory}} at the <b>swearing-in</b> of the President of Russia, for {{opening and closing}} sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio {{at the beginning and}} end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{visited the}} {{president}} at the White House {{for the first time}} as an ally on January 19, 1941, the evening before Roosevelt's third <b>swearing-in.</b> The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain, and Willkie accepted. Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie, and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening. Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins, both in London on missions from Roosevelt, and gave his former rival a letter to be hand-delivered to the British prime minister, Winston Churchill. At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad; McNary, with considerable influence in foreign affairs, had never left North America. Thus, there was much public attention to Willkie's mission. He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, after the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Leane advocated for the introduction of radio communications into the police, stressing the need for quick response in cases of civil emergency. On 18 June 1940, Leane was appointed as {{the commander of the}} Returned and Services League-organised Volunteer Defence Corps (VDC) in South Australia, an organisation similar to the Home Guard in the United Kingdom. Within two weeks, more than 2,000 returned World War I servicemen had enlisted in the VDC. In response to {{the outbreak of}} war, by July 1940 Leane had authorised the <b>swearing-in</b> of 3,000 special constables to guard vulnerable points and industry against fifth column elements. On 19 October, Leane commanded a parade of more than 5,000 VDC members, including 2,000 who had travelled from country areas. By February 1941, the VDC had increased to a strength of 8,000 men. During World War II, South Australia was the only state to permit members of the police to enlist in the armed forces, but this was withdrawn after Japan entered the war, due to the need to maintain police numbers. In July 1943, Leane's appointment as VDC commander was extended for twelve months, {{despite the fact that he}} had reached the normal Army retirement age of 65. On 30 June 1944, Leane retired as police commissioner, and was replaced by William Francis Johns, a serving superintendent.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the <b>swearing-in</b> of the jury and {{introductions}} from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E
