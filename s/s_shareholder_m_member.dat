40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{underlying}} determinants of home bias using a comprehensive sample of U. S. investor holdings of foreign stocks. We document that U. S. cross-listings are economically important, as U. S. ownership {{in a foreign}} firm roughly doubles upon cross-listing in the United States. We explore the cross-sectional variation in this ―cross-listing effect ‖ and show that increases in U. S. investment are largest in firms from weak accounting backgrounds and in firms that are otherwise informationally opaque, indicating that U. S. investors value the improvements in disclosure associated with cross-listing. We confirm that relative equity valuations rise for cross-listed stocks, and provide evidence suggesting that valuation increases are {{due in part to}} increases in U. <b>S.</b> <b>shareholder</b> demand and in part {{to the fact that the}} equities become more attractive to non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>shareholders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Can {{shareholder}} voting prevent managers from destroying {{value in}} corporate acquisitions? Previous studies based on U.

We {{find that in}} the U. K. shareholders gain 8 cents per dollar at announcement with mandatory voting, or $ 13. 6 billion over 1992 - 2010 in aggregate; without voting, U. K. shareholders lost $ 3 billion. U. <b>S.</b> <b>shareholders</b> lost $ 214 billion in matched deals.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{investor}} recognition and bonding {{associated with a}} U. S. cross-listing are distinct effects using a sample of Canadian firms. In contrast to the post-listing decline documented in the literature, we find that cross-listed firms with a single class of shares enjoy a permanent increase in valuation if they attract and maintain investor recognition over time. Valuations of firms that fail to widen their U. <b>S.</b> <b>shareholder</b> base return to pre-listing levels within two years. Cross-listed firms with dual-class shares exhibit a permanent increase in valuation regardless {{of the level of}} U. S. investor holdings, consistent with firm-level bonding. The Author 2008.

40|$|American {{corporations}} earn a {{large and}} growing share of their profits from their foreign operations. This paper evaluates the effect of foreign earnings on dividend payments by American corporations. The {{results suggest that the}} effect may be rather dramatic: that, all other things equal, U. S. corporations pay dividends out of foreign earnings at rates that are three times higher than their payout rates from domestic earnings. Why firms do so is unclear, though this behavior may be consistent with a signaling view of dividends. There is a curious tax consequence of this high payout rate on foreign earnings: the tax system, which grants foreign tax credits to U. S. corporations for the foreign taxes they pay, may receive more revenue from taxing the dividends of U. <b>S.</b> <b>shareholders</b> than from the corporate tax on foreign earnings. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{cumulative}} application of U. S. takeover rules it is common practice to exclude U. <b>S.</b> <b>shareholders</b> from tender offers. To this end, bidders usually avoid publicising the offer in the United States or among U. S. residents (restrictions on dissemination) and they may even regard acceptances on the part of U. S. residents as void (restrictions on acceptance). However, such restrictions could be at odds with the principle of equal treatment of target’s shareholders or with the mandatory bid rule, provided for by the EU Takeover Directive as well as by Member States’ domestic laws. This article sets out to demonstrate that only restrictions on dissemination might be reconcilable with the equality principle. Restrictions on acceptance, on the contrary, represent a clear violation of that principle, admissible only if the cumulative application of U. S. law would make the offer unfeasible...|$|R
