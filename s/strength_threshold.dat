40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether relationships between upper leg muscle 			strength and activity limitations are non-linear {{in patients with}} 			knee osteoarthritis, and, if so, to determine muscle <b>strength</b> 			<b>thresholds</b> for limitations in daily activities. 			Design: Baseline data were used for 562 patients with knee osteoarthritis in 			the Amsterdam-Osteoarthritis cohort. Upper leg muscle strength 			(Nm/kg) was measured isokinetically. Activity limitations were 			measured with the timed Get Up and Go test and timed Stair Climb 			Test, subdivided into stair-ascent and stair-descent. Linear and 			non-linear relationships between muscle strength and activity 			limitations were evaluated, and thresholds were determined. 			Results: Non-linear models improved model fit compared with linear models. 			The improvement in percentage variance accounted for was 5. 9, 8. 2 and 			 5. 2 percentage points for the timed Get Up and Go, stair-ascent and 			stair-descent times, respectively. Muscle <b>strength</b> <b>thresholds</b> were 			 0. 93 Nm/kg (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 82 – 1. 04), 0. 89 Nm/kg 			(95 % CI 0. 77 – 1. 02) and 0. 97 Nm/kg (95 % CI 0. 85 – 1. 11) for 			relationships with timed Get Up and Go, stair-ascent and 			stair-descent times, respectively.

Long-term sludge storage tests conducted by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory show that high uranium content K Basin sludge can self-cement and form a strong sludge with a bulk shear strength of up to 65 kPa. Some of this sludge has "paste" and "chunks" with shear strengths of approximately 3 ~ 5 kPa and 380 ~ 770 kPa, respectively. High uranium content sludge samples subjected to hydrothermal testing (e. g., 185 °C, 10 h) have been observed to form agglomerates with a shear strength up to 170 kPa. After interim storage at T Plant, the sludge in the STSCs will be mobilized by water jets impinging the sludge. The objective of the evaluation {{was to determine the}} range of sludge shear strength for which there is high confidence that a water-jet retrieval system can mobilize stored K-Basin sludge from STSCs. The shear strength at which the sludge can be retrieved is defined as the "shear <b>strength</b> <b>threshold</b> of concern. " If the sludge shear strength is greater than the value of the shear <b>strength</b> <b>threshold</b> of concern, a water-jet retrieval system will be unlikely to mobilize the sludge up to the container’s walls. The shear <b>strength</b> <b>threshold</b> of concern can be compared with the range of possible shear strengths of K-Basin stored sludge to determine if the current post interim-storage, water-jet retrieval method is adequate. Fourteen effective cleaning radius (ECR) models were reviewed, and their validity was examined by applying them to Hanford 241 -SY- 101 and 241 -AZ- 101 Tanks to reproduce the measured ECR produced by the mixer pumps. The validation test identified that the Powell- 3 and Crowe- 2 ECR models are more accurate than other ECR models reviewed.

Axon cable models were developed and coupled to finite-element DBS models in three-dimensional (3 -D). Field thresholds (VT, ET, and ∇(2) VT) were derived at the location of activation for various stimulation amplitudes (1 to 5  V), pulse widths (30 to 120  μs), and axon diameters (2. 0 to 7. 5  μm). Results showed that thresholds for VT and ∇(2) VT were highly dependent on the stimulation amplitude while ET were approximately independent of the amplitude for large axons.
