The tiller is <b>straight</b> <b>grained</b> ash. The rudder can be rotated a full 360 degrees if needed.|$|R
25|$|It {{is common}} to find American Windsors made in the 18th century that contain three {{different}} species of wood. Pine, bass or tulip poplar are common for the seat. Non ring porous hardwoods such as Maple are stiff and make crisp turnings, and {{were used for the}} undercarriage. Ring porous species such as Oak, ash, and hickory all rive (split) and steam bend nicely. These <b>woods</b> are also <b>straight</b> <b>grained</b> and flexible and thus work well for slender parts such as the spindles.|$|R

50|$|It is a tree {{growing to}} 30 m tall, with a trunk {{diameter}} of 1 m. The fruit is ovoid, 3 cm long, with five wings not extending beyond the fruit apex. The bark is fire-resistant. The wood is coarse, fairly <b>straight</b> <b>grained,</b> dull to somewhat lustrous {{and without any}} smell or taste. The heartwood varies from light brown with few markings to dark brown or brownish black and figured with darker streaks. The sapwood is reddish white and sharply differentiated. The heartwood is moderately durable and the sapwood is liable to powder-post beetle attack.|$|R
50|$|The timber is pale red, <b>straight</b> <b>grained</b> and pleasantly fragrant. Its major {{qualities are}} that it works well and is {{extremely}} durable, being resistant to attacks from termites, wood boring insects and fungi. For these reasons the timber achieved major economic significance {{during the first three}} decades of the 20th century, when it was high in demand for developing work. Currently the timber is most used in the making of local arts and crafts, fishing boats for Lake Malawi, {{as well as in the}} construction and decoration of many prestigious buildings.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} commercial species, blackbutt is well {{regarded by}} foresters {{for the high}} quality of timber, easy regeneration and quick growth. Uses include making poles, railway sleepers, flooring, building framework, cladding, joinery, lining boards, furniture, woodchipping and decking. Wood density is about 900 kg per cubic metre. The sapwood is resistant to attack by lyctus borers, the heartwood is yellowish brown to light brown. Coarse textured, fairly <b>straight</b> <b>grained,</b> common small gum veins. Hard, strong, tough but not particularly difficult to work. Slow drying of mid to good levels of durability. Blackbutt timber {{is used in the}} flooring of Parliament House, Canberra.|$|R
50|$|MacDougall was an {{accomplished}} amateur musician, who also made violins as a hobby. He added a woodworking corner to his Park office {{where he made}} violins in his spare time. He used his knowledge of woods to good effect and scoured the country looking for scraps of old, fine <b>grained</b> <b>woods</b> which he then traded with professional violin makers for tools and advice. He made over 6 violins which were presented to friends, several of whom were professional players, who appreciated his quality of sound. One {{is still in the}} family.|$|R
50|$|The {{fragrant}} white flowerheads {{and green}} foliage make Grevillea baileyana an attractive garden plant. It prefers a compost-rich, acidic soil with good drainage. It is long-lived in cultivation and usually grows {{no higher than}} 8 to 10 metres (25-35 ft). Although noted for prolific flowering in tropical regions, plants may take many years to produce flowers in temperate areas. It is generally propagated by seed, although some success has been had with cuttings. The white or pinkish <b>grained</b> <b>wood</b> {{can be used in}} wood turning or cabinet making.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of forests full of <b>straight</b> <b>grained</b> conifers {{such as the}} Coast Douglas fir meant that Vancouver Island could provide shipbuilding material suitable for spar making {{in the age of}} sail. The later discovery of coal on the island and at Vancouver's Coal Harbour, meant that the area could also serve as a useful resource in the age of steam as well. Rear-Admiral Robert Lambert Baynes, aware of the political importance of maintaining British sovereignty amidst the San Juan Boundary Dispute and the British Columbia gold rushes recommended to the Admiralty a move of the station headquarters from Valparaíso to Esquimalt in November 1859.|$|R
50|$|Light European {{mountain}} grown spruce {{was used}} to fashion the soundboard in all Knight pianos.The close <b>grained</b> <b>wood</b> used by master luthiers has more resonant characteristics than any other timber and {{is a major factor}} in the sensitive response of the Knight. The finished soundboard was air seasoned, kiln dried, then coated with a special moisture proof varnish, which also enhanced the tonal properties. Knight used a double carved main bridge that was laminated and capped with quarter sawn beech. This method of construction eliminates dissipation of the vibrations which take the line of least resistance and follow the laminations.|$|R
50|$|Hardwoods with tightly <b>grained</b> <b>wood</b> {{and small}} pores {{are best for}} wooden cutting boards. Good {{hardness}} and tight grain help reduce scoring of the cutting surface and absorption of liquid and dirt into the surface. Red oak, even though a hardwood, has large pores which retain dirt even after washing. This makes it a poor choice for cutting-board material. Teak's tight grains and natural coloration make it a highly attractive cutting-board material, both for aesthetic and durability purposes. Teak, a tropical wood, contains tectoquinones, components of natural oily resins that repel moisture, fungi, warping, rot and microbes. Wooden boards can also be refinished with sanding and a reapplication of oil and wax.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} grown in wet areas, {{including}} salt water areas, as a soil stabilizer. E. occidentalis has been cultivated {{in areas with}} an average rainfall of 350 mm rainfall per annum and that experience frosts and periodic drought. It produces a durable wood {{that can be used}} as sawn timber. In countries such as Israel, Morocco, Chile and other countries it is used for many purposes including construction, firewood, charcoal, and pulp. It is cultivated in Australia as a windbreak and shade tree as well as a soil stabilizer in estuaries and wetlands. The species also has potential for apiculture and honey production. It is suitable for cabinet making and construction with the hard, pale tan, <b>straight</b> <b>grained</b> heartwood and durable in damp soils. The air dried density of the wood ranges from 850-1000 kg /m3.|$|R
5000|$|The wood of {{this species}} is highly prized by fine {{furniture}} makers and wooden boat builders. It grows to form a medium size tree in the forests at middle altitudes. The wood of good sized trees is <b>straight</b> <b>grained</b> and dense, golden brown, and not dissimilar to yew (Taxus). It is considered a high value and speciality species by the timber industry. The wood is hard and strong with little shrinkage, bends and works well, and is very durable. The wood is used for railway sleepers, flooring, ship masts, furniture, and cabinet work.It makes an attractive container plant, but is slow growing, and prefers cool, moist, acidic soil indicating it needs constant moisture in containers. [...] Therefore, this species is rare in cultivation, and is limited to botanic gardens and arboreta and a few private gardens.|$|R
