5|$|Both models {{include an}} Apple A8 <b>system-on-chip,</b> and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary {{difference}} between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, {{in comparison to the}} 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One X's {{design is}} a {{revision}} of the Xbox One S hardware, but further streamlined. It uses a <b>system-on-chip</b> (SoC) known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, 9 GB of which is allocated to games. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console will feature a vapor chamber method of cooling for the SoC, and motherboards will be tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage. The console will also support AMD's FreeSync technology on compatible displays.|$|E

25|$|Galaxy S4 models {{use one of}} two processors, {{depending}} on the region and network compatibility. The S4 version for North America, most of Europe, parts of Asia, and other countries contains Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 <b>system-on-chip,</b> containing a quad-core 1.9GHz Krait 300 CPU and an Adreno 320 GPU. The chip also contains a modem which supports LTE. Other models include Samsung's Exynos 5 Octa <b>system-on-chip</b> with a heterogeneous CPU. The octa-core CPU comprises a 1.6GHz quad-core Cortex-A15 cluster and a 1.2GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 cluster. The chip can dynamically switch between the two clusters of cores based on CPU usage; the chip switches to the A15 cores when more processing power is needed, and stays on the A7 cores to conserve energy on lighter loads. Only one of the clusters is used at any particular moment, and software sees the processor as a single quad-core CPU. The SoC also contains an IT tri-core PowerVR SGX 544 graphics processing unit (GPU). Regional models of the S4 vary in support for LTE; for Exynos 5-based models, while the E300K/L/S versions support LTE, with the Cortex-A15 also clocked at 1.6GHz. the GT-I9500 model does not. The S4 GT-I9505 includes a multiband LTE transceiver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new compression technique for testing the intellectual property (IP) cores in <b>system-on-chips.</b> The pattern run-length compression applies the well-known run-length coding to equal and complementary consecutive {{patterns of the}} precomputed test data. No structural information of the IP cores is required by the encoding procedure. A data-independent decompressor can be realized by the embedded processor or on-chip circuitry. The decompressed test set can be flexibly applied to a single-scan or multiple-scan chain of each core-under-test. Experiments on ISCAS- 89 benchmarks show that the new technique results in superior compression performance. The test application time is also significantly reduced.
