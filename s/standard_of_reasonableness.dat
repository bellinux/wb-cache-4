Methodology/approach/design - A theoretical and jurisprudential analysis <b>of</b> the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness,</b> the minimum core and proportionality, used in different jurisdictions for adjudicating claims grounded in the constitutional right to water. Findings - The advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness,</b> the minimum core and proportionality as standards for adjudicating the constitutional right to water. Practical implications - The article shows that the adjudication of the employment {{of the principle of}} proportionality is the best comparative practice concerning the adjudication {{of the constitutional}} right to water.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{enforcement}} of the constitutional right to water.

It shows that proportionality offers more advantages and fewer disadvantages than reasonableness and the minimum core in the circumstances of adjudication of the constitutional right to water.

40|$|Section 39 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria {{guarantees}} {{freedom of}} expression, {{including the right}} to receive and impart information. Also, the domestication of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights' makes the Charter's protections for access to information part of Nigerian law. Indeed, sections 39 (3) and 45 (1) of the Constitution permit restrictions on access to information, but only by 'law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society'. Unfortunately, access to information in Nigeria is heavily circumscribed by statutes that confer absolute powers on the executive to classify information to protect vague 'national security' interests inconsistently with what is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. Underlying this problem are a colonial legacy of administrative secrecy that disdains disclosure of official information and clumsy constitutional rights provisions that accentuate security restrictions rather than the right to information. Using democratic theory as an analytical tool, this thesis advocates for the right of access to information as not just a constitutional value, but also a minimum requirement for the functioning of a democratic society. In so doing, it aims to curtail abuse of executive powers under national security laws that permit limitations on access to information. The thesis uses African human rights <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> to evaluate how national security laws that limit access to information measure against constitutional <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> and justifiability in a democratic society. The thesis finds that constitutional protection and jurisprudential recognition of the right of access to information in Nigeria do not comply with minimum international law requirements. The thesis ultimately suggests that limitation of access to information on grounds of national security must be in the public interest. In striking a balance between access to information and national security, it recommends a sufficient legislative description of 'national security' and clear constitutional framework for access to information, subject to restrictions only where harm to national security is demonstrably greater than access to information...|$|R
