40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe U. S.

The main {{component of the}} <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> range will be a three-mile-long Kevlar cable, fully suspended between two mountains, with an elevation difference of 2450 feet. Test vehicles (targets, test platforms, and retrieval trolleys) will travel along the cable at different speeds and different altitudes that conform to different test requirements. The main electronic support system for the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> range will be the Ground Command and Control System (GCCS). The GCCS is being designed to control targets, retrieval trolleys, test fixtures, and test platforms on the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> range. The GCCS will control up to four vehicles on the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> at the same time. In the long term, {{the goal is to}} control test vehicles of 20, 000 pounds in weight and 550 knots/hour in speed. The initial capability will control targets and test platforms of 10, 000 pounds, at speeds of up to 250 knots/hour. The GCCS will consist of: • Telemetry links to communicate to and from various vehicles • A position measuring system to determine the position of the vehicle on the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> • A control system to generate all commands necessary to activate events in the airborne vehicles • An operator console The control room will have the capability to display the vehicle parameters, meteorological data, lightning prediction data, video and real-time simulation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aerial {{refueling}} hose-and-drogue {{system is a}} special case of a generalized <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> towed system. The present work investigates the effect of pertinent parameters such as the cable tension, tow point disturbance and vortex wake on the dynamic behavior and stability of the generalized model by using the finite element method with an accurate and computationally efficient three-noded, curved beam element. The analysis {{results show that the}} conventional modal and spectrum analysis method is inappropriate for the dynamic stability analysis of the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> towed system. This is because the mechanism of instability due to the tow point disturbance is not the resonance of the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> towed system but the wave propagation downstream along the cable absorbing energy from the airflow when the wave propagation speed is less than the airflow speed. The study also demonstrates that the vortex wake has {{a significant impact on the}} dynamics of the <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> towed system. The short cable system will orbit with the vortex and the orbiting behavior will diminish as the cable length increases...|$|R
50|$|A {{compromise}} between undergrounding and using overhead lines is installing air <b>cables.</b> <b>Aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are insulated cables spun between poles {{and used for}} power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> is that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the cables are damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs - particularly high in rocky areas - of burying. The disadvantages of <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are {{that they have the}} same aesthetic issues as standard overhead lines and that they can be affected by storms. However if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no interruption of service. Electrical hazards are minimised and re-hanging the cables may be possible without power interruption.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> or air {{cable is}} an {{insulated}} cable usually containing all conductors required for an electrical transmission system or a telecommunication line, which is suspended between utility poles or electricity pylons. As <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are completely insulated {{there is no}} danger of electric shock when touching them {{and there is no}} requirement for mounting them with insulators on pylons and poles.A further advantage is they require less right of way than overhead lines for the same reason. They can be designed as shielded cables for telecommunication purposes. If the cable falls, it may still operate if its insulation is not damaged.|$|R
40|$|In this study, two {{polarization}} effects, {{namely the}} state of polarization (SOP) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibre cable are investigated. The change in polarization effects introduces errors in optical fibre communication system. We find that the SOP drifts slowly in buried cables, and rapidly in <b>aerial</b> <b>cables.</b> This is because buried cables are located in a static environment, whereas <b>aerial</b> <b>cables</b> are exposed directly to a dynamic environment. The SOP change in <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> shows significant correlation with its environment (the global radiation, temperature and wind). The autocorrelation function (ACF) was not performed in buried cable, since they do not satisfy the ACF assumption, whereas in <b>aerial</b> <b>cable</b> {{it is found that}} the ACF of the SOP decorrelates quite quickly during the day. The 50 percent decorrelation time during the day and night are 9. 6 and 30. 4 minutes, respectively. During the day the properties of the optical fibre change rapidly {{as a result of the}} rapidly changing environmental conditions, whereas at night the environmental conditions change relatively slowly. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the SOP fluctuations show discrete peaks, which corresponds to the wind induced vibrational frequency of the cable. The PMD fluctuations for undeployed and deployed <b>aerial</b> optical fibre <b>cable</b> are monitored using the generalized interferometric technique (GINTY). It is found that the PMD measured with polarization scrambling is more scattered but more reliable than the PMD measured without polarization scrambling. This is because the PMD obtained with polarization scrambling is averaged over different input and output (I/O) SOP pairs. For deployed <b>aerial</b> <b>cable,</b> it is found that the PMD measured without polarization scrambling fluctuates rapidly during high wind speed conditions. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the measured PMD and the change in temperature. It is found that the change in temperature has a stronger influence than the wind on the PMD of the optical fibre lin...|$|R
