5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on a life of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} sixteenth–ranked Fresno State Bulldogs, led by ninth–year head coach Pat Hill and quarterback Paul Pinegar. The Bulldogs took an early lead on a Pinegar {{touchdown}} pass that was answered by LenDale White's rushing touchdown for the Trojans {{to leave the}} game tied {{at the end of}} the first quarter. After a rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, the Trojans could only answer with a Mario Danelo field goal. A second passing touchdown by Pinegar and another Danelo field goal closed out the half with the Bulldogs leading 21–13. The Trojans <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of the game in the third quarter with a Leinart touchdown run, a Reggie Bush touchdown run, and a Leinart touchdown pass that gave the Trojans a 13-point lead. Pinegar answered for the Bulldogs with his third touchdown pass of the game, but a 50-yard touchdown rush by Bush allowed the Trojans to keep the same lead, Two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, Pinegar's fourth touchdown pass and a second rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, gave them a 1-point lead with nineminutes left in the game. After a 65-yard run by Bush, White scored for the Trojans, who missed on a two–point conversion attempt. A Danelo field goal gave the Trojans a 50–42 lead, and the Trojans won after intercepting Pinegar with a minute left in the game. Bush set a Pac-10 record with 513total yards in the game, including almost 300yards rushing, and the Trojans increased their winning streak to 33games.|$|E
25|$|Pride {{in being}} German {{remained}} a difficult issue; {{one of the}} surprises of the 2006 FIFA World Cup which was held in Germany, were widespread displays of national pride by Germans, which <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> even the Germans themselves by surprise and cautious delight.|$|E

25|$|From 1815, {{after years}} of {{military}} conflict, in full Restoration, Granville <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a new direction.

25|$|Arguably, {{the artistic}} {{frictions}} between Cale and Reed are what shaped the group's early sound {{much more than}} any other members. The pair often had heated disagreements about the direction of the group, and this tension was central to their later collaborations. When Cale left, he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the more experimentalist tendencies with him, as is noticeable in comparing the proto-noise rock of White Light/White Heat (which Cale co-created) to the comparatively dulcet, folk rock-influenced The Velvet Underground, recorded after his departure.|$|E
25|$|A. J. P.

He acted impatiently and on impulse. Previously flexible he now relied on dogma, denouncing Nasser as a second Hitler. Though he claimed to be upholding international law, he in fact disregarded the United Nations Organisation which he had helped to create … The outcome was pathetic rather than tragic”.|$|E
25|$|At about 5:00pm, the {{governor}} gave the royal assent {{to the bill}} in the Legislative Council room, {{in the presence of}} members of both houses of Parliament. Since he was already in town, {{the governor}} decided to also give assent to some forty one other bills passed by the houses and awaiting to be assented. Among those bills was the Rebellion Losses Bill. The assent of this law <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some people by surprise, and the galleries where some visitors were standing became agitated.|$|E

25|$|The Insular Cases <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the view}} that {{aboriginal}} title was constitutionally protected property, at least within the Philippines. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Supreme Court held that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution required compensation for the taking of Indian lands when held in fee simple (as limited by treaty) and treaty title. It took the contrary view with a reservation created by executive order. The taking of reservation land is now acknowledged as a taking.|$|E
25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{year after}} Melville's death, Moby-Dick, along with Typee, Omoo, and Mardi, was reprinted by Harper & Brothers, giving it {{a chance to be}} rediscovered. However, only New York's {{literary}} underground <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> much interest, just enough to keep Melville's name circulating for the next 25 years in the capital of American publishing. During this time, a few critics were willing to devote time, space, and a modicum of praise to Melville and his works, or at least those that could still be fairly easily obtained or remembered. Other works, especially the poetry, went largely forgotten.|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the area}} was {{frequently}} mapped, due to its location on the Sweden-Norway frontier, which has existed since 1273. In that era, the massif was entirely Norwegian, but in 1644, Sweden succeeded in capturing Särna during the Torstenson War. However, in 1645, the Second Treaty of Brömsebro failed to clearly define the frontier, and not until 1751, after negotiations, was the current frontier established. If the wrangling over the border <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> forever, {{all the more so}} since the zone was so trivial. The area around the mountain was not settled until later. This began on the Norwegian side: there was at least one farm at Ljørdalen in 1528. Not until the 18th century did the Swedish part become populated, initially with cabins for transhumance, for example at Mörkret. Virtual villages grew up after the beginning of the 19th century at Gördalen, Storbäcken, Storbron, Hägnåsen, Mörkret, Tjärnvallen and Lillådalen. Many of the park trails date from this era of transhumance.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld {{decided not}} to wear his glasses {{in the first round}} of the 2015 World Championship and took out {{finishes}} of 167 and 170 in beating Rowby-John Rodriguez 3–0. He was then involved in three successive matches in which there was never a set between Van Barneveld and his opponent as he edged past Jamie Caven 4–3, Adrian Lewis 4–3 (Lewis missed one match dart) and Stephen Bunting 5–4. In the Bunting match he returned from a break after the fourth set with his glasses on explaining afterwards that the board was looking blurry. Van Barneveld looked to have got himself back into his semi-final meeting with Phil Taylor when he recovered from 2–0 down to draw level, but his lengthy previous matches <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> effect as he could not win another set to be defeated 6–2. At the Masters he knocked out newly crowned world champion Gary Anderson 11–6 in the semi-finals, but was beaten by a reversal of this scoreline against Michael van Gerwen in the final.|$|E
25|$|Carl Froch lost in {{the final}} of the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament in a {{dramatic}} bout against undefeated WBA super-middleweight champion Andre Ward. The vacant The Ring super-middleweight title would be on the line in the fight, as well as Froch and Ward's super-middleweight titles. In the first 7 rounds, Ward outboxed Froch, successfully using his jab to neutralize Froch and beating Froch to the punch from a distance and at close range. In the later rounds, Ward <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his foot off the gas, leaving Froch to win a couple of rounds {{near the end of the}} fight, though they were close and fairly competitive rounds. The judges scorecards were 115–113, 115–113 and 118–110, all in favor of Ward. Ward won the vacant The Ring super-middleweight title and is also regarded as becoming Lineal champion with his Super Six World Boxing Classic win against Froch, despite some independent sources rating undefeated IBF title holder Lucian Bute #1 or 2. The fight peaked at 580,000 viewers on Showtime.|$|E

25|$|With Alec Bedser and the spinners {{doing most of}} {{the work}} against South Africa in 1951, Statham had to do very little in the Tests, but he only missed 100 {{first-class}} wickets due to injury and showed himself a formidable bowler on a pitch offering help. In India, his average was good, but the heat and humidity certainly <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their toll upon his body and he did little in the Tests, with the result that he was not chosen for a Test match in 1952 even though he was gaining speed and straightness and was often extremely formidable despite conditions rarely favouring bowlers. In 1953, Statham was within a whisker of heading the first-class averages and bowled wonderfully on the most placid of pitches against Hampshire, but Bedser ensured he was not needed in the Ashes Tests. Statham and fellow fast-bowler Fred Trueman were on occasion, in 1953, called up to the Test squad, but with the England team maturing, the captain, Len Hutton did not feel comfortable playing two fast-bowlers, often preferring the more economical, slower bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. This meant that Statham and Trueman rarely bowled in tandem in this period.|$|E

They also praised the gameplay and its openness to accept novice players, despite the reviewer noting that it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> longer to level up a character compared to offline Dragon Quest entries. Two of the other reviewers pointed out issues with messaging, and a lack of guidance about which enemies were too strong for a player character's current level.|$|E
