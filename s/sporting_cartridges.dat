60|$|It must be {{admitted}} {{that there was}} some carelessness in permitting sporting ammunition ever to get to the front at all. When the Derbyshire Militia were taken by De Wet at Roodeval, a number of cases of <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridges</b> were captured by the Boers (the officers had used them for shooting springbok). My friend, Mr. Langman, who was present, saw the Boers, in some instances, filling their bandoliers from these cases on the plausible excuse that they were only using our own ammunition. Such cartridges should never have been permitted to go up. But in spite of instances of bungling, the evidence shows that every effort has been made to keep the war as humane as possible. I am inclined to hope that a fuller knowledge will show that the same holds good for our enemies, and that in spite of individual exceptions, they have never systematically used anything except what one of their number described as a 'gentlemanly' bullet.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]224 Weatherby Magnum (5.56×49mmB) is a <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{that was}} {{developed}} in 1963 by Roy Weatherby after about 10 years of development. It is a proprietary cartridge with no major firearms manufacturers chambering rifles for it other than Weatherby. It was originally called the [...]224 Weatherby Varmintmaster when it was introduced alongside the Weatherby Varmintmaster rifle, but the rifle was discontinued in 1994 and the cartridge was renamed.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{commercial}} <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridges,</b> {{only the}} [...]460 Weatherby Magnum offers a superior performance over the [...]450 Rigby. However, most bullets manufactured {{such as those}} by Hornady and Woodleigh are rated for [...]450 Rigby velocities rather than those achievable through the [...]460 Weatherby. For this reason actual performance and penetration on heavy thick skinned game species are on par between these two cartridges. The Weatherby cartridge has a 6% greater capacity than the [...]450 Rigby but operates at higher pressures.|$|E
50|$|During the 1950s, {{the sound}} of test firing of munitions still {{occasionally}} shattered the peace over Witton, but with the standardization of cartridges across the Western powers and a general downturn in ammunition requirements, the sidelines in <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridges</b> were discontinued by Imperial Metal Industries (IMI) in 1970. IMI became independent of ICI in 1977, still producing rimfire and shotgun cartridges for the sporting markets. The more economically viable production of shotgun and rimfire ammunition continued. The Ammunition Division was incorporated separately as Eley Limited in 1983.|$|E

When {{it became clear}} that there was not enough case capacity to meet U.S. Continental Army Command's (CONARC) velocity and penetration requirements, ArmaLite contacted Remington to create a similar cartridge with a longer case body and shorter neck. This became the [...]222 Special. At the same time, Springfield Armory's Earle Harvey had Remington create an even longer cartridge case then known as the [...]224 Springfield. Springfield was forced {{to drop out of the}} CONARC competition, and thus the [...]224 Springfield was released in 1958 as a commercial <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridge</b> known as the [...]222 Remington Magnum. To prevent confusion among all of the competing [...]222 cartridge designations, the [...]222 Special was renamed the [...]223 Remington in 1959. In the spring of 1962 Remington submitted the specifications of the [...]223 Remington to the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI). With the U.S. military adoption of the M16 assault rifle in 1963, the [...]223 Remington in a slightly derived form was standardized as the 5.56×45mm NATO. As a commercial <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridge</b> the [...]223 Remington was introduced in 1964.|$|R

50|$|As African hunting safaris {{became more}} popular from the 1990s onward {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the cartridge. Whereas before mainstream American ammunition manufacturers hardly ever showed an interest in the British big bore ammunition, demand created by American hunters spurred on companies such as A-Square, Federal, and Hornady to offer ammunition for these cartridge types. Eley, which had purchased Kynoch, licensed the brand name to Kynamco in Suffolk in the United Kingdom. Kynamco now offers British <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridges</b> including the Nitro Express cartridge for sale using the Kynoch brand name.

The smoothbore barrel is fitted with a choke that acts as a shot diverter, making it more effective against human targets. The HK512 is designed for use by police and military forces; indeed, the use of standard <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridges,</b> shells with reduced charges, or plastic training rounds will cause the HK-512 to malfunction. The muzzle of the gun incorporates a device that causes the shot to spread in an almost rectangular pattern. Because of this shot device, the HK-512 also cannot fire tear gas or signal cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the success}} of the [...]450 NE, various people (it is not clear who) decided to follow Rigby’s example and load the old [...]450/400 Black Powder Express, [...]500 Black Powder Express and [...]577 Black Powder Express {{cartridges}} with cordite, creating the [...]450/400 Nitro Express, [...]500 Nitro Express and [...]577 Nitro Express, the latter two offering greater power than the [...]450s at the expense of greater rifle weight and recoil.

The action used an internal box magazine and the Mauser-type claw extractor for controlled round feeding for excellent reliability. The barrel used on initial versions was of the same shape as the original military one, except it was polished and deep blued. The trigger mechanism was initially the same two-stage military type. Remington used the same steel and heat treatment as for the M1917 rifles, although improving the dimensional tolerances and the standard of finish.

50|$|The Anglo-American Explosives Company began {{manufacturing}} its shotgun {{powder in}} Oakland, New Jersey in 1890. DuPont began producing guncotton at Carneys Point Township, New Jersey in 1891. Charles E. Munroe of the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island patented a formulation of guncotton colloided with nitrobenzene, called Indurite, in 1891. Several United States firms began producing smokeless powder when Winchester Repeating Arms Company started loading <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridges</b> with Explosives Company powder in 1893. California Powder Works began producing {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose with ammonium picrate as Peyton Powder, Leonard Smokeless Powder Company began producing nitroglycerine-nitrocellulose Ruby powders, Laflin & Rand negotiated a license to produce Ballistite, and DuPont started producing smokeless shotgun powder. The United States Army evaluated 25 varieties of smokeless powder and selected Ruby and Peyton Powders as the most suitable {{for use in the}} Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. Ruby was preferred, because tin-plating was required to protect brass cartridge cases from picric acid in the Peyton Powder. Rather than paying the required royalties for Ballistite, Laflin & Rand financed Leonard's reorganization as the American Smokeless Powder Company. United States Army Lieutenant Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder named W.A. for their efforts. W.A. smokeless powder was the standard for United States military service rifles from 1897 until 1908.|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} Weatherby fashion, a Weatherby cartridge would outclass similar-caliber cartridges {{with regard}} to the performance of the cartridge. To accomplish this task Weatherby relied on one of the largest commercial <b>sporting</b> <b>cartridge</b> cases available. The [...]416 Weatherby Magnum uses the same case as the [...]378 Weatherby Magnum and the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum. The case design was inspired by the [...]416 Rigby cartridge and features a belt and Weatherby’s signature double-radius venturi shoulder. Unlike the [...]416 Ruger and the [...]416 Remington, the [...]416 Weatherby Magnum requires an extra-large bolt face and large magnum action to contain the cartridge due to its oversized dimensions. Putting this in perspective, the [...]416 Weatherby Magnum has a case capacity of 140 gr. of water (9.09 cm3), an increase of 31% over that of the [...]416 Remington Magnum case.|$|R
