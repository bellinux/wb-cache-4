These pelvic tumors have a greater likelihood of being malignant. An early survey found {{that the rate of}} tumor malignancy was 48% for girls and 67% for boys older than 2 months at the time of <b>sacrococcygeal</b> <b>tumor</b> diagnosis, compared with a malignant tumor incidence of 7% for girls and 10% for boys younger than 2 months at the time of diagnosis. The pelvic site of the primary tumor has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor, most likely caused by a higher rate of incomplete resection.|$|E
40|$|Ependymomas, {{the common}} glial {{tumors of the}} spinal cord, occur {{occasionally}} outside {{the central nervous system}} and are called extraspinal ependymomas (ESE). ESE, which are clinically confused with other sacrococcygeal tumors, are rarely seen and found primarily in the sacrococcygeal region during childhood. We report a case of a seven-year-old boy presenting with a midline mass (6 cm diameter) over his coccyx. The solid mass was diagnosed as maxillopapillary type of ependymoma. Clinical and histopathological features of the case are described and literature reviewed. Key words: extraspinal ependymoma, subcutaneous <b>sacrococcygeal</b> <b>tumor.</b> Ependymomas usually arise within the spinal cord or in the brain.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. : Operative {{technique}}. OBJECTIVE. : To {{report a}} new technique for sacral resection, with short-term preliminary results. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. : Although various reports analyzed en bloc excision of sacral tumors, there are still technical problems to improve protection of nerve roots, preserve surrounding structures, and reduce intraoperative bleeding, while maintaining the oncological result. METHODS. : Thirteen patients were resected for their <b>sacrococcygeal</b> <b>tumor</b> by following the described technique. Two patients had undergone previous surgery elsewhere. The sacrum was exposed by a posterior midline incision and complete soft-tissue dissection. Lateral osteotomies were performed through the sacral foramina using a threadwire saw (devised by Tomita and Kawahara) and Kerrison rongeurs, to avoid damage to the sacral roots. After proximal osteotomy, the sacrum was laterally elevated and mobilized to allow dissection of presacral structures. Mean surgical time was 5. 5 hours (range; 1. 5 - 8). Mean blood loss was 2961 mL (range; 1000 - 8000 mL). RESULTS. : Level of resection was proximal in 9 patients and at S 3 or below in 4. Margins were wide in 10 patients, marginal in 1, and intralesional in 2. At a mean follow-up of 35. 5 months, 9 patients were disease free, while the tumor recurred locally in 4 cases. Complications requiring surgery were seen in 1 case. CONCLUSION. : The reported technique allows wide margins with preservation of roots, and reduction in blood loss and operative time. Indications for posterior-only approach can be extended to resection proximal to S 3, when there is minimal pelvic invasion and none or partial involvement of sacroiliac joints. However, the long-term benefits of this technique need to be evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Background:Sacrococcygeal {{tumors are}} {{composite}} embryonal turn ours reflecting any {{one or more}} of ernbryonallfoetal remnants such as germinoma, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma and yolk sac tumors. Teratomas are the commonest variety of these tumours encountered in clinical practice. <b>Sacrococcygeal</b> <b>tumors</b> are most commonly found in females. Male presentations tend to carry high risk of malignancy. Clinical management of sacrococcygeal tumours in males therefore requires more meticulous attention to the details of surgery and follow-ups. Study design:This is a clinical case report of a huge sacrococcygeal tumour highly valued by a mentally deranged mother, which was excised from a three (3) month old baby boy under general anaesthesia in prone position over a three and half hour period. The purpose of the report is to highlight the special challenges in the management of the case not only on account of the sheer size of the tumour but also the unusual psychopathic attachment of the mother to her baby′s tumour. The accompanying literature review was by both manual and Medline searches. Result:Surgery and postoperative recovery were uneventful. Histology showed tumour variety to be sacrococcygeal teratoma. Patient showed steady progress with each follow-up visit. Conclusion: Sacrococcygeal tumours are rare, but are the commonest tumours of the newborn. Early surgery avoids tendency to malignant transformation and a good follow-up program is necessary for a guarded prognosis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Fetal {{tumors are}} {{relatively}} rare {{and the early}} prenatal diagnosis enables the prediction of possible complications and decision for appropriate treatment. This paper deals {{with the role of}} ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in the early prenatal diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma. Case report. A 21 -year-old primigravida was found to have a large <b>sacrococcygeal</b> <b>tumor</b> measuring 25 x 30 mm, presented mainly as a solid mass, when she underwent the initial ultrasound examination {{on the first day of}} 19 th week of gestation. There were no other associated anomalies. The second ultrasound examination was obtained after 6 days and revealed that the tumor had doubled its size. The prominent enlargement raised suspicion of immature sacrococcygeal teratoma and thus, fetal magnetic resonance imaging was performed in the 20 th gestation week. The examination showed a crococcygeal teratoma presented as a large solid mass with small microcystic areas, the largest diameter being 60 mm, completely externally positioned with no intra-pelvic extension. Rapid tumor growth posed a threat to the fetal circulation and it was the main reason when opting for the termination of pregnancy at 20 weeks of gestation. Pathohystological examination confirmed the diagnosis of immature sacrococcygeal teratoma. Discussion. In the prenatal period the magnetic resonance imaging of a fetal tumor initially diagnosed by ultrasound examination is an additional part of diagnostic procedure, and it is not contraindicated during pregnancy. Magnetic resonance imaging improves the delineation of the tumor. The prompt prenatal diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma, as well as the detection of possible associated anomalies, is important for the pregnancy management, prediction of possible complications and choice of appropriate treatment. Conclusion. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are noninvasive, compatible and complementary diagnostic modalities in evaluation of sacrococcygeal teratoma in prenatal period...|$|E

40|$|The <b>sacrococcygeal</b> teratomas are <b>tumors</b> with {{relatively}} low incidence, {{but with a}} high risk of malign transformation with age. We have included in our retrospective study a number of 39 cases of sacrococcygeal teratomas hospitalized in Pediatric Surgery Department from Timisoara in the last twenty five years. The necessary data were obtained by using retrospective statistical methods. We analyzed in the study the frequency of sacrococcygeal teratomas in the period 1979 ─ 2004, the distribution of cases with regard to gender (F/M ratio) and the affected group. Using the histopatological results we were able to establish the benign/malign rate at newborn. Also we diagnosed the percentage of malign transformation in cases of sacrococcygeal teratomas ad addressed after the age of 2 months. Results: the female patients were more affected than males. Benign forms of the disease were prevalent in the neonatal period. Patients diagnosed after 2 months of age had a high frequency of malign sacrococcygeal teratomas. Surgical treatment before the age of 2 months leads to a decrease of malign transformation and relapse...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} <b>sacrococcygeal</b> chordoma <b>tumor</b> presents with {{a typical}} morphology of lobulated myxoid tumor tissue with cords, strands and nests of tumor cells. The population of cells consists of small non-vacuolated cells, intermediate cells {{with a wide}} range of vacuolization and large heavily vacuolated (physaliferous) cells. To date analysis was only performed on bulk tumor mass because of its rare incidence, lack of suited model systems and technical limitations thereby neglecting its heterogeneous composition. We intended to clarify whether the observed cell types are derived from genetically distinct clones or represent different phenotypes. Furthermore, we aimed at elucidating the differences between small non-vacuolated and large physaliferous cells on the genomic and transcriptomic level. Phenotype-specific analyses of small non-vacuolated and large physaliferous cells in two independent chordoma cell lines yielded four candidate genes involved in chordoma cell development. UCHL 3, coding for an ubiquitin hydrolase, was found to be over-expressed in the large physaliferous cell phenotype of MUG-Chor 1 (18. 7 -fold) and U-CH 1 (3. 7 -fold) cells. The mannosyltransferase ALG 11 (695 -fold) and the phosphatase subunit PPP 2 CB (18. 6 -fold) were found to be up-regulated in large physaliferous MUG-Chor 1 cells showing a similar trend in U-CH 1 cells. TMEM 144, an orphan 10 -transmembrane family receptor, yielded contradictory data as cDNA microarray analysis showed up- but RT-qPCR data down-regulation in large physaliferous MUG-Chor 1 cells. Isolation of few but morphologically identical cells allowed us to overcome the limitations of bulk analysis in chordoma research. We identified the different chordoma cell phenotypes to be part of a developmental process and discovered new genes linked to chordoma cell development representing potential targets for further research in chordoma tumor biology...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} long-term outcomes of <b>sacrococcygeal</b> germ cell <b>tumors</b> (SC-GCTs) over a 15 -year period. Materials and Methods. A retrospective review was conducted of all pediatric patients treated for SC-GCTs at our hospital from 1998 to 2012. Results. Fifty-seven patients were treated for SC-GCTs with the most common in Altman’s classification type I. Age at surgery ranged from one day to 5. 6 years. Tumor resection and coccygectomy were primarily performed in about 84 % of the cases. Pathology revealed mature, immature, malignant sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCTs), and endodermal sinus tumors (ESTs) in 41 (72 %), 4 (77 %), 6 (10. 5 %), and 6 (10. 5 %), respectively. Recurrence of discase occurred in 3 of 41 patients with mature teratomas (7. 3 %); 2 recurrences with mature teratomas and one recurrence with EST. Five of 6 malignant SCTs and 3 of 6 ESTs responded well to the treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated in both malignant teratomas and ESTs. No immediate patient death was noted in any of the 57 cases, but 4 patients with malignant tumors and distant metastasis succumbed at home within 2 years of the initial treatment. Conclusion. Benign SCTs have a significant recurrence rate of approximately 7 %. Close follow-up with serial AFP level monitoring should be done for 5 years after initial tumor resection and coccygectomy. The survival rate for malignant SC-GCTs with distant metastasis was unfavorable in the present study...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{recently}} published pump/acardiac umbilical venous diameter (UVD) ratios, representing the pump twin's excess cardiac output fraction, of 27 acardiac twin pregnancies. There {{was a clear}} separation between the 17 pump twins that had life-threatening complications and the 10 that did not. The hypothesis {{of this study is}} that placental chorangioma and <b>sacrococcygeal</b> teratoma (SCT), <b>tumors</b> whose perfusion also causes high-output complications, have the same fetal outcome as pump twins when perfusion of the tumor requires the same excess cardiac output fraction. Methods: We compared the three fetoplacental circulations. Fetuses with a placental chorangioma and acardiac twin pregnancies both have their feeding artery and draining vein located at the placental cord insertion. In contrast, SCT lacks a prescribed feeding artery and draining vein. We, therefore, had to modify our model to assume that the diameter of the hypothetical draining vein is related to the flow difference between inferior vena cava and superior vena cava. The latter flow has been estimated sonographically and is the same as the inferior vena cava flow in the absence of an SCT. Furthermore, a simple modification accounts for the different location of the tumor with respect to the placental cord insertion. Results: We propose to apply the clinical pump/acardiac UVD ratios to pregnancies complicated by placental chorangiomas and the modified pump/acardiac UVD ratios for SCT. Conclusion: Risk prediction of these rare fetal tumors may be possible based on application of data on excess cardiac output fractions from pump/acardiac UVD ratios and will require future clinical validation...|$|R
