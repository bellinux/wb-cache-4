Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a <b>secondary</b> <b>reaction</b> between LiOH and CO2).|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of prestress <b>secondary</b> <b>reactions</b> in the post-elastic range {{has been a}} topic of much controversy. Due to the brittleness of FRP (fiber reinforced polymer) composites, external FRP tendon members may have different moment redistribution characteristics compared to conventional concrete members.

40|$|Reduction of NO{sub x} {{emission}} is {{an important}} environmental issue in pulverized coal combustion. Final emissions of NO{sub x} are strongly affected by the nitrogen release during devolatilization, {{which is the first}} stage of coal combustion. The most cost-effective approach to NO{sub x} reduction is air-staging which can also operate with additional down-stream techniques such as reburning [1]. Air staging promotes the conversion of NO{sub x} precursors (HCN, NH{sub 3 }, etc.) to N{sub 2 } by delaying the oxygen supply to the greatest extent when those nitrogen species are released during devolatilization. Such a delay gives the primary volatiles a chance to undergo <b>secondary</b> <b>reactions,</b> including tar cracking and soot formation. <b>Secondary</b> <b>reactions</b> of volatiles largely determine the fate of the ultimate NO{sub x} production from pyrolysis, therefore a detailed investigation into the transformation of nitrogen species during <b>secondary</b> <b>reactions</b> and effects of soot on nitrogen release is critical for design and implementation of new pollution control strategies. Current nitrogen models (including the CPD model at BYU) only simulate the nitrogen release during primary pyrolysis, which happens at low temperatures.
