40|$|In climate policy, substitutions metrics {{are used}} to {{determine}} exchange ratios for different greenhoue gases {{as part of a}} multi-gas strategy. The suitability of the metric depends on the policy goals and considerations regarding its practical use. Here, we present a multi-model comparison study to look at the impact of different metrics on the mitigation strategies and global climate policy costs. The study looks into different Global Warming Potentials (GWP) and the Global Temperature change Potential (GTP). The study shows that for all the models, varying between GWPs - from differen IPCC reports, with different integration periods: 20 or 100 years - has a relatively small influence on policy costs (< 2. 2 % spread across scenarios with a. 8 W/m^ 2 target) and climate outcomes.

However, under imperfect foresight in combination with inertia of CH 4 abatement options, or if implemented sub-optimally, time-varying GTP can result in higher costs than a 100 -year GWP.

To explore HBV evolution and to analyze the effects and patterns of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) mutations on blood screening assays, 358 Iranian blood donors diagnosed as asymptomatic HBV carriers were enrolled in this nationwide study. Large S and partial S genes were amplified and sequenced. HBV (sub) genotypes and synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were investigated. The impact of naturally occurring mutations on HBsAg ELISA results was explored. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that isolated strains were of genotype D. The dominant subgenotype/subtype was D 1 /ayw 2. Deletions and naturally occurring stop codons in the pre-S 1 and major hydrophilic region (MHR) were identified. In total, 32. 8 % of the studied strains harbored 195 single or multiple mutations in the MHR, the majority of which were located at the first loop of the "a determinant" domain.

30|$|Lastly, we {{assessed}} aboveground carbon mitigation as a metric {{of greenhouse gas}} regulation (GHGR). Aboveground carbon mitigation {{was defined as the}} sum of carbon storage in aboveground tree biomass as well as a carbon-use benefit associated with the harvest and use of renewable wood products. Carbon storage in tree biomass was calculated by multiplying standing biomass by the carbon ratio 0.498 : 1 (Birdsey 1992). The carbon use benefit was estimated using the methodology described by Lippke et al. (2011 b) as a sum of three terms: product storage, product substitution, and carbon emissions associated with harvesting. Product storage refers to carbon stored in LLWP when wood is harvested and used for building materials, furniture, etc. This carbon is released back to the atmosphere slowly as LLWP are retired and eventually decompose. When harvested biomass is used as an energy feedstock, on the other hand, carbon stored in the biomass is released into the atmosphere almost immediately. Product substitution is the benefit resulting from the use of relatively low-carbon renewable products (e.g. wood) in place of carbon intensive products (e.g. steel) and fossil fuels. Lippke et al. (2011 a, 2012) found the <b>substitution</b> <b>value</b> to be significantly greater when biomass is used for LLWP as compared to energy feedstocks. It is important to acknowledge that the adoption of a product substitution term in this framework assumes that products do in fact substitute for other, more carbon-intensive products. In actuality, however, they might simply be additional to the economy (e.g. if increased availability of bioenergy products reduce overall energy prices, and therefore increase total energy demand) or might simply substitute for other products of similar carbon intensity (e.g. LLWP substituting for other LLWP). Finally, carbon emissions associated with harvesting are subtracted from the storage and substitution pools in order {{to come up with the}} final value of the carbon use benefit. In the current analysis, we calculated the value of the aboveground carbon mitigation metric (aboveground carbon storage[*]+[*]use benefit) for biomass used to produce LLWP as well as cellulosic ethanol (Lippke et al. 2012). In total, six scenarios were explored, based on the three FP scenarios and a binary variable indicating whether or not harvested biomass was assumed to substitute for fossil intensive products. In order to estimate product storage, we assumed that carbon in biomass harvested and utilized for LLWP formed a carbon pool with an 80 -year half-life (Perez-Garcia et al. 2005). Because carbon in biofuels is stored for a negligible amount of time, we did not include a product storage term for biomass used to produce ethanol. Substitution benefits were calculated using carbon displacement ratios – or the estimated carbon savings for every unit of carbon in biomass utilized in place of carbon- intensive alternatives. We selected average carbon displacement ratios of 2.1 : 1 for LLWP and 0.38 : 1 for cellulosic ethanol (produced via gasification) from Lippke et al. (2012). These values were calculated using life-cycle assessment (LCA) modeling of conventional practices. Carbon emissions from logging operations were assumed to be equivalent to 6  % of the carbon contained in the pre-harvest stand at a site (Lippke et al. 2011 b). The final value of the aboveground carbon mitigation metric at a given point in time was calculated by taking the sum of the aboveground biomass and LLWP carbon pools at that point in time, adding total cumulative avoided emissions (i.e. product substitution benefits), and then subtracting total cumulative emissions from management and logging.|$|E

40|$|In Indonesia, {{the various}} mining {{commodities}} {{and the amount}} of resources and reserves are promising, as evidence there are numerous large-scale mining companies and small-scale mines in operation. In 2014 there were 41 companies that held the CoW (mineral contract of work) and 13 companies active in production; and 76 CCoW (coal contract of work) holders, and 57 companies active in production. As well as this, {{there are more than a}} thousand small-scale mining companies active for mining commodities. However, mining commodities provide a resource that is not renewable. This will potentially lead to prolonged problems when mining companies do not adhere to good mining practices, particularly in the closing stages of the mine. Mine closure is the final stage in the process of mining activity. In certain circumstances, closure activities can take a long time and of course can have huge costs. In fact, at this stage, the company is no longer making profit, only incurring costs for the project closure. To prevent problems that may arise after the mine is closed, such as abandoned post-mining land, and the bankruptcy of the company at the end of mining operations, etc., then through specific rules, ie rules of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 18 of 2008, the mining company in Indonesia must provide a certain amount of money as a financial guarantee to finance the planned closure project; it must be approved by the government before entering this phase. However, problems are encountered in practice. The government may become overloaded because they have to quickly make a decision on the closure plan submitted by the company. So a tool is needed that can be used to assess the feasibility as soon as the mine closure plan is proposed by a company, these tools can provide an overview and a variety of options for decision making. In this dissertation methodology was developed to create a systems dynamic model of mine closure. The model developed can be applied to a variety of mining methods and for various mining commodities. The model can be used to determine the closure costs, to choose the closure project-financing scenario, and up to micro and macro economic analysis of mining activities in the region. In the case studies conducted in this dissertation, the best scenario of the mine closure planning is to include the everlasting fund in the form of time deposits, and convert the post-mining land for agriculture. The amount of deposit money is about USD 358, 986, 500 should be spare at the end of mine production, and the total of mine closure cost to be approximately USD 440, 757, 384.

The results (given in total fresh weight) generally show good agreement with reported annual production (shown in brackets) at each farm: simulated production of 134 tons of Pacific oyster in Loch Creran (150 tons, − 10 %), 2691 tons of blue mussel in Pertuis Breton (2304 tons, + 17 %), 314 tons of Mediterranean mussel in the Bay of Piran (200 tons, + 57 %), 545 tons of Mediterranean mussel in Chioggia (660 tons, − 17 %) and 119 tons of Manila clam in Ria Formosa (104 tons, + 15 %). The nitrogen mass balance for each farm was also determined with the FARM model. The net removal of nitrogen (N) by the farms was estimated to correspond to 1206 population equivalents per year (PEQ y− 1) in Loch Creran, 93503 PEQ y− 1 in Pertuis Breton, 9196 PEQ y− 1 in the Bay of Piran, 97916 PEQ y− 1 in Chioggia and 8613 PEQ y− 1 in Ria Formosa. The aggregate income due to both the shellfish sale and <b>substitution</b> <b>value</b> of landbased fertilizer reduction or nutrient treatmentwas estimated to be about 700 k€ y− 1 in Loch Creran, 30, 706 k€ y− 1 in Pertuis Breton, 3000 k€ y− 1 in the Bay of Piran, 30, 000 k€ y− 1 in Chioggia, and 5000 k€ y− 1 in Ria Formosa. Outputs of FARM may be used to analyse the farm production potential and profit maximization according to seeding densities and/or spatial distribution. Results of a marginal analysis for all the study sites were determined. As an example, profit maximization in Loch Creranwas obtained with 97 tons of seed, resulting in a total production of 440 tons (profit of 2100 k€ for a culture period of about 2 years). FARM additionally integrates the well-known ASSETS model, for assessment of farm-related eutrophication impacts. The assessment results for the five study sites show that water quality is either maintained or improved in all farms under standard conditions of culture practice. FARM results may be used by farmers to analyse farm production potential and by managers for environmental assessment of farm-relatedwater quality impacts,whether positive or negative. It is a useful tool for all stakeholders for the valuation of nitrogen credits, which may be traded as part of an integrated catchment management plan. The FARM results were scaled up to determine a net value of 11 – 17 billion € y− 1 of ecosystem goods and services, provided by shellfish culture towards reducing eutrophication in the coastal waters of the European Union. These numbers highlight the role that extractive organic aquaculture plays in integrated coastal zone and nutrient emissions management...|$|E

This study contributes to understanding the T 2 ̆ 6 A-specific sectoral impacts of the KORUS and suggests a need to reconsider the competitiveness of China’s T 2 ̆ 6 A exports in the era following elimination in 2005 of Multi-Fiber Arrangement quantitative trade restrictions...|$|R
