25|$|A {{hybrid of}} C. ignobilis and C. melampygus (bluefin trevally) has been {{recorded}} from Hawaii. The specimen was initially {{thought to be a}} bluefin trevally of world-record size, but was later rejected when it was discovered to be a hybrid. Initial evidence of hybridisation was morphological characteristics intermediate to the two species; later genetic tests confirmed it was indeed a hybrid. The two species are known to school together, including at <b>spawning</b> <b>time,</b> which was considered to be the reason for hybridisation.|$|E
25|$|Cephalopods are {{a diverse}} group of species, but share common life history traits, for example they have a rapid growth rate and short life spans. Stearns (1992) {{suggested}} that in order to produce the largest possible number of viable offspring, spawning events depend on ecological environmental factors of the organism. The majority of cephalopods do not provide parental care to their offspring, except for example, octopus, which helps this organism increase the survival rate of their offspring. Marine species life cycles are affected by various environmental conditions. The development of a cephalopod embryo can be greatly affected by temperature, oxygen saturation, pollution, light intensity, and salinity. These factors are important to the rate of embryonic development and the success of hatching of the embryos. Food availability also {{plays an important role in}} the reproductive cycle of cephalopods. A limitation of food influences the timing of spawning along with their function and growth. <b>Spawning</b> <b>time</b> and spawning vary among marine species; it's correlated with temperature, though cephalopods in shallow water spawn in cold months so that the offspring would hatch at warmer temperatures. Breeding can last from several days to a month.|$|E
25|$|Intensive {{exploitation}} of lake resources and habitat destruction resulted in marked decrease in fish production so that commercial operations were halted and recreational fishing is presently limited {{to catch and}} release. Years of construction activity on the lake's limited watershed resulted in lowered water levels. Heavy metals (aluminium, chromium, arsenic, and copper) dissolved in the water {{as a result of}} coal burning were deemed to be at acceptable levels, but metals in sediment and mercury in larger pike were found to be excessive. TransAlta responded with measures to reduce metal and thermal pollution, and the Wabamun power plant was decommissioned and torn down. As a result of the Canadian National Railway oil spill, fish from the lake are not recommended for consumption. Walleye have not been seen in the lake since the early 1900s when they were fished out. Several attempts to restock walleye in the lake failed because the Wabamun power plant (built in the 1950s) discharged its heated cooling water into the lake, keeping that portion of the lake clear of ice. Walleye would spawn in the warm water weeks prior to their normal <b>spawning</b> <b>time</b> and the hatchlings did not survive when they could not find enough food in the still-cold portions of the lake. After closure of the Wabamun power plant in 2010, Alberta Fish and Wildlife attempted another stocking of walleye, and this one appears to have been successful. Walleye are reproducing and so are their young. TransAlta no longer uses the lake for any of its operations.|$|E
40|$|When organisms release gametes {{into the}} sea, {{synchrony}} must be precise to increase fertilization and decrease hybridization. We tagged and genotyped over 400 spawning corals {{from the three}} species in the Montastraea annularis species complex. We report {{on the influence of}} species, individuals, and genotypes on timing of spawning from 2002 through 2009. During their annual spawning event M. franksi spawns on average 2 h after sunset, whereas M. annularis and M. faveolata spawn 3. 5 h after sunset. Only M. franksi and M. annularis have compatible gametes. Individual colonies of the same genotype spawn at approximately the same time after sunset within and across years (within minutes), but different genotypes have significantly different <b>spawning</b> <b>times.</b> Neighboring colonies, regardless of genotype, spawn more synchronously than individuals spaced further apart. At a given distance, clone-mates spawn more synchronously than nonclone-mates. A transplant experiment indicates a genetic and environmental influence on <b>spawn</b> <b>time.</b> There is strong, but not absolute, concordance between <b>spawn</b> <b>time,</b> morphology, and genetics. Tight precision in spawning is achieved via a combination of external cues, genetic precision, and perhaps conspecific signaling. These mechanisms are likely to influence reproductive success and reproductive isolation in a density-dependent manner...|$|R
50|$|<b>Spawning</b> <b>times</b> vary {{depending}} on its habitat. Near Hong Kong, it mates during Spring, from March to May. In the Red Sea area, it takes place from August to October. After mating, the female deposits her eggs near the coast, between depths of 5 and 20 m.|$|R

60|$|Still, good mothers too may {{be found}} among fish, though far from frequently. One of the Guiana catfishes, known as Aspredo, very much resembles her countrywoman the Surinam toad in her nursery arrangements. Of course you know the Surinam toad--whom not to know argues {{yourself}} unknown--that curious creature that carries her eggs in little pits on her back, where the young hatch out and pass through their tadpole stage in a slimy fluid, emerging at last from the cells of this living honeycomb only when they have attained the full amphibian honours of four-legged maturity. Well, Aspredo among cat-fish manages her brood {{in much the same}} fashion; only she carries her eggs beneath her body instead of on her back like her amphibious rival. When <b>spawning</b> <b>time</b> approaches, and Aspredo's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love, the lower side of her trunk begins to assume, by anticipation, a soft and spongy texture, honeycombed with pits, between which are arranged little spiky protuberances. After laying her eggs, the mother lies flat upon them on the river bottom, and presses them into the spongy skin, where they remain safely attached until they hatch out and begin to manage for themselves in life. It is curious that the only two creatures on earth which have hit out independently this original mode of providing for their offspring should both be citizens of Guiana, where the rivers and marshes must probably harbour some special danger to be thus avoided, not found in equal intensity in other fresh waters.|$|E

Gametogenesis of S. bournoni began in April or May while S. intersepta had a much longer oogenic cycle that began in December with spermatogenesis beginning in July. Though spawning was not observed in situ, spawning was inferred from the decrease of late stage gametes in histological samples. In addition, histological observations of oocyte resorption and released spermatozoa were used to corroborate <b>spawning</b> <b>times.</b> Data indicate that S. bournoni spawns in September while S. intersepta spawns after the full moon in late August or early September...|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} {{varieties}} of boss spawns: Some were activated {{after a certain}} number of lower level monsters were killed, while others were time-based.

40|$|The Caribbean corals, Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis, {{recently}} have undergone drastic declines {{primarily as a}} result of disease. Previous molecular studies have demonstrated that these species form a hybrid (A. prolifera) that varies in abundance throughout the range of the parental distribution. There is variable unidirectional introgression across loci and sites of A. palmata genes flowing into A. cervicornis. Here we examine the efficacy of prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms within these corals including <b>spawning</b> <b>times</b> and choice and no-choice fertilization crosses. We show that these species have subtly different mean but overlapping <b>spawning</b> <b>times,</b> suggesting that temporal isolation is likely not an effective barrier to hybridization. We found species-specific differences in gametic incompatibilities. Acropora palmata eggs were relatively resistant to hybridization, especially when conspecific sperm are available to outcompete heterospecific sperm. Acropora cervicornis eggs demonstrated no evidence for gametic incompatibility and no evidence of reduced viability after aging four hours. This asymmetry in compatibility matches previous genetic data on unidirectional introgression...|$|R

50|$|Spawning {{season for}} the grubby begins in winter and extends into spring. Spawning begins in coastal waters and later occurs in {{offshore}} oceanic waters. The spawning in coastal waters {{has been reported to}} occur only in winter and early spring.

50|$|The {{breeding}} season and spawning times can be shifted thus expanding the seasonal range of production.

40|$|The Mytilus edulis species complex {{includes}} three smooth-shelled blue mussels, M. edulis (Linnaeus 1 75 8), M trossulus (Gould 1 850), and M galloprovincialis (Lamarck 18 19). When any two of theses species occur sympatrically, hybridization and backcrossing of hybrid and parental genotypes is evident. Despite introgression of genes between taxa their genetic integrity is maintained. To test {{the hypothesis that}} a temporal variation in species-specific <b>spawning</b> <b>times</b> is the mechanism limiting hybridization and maintaining genetic integrity in a M edulis and M. trossulus hybrid zone in eastern Maine, mussels were sampled on monthly to semi-monthly intervals throughout 2000 from a low intertidal site in Cobscook Bay. Four polymerase-chain-reaction-based (PCR) genetic markers were used to differentiate between species. Gamete volume fraction (GVF) and oocyte area measurements indicated that both species are temporally synchronized with respect to gametogenesis and spawning. Thus low frequency of hybridization and preservation of genetic identity is {{not the result of}} temporally separated <b>spawning</b> <b>times.</b> Limited hybridization may result from gametic incompatibility, differential environmental adaptation, or selective mortality of hybrids.

50|$|Adriatic trout are {{threatened}} by excessive damming, hybridization with introduced species and overfishing. In the river Neretva, natural hybrids (named kosor by locals) between Adriatic and brown trout can be found. Hybridization was also confirmed experimentally (Kosorić & Vuković. 1969). Adriatic trout prefers rivers with more water and wide riverbed. Adriatic and brown trout have different <b>spawning</b> <b>times</b> that overlap only slightly every few years, which is why natural hybridization is not widespread and both species live sympatrically in the same rivers.|$|R

50|$|Global {{production}} of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, requires over 3 billion eggs per year.

40|$|Background: The Caribbean pillar coral Dendrogyra cylindrus was {{recently}} {{listed as a}} threatened species under the United States Endangered Species Act. One of the major threats to this species is its low, virtually undetectable recruitment rate. To our knowledge, sexually-produced recruits have never been found in over 30 years of surveys of Caribbean reefs. Until recently, the reproductive behavior of D. cylindrus was uncharacterized, limiting efforts to study its early life history, identify population bottlenecks, and conduct outplanting projects with sexually-produced offspring. In Curaçao, we observed the spawning behavior of this species over three years and five lunar cycles. We collected gametes from spawning individuals on three occasions and attempted to rear larvae and primary polyp settlers. Results: Here we describe successful fertilization methods for D. cylindrus and we document rapid embryonic development. We describe the successful propagation of embryos to the swimming larvae stage, the first settlement of larvae in the laboratory, and the survival of primary polyp settlers for over seven months. We show that <b>spawning</b> <b>times</b> are highly predictable {{from year to year}} relative to the lunar cycle and local sunset times. We use colony-level data to confirm that males begin spawning before females. We also provide the first reports of split-spawning across months in this species. Conclusions: Together, our findings of consistent <b>spawning</b> <b>times,</b> split-spawning, rapid embryonic development, and remarkable robustness of larvae and settlers now enable expanded research on the early life history and settlement ecology of D. cylindrus. This will help biologists to identify the population bottlenecks in nature that underlie low recruitment rates. Further, the settlement of D. cylindrus larvae in the laboratory now makes out-planting for restoration more feasible. Asynchronous <b>spawning</b> <b>times</b> and rapid embryonic development may have important consequences for population biology, connectivity, and management, by affecting fertilization dynamics and larval dispersal distances. We argue that a precautionary approach to conservation is warranted, given this species’ peculiar life history traits and still-unresolved population structure. Overall, the natural history and husbandry contributions presented here should facilitate accelerated research and conservation of this threatened coral...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Mandatory {{catch and}} release of wild fish and supplementation with hatchery-reared fish are {{commonly}} used to sustain sport fisheries on low-abundance populations of wild steelhead. However, their effectiveness in limiting angling mortality on wild fish is uncertain. We radio-tagged 226 (125 wild, 101 hatchery) angled adult steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss {{near the mouth of}} the Vedder 2 Chilliwack River, British Columbia, in 1999 and 2000 and monitored their sub-sequent movements to determine survival to spawning and overlap in the distributions of inferred holding sites, spawning sites, and <b>spawning</b> <b>times.</b> The distributions of prespawning holding sites did not differ between wild and hatchery fish in either year, but spawning locations differed. Holding and spawning sites used by hatchery fish were restricted to the lower two-thirds of the river, downstream of the hatchery where they were reared but well upstream of their smolt release site. Wild fish spawned throughout the watershed. <b>Spawning</b> <b>times</b> did not differ between wild and hatchery fish, but varied with run timing. The maximum mortality from the initial catch and release and radio-tagging was 1. 4 % in 1999 and 5. 8 % in 2000; true mortality rates were lower because tag regurgitation was indistinguishable from death.
