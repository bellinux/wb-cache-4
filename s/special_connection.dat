5|$|The {{materials}} used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the membrane. Mulberry trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance—instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The Yakuts believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> to nature.|$|E

25|$|The king's {{power over}} the temple was not proprietary, but administrative. He might borrow from it, but repaid like other borrowers. The tithe {{seems to have been}} {{considered}} the rent due to the god for his land. It is not clear that all lands paid tithe; perhaps only such as once had a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> with the temple.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} Agnes's first {{book about the}} then-North Borneo, Land Below the Wind, has become the {{unofficial}} motto of Sabah. The phrase was used by sailors to describe all the lands south of the typhoon belt, but Agnes popularised the <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> of the phrase with Sabah, by applying it exclusively to North Borneo in her book.|$|E
25|$|In {{a form of}} {{sympathetic}} magic, many built life-size {{replicas of}} airplanes out of straw and cut new military-style landing strips out of the jungle, hoping to attract more airplanes.

25|$|Monarchy, {{especially}} absolute monarchy, {{sometimes is}} linked to religious aspects; many monarchs once claimed the right to rule by the will of a deity (Divine Right of Kings, Mandate of Heaven), a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> to a deity (sacred king) or even purported to be divine kings, or incarnations of deities themselves (imperial cult). Many European monarchs have been styled Fidei defensor (Defender of the Faith); some hold official positions relating to the state religion or established church.|$|E

On his Oltenian estates, at Pătulele, Știrbei employed horticulturist Friedrich Grunow, who reforested the area with black locust, which reputedly stopped desertification. From 1888, Știrbei also sought appointment as curator of Așezămintele Brâncovenești, a charity set up by his aunt, Zoe Brâncoveanu, having donated his estate in Cervenia for its use. He shared this position with his cousin Georges. Together, the cousins also managed Brâncovenesc Hospital, setting up a quarantine area for the cholera outbreak of 1893.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Which {{commercial}} bank supervisory policies ease – or complicate – the external financing obstacles faced by firms? Based on new data from almost 5, 000 corporations across 48 countries, this paper provides the first empirical {{assessment of the}} impact of bank supervision on firm financing obstacles. We find that countries with supervisory strategies focused on inducing banks to disclose accurate information to the private sector and strategies that do not reduce the incentives of private agent to monitor banks tend to lower the financing obstacles faced by firms and reduce the importance of corruption and <b>special</b> <b>connections</b> in raising external finance. Furthermore, countries with powerful supervisory agencies that have the authority to monitor, influence, and discipline banks directly tend to have firms that rely more on <b>special</b> <b>connections</b> and corruption to obtain bank finance and frequently face greater overall financing obstacles. Finally, we find that creating a supervisory agency that is independent of the government and banks mitigates these adverse consequences of powerful supervisory agencies...|$|R

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} his life, Austrian {{psychoanalyst}} Sigmund Freud felt a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> to Balzac's novel, {{since he}} believed that his world was shrinking like Valentin's talisman. Diagnosed with a fatal tumor, Freud resolved to commit suicide. After re-reading La Peau de chagrin, he said to his doctor: [...] "This was the proper book for me to read; it deals with shrinking and starvation." [...] The next day, his doctor administered a lethal dose of morphine, and Freud died.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{earliest}} mainstream exposure came in {{the prime}} time sketch comedy program The Dana Carvey Show. While only lasting seven episodes in early 1996, it provided Colbert with roles that would help forge his future onscreen persona. This was largely due to its format of delivering sketch performances directly to the camera. Although they did not air, several sketches inspired by The Onion also had Colbert playing a deadpan anchor delivering the news. In an interview with The New York Times regarding The Dana Carvey Show, Colbert noted, [...] "If you {{have an opportunity to}} give it right to the audience, there’s a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> that you make by looking at the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother thing going on. I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Rae {{ultimately}} learnt of the affair; Richardson characterised {{her response}} as being [...] "shocked and angry", and Barlow told Inside Soap magazine that the revelation left her character [...] "more torn than ever." [...] The discovery prompted Rae to consider having an abortion, but Brendan convinced her not to, and {{revealed that he}} once lost his own child. Barlow called the scenes [...] "really heartfelt stuff", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself a good father, whereas it was [...] "a bigger deal" [...] for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste because she knew that he was gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that she could be a good single mother. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult.|$|E
500|$|Following Marianna's {{death in}} 1890, it was {{reported}} in French newspapers that she had finally, on her deathbed and with Edgardo beside her, become a Christian. Edgardo refuted this: [...] "I have always ardently desired that my mother embrace the Catholic faith," [...] {{he wrote in a}} letter to Le Temps, [...] "and I tried many times to get her to do so. However, that never happened". A year later, Father Pio Edgardo Mortara returned to Italy for the first time in two decades to preach in Modena. A sister and some of his brothers came out to hear his sermon, and for the rest of his life Edgardo called on his relatives whenever he was in Italy. During a 1919 sojourn in Rome he visited the House of Catechumens he had entered 61 years before. By this time he had settled at the abbey of the Canons Regular at Bouhay in Liège, Belgium. Bouhay had a sanctuary to the Virgin of Lourdes, to which Father Mortara felt a <b>special</b> <b>connection,</b> the Lourdes apparitions of 1858 having occurred in the same year as his own conversion to Christianity. Father Pio Edgardo Mortara resided at Bouhay for the rest of his life and died there on 11 March 1940, at the age of 88.|$|E

Harihara is the name of a deity that combines the essence of Vishnu (Hari) with that of Shiva (Hara) and that was much favored by the Khmer kings. Jayavarman II's adoption of the epithet [...] "devaraja" [...] (god-king) signified the monarch's <b>special</b> <b>connection</b> with Shiva.|$|E
