5|$|The Daddies {{recorded}} {{their first}} demo cassette 4 From On High in July 1989, featuring four tracks of punk-tinged swing and funk rock. The tape {{went on to}} sell over 1,000 copies in the Eugene and Portland areas, enabling the band to self-produce their debut LP Ferociously <b>Stoned</b> the following year. Fusing punk rock and jazz horns with funk grooves, the album garnered favorable comparisons to contemporaries Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Before it was even officially released, Ferociously <b>Stoned</b> became a regional best-seller, setting a record for advance sales in Eugene's record stores and then remaining {{for over a year}} on The Rockets Northwest Top Twenty list, helping expand the Daddies' touring reach to as far as Alaska and Los Angeles by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and <b>stoned.</b> With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Back at Mina, {{the pilgrims}} perform {{symbolic}} stoning {{of the devil}} (Ramy al-Jamarat) by throwing seven stones at only {{the largest of the}} three pillars, known as Jamrat al-Aqabah from sunrise to sunset. The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not <b>stoned</b> on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with catch basins below to collect the pebbles.|$|E

5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic <b>Stones</b> are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic <b>Stones</b> can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic <b>Stone</b> for some special effect. Activating a Haste <b>Stone,</b> for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic <b>Stones,</b> the power of the <b>stone</b> increases if more than one of the same <b>stone</b> is picked up by the player. Each <b>stone</b> is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while <b>stones</b> marked with question marks represent random Magic <b>Stones,</b> which grant the player either a Haste <b>Stone,</b> Fire <b>Stone,</b> Ice <b>Stone,</b> Thunder <b>Stone,</b> Minimize <b>Stone,</b> Reflect <b>Stone,</b> Doom <b>Stone,</b> or Ultima <b>Stone.</b>|$|R
5|$|This {{experimental}} {{freedom was}} fully exercised on the Daddies' second album, Rapid City Muscle Car. Self-produced and self-recorded, Rapid City Muscle Car was the band's attempt at creating an eclectic concept album wherein each track was composed {{in a different}} musical style, yet were all thematically united through interconnected lyricism. Anchored in funk and swing, the album featured genre experiments in ska punk, psychedelic rock, country, rockabilly, big band, hard rock and lounge. Released on the band's self-operated label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records in December 1994, the album sold decently, though failed to match the success of Ferociously <b>Stoned.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and <b>stoned</b> to death.|$|E
5|$|By the evening, a {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be <b>stoned</b> in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on the mob, which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and the mob. The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; the mob returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.|$|E

40|$|The {{bacteria}} in 37 <b>stones</b> obtained from 37 patients with urinary <b>stone</b> diseases, that is, 11 renal <b>stones</b> (containing 2 staghorn calculi), 21 ureteral <b>stones,</b> 4 bladder <b>stones</b> and 1 urethral <b>stone,</b> were studied, {{according to the}} Nemoy & Stamey's method. The <b>stones</b> were collected by partial nephrectomy (1 case), nephrolithotomy (1 case), pyelolithotomy (1 case), percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) (6 cases), 12 ureterolithotomies, transurethral ureterolithotripsy (2 cases), cystolithotripsies (4 cases) and spontaneous deliveries (10 cases). According to a <b>stone</b> analysis by infrared spectrophotometer revealed 30 were noninfection <b>stones</b> (81. 1 %) and 7 infection <b>stones</b> (18. 9 %). Of these 37 <b>stones,</b> 5 <b>stones</b> (13. 5 % of 11 <b>stones)</b> had bacteria within them.

The fact that all organisms within <b>stones</b> cannot be detected by urine culture before collecting <b>stones</b> of the patients in our present study, suggests that patients undergoing endourological surgery, such as {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} and PNL, may have a risk of complications, such as severe urinary tract infection and urosepsis, if the possibility of the presence of organisms within <b>stones</b> is not taken into consideration...|$|R
5|$|The first {{operation}} {{involving the}} 6th Airlanding Brigade followed two attacks by the Palmach on coastguard stations over {{the night of}} 24/25November. Palestine Police Force dogs tracked the attackers to the settlements of Rishpon and Sidna Ali. In the following cordon and search operation, the police were <b>stoned</b> by the inhabitants, and the soldiers on the cordon had to prevent reinforcements from other settlements reaching the villages. The next day, 26November, the police were involved in hand-to-hand fighting with the villagers and eventually withdrew, calling on the brigade to enter the settlements and enforce law and order. Leaving some men behind on the cordon {{to hold back the}} estimated 3,000 crowd, the remainder of the brigade entered the settlements. Here they carried out several baton charges {{and for the first time}} used tear gas to disperse the crowds. In the cleanup operation, 900 persons were later arrested.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's <b>stoned</b> to death by the crowd.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is <b>stoned</b> by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: The role {{of protein}} {{components}} of pancreatic secretions has been controversial in pancreatic <b>stone</b> formation. OBJECTIVE: To study the lithogenic role of pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein and lactoferrin in <b>stone</b> formation in chronic pancreatitis. PATIENTS: Pancreatic <b>stones</b> {{were collected from}} 13 patients with alcoholic (n= 6) and nonalcoholic (n= 7) chronic calcified pancreatitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pancreatic <b>stone</b> extracts were analyzed for pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein and lactoferrin using enzyme immunoassay. The localization of pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein immunoreactivity in the <b>stone</b> was observed using immunogold staining and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Immunoreactivities for pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein were detected in the <b>stones</b> from all 13 patients with chronic calcified pancreatitis and for lactoferrin in the <b>stones</b> from five of the 13 patients. Pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein immunoreactivity distributed diffusely from the center to {{the periphery of the}} pancreatic <b>stones.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of pancreatic <b>stone</b> protein seems to be constant from the initial step of the <b>stone</b> formation to subsequent steps of the <b>stone</b> growth.

40|$|Background: To {{develop a}} method for {{systematic}} classification of gallbladder <b>stones,</b> analyze the clinical characteristics of each type of <b>stone</b> and provide a theoretical basis {{for the study of}} the formation mechanism of different types of gallbladder <b>stones.</b> Methodology: A total of 807 consecutive patients with gallbladder <b>stones</b> were enrolled and their gallstones were studied. The material composition of gallbladder <b>stones</b> was analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and the distribution and microstructure of material components was observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy. The composition and distribution of elements were analyzed by an X-ray energy spectrometer. Gallbladder <b>stones</b> were classified accordingly, and then, gender, age, medical history and BMI of patients with each type of <b>stone</b> were analyzed. Principal Findings: Gallbladder <b>stones</b> were classified into 8 types and more than ten subtypes, including cholesterol <b>stones</b> (297), pigment <b>stones</b> (217), calcium carbonate <b>stones</b> (139), phosphate <b>stones</b> (12), calcium stearate <b>stones</b> (9), protein <b>stones</b> (3), cystine <b>stones</b> (1) and mixed <b>stones</b> (129). Mixed <b>stones</b> were those <b>stones</b> with two or more than two kinds of material components and the content of each component was similar. A total of 11 subtypes of mixed <b>stones</b> were found in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with renal <b>stones</b> treated at a single institute by flexible URS were retrospectively evaluated. To assess the clinical utility of CSD, relationships between stone-free (SF) status and <b>stone</b> burden (CSD and volume) were analyzed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. To identify <b>stone</b> number impact on CSD, the AUROC of CSD divided by <b>stone</b> number was evaluated. Correlation coefficients of CSD and <b>stone</b> volume were also calculated for groups by <b>stone</b> number. RESULTS: In cases with CSD < 20. 0 mm, CSD and <b>stone</b> volume revealed equal ability to predict SF status. In cases with CSD ≥ 20. 0 mm, <b>stone</b> volume showed higher predictive ability. The ROC curves for cases with ≥ 4 <b>stones</b> showed that CSD was less predictive of SF status than <b>stone</b> volume. The correlation coefficients of CSD and <b>stone</b> volume by <b>stone</b> number were 0. 922 for 1 <b>stone,</b> 0. 900 for 2 - 3 <b>stones,</b> and 0. 661 for ≥ 4 <b>stones.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In cases with CSD ≥ 20. 0 mm or ≥ 4 <b>stones,</b> we should evaluate <b>stone</b> volume for a more predictive <b>stone</b> burden, and pretreatment non-contrast CT seems sufficient. In cases with CSD < 20. 0 mm or 1 - 3 <b>stones,</b> CSD was as valid a predictor of preoperative <b>stone</b> burden as <b>stone</b> volume, so preoperative kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) films may be sufficient...|$|R
