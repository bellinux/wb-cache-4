5000|$|The 1993 Cobra R was {{the first}} of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an {{extremely}} exclusive vehicle. As the [...] "R" [...] designation in its name stood for [...] "Race", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, sound deadener, rear <b>seat,</b> <b>rear</b> safety belts, rear carpeting, and roll-up cargo cover, among other items. There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors. Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area. The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition.|$|E
5000|$|Cadillac {{produced}} what it {{termed a}} [...] "commercial chassis". This was a longer and strengthened {{version of the}} long-wheelbase Fleetwood limousine frame to carry the extra weight of bodywork, rear deck and cargo. Designed for professional car use, {{the rear of the}} Cadillac commercial chassis was considerably lower than the passenger car frame, thereby lowering the rear deck height as well for ease of loading and unloading. They were shipped as incomplete cars to coachbuilders for final assembly. A Cadillac commercial chassis typically consisted of the car's front end sheet metal with lighting and trim, dashboard and controls. Rear quarter panels and sometimes the front door shells were shipped with the chassis for use in the finished coachwork. Today, most hearses are made from converted sedans on stretched wheelbases. The fleet division of Ford Motor Company sells a Lincoln Town Car with a special [...] "hearse package" [...] strictly to coachbuilders. Shipped without rear <b>seat,</b> <b>rear</b> interior trim, rear window or decklid, the hearse package also features a heavy-duty suspension, brakes, charging system and tires and was once offered on a modified Ford Expedition SUV chassis with the Triton V10 truck engine.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the noise {{performance}} for the seat adjuster mechanism, noise and vibration measurements were conducted in both European and Australian cars for six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations on the driver's seat. The six modes of the driver's seat operations are: both up for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, front seat end up, front <b>seat</b> end down, <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end up and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end down. The eight modes of the seat operations are: forward, backward, both up for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, both down for the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> ends, front seat end up, front <b>seat</b> end down, <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end up and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> end down. The noise and vibration levels, sound quality and the root causes for the noise problems have been analysed and discussed for the six and eight modes of the seat adjustment operations.

40|$|Families in the Western {{world have}} a car and several family members share the same car. In this study, 154 {{participants}} have adjusted a driver's seat three times. The primary objective was to study intrapersonal repeatability and intraclass correlation (ICC) on seat; length adjustment, backrest angle, seat front edge and <b>seat</b> <b>rear</b> edge adjustment, related to participant age, sex, stature and weight. Length adjustment has the best intrapersonal repeatability within two repetitions, 49 mm and ICC-value 0. 87. Females and younger participants (age < 40 years) adjust seats generally more accurately. Females adjust the seat 41 mm more forward, 120 mm compared to men 79 mm counted from 0 -starting position. Females sit with more upright seat backrests, 46 degrees compared to 43 degrees for males counted from 0 -starting position.

40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, new safety technologies intended for the <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> studies of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt and seat geometry, and methods for assessing belt fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, built-in booster seats with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> should have higher priority. Load limiters, seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. If load limiters are installed in <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> than in the front seat. The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row occupant seating patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children. Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating. The ages of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant vary substantially with driver age. Drivers aged 16 - 25 most likely have other 16 - 25 YO or 0 - 4 YO occupants in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> For drivers aged 26 - 50, 85 % of their <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants are under aged 16. Drivers over age 50 have the greatest proportion of passengers over age 50 in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> From the injury analysis, <b>seating</b> in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> is protective in terms of fatality and injury reduction, regardless of restraint use, except for rear impacts. The back of the front seat is a common injury contact point for rear-seat occupants. Studies of belt restraints have seldom found a difference in effectiveness between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Most common injury contact points in side impact for belted children are on the lower rear quarter of the rear window. The presence of other occupants in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> provides some benefit in injury reduction for children involved in side impacts, possibly by limiting lateral movement. Pediatric abdominal injury patterns indicate that the <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> of minivans provide an environment with lower risk of abdomen injury compared to the back seats of passenger cars and SUVs. Pediatric injury rates are similar for children riding in SUVs and passenger cars, as potential benefits of a heavier vehicle are offset by a greater tendency to be in rollovers. Presence of a three-point belt rather than a lap-only belt reduces pediatric risk of AIS 2 + injury by 81 %. The presence of a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> <b>seating</b> position usually only affects seating practices when there is a single child occupant in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R
