5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading,</b> Outre-Mer.|$|E
5|$|Ng {{was born}} in Jakarta on 28 July 1973 with the name Clara Regina Juana {{and raised in the}} Kemayoran sub-district. She took up reading at a young age, {{reportedly}} capable of reading translations of The Adventures of Tintin by kindergarten. She also enjoyed Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale The Snow Queen, which influenced her writing. By age 11 <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> adult-oriented works by Mira W. Ng attended Budi Mulia Elementary School from 1979 until 1986, then attended Van Lith Middle School until 1989; it was while in middle school that she taught herself creative writing and began creating works. She completed her high school education at Bunda Hati Kudus, graduating in 1992. While in high school, she became interested in social issues, including discrimination faced by ethnic Chinese, LGBT, and women.|$|E

R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and so she started to write the kind of books that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading.</b> After her parents divorced, her mother moved her and her sisters back to Fayette County in 1969, where she spent two years at Albert Gallatin Senior High. When her family moved again, she spent her senior year at Uniontown Area Senior High School, acting, singing, and writing for the school paper. She is an alumna of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn).|$|E

500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But {{there was something about}} the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Ripley {{auditioned for}} Granada Television's Cold Feet, a {{television}} pilot about the romances of three couples living in Manchester. She believed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> {{for the role}} of Rachel, the [...] "young, pretty one", and was surprised to discover that she was wanted for Jenny, the [...] "northern housewife". In the audition, she performed with an inelegant approximation of a local Manchester accent. The producers found her approach to the role refreshing from other actresses, who were seen as too [...] "finger-wagging". Ripley won the role, and appeared opposite John Thomson and James Nesbitt in the programme. After the pilot won an award, ITV's director of programmes commissioned a series of Cold Feet, so Ripley worked on improving her character's accent by speaking to locals and mimicking their speech. Her supporting character from the pilot episode was given a bigger role in the series; in the first episode (broadcast in 1998), Jenny gives birth to her first child. At that time, Ripley had never experienced childbirth, so copied birth scenes she had seen in other television series. An Independent review of the first series in November 1998 noted, [...] "Fay Ripley has a range of quirky mannerisms that are more reminiscent of Elaine in Seinfeld than of any other Brit-com woman." [...] The character also gained Ripley public recognition; after being noticed by a member of staff in Marks & Spencer, she was so pleased that she invited the woman to dinner.|$|E
500|$|Mary Alice {{appears in}} flashbacks and dream {{sequences}} in {{the remainder of}} the series, during which several previously unknown details about the day she committed suicide are revealed. In season two, Mary Alice {{was the first of the}} housewives to move onto Wisteria Lane, to which she recounts how she met each of them and how they all became friends. In season three, Lynette has a recurring nightmare of the last time she spoke to Mary Alice; while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> her blackmail note for the first time on her front lawn, the day she committed suicide. Lynette asks if she is okay, to which Mary Alice says she is and while Lynette knew otherwise, she had groceries that needed refrigeration, so she simply told Mary Alice she would see her later. After a hostage situation at the local grocery store, Lynette has one final dream in which she speaks to Mary Alice and asks how she can help her; she tells her that we can’t prevent what we can’t predict, and to enjoy the beautiful day, as we get so few of them. Afterward, Mary Alice states that this was the last time Lynette would ever dream of her, and for her sake, she is grateful. In season four, Mary Alice appears in two separate flashbacks to when Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) was first living on Wisteria Lane; in [...] "Now You Know", she and Susan knock on Katherine’s door wondering why there is a moving truck outside her house, to which a rattled Katherine says she got a new job in Chicago. In [...] "Free", Mary Alice is shown to have been babysitting Katherine's daughter Dylan (Hailee Denham) the night the child's father returned, to which Katherine looks immediately panicked and Mary Alice apologizes for any wrongdoing.|$|E

2500|$|In a May interview, Scott said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> {{the entire}} oeuvre of Aldous Huxley. In another interview, she {{admitted}} almost joining a [...] "cult" [...] endorsed by Huxley, {{but did not}} due to the vow of poverty required. Huxley explored reincarnation and destiny, to which Scott also professed [...] during interviews. During Scott's spiritual search, she eventually met the Dalai Lama at a private reception at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Yet, conversely, Scott was a friend and reader of Ayn Rand, an Aristotelian atheist. Later that year, Scott was cast to do the summer-stock version of Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke (1948). Instead, she quit the production and audited two morning courses—philosophy and political science—for six weeks at the University of Southern California.|$|E
2500|$|Popular {{legend has}} it that Otelia and William Mahone {{traveled}} along the newly completed Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad naming stations from Ivanhoe, a book <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> written by Sir Walter Scott. From his historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Windsor, Waverly and Wakefield. She tapped the Scottish Clan [...] "McIvor" [...] for the name of Ivor, a small Southampton County town. When they reached a point in Prince George County not far {{from the end of the}} line at Petersburg, the two could not agree. It is said that they invented a new word in honor of their [...] "dispute", which is how the tiny community of Disputanta was named.

2500|$|The setting {{develops}} this theme. [...] Mary {{was believed}} in the Middle Ages {{to have been a}} very studious girl who was engaged by the Temple of Jerusalem with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the Holy of Holies. [...] The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's Book of Hours; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study {{in a part of the}} Temple (one medieval authority specified [...] that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived). The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in illuminated manuscripts, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.|$|E

On her father's side, she was descended from the celebrated Solomon Sulzer, a famous synagogue cantor and Jewish liturgical composer in Vienna. Her mother was from a [...] "well-to-do Jewish family".

In a review of Volume 12, Patti Martinson criticized the series for being [...] "soap opera-ish", but said she was still enjoying the characters and the plot. Two volumes later, Holly von Winckel criticized the manga's male characters for looking like women and for its unevenly distributed dialogue balloons. Marissa Sammy said the 15th volume was [...] "far richer in plot and appeal" [...] than earlier volumes.

2500|$|On a little-endian system, the bytes {{are written}} {{from left to}} right in {{increasing}} significance, starting with the one's byte: 0Dh at +0, 0Ch at +1, 0Bh at +2, 0Ah at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses {{from left to right}}) shows that the order is reversed (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a hexdump is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows that he or <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>reading</b> a hexdump of a little-endian system and who knows what kind of data he or <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>reading,</b> reads the byte sequence 0Dh,0Ch,0Bh,0Ah as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or 0x0a0b0c0d in hexadecimal notation.

Its focus on morals and manners was influenced by Jane Austen's approach to fiction. He anonymously published [...] Precaution and it received favorable notice from the United States and England. By contrast, his second novel The Spy (1821) was inspired by a tale related to him by neighbor and family friend John Jay. It was more successful and became a bestseller; the setting of this Revolutionary War tale is widely believed to have been John Jay's family home [...] "The Locusts" [...] in Rye, New York. In 1823, Cooper published The Pioneers, the first of the Leatherstocking series. The series features Natty Bumppo, a resourceful American woodsman at home with the Delaware Indians and their chief Chingachgook. Bumppo was also the main character of Cooper's most famous novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826), written in New York City where Cooper and his family lived from 1822 to 1826.
