Based on fifteen months ethnographic study in two clinics this thesis traces the changes that have taken place in the regulation of commercial intimacy in Dakar following the integration of an experimental regime at the state clinic and the creation of the identity “clandestine” by non-governmental organizations. Despite the enormous changes that have taken place over the course of the twentieth century, colonial <b>sanitary</b> <b>regulation</b> remains a governing “biopolitical paradigm” (Epstein, 2007), leaving its traces in the therapeutic, experimental, and affective lives of the clinics. In this thesis I examine how racial, gender, and class difference is produced in regulation through (1) the racial politics of colonial policy; (2) enactments of social and individual bodies at the Enda mobile clinic; (3) how difference is written into the onto-epistemologies of molecular biology; (4) how attempts to understand and accommodate difference are attempted through bioethics and the material effects of ethical practice. I do this by paying close attention to the ethnomethods of the professionals I study and to the local historical geographies of clinical practice. Throughout this thesis I think about the feminist biopolitics that might be capable of responding to and theorizing the surprising social life of the clinics...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the effect of {{conventional}} air chilling associated to intermittent spray-chilling treatment, on weight loss, physico-chemical and bacteriological quality of beef carcasses. Two plants of commercial beef slaughterhouse located in Goiânia and fiscalized by the Federal Inspection Service were used to develop the research. The spray-chilling treatment was accomplished in an intermittent way, commanded by a controlled logical program, with cycles of 90 seconds, in intervals of 30 minutes, during the first 4 hours of the chilling process. Physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis were made in spray-chilled water and carcasses samples, according to recommendation of the effective legislation. The average values of carcasses weight loss of treatment group were lower to the ones verified for the control group, in both plants, A and B, (P < 0, 001), showing a high economic potential. As a conclusion of physico-chemical and bacteriological analysis results of water and meat samples, it is clear that the technology of chilling beef carcasses in the conventional system associated to spraying did not interfere in the quality of meat, and it can become an analysis object on part of official organs for <b>sanitary</b> <b>regulation</b> and fiscalization, for its definitive adoption...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] An environmental history of Kansas City and an urban history of the Missouri River, this dissertation shows how interconnected the city and the river were through the twentieth century. Examining how the river literally flowed through the infrastructure (pipes and sewers) and the citizenry (drinking water and excrement) of the Kansas Cities illuminates the interrelationships and trans-boundary connectedness of the city's social and environmental history. Exploring the intimate uses of the river also shows how public health brought residents upstream and downstream from Kansas City into relationship with each other as each part broadens to a wider set of connections, to encompass the lower Missouri River basin.

While airports have {{been at the forefront of}} measures to prevent the importation of ‘foreign’ infectious diseases since the early 1930 s, the present scale of international aeromobility combined with heightened awareness of the role air travel plays in the global spread of human pathogens, the epidemiological obsolescence of many early aeronautical <b>sanitary</b> <b>regulations,</b> and a dearth of academic studies on health security at airports, provide compelling reasons to examine the development, content, and implications of the existing Port Health Regulations and associated health security practices that are performed at UK airports.
