Using yearly data for the period from 1985 to 2012 we conducted a Granger-causality test, Impulse response functions and Variance decompositions that were simulated from the estimated unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR).

Granger causality results show that <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> and the economic growth have a causal impact on house prices.

Additionally, both the long-run and short-term influences of the combined residential and office property <b>prices</b> on the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> weakened after controlling {{for changes in the}} macroeconomic influences. Whilst the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> are largely influenced by the office property prices in the long run; the residential property prices impact stronger on the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> in the short-term. Thus the combined perspective has significant implications in mixed asset allocation that includes stock and property investments. ...|$|R

50|$|Many {{companies}} use employee {{stock options}} plans to retain and attract employees, the objective being to give employees {{an incentive to}} behave {{in ways that will}} boost the company's stock price. If the company's <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> rises above the call price, the employee could exercise the option, pay the exercise price and would be issued with ordinary shares in the company. The employee would experience a direct financial benefit of the difference between the market and the exercise prices. If the market price falls below the stock exercise price at the time near expiration, the employee is not obligated to exercise the option, in which case the option will lapse. Restrictions on the option, such as vesting and non-transferring, attempt to align the holder's interest with those of the business shareholders.|$|E

To allow the user to determine that more than one stock was being portrayed, different timbres or brightnesses might be used for the different stocks, or they may be played to the user from different points in space, for example, through different sides of their headphones.|$|E
5000|$|Frye and Hughes had {{a falling}} out in 1946. Hughes' {{financial}} advisor Noah Dietrich said that Frye was ruining {{the company with}} overexpansion. TWA's <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> plunged from $53 a share to $10 as the airline suffered a pilot's strike and a temporary grounding of its Constellation fleet. Hughes dictated to management a 50% cut across the board {{as a solution to}} the financial problems. In December 1946, Hughes loaded the TWA Board of Directors with men from the Hughes Tool Co. Frye resigned in February 1947, followed three months later by Richter. Thus ended the era of [...] "The Airline Run by Flyers".In the next two decades, TWA suffered constant changes in management, with the exception of Ralph Damon. TWA survived partly due to the airline's legal maneuvering of the 1940s that eliminated a possible competitive threat from American Overseas Airlines, affiliated with American Airlines. C.R. Smith, President of American, unhappy with the AOA's financial results, sold AOA to Pan American in 1950; TWA and Pan Am were the only U.S. airlines scheduling passenger flights to Europe until National started in 1970.|$|E

50|$|As an author, Casti {{has written}} more than 120 {{scientific}} articles and seven technical monographs and textbooks on mathematical modeling. In addition, he was formerly {{editor of the}} journals Applied Mathematics & Computation (Elsevier, New York) and Complexity (Wiley, New York). In 1989 his text/reference works Alternate Realities: Mathematical Models of Nature and Man (Wiley, 1989) was awarded a prize by the Association of American Publishers in a competition among all scholarly books published in mathematics and the natural sciences. In 1992, he also published Reality Rules (Wiley, New York), a two-volume text on mathematical modeling. In addition to these technical volumes, he has written fourteen popular books on science. These include Paradigms Lost: Images of Man in the Mirror of Science (Morrow, NY, 1989), which addresses several of the most puzzling controversies in modern science, Searching for Certainty: What Scientists Can Know About the Future (Morrow, NY, 1991), a volume dealing with problems of scientific prediction and explanation of everyday events like the weather, <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> movements and the outbreak of warfare, and Complexification (HarperCollins, NY, 1994), a study of complex systems {{and the manner in}} which they give rise to counterintuitive, surprising behavior. Dr. Casti has also written three popular volumes on mathematics: Five Golden Rules: Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics---and Why They Matter; a sequel, Five More Golden Rules (1995, 2000) both published by John Wiley & Sons (New York); and Mathematical Mountaintops: The Five Most Famous Problems of All Time, published and later recalled by Oxford University Press (New York). In addition, in 1996 he published Would-Be Worlds, a volume on computer simulation and the way it promises to change the way we do science, also published by John Wiley & Sons (New York). In 1998 he published a volume of scientific fiction, involving Ludwig Wittgenstein, Alan Turing, J. B. S. Haldane, C. P. Snow and Erwin Schrödinger in a fictional dinner-party conversation centered about the question of the uniqueness of human cognition and the possibility of thinking machines. This book was published under the title The Cambridge Quintet by Little, Brown (London) in December 1997 and by Addison-Wesley in the US in early 1998.More recently, his published books include Art & Complexity (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2005), a volume edited with A. Karlqvist, as well as a short volume on the life of the Austrian logician, Kurt Gödel, the book Gödel: A Life of Logic (Perseus Books, Cambridge, MA, 2003). In the same year he published the volume, The One, True, Platonic Heaven (Joseph Henry Press, Washington, DC, 2003), which addresses in a fictional format the question of the limits to scientific knowledge. The volume on art and complexity sparked off a continuing interest in the interrelationship between complex systems and artistic forms of all types, which is reflected in a set of papers currently in preparation addressing the complexity of scientific theories regarded as artistic forms.|$|E

Stock price prediction is one of the emerging field in neural network forecasting area. This paper also presents the Neural Networks ability to forecast the daily <b>Stock</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Prices.</b> <b>Stock</b> <b>market</b> prediction is very difficult since it depends on several known and unknown factors while the Artificial Neural Network is a popular technique for the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> Forecasting. The Neural Network is based on the concept of ‘Learn by Example’. In this paper, Neural Networks and Statistical techniques are employed to model and forecast the daily <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> and then the results of these two models are compared. The forecasting ability of these two models is accessed using MAPE, MSE and RMSE. The results show that Neural Networks, when trained with sufficient data, proper inputs and with proper architecture, can predict the <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> very well. Statistical technique though well built but their forecasting ability is reduced as the series become complex. Therefore, Neural Networks can be used as an better alternative technique for forecasting the daily <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

These findings lead us to be skeptical of recent claims that the <b>stock</b> <b>market's</b> poor performance during the 1970 's can be explained by volatility-induced increases in risk premia. ...|$|R
