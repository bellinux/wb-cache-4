5|$|Bo's {{tenure in}} Dalian {{was marked by}} the city's phenomenal {{transformation}} from a drab port city to a modern metropolis, a 'showcase' of China's rapid economic growth. In the early 1990s, Bo took <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> {{the construction of the}} Shenyang-Dalian Expressway, China's first controlled-access freeway, winning accolades for the rapid expansion of infrastructure and for environmental work. Since Bo's time in office, Dalian became {{known as one of the}} cleanest cities in China, having won the UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award in 1999. In addition, Bo was an advocate for free enterprise and small businesses, and successfully courted foreign investment from South Korea, Japan, and Western countries. In contrast to his colleagues, he held press conferences at Chinese New Year, and developed a reputation among foreign investors for 'getting things done'.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} innings at Headingley, Panesar picked up three wickets {{including}} that of Inzamam-ul-Haq, who overbalanced and dislodged the bails with his stomach to be dismissed hit wicket. In the second innings Panesar had figures of 3 for 39. Panesar was given <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> responding to criticism from England coach Duncan Fletcher. Despite his performances in the Test arena against Pakistan {{in the summer of}} 2006, Panesar was overlooked for the 30 man ODI squad for the 2006 ICC Champion's Trophy in India.|$|E
25|$|North Hobart won the toss kicked to {{the eastern}} end of the ground. With the aid of a {{westerly}} wind, North Hobart was the dominant team in general play. The Robins managed eleven scoring shots to Wynyard's two, but led by only 19 points at quarter time, 3.8 (26) to 1.1 (7). <b>Some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> North Hobart's inaccuracy in front of goal is given to strong defensive work by Wynyard's Phillip Dell and David Cox. John Devine was instrumental as ruck-rover around the ground. Late in the quarter, the Cats finally managed a goal against the wind, courtesy of a downfield free kick to West.|$|E

25|$|On 3 May 2015, The Economist {{published}} a report outlining Pakistan's economic performance. It highlighted that Pakistan's economic performance {{said that the}} economy will grow by 4.7% next year, the fastest rate in eight years. Consumer prices rose by 2.5% in between January to March 2015, the smallest increase {{for more than a}} decade. Twice already this year the central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate. It said that the government of Nawaz Sharif takes <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the economy's new stability. It has stuck to an IMF programme agreed to in 2013, a few months after it came to power in Pakistan's first-ever handover from one civilian government to another. Foreign-exchange reserves have more than doubled, to $17.7billion.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{their poor}} reputation, the Besser shorts did have their comedic moments. In general, the remakes had the {{traditional}} Stooges knockabout look and feel, such as 1958's Pies and Guys (a scene-for-scene remake of Half-Wits Holiday, which {{itself was a}} reworking of the earlier Hoi Polloi), Guns a Poppin (1957), Rusty Romeos (1957) and Triple Crossed (1959). In contrast, Hoofs and Goofs, Horsing Around and Muscle Up a Little Closer (all 1957) mostly resembled the sitcoms of the era. A Merry Mix Up (also 1957) and Oil's Well That Ends Well (1958) are also amusing, while the musical Sweet and Hot (1958) deserves <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> straying from the norm. The American space craze also led to three entries focusing on space travel: Space Ship Sappy, Outer Space Jitters (both 1957) and Flying Saucer Daffy (1958).|$|E
25|$|Howard started {{circulating}} {{the story}} that his corps' failure had actually been triggered {{by the collapse of}} Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday's I Corps to the west, and this was a partial reason for Doubleday's removal from command of the corps. However, this excuse was not accepted by history—the reverse was actually true—and the reputation of the XI Corps was ruined. Some argue that Howard should get <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the eventual success at Gettysburg because he wisely stationed one of his divisions (Maj. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr's) on Cemetery Hill as a reserve and critical subsequent defensive line. For the remainder of the three-day battle, the corps remained on the defensive around Cemetery Hill, withstanding assaults by Maj. Gen. Jubal Early on July 2 and participating at the margin of the defense against Pickett's Charge on July 3. Also at Gettysburg, Howard's younger brother, Major Charles Henry Howard, served as his aide-de-camp.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich named Fat Tony's death the ninth Best TV Character Death of 2010, writing, [...] "give the writers <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> doing something different: In the middle of an otherwise straightforward mob-themed episode, they actually went ahead and killed off Fat Tony, a character who was first introduced almost twenty years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Bullock, another {{board member}} of the {{organizing}} committee and also head of the Utah League of Cities and Towns, often clashed with Romney at the time, and later said that Romney deserved <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the turnaround {{but not as much as}} he claimed. Bullock said: [...] "He tried very hard to build an image of himself as a savior, the great white hope. He was very good at characterizing and castigating people and putting himself on a pedestal." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 1883 {{eruption}} of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped {{the effects on}} the sky over several years. They labelled the phenomenon the [...] "equatorial smoke stream". In the 1920s, a Japanese meteorologist, Wasaburo Oishi, detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji. [...] He tracked pilot balloons, also known as pibals (balloons used to determine upper level winds), as they rose into the atmosphere. Oishi's work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because {{it was published in}} Esperanto. American pilot Wiley Post, the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> discovery of jet streams. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above [...] In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.|$|E

The opposition used this in their favor and alleged that the bombing targets were solely pro-Serbian forces in Montenegro, like party headquarters.|$|R
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode". Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode is kind of a yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E
500|$|Marc Buxton of Den of Geek {{scored the}} episode {{three out of}} five stars, calling it filler, but fun, and saying that the Ghost Rider prison {{sequence}} [...] "made the episode" [...] for him. Buxton said he [...] "digs" [...] the connections made between Mac and Civil War, but felt {{the end of that}} subplot with Simmons was confusing and could have been made clearer. Kevin Fitzpatrick of ScreenCrush said the series [...] "deserves <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> venturing into" [...] the prison breakout trope, and thought the action sequences were impressive, but felt that Johnson's storyline was [...] "nowhere near as compelling as the series wants it to be" [...] and contrived, and said that the Mace/Simmons subplot was [...] "consistently dashing any energy or momentum built up from the prison scenes". Fitzpatrick also criticized the ghost effects. Collider's Evan Valentine gave the episode four stars out of five, indicating a [...] "very good" [...] episode, saying, [...] "When Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it manages to find something interesting and worthwhile for each of its cast to dig their teeth into, and this episode {{is one of the most}} on-point examples of that we’ve seen this season." [...] He highlighted the action scenes, character interactions, and the Ghost Rider visual effects.|$|E
500|$|Publications such as GQ, Rolling Stone, and People have {{referred}} to Lautner as a sex symbol, with the latter publication calling the actor a future epitome of pop culture. He {{has been called the}} new young adult star that can [...] "both woo the girls with his intensity and impress the boys with his rugged agility." [...] According to Mickey Rapkin of GQ, the use of Lautner's physique in films has been compared to Megan Fox in her work. After his massive physical change following Twilight, Lautner became a tabloid teen idol with his co-stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. Lautner, determined to stay in the series, worked out every day and gained over [...] of muscle in order to bulk up for the role of Jacob Black in the remaining films in The Twilight Saga. Michelle Lanz of MSN Wonderwall said that Lautner's change may have saved his career. Several critics credit Lautner's physical characteristics for much {{of the success of the}} Twilight series, with critic Sharon Waxman stating, [...] "as a tabloid teen idol, he certainly deserves <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> New Moon's $700 million worldwide gross." [...] Lautner's abs in particular have been subject to media attention, with The Wrap stating that companies bidding for the actor in movies in 2011 would [...] "shell out for the young actor's much-on-display though mostly untried abs." [...] Mickey Rapkin of GQ said, [...] "the film's marketing issues were solved when Lautner's [...] "abdominal muscles became New Moons main talking point, not to mention his calling card." [...] He was named number one on Access Hollywood's [...] "Top 5 Hollywood Abs" [...] list.|$|E

June turns to her right and beckons to Ward, whom we see pruning shrubbery with hedge clippers, then to her left, where Wally {{looks up from his}} lawn mower near some shrubbery, then toward the walkway, where Beaver looks up happily from mowing, all as the stars are announced.

2500|$|Despite {{negative}} {{reception of}} the film, critics praised Annabeth Gish {{in the role of}} the wheelchair-using Susan Sparks.

2500|$|Hooke was apt to use ciphers {{and guard}} his ideas.

Hooke also was immensely busy and thus unable– or in some cases unwilling, pending a way of profiting from the enterprise via letters patent– to develop all of his own ideas. This was a time of immense scientific progress, and numerous ideas were developed in several places simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservative {{government}} was also increasingly {{accused in the}} media of [...] "sleaze". Their support reached its lowest ebb in late 1994, after {{the sudden death of}} Labour Party leader John Smith and the election of Tony Blair as his successor, when Labour had up to 60% of the vote in opinion polls and had a lead of some 30 points ahead of the Conservatives. The Labour lead was gradually narrowed over the next two years, as the Conservatives gained <b>some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment.

2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the {{emergence}} of a world market must also go to the dynasty. It {{played a significant role in}} linking the markets of China to the rest of the world. The market structure and economic policies of the Chola dynasty were more conducive to a large-scale, cross-regional market trade than those enacted by the Chinese Song Dynasty. A Chola record gives their rationale for engagement in foreign trade: [...] "Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses attach to yourself by providing them with villages and decent dwellings in the city, by affording them daily audience, presents and allowing them profits. Then those articles will never go to your enemies." ...|$|E

Democrats later developed microtargeting capabilities for the 2006 election cycle.
