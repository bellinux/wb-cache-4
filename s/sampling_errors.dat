5|$|The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, {{established}} in 1989, demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-harm exceeded {{that of the}} males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy {{has been known to}} vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general. Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and <b>sampling</b> <b>errors,</b> directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.|$|E

According to a nationwide poll of 2,242 U.S. adults surveyed online in September 2005 by Harris Interactive (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to <b>sampling</b> <b>errors,</b> non-response,etc.), 90% of U.S. Catholics supported the use of birth control/contraceptives.

25|$|Nonprobability {{sampling}} is any {{sampling method}} where {{some elements of}} the population have no chance of selection (these are {{sometimes referred to as}} 'out of coverage'/'undercovered'), or where the probability of selection can't be accurately determined. It involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest, which forms the criteria for selection. Hence, because the selection of elements is nonrandom, nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of <b>sampling</b> <b>errors.</b> These conditions give rise to exclusion bias, placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population. Information about the relationship between sample and population is limited, making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population.|$|E

If the sample is the entire population, {{then there is no}} <b>sampling</b> <b>error.</b> A relatad point is that <b>sampling</b> <b>error</b> is a functicn of sample size, as a hypothetical example illustrates. As the sample statistics more and more closely approximate the population parameters, the sampling distributions have less and less variability, and the standard error (standard deviation of the sampling distribution) decreases until there is no <b>sampling</b> <b>error.</b> <b>Sampling</b> <b>error</b> is two dimensional in that the effects of <b>sampling</b> <b>error</b> increase and decrease as a function of how many of the population members are sampled as well as who is sampled. In a one dimensional framework, <b>sampling</b> <b>error</b> is simply the difference between the results one would have obtained if one sampled the entire population and the results one did obtain.

50|$|According to a differing view, a {{potential}} {{example of a}} <b>sampling</b> <b>error</b> in evolution is genetic drift; a change is a population’s allele frequencies due to chance.

Additionally, in 1969, they reasserted the Catholic principle of primacy of conscience, a principle that they said should be properly interpreted.

40|$|Crop {{yield and}} revenue {{insurance}} products with coverage based on actual production history (APH) yields dominate the U. S. Federal Crop Insurance Program. The APH yield, which plays {{a critical role}} in determining the coverage offered to producers, is based on a small sample of historical yields for the insured unit. The properties of this yield measure are critical in determining the value of the insurance to producers. <b>Sampling</b> <b>error</b> in APH yields has the potential to lead to over-insurance in some years and under-insurance in other years. Premiums, which are in part determined by the ratio of the APH yield to the county reference yield, are also affected by variations in APH yields. Congress has enacted two measures, yield substitution and yield floors, that are intended to limit the degree to which <b>sampling</b> <b>error</b> can reduce the insurance guarantee and producer welfare. We examine the impact of <b>sampling</b> <b>error</b> and related policy provisions for Texas cotton, Kansas wheat, and Illinois corn. The analysis is conducted using county level yield data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service and individual insured-unit-level yield data obtained from the Risk Management Agency’s insurance database.
