60|$|If this be so, a false opinion, like an {{erroneous}} motive, {{can hardly}} have even a provisional usefulness. For {{how can you}} attack an erroneous way of thinking except in detail, {{that is to say}} through the sides of this or that single wrong opinion? Each of these wrong opinions is an illustration and type, as it is a <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> and abettor, of some kind of wrong reasoning, though they are not all on the same scale nor all of them equally instructive. It is precisely by this method of gradual displacement of error step by step, that the few stages of progress which the race has yet traversed, have been actually achieved. Even if the place of the erroneous idea is not immediately taken by the corresponding true one, or by the idea which is at least one or two degrees nearer to the true one, still the removal of error in this purely negative way amounts to a positive gain. Why? For the excellent reason that it is the removal of a bad element which otherwise tends to propagate itself, or even if it fails to do that, tends at the best to make the surrounding mass of error more inveterate. All error is what physiologists term fissiparous, and in exterminating one false opinion you may be hindering the growth of an uncounted brood of false opinions.|$|E

50|$|In a deteriorating {{political}} climate, it is {{a chance}} encounter that sets the ground for a consequential and lasting relationship with a businessman from Hamburg, Ernst Michael Winter, who had asked to see an artist studio. Possibly due to the coincidence of names between the classical painter N. Grigorescu and himself (as the joke goes), or rather because Octav's brother, Constantin, worked as an engineer at the firm the Germans were selling equipment to, the visit was a true meeting of the minds, or artistic sensibilities. In fact, soon after, Mr. Winter dedicated himself to art opening a gallery. Two exhibitions in Hamburg, the third scheduled but stopped by the artist's death, followed, a relationship of trust and long <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> ensued. This success brought various forms of harassment from the government. The unbearable last years of the regime, doubled by the offensive cult of personality, pushed the painter one more time to seek exile.

The response rate was 80 %. The most commonly prescribed <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> provided prone and upright postures. The results showed conflicting assessment criteria for the use of a prone standing position. All of the therapists agreed that the choice of <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> was based on an assessment but the criteria varied. The mean age to start using a <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> was 13. 2 months (range 6 - 48 months). The reasons for using a <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> and what is hoped to be achieved were agreed by over 80 % of the therapists i. e. increased bone mineral density, reduction of contractures, maintenance of muscle length, experience of 'normal' standing position, for social reasons, for physiological benefits and for development of the hip joint. However muscle strength was a priority for only 64 % of physiotherapists when using this equipment. 55 % of physiotherapists believed that current standing supports meets the needs of the user and 30 % did not. The results indicated a need for more evidence to support the use of standing supports and guidelines for their provision and use...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} early {{development}} of postural adjustments during external perturbations {{in two different}} standing positions: <b>standing</b> with <b>support</b> and <b>standing</b> without <b>support.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to assess a group of 13 infants four times during the period in life when independent standing is achieved; at 8, 10, 12 and 14 months. However, longitudinal data could be achieved only in four infants. Muscle activations of the neck, hip and ankle were recorded using surface electromyography. Based on earlier studies and controversies, three main issues were addressed: (1) Is direction specificity present before independent standing is established? (2) How do postural adjustments change with increasing age (8 - 14 months) ? (3) Are postural adjustments task-specific in the young child? The results showed that our small sample of infants aged 8 and 10 months, who were not yet able to stand independently, exhibited direction-specific postural adjustments both during standing with and without support, though not consistently during all trials and at all body levels. Therefore, we argue that direction specificity might constitute a prerequisite for the development of independent standing. We also found that the development of postural adjustments in <b>standing</b> with <b>support</b> resembles that of sitting, i. e. great variation in the postural adjustments at early age, and fine-tuning to the situation with increasing age and experience. This, we find that this is in agreement with the proposal that postural control develops through a selection process of the most suitable postural adjustments for the situation from a repertoire of direction-specific postural adjustments. The development of postural adjustments during <b>standing</b> without <b>support</b> is discussed. Additionally, differences in response rates were noted between the two standing positions, indicating that even before independent standing is established, sophisticated sensorimotor integration enables task-specific postural adjustments...|$|R

40|$|Longwall mines {{typically}} {{use some}} form of <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> for secondary roof support in longwall tailgate entries. Although {{there have been several}} new support products developed for this application, there remains no universal design criteria to optimize the application of these support technologies. The requirement for optimization and proper support selection is to understand the degree of control that the support has on the ground behavior. The ground reaction curve and numerical modeling was used to evaluate the impact of <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> on ground behavior. LaModel was used to evaluate the impact of <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> on main roof and floor behavior and pillar yielding. The conclusion drawn from this study was that standing supports do not have sufficient capacity to control main roof or floor loading or prevent the resulting convergence of the tailgate entry. However, it is imperative that this uncontrollable convergence be considered in the support design to prevent premature failure of the support. A FLAC model was used to evaluate the near-seam roof and floor behavior in conjunction with the global vertical and horizontal stresses. The model suggests that standing roof supports can have some impact on the ground behavior as the elastic response of the rock is exceeded and rock structure deteriorates from the stress concentrations that develop around the tailgate opening. During this phase, the capacity and stiffness of the <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> can be critical to the stability of the opening, as eventually the rock mass will be transformed into a partially detached structure whose weight must be supported by the <b>standing</b> <b>support.</b> This work is part of a ground control program of research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) aimed at improving mine safety by reducing roof fall injuries and fatalities...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{safety component}} for all underground mining is intrinsic and <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> systems. Specifically, tabular hardrock mining exploits {{a wide variety}} of deposits that require various methodologies to safely mine the ore material. Several new support systems have been developed in recent years for hard rock applications which have been modified or applied in a variety of ground control applications. These include prestressing devices, improved cribs, and free standing supports. Various <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> and prop-type systems have been designed for hardrock applications with seismic loading conditions to accept prestressing. The prestressing, using water-filled cells, creates an active load upon installation and is considered essential to maintain support during and after the blasting of the mine faces. Heavy seismic activity is also present in these mines and the prestressing units can provide some energy absorption capability to help preserve the integrity of the support. This paper presents an overview of these innovations in support technology...|$|E
40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{study was conducted}} with Emerald Coal Resources, L. P., an affiliate of Foundation Coal Corporation, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} (partially) pre-driven longwall recovery rooms supported with pumpable roof supports. This paper evaluates the load transfer mechanics associated with the advancement of the longwall face into the pre-driven recovery room and the widening of the room to recover the longwall shields. The results show that the yielding of the panel fender produced uncontrollable convergence that caused yielding of the shields and stiff pumpable roof supports when the face was approximately 10 ft from the recovery room. The shields continued to yield until the face advanced into the recovery room. Convergence in the pre-driven recovery room typically reached 6 - 8 in once the pumpable supports yielded and shed load through a declining residual load capacity prior to being cut out by the longwall shearer. Roof deformations occurred beyond the 32 -ft horizon with total deformation ranging from 2 to 4 in, indicating that <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> was necessary to help control the span as the longwall face advanced into the pre-driven recovery room. Stability improved as the pumpable supports were cut out, thereby reducing the span between the shields and the outby pillars. In the end, the shields were successfully recovered under stable ground conditions. However, a disconcerting discovery was the load shedding of the outby pillars as the recovery room was mined into. It is postulated that this may be due to the progression of the rear abutment moving toward the recovery room as the panel fender and <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> in the recovery room yield and shed load. This behavior was not expected with a relatively narrow room that is fully supported with <b>standing</b> <b>support.</b> If this mechanism is indeed occurring, the width of the room and performance of the <b>standing</b> <b>support</b> becomes even more critical. Premature failure of the support can lead to excessive convergence on the shield line that cannot be controlled even with modern shields, resulting in roof instabilities that can lead to catastrophic results...|$|E
