25|$|It {{had been}} {{actively}} targeted during the <b>Sunrise</b> <b>period</b> by speculators using fast track Benelux trademarks to create prior rights on various high value generic terms {{and during the}} landrush by speculators using EU front companies in the UK and Cyprus to register large numbers of domains. While speculative activity occurred with the launch of other domains, it was {{the scale of the}} activity that called into question the competence of EURid in protecting the integrity of eu ccTLD.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sunrise</b> <b>Period</b> {{was broken}} into two phases. The first phase, which began on 7 December 2005 was to {{facilitate}} applications by registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names. The second phase began on 7 February 2006 and covered company, trade and personal names. In {{the case of}} all Sunrise applications, the application needed {{to be accompanied by}} documents proving the claim to ownership of a certain right. The decision was then made by PricewaterhouseCoopers Belgium, which had been chosen as the validation agent by EURid.|$|E

2500|$|...eu is {{the country}} code {{top-level}} domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). Launched on 7 December 2005, the domain is available for any person, company or organization based in the European Economic Area (the EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The TLD is administered by EURid, a consortium originally consisting of the national ccTLD registry operators of Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, joined later by the national registry operator of the Czech Republic. Trademark owners were able to submit registrations through a <b>sunrise</b> <b>period,</b> {{in an effort to}} prevent cybersquatting. Full registration started on 7 April 2006.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Sunrise</b> <b>period</b> {{is often}} a 30-day (or longer) phase during which {{trademark}} owners can purchase domain names before they are offered to the general public. This period of time allows for companies to keep the domain name associated with their brand before someone can publicly purchase the domain. Often domains such as info, mobi, pk, and eu are picked up by companies during the <b>sunrise</b> <b>period</b> that proceeds the larger landrush period. In order {{to participate in the}} <b>sunrise</b> <b>period,</b> one has to be a registered trademark holder with the Trademark Clearing House. The allowance of time for each registered domain name in the <b>sunrise</b> <b>period</b> is two years. After that, the trademark holder needs to reclaim their domain.|$|E
5000|$|Dawn (from an Old English verb dagian [...] "to become day") or astronomical dawn is {{the time}} that marks, {{depending}} on the specific usage, {{the beginning of the}} twilight before <b>sunrise,</b> the <b>period</b> of the pre-sunrise twilight or the time of sunrise. When identified as the beginning of or the period of twilight, it is recognized by the presence of weak sunlight, while the Sun itself is still below the horizon.|$|R
5000|$|Recreational {{vessels are}} {{required}} to display navigation lights between sunset and <b>sunrise</b> and during <b>periods</b> of reduced visibility (fog, rain, haze, etc.). The U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules specify lighting requirements for every description of watercraft.|$|R
5000|$|The General Availability phase follows all <b>Sunrise</b> and Landrush <b>periods.</b> This {{is an open}} period {{based on}} the [...] "first come, first served" [...] policy to the public. Typically, 90 {{calendar}} days after General Availability opens for each new gLTD, registries must provide Trademark Claims.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Sunrise</b> <b>Period</b> is a {{time period}} {{immediately}} prior to the launching of a TLD. Trademark Clearinghouse registrants receive priority access to reserve domain names associated with their trademarks before general access. New gTLD registries are required to offer a <b>Sunrise</b> <b>period</b> of at least 30 days.|$|E

25|$|The preparation, development, and {{technical}} {{testing of the}} domain started in 2007 by registrar RU Center. The domain delegation process started in November 2009 as an application to ICANN under the new Fast Track IDN ccTLD process. The domain {{is expected to be}} launched in 2010. In preparation for a launch, RU Center opened a <b>sunrise</b> registration <b>period</b> for Russian trademark owners from 25 November 2009 to 25 March 2010. General public registrations are planned starting 20 April 2010 through June 2010 using a Dutch auction process, and at a fixed price beginning in July 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The heliacal rising ( [...] , [...] ) {{of a star}} occurs {{annually}} when {{it first}} becomes visible above the eastern horizon {{for a brief moment}} just before <b>sunrise,</b> after a <b>period</b> of time when it had not been visible. Historically, the most important such rising is that of Sirius, which was an important feature of the Egyptian calendar and astronomical development.|$|R
40|$|Nocturnal {{species may}} {{communicate}} by visual signals {{more frequently than}} previously thought. In fact, such species are habitually active around sunset and sunrise, when light conditions are still suitable for visual communication. We investigated the communication function of a visual cue in the eagle owl Bubo bubo, a nocturnal predator. In this species, territorial and courtship displays peak during the sunset and <b>sunrise</b> <b>periods</b> and involve the display of a white badge located on the throat whose reflectance properties are sex and period dependent. Experimental intrusions were conducted at 30 eagle owl territories {{in order to understand}} the function of the white badge during contests. We analyzed the reactions of both male and female owners toward a taxidermic mount with a normal brightness and a brightness-reduced white badge, with both male and female territorial calls. Our results indicate that the white badge of eagle owls plays an important role in visual communication during contests. Males displayed more frequently toward male low-brightness mounts, which were also approached more closely or attacked. Female behavior did not differ between experimental groups. Furthermore, a positive relationship between male badge brightness and breeding output suggested a potential role of the white badge as an honest signal of male quality. The need to convey information by visual communication in a nocturnal species may have promoted the evolution of visual signals employed at crepuscule. © The Author 2006.

40|$|The {{most common}} catch of the amateur angler is the perch {{and it is}} the diurnal {{periodicity}} of activity (& catchability) which is examined in this study based on earlier articles and manuscripts by the authors. Of all environmental factors, variation in light and temperature are the chief reasons in establishing the times of activity periods. Winter, summer and autumn activity was studied. The spawning perch was found to be more active than the non-spawning perch. The time of day in which the fish may be active is dependant on its ability to sense changes in the external environment. Its adaptation to light is the reason for day-activity in the winter, and also accounts for the fact that hardly any activity occurs between sunset and <b>sunrise</b> when this <b>period</b> exceeds 6 hours...|$|R
40|$|Winter mesospheric echoes are {{observed}} between about 55 and 80 km when auroral absorption is present during daylight hours. Relatively steady auroral absorption during <b>sunrise</b> and sunset <b>periods</b> causes a distinct onset and decay signature in mesospheric echo occurrence. The echo onset and disappearance time are shown versus height by the inclined lines for four different dates. The more vertical lines give the visible sunlight height/time curves for both sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS). The data is combined and replotted {{to give the}} morning onset height and the afternoon disappearance height {{as a function of}} solar zenith angle. Echoes are not observed at the lowest heights in the morning until the solar zenith angle is less than 90 deg. The afternoon echoes at the lowest heights also start to disappear as soon as the solar zenith angle exceeds 90 deg, implying that the solar component which sustains the mesospheric echo is screened by a layer extending up to about 60 km. The morning echo at 73 km onsets near the time of visible sunrise, but in the afternoon the 73 km echo lasts well past visible sunset...|$|R
