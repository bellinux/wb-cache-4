Sister Linda Werthman, the President of the Detroit Regional Community of the Sisters of Mercy, said, [...] "She never stopped being a Sister of Mercy {{in her heart}} {{and many of us}} never <b>stopped</b> <b>thinking</b> of her in that way.

It was already too late: Joe was killed in October 1944. [...] "Here we were," [...] Wheeler later wrote, [...] "so close to creating a nuclear weapon to end the war. I couldn't stop thinking then, and haven't <b>stopped</b> <b>thinking</b> since, that the war could have been over in October 1944." [...] Joe left a widow and baby daughter, Mary Jo, who later married physicist James Hartle.|$|E

[...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. I <b>stopped</b> <b>thinking</b> about him a while back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hughes wanted {{young black}} writers to be {{objective}} about their race, but not to scorn it or flee it. He understood the main points of the Black Power movement of the 1960s, but believed {{that some of the}} younger black writers who supported it were too angry in their work. Hughes's work Panther and the Lash, posthumously published in 1967, was intended to show solidarity with these writers, but with more skill and devoid of the most virulent anger and racial chauvinism some showed toward whites. Hughes continued to have admirers among the larger younger generation of black writers. He often helped writers by offering advice and introducing them to other influential persons in the literature and publishing communities. This latter group, including Alice Walker, whom Hughes discovered, looked upon Hughes as a hero and an example to be emulated within their own work. One of these young black writers (Loften Mitchell) observed of Hughes: [...] "Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, {{for all of us to}} follow. You never got from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never <b>stopped</b> <b>thinking</b> about the rest of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison <b>stopped</b> <b>thinking</b> about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E

[...] In the January 2006 issue of The Artist’s Magazine, which featured Yim’s Lady in Shimmering Light as its cover, Yim’s painting {{is described as a}} “stunning work” which has a “classic quality that crosses geographic and cultural boundaries.” [...] The prominent writer Li Ao, one of Taiwan's foremost public intellectuals, heaped similar praise on Yim's Mackay Practicing Medicine in a supplement to the Yangcheng Evening News in 2008 and also on his television show. [...] Lin Yong, former President of the Guangdong Artists' Association, waxes poetic in a memorable passage: [...] "Yim Mau-Kun has spent decades quietly, calmly, diligently and thoughtfully painting. [...] I don't know how many drawings and paintings he's created, and I don't know how many books he has read. [...] But over the decades, whenever we talk he often has impressive insights; he has never <b>stopped</b> <b>thinking.</b> [...] It's his diligence in studying, thinking, and articulating his thoughts that make me {{think of him as a}} Confucian scholar. [...] His insights have been very beneficial for me. [...] I see deep wrinkles in an old tree, ripples in a river, a rock unmoved by thunder and storms, a massive tree that remains unbent, and I see in Yim Mau-Kun a refreshing spring breeze." [...] Liang Jiang—former Deputy Director of the [...] National Art Museum of China and former Director of the Art Institute of China Army Academy—in the essay [...] "True to Himself" [...] for Taiwan's Arts and Literature Daily celebrates at length Yim's still lifes, landscapes, as well as Crossing the Stormy Strait and Reaching Shore. [...] Ned Jacob, nationally renowned artist and teacher at the Scottsdale Artists' School, in the foreword to A Classical Guide to How to Draw the Head speaks of [...] Yim as [...] "a craftsman of surpassing ability and sensibility," [...] a [...] "brave and vociferous champion of the classical legacy," [...] whose works [...] "resonate [...] virtuosity and boldness of handling[...] [...] [...]Treasures such as these – sacredly kept – will comfort us in those hours when fears and doubts come calling." ...|$|E
