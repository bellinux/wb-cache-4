25|$|The {{final report}} was {{released}} in November 2008, {{one year after the}} crash. It was determined that the accident was caused by pilot error {{as a result of the}} condition known as spatial disorientation. The Turkish Transport minister Binali Yıldırım stated that the crash was a “normal controlled flight into terrain by the fault of the crew.” The report states that the GPWS was not able to produce audible alarms due to a defect. Both the captain and the first officer were rather inexperienced and it was their first approach to Isparta. They did neither enter the Standard Instrument Departure of Istanbul nor the <b>Standard</b> <b>Terminal</b> Arrival Route and approach procedure of Isparta into the flight management system.|$|E

50|$|As is {{the case}} in Marathon, Marathon 2 uses {{computer}} terminals to advance the plot and allow the player to communicate with various artificial intelligences. The player communicates with Durandal and Tycho, both of whom were artificial intelligences aboard the UESC Marathon in the original game (Leela is almost entirely absent from Marathon 2). Because of the translation equipment installed in the player's character's suit, the player can also access S'pht and Pfhor terminals, which function {{in the same manner as}} <b>standard</b> <b>terminals.</b> Terminals in Marathon 2 can change level dynamics by means such as opening or closing doors or altering the tide of liquids, and are capable of teleporting the player not only out of a level but to other locations throughout. The mission of some levels is to access and read certain terminals. Unlike Marathon, Marathon 2 does not pause the game when a player accesses a terminal, leaving him open to attack while reading, in which case the game immediately stops him from reading.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Software defined radio (SDR) {{techniques}} {{are a key}} enabler for multi <b>standard</b> <b>terminals.</b> Recent advancements {{in the evolution of}} powerful hardware allow the development of reconfigurable basebands and their integration in mobile systems. In this paper we propose a novel reconfiguration architecture for such systems. Due to its modular structure and its effective inter module communication both high efficiency and flexibility are enabled. For the developed structure we propose a tailored reconfiguration infrastructure suitable to deploy and configure these modules even in non operating system (OS) driven devices. In order to prove the concept of the architecture a reconfigurable OFDM demodulator is implemented and analysed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} to Intellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP) of multimedia content streams is proposed. The innovative feature of the approach is that the protection procedure is associated, embedded and downloaded with the protected content that is “consumed ” on <b>standard</b> <b>terminals.</b> Such an approach thus enables terminal interoperability, {{which is one of the}} main obstacles to the deployment of “secure ” terminals. The approach takes its origin from the successful experiences in the standardization of toolsets for audio synthesis and processing in the framework of the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). The approach is in course of development together with a prototype implementation in the framework of the IST project MOSES (MPEG Ope...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{downlink}} throughput improvement for IEEE 802. 11 a/g systems by using a modified access point (AP) equipped with multiple antennas.

In this paper we concentrate on channel estimation over acknowledgement (ACK) bursts and effect of imperfections such as non-ideal channel reciprocity and delayed channel estimates. Simulations based on channel models approved by the IEEE 802. 11 Standard Group demonstrate that a near doubling of downlink capacity can be achieved in a conference room environment in the case of low levels of channel reciprocity errors at the AP. 1...|$|R
50|$|The HP 9810, 9820 and 9830 desktop {{computers}} used a slow, serialized TTL {{version of the}} 2116 CPU, although they did not ultimately use any of the operating system or application software, instead relying on user-friendly ROM-based interpreters such as BASIC which worked when powered up and integrated keyboards and displays rather than disks or <b>standard</b> <b>terminals.</b> In 1975, HP introduced the BPC, the world's first 16-bit microprocessor, using HP's NMOS-II process. The BPC was usually packaged in a ceramic hybrid module with the EMC and IOC chips, which added extended math and I/O instructions. The hybrid was developed as {{the heart of the}} new 9825 desktop computer. The later 9845 workstation added an MMU chip. These were the forerunners of personal computers and technical workstations.|$|R
