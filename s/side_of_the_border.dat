5|$|A {{number of}} West German state organisations were {{responsible}} for policing the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> These included the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS, Federal Border Protection), the Bayerische Grenzpolizei (Bavarian Border Police) and the Bundeszollverwaltung (Federal Customs Administration).

5|$|Eventually, Poland and Lithuania {{reached an}} {{agreement}} on a new border that left Sejny on the Polish <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> The Polish–Lithuanian border in the Suwałki Region has remained the same since then (with {{the exception of the}} World War II period).|$|E
5|$|Poland did not {{recognize}} this bilateral treaty. Ensuing tensions heightened until {{the outbreak of the}} Polish–Lithuanian War. Sejny changed hands frequently until it was controlled by Polish forces on September 22, 1920. The situation was legalized by the Suwałki Agreement of October 7, 1920, which effectively returned the town to the Polish <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E

5|$|When {{the modern}} border between Wales and England was {{established}} by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, many Welsh-speaking communities found themselves on the English <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> Welsh was spoken in Archenfield in Herefordshire into the nineteenth century.

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{appears to}} have been in {{existence}} by 1101, when it was known as Godric’s Castle, named probably after Godric of Mappestone, a local Anglo-Saxon thane and landowner mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Victorian historians, however, believed the castle to date back further to the pre-Norman conquest days of King Canute, and the site may have been among a small number of Saxon fortifications along the Welsh border. By Norman times, Goodrich formed part of the Welsh Marches, a sequence of territories granted to Norman nobles in, and alongside, Wales. Although Goodrich lay on the safer, English <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> the threat of raids and attacks continued throughout most of the period.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign {{had been reduced to}} a 'war of words.'

5|$|I-87 takes a northerly track from US11, {{crossing}} the Great Chazy River and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past {{a series of}} homes and businesses built up along nearby US9. As both roads head north out of the village, US9 connects to the Northway one last time at exit43, the last interchange on I-87 before the Canadian border. Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as it begins to run past the customs facilities on the American <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the Canadian border, where the highway continues past the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing into Quebec as A-15.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1632 a well-prepared Russian army took a number of strongholds on the Lithuanian <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> and {{commenced}} a siege of Smolensk. The well-fortified city was able to withstand a general onslaught followed by a ten-month encirclement by an overwhelming force led by Mikhail Shein. At that time a Commonwealth rescue expedition of comparable strength arrived, under the highly effective military command of Władysław IV. After months of fierce fighting, in February 1634 Shein capitulated. The Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed the Deulino territorial arrangements with small adjustments {{in favor of the}} Tsardom. Władysław had relinquished, upon monetary compensation, his claims to the Russian throne.|$|E
5|$|M-73 {{starts on}} its southwestern end on a {{bridge over the}} Brule River that connects across the state line to WIS55 in Forest County, Wisconsin. On the Michigan <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> the highway runs north away from the river. It runs along {{the western edge of}} a section of farm fields before turning eastward to run through them. M-73 passes to the south of Hagerman, Little Hagerman and Bass lakes, after which it turns northeasterly running north of Stanley Lake. The {{northern}} terminus is at US2 west of downtown Iron River. All of M-73 is two-lane rural highway through wooded terrain except the section immediately north of the state line which runs along the aforementioned farm.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Lebanon War was a 34-day {{military}} conflict in Lebanon and northern Israel. The principal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary {{forces and the}} Israeli military. The conflict was precipitated by a cross-border raid by Hezbollah during which they kidnapped and killed Israeli soldiers. The conflict began on 12 July 2006 when Hezbollah militants fired rockets at Israeli border towns as a diversion for an anti-tank missile attack on two armored Humvees patrolling the Israeli <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> fence, killing three, injuring two, and seizing two Israeli soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware {{as early as the}} 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in very {{different}} ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were {{set up on the}} western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border. West Germans such as Michael Gartenschläger and Kurt Lichtenstein were commemorated with signs and memorials, some of which were supported by the government. The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{developed}} the Southwest, the Colorado River {{was seen as}} a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lack, on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> <b>of</b> {{roads and}} tracks {{suitable}} for vehicles meant that movement {{was limited to}} foot tracks mostly unmarked on any map, as well as water and air movement.
