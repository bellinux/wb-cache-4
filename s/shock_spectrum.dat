40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [78]- 80) A pendulum {{was dropped}} on a piano key, throwing the piano hammer upwards {{to strike a}} stationary force transducer. Measurements of the hammer force pulse for different velocities show that the hammer behaves like a hardening spring, becoming stiffer as the impact velocity increases. The residual <b>shock</b> <b>spectrum</b> was obtained with an FFT analyzer. The maximum value of the <b>shock</b> <b>spectrum,</b> fmax, indicates the frequency at which the hammer is most effective at transferring its energy. As the hammer velocity increases, the <b>shock</b> <b>spectrum</b> broadens and fmax increases. Values of fmax, corresponding to velocities observed in a real piano, were obtained for three sets of hammers: properly voiced, hard, and soft, each set covering {{the range of the}} piano keyboard. The dependence of fmax on hammer velocity, stiffness, and position along the piano keyboard is shown to agree very well with the observed timbre of piano sounds for different dynamic levels, hammer stiffnesses, and keyboard position.

40|$|ABSTRACT: I {{have taken}} on the job of {{recording}} the features {{and use of the}} pseudo velocity <b>shock</b> <b>spectrum</b> (PVSS) plotted on four coordinate paper (4 CP). Some of the newer rules could be presented as a separate paper, but knowledge of the PVSS on 4 CP is so limited that few would understand the application. An integrated document is needed to show how all the concepts fit together. The rules cover the definition, interpretation and accuracy of four coordinate paper, simple <b>shock</b> <b>spectrum</b> shape, drop height and the 2 g line, pseudo velocity relation to modal stress, shock severity, destructive frequency range, shock isolation, use with multi degree of freedom systems, low frequency limitation of shaker shock, and relation to the aerospace acceleration SRS concept.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{for the establishment}} of spacecraft loads is strongly influenced by project constraints which include the cost, schedule and allowable weight. The most rigorous approach is the transient loads analysis which requires a composite mathematical model of the spacecraft and launch vehicle. The structural member loads for the entire composite structure are computed by applying the forcing functions, which represent various dynamic environments during the mission, to the composite model. Although this method ideally leads to a lightweight design, it is costly and time consuming due to complex interfaces involving many organizations.

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce a {{repeatable}} <b>shock</b> <b>spectrum</b> is needed for many applications in industry. Flight components and structural systems often require qualification testing consisting of subjecting the payload to a specified shock response spectrum (SRS). Testing is used to qualify sensitive packages for flight, ensuring that the unit will survive and continue to function normally during and after being subjected to the anticipated environment. Traditional pyroshock testing is expensive, the excitation can over test flight components and it is often not repeatable within desired limits. Furthermore, development of shock isolation systems to reduce environments for flight payloads requires similar testing capability. A compressed-air shock test system has been developed using a pneumatic gun to deliver repeatable and controlled transient loads, simulating high-shock flight conditions. This “shock gun ” delivers a captive projectile through a barrel to provide the desired structural response. Measured accelerations are used to quantify the shock performance, typically using the SRS technique. Shock isolation systems have been developed and refined with this system, directed at attenuating high-level, high-frequency loads associated with typical conditions such as launch vehicle fairing and stage separation events. The performance of the present system will be reviewed, and possible extensions of this test method, including ultimate limitations in frequency and amplitude, {{will be discussed in}} the paper. ...|$|E

Our model includes {{the effects of}} large-scale shear due to Galactic differential rotation, density stratification, compressibility, magnetic fields, heating via supernova explosions and parameterized radiative cooling of the interstellar medium. In addition to investigating isolated supernova explosions we allow for multiple supernovae distributed randomly in the Galactic disc and exponentially in the vertical direction. Single supernova explosions drive a strong shock, the lifetime of which is approximately 2 Myr in our model. This stage {{is found to be}} characterized by a kinetic energy spectrum in the diffuse gas with spectral index consistent with k = — 2. Large-scale shear and Coriolis force act on the supernova remnant producing some vorticity inside it, but this process was found to be very weak. In the case of multiple supernova explosions, older remnants have an important role causing density fluctuations in the interstellar medium. In this "clumpy " medium, the propagation velocity of the shock fronts changes due to the changing density, and vorticity is generated.
