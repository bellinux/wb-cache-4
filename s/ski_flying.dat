5|$|Events {{under the}} <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Cup have several {{differences}} to the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Cup is part of the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January at the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships in Kulm, Prevc {{became the}} <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> world champion. The event {{consisted}} of three rounds as the fourth round was cancelled because of strong wind. He set two hill records during the competition.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to co-operate on hill {{design and}} event organisation, the venues at Kulm, Oberstdorf and Planica formed the KOP working group in 1962 (KOP being an {{abbreviation}} of Kulm/Oberstdorf/Planica). This group {{would go on}} to consult with the FIS in all aspects of <b>ski</b> <b>flying,</b> celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2012. In 1953, Kulm hosted the first International <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> Week, which would be the premier event in <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> until 1972.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ski</b> <b>flying</b> events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on the Ski Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> also count towards the Ski Jumping World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> competitions, even if only one took place. In contrast to the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships, the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to the Ski Jumping World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from neither are included as part of the World Cup standings.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} event in <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> is the World Championships, which was first held in Planica in 1972 {{and has been}} staged biennially at all hills (except Ironwood) since 1988. The event replaced various incarnations of International <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> Week, which ran from 1953 to 1989. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded after two competitions, with the total points winner receiving the title of <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Champion. A team competition was introduced in 2004, in which medals are also awarded.|$|E
5|$|A <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there are up to three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged {{as part of the}} <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships or <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation is optional.|$|E

5|$|Unlike ski jumping, {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to ski jumping, athletes are not able to practice on <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the initial}} viral campaign, Red Bull's efforts have {{included}} sponsoring extreme sport events including cliff diving, BMX, <b>skiing,</b> <b>flying,</b> downhill and free-ride mountain biking and skateboarding. In the 1990s, Red Bull sponsored the rower Xeno Müller, who won an Olympic {{gold medal in}} the single sculls in 1996 [...]Red Bull also owns and conducts the Flugtag ("flight day" [...] in German), a competition where entrants launch themselves off a 10-metre ramp in homemade [...] "flying machines" [...] into a body of water (reminiscent of the Birdman Rally); its own version of the soapbox derby called the Red Bull Soap Box Race which was recently held in Cincinnati, Ohio; the Red Bull Art of the Can Competition, an international art competition in which artists are asked to create works using the Red Bull can; and the Red Bull BC One individual breakdance competition; also events such as the motorcycle Erzberg Enduro where less than two percent of entrants finish the course.|$|R
5|$|Vikersundbakken opened as Northern Europe's only <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> hill in March 1966. The {{hill was}} later renovated and {{expanded}} {{ahead of the}} FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 1977 and again ahead of the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 1990. Holmenkollen National Arena and Holmenkollbakken were declared the national venue for Nordic skiing in 1997, ahead of Granåsen in Trondheim and Lysgårdsbakken in Lillehammer. By then ideas had been launched to build a national <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> hill in Rødkleiva. However, it was rejected both by Holmenkollen director Rolf Nyhus and ski jumping director Odd Hammernes, who stated that a new <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> hill would be too expensive.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015/16 season, Prevc won 15 out of 29 World Cup events, the Four Hills Tournament, and {{the overall}} and <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> titles.|$|E

5|$|The {{world record}} stayed in Planica for four years, {{during which the}} K-point at Velikanka bratov Gorišek was {{upgraded}} to 165m {{in time for the}} inaugural <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships in 1972, which eventually superseded International <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> Week. This new event was sanctioned a year earlier by the FIS at their 28th International Ski Congress in Opatija, Croatia (then a part of Yugoslavia). Much like in 1938 when the discipline received official recognition from the FIS, another milestone had been reached as <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> was now granted its own world championship-level event on par with the Ski Jumping World Championships, having spent almost four decades as a mere 'special attraction' alongside its older and more prestigious sibling.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, {{the festival}} added {{one of its}} most popular and {{controversial}} events, drag boat racing on Town Lake. It also added a water <b>skiing</b> championship, kite <b>flying</b> championship and an Austin Grand Prix - sports car racing on city streets.|$|R

50|$|Steep is {{an extreme}} sports game set in an open world {{environment}} of the Alps and Denali (Mount McKinley), which can be explored freely by the players. The game can be played from either a first-person or third-person perspective, which can be switched instantly at players' will. The game also utilizes the GoPro camera during races. The four main activities available in the game include <b>skiing,</b> wingsuit <b>flying,</b> snowboarding and paragliding. Players can switch between these activities by using the game's menu wheel.|$|R
5|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the 1930s, <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> has developed its own distinct history and {{given rise to}} all of the sport's world records. The first hill designed specifically for <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> was built in Slovenia in 1934, after which both Germany and Austria built their own hills in 1950. This was followed by Norway in 1966, the United States in 1970, and the Czech Republic in 1980. From the 1960s to 1980s, a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly, together with hill upgrades and evolutions in technique to fly longer distances.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011/12 season, Prevc {{recorded}} four top 10 finishes. In February, Prevc was {{a member}} of the team that won the first ever World Cup team victory for Slovenia at the <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> team event in Oberstdorf, together with Robert Kranjec, Jurij Tepeš, and Jure Šinkovec. Prevc jumped 225.5 meters (which would equal the hill record) in the one-series event but fell hard after the landing and injured his shoulder. He required an operation which meant that he had to finish the season early and also missed out the <b>Ski</b> <b>Flying</b> World Championships in Vikersund. Although he missed the last five events of the season, Prevc finished 15th in the overall standings.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Planica event and following numerous near-flat ground landings, it became clear that <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> had once again outgrown an older hill and needed enlarging in the years to come. In 2005, almost immediately after the conclusion of the World Cup season, talks were under way to upgrade the hill in Vikersund. This became a reality in mid-2010, when the FIS announced major rule changes at the 47th International Ski Congress in Antalya, Turkey, to allow for <b>ski</b> <b>flying</b> hills to be constructed to their largest sizes yet.|$|E

5000|$|Bloudkova velikanka (also: Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka, Old Bloudkova velikanka, Large Rožman/Bloudek Hill) {{is a large}} {{ski jumping}} hill in Planica, Slovenia, opened in 1934 by Joso Gorec's initiative. The hill was {{originally}} constructed by Ivan Rožman who invented and first in the world used so called [...] "snow cement". and unfairly named after Stanko Bloudek. The hill was renamed Rožman/Bloudkova velikanka posthumously to honor Rožman. A year after opening, Stanko Bloudek became the main constructor, improving the hill until his death and with his vision and skills made Planica world-famous and brought <b>ski</b> jumping/ski <b>flying</b> {{to a whole new}} dimension. As a builder, he is credited with 13 world records and in 1936 the first jump in history over 100 metres. Thus, a new sport was born right on this hill. Hill's axis and name are under national monument protection and cannot be changed. After almost a decade of inactivity, the hill was completely renovated and reopened in 2012. Right next to this one they built a brand new normal hill which replaced the old demolished one about 100 metres to the south.|$|R
