50|$|Outside <b>slotted</b> <b>stator</b> {{laminations}} may {{be processed}} with the needle-winding technique, the flyer-winding technique and the linear-winding technique. The {{selection of the}} process depends on the desired number of turns in the winding and the intended fill factors. Consequently, flyer-winding is particularly used if a thin wire and thus high numbers of windings are expected in combination with a medium and high voltage application. Therefore, it is typically used with “white goods”, such as e.g. household applications, or in general domestic engineering with an operating voltage of 230 V. In the case of stators with less windings and a lower mass, {{it is common to}} process outside <b>slotted</b> <b>stator</b> laminations using the needle-winding technique or the linear winding technique.|$|E
5000|$|... • Inside <b>slotted</b> <b>stator</b> laminationsThe needle-winding {{technique}} basically {{represents the}} only feasible winding process for inside <b>slotted</b> <b>stator</b> laminations. The stator mainly {{consists of a}} steel package, two end plates and slot insulation. The particular benefit of this process technology {{lies in the fact}} that the winding machine produces a completely winded assembly group when adequate electrical slot fill factors are employed. If, however, the use of single teeth requires joining and interconnecting operations, all interconnecting measures of the coil sections of one phase may be executed by the winding machine for the stator laminations. In this case, the electric slot fill factor may amount up to 45%. Since manufacturing a functioning stator merely requires a small effort, the negative impact on the electric fill factor is gladly accepted. In order to be able to use various additional functions of the winding machine, the end plates are often designed in a way which allows e.g. the taking on of cutting terminal contacts. In addition, winding space restrictions and laying ducts for the connecting wires of a phase may be integrated.The material costs are also low due to the small number of individual components. In combination with the modest costs of the means of production, stator laminations constitute a practical solution. Three essential basic concepts frequently come to the fore when dealing with the design of stator laminations. Stator laminations for concentrated winding are divided into the following main groups.|$|E

40|$|Cage {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industries because of their rugged construction and low cost. The drawback with an induction motor is that, it draws high magnetising current. The magnetising current drawn by an induction motor depends on air gap length between stator and rotor, and shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slots.</b> Air gap length in an induction motor is already very less; therefore it is not reduced below a certain level. There are three shapes of stator slots- parallel sided, tapered and circular; generally, the tapered or parallel sided shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> is adopted by manufacturers of induction motors. Here, a comparative study on performance of 3 KWinduction motor with different shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> is presented. It is shown that, the induction motor with circular shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slots</b> shows better efficiency, reduced magnetising current and better overload capacity, than the motors with other shapes of <b>stator</b> <b>slots.</b> Therefore, circular shape of <b>stator</b> <b>slot</b> is {{the best choice for}} 3 KW induction motor...|$|R

50|$|Motors that {{directly}} produce linear motion are called linear motors. The advantage of linear motors {{is that they}} can produce linear motion without the need of a transmission system, such as ballscrewsleadscrew, rack-and-pinion, cam, gears or belts, that would be necessary for rotary motors. Transmission systems are known to introduce less responsiveness and reduced accuracy. Direct drive, brushless DC linear motors consist of a <b>slotted</b> <b>stator</b> with magnetic teeth and a moving actuator, which has permanent magnets and coil windings. To obtain linear motion, a motor controller excites the coil windings in the actuator causing an interaction of the magnetic fields resulting in linear motion. Tubular linear motors are another form of linear motor design operated in a similar way.|$|E
50|$|Plugged tooth coils are {{frequently}} {{used in a}} star-shaped stator design where a final ring or yoke is mounted after the assembly of the coils. Inside <b>slotted</b> <b>stator</b> laminations can also be fitted with plugged tooth coils. But in that case, fill factor losses can be registered due to the plug-in direction from the inside to the outside. Conical windings are only possible and beneficial, if the plug-in direction is from the outside to the inside. As {{for the type of}} insulation, it is possible - as with the classical single teeth - to work with paper insulations or insulating end plates. If insert molding is applied with a star-shaped package, it is not referred to as plugged tooth coils anymore because of the necessary direct winding with a needle winding system, flyer winding technique or linear winding technique.Plugged tooth coils eventually require at least two contact points per coil, just as the single teeth. Toothed chains of a phase connected in series are rarely produced since, compared with the already difficult assembly of phase-wise wound T-segments, they will be followed by further assembly movements (pushing onto the stator pack) and the changing length ratios of the connecting wires between the coil sections of a phase. Therefore, two cut-and-clamp contacts per coil {{are frequently}} used for plugged tooth coils which finally reach into a control card or a lead frame via pin-like forms of the contacts.|$|E
