5|$|Outside Australia it {{has become}} naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not {{considered}} to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and tannin production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} {{reducing}} native biodiversity in many distinct regions across the globe. While {{biological control agent}}s have been effectively utilized to manage invasive plant species and preserve existing biodiversity, not all biological control agents are successful. The invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> (Rhinocyllus conicus) was originally introduced to America as a biological control agent to manage musk thistle (Carduus nutans), {{but it has been}} found to attack several species of native thistle. This study examined the movements of the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> away from musk thistle into two different species of native thistle in the Colorado Front Range: wavyleaf thistle (Cirsium undulatum) and fringed thistle (Cirsium centaureae). Specifically, the proximity of invasive musk thistle to wavyleaf thistle was observed to see if it has any influence on thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> attack upon wavyleaf thistle. Additionally, fringed thistle was observed in three different habitat types in the Colorado Front Range (i. e. meadow, riparian, and tree line habitat) to see if the invasive thistle <b>seed</b> head <b>weevil</b> has been moving up in elevation in response to climate change.

40|$|Breeding for {{resistance}} to biotic and abiotic stresses of global importance in common bean is reviewed {{with emphasis on}} development and application of marker-assisted selection (MAS). The implementation and adoption of MAS in {{breeding for disease resistance}} is advanced compared to the implementation of MAS for insect and abiotic stress resistance. Highlighted examples of breeding in common bean using molecular markers reveal the role and success of MAS in gene pyramiding, rapidly deploying resistance genes via marker-assisted backcrossing, enabling simpler detection and selection of resistance genes in absence of the pathogen, and contributing to simplified breeding of complex traits by detection and indirect selection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with major effects. The current status of MAS in breeding {{for resistance}} to angular leaf spot, anthracnose, Bean common mosaic and Bean common mosaic necrosis viruses, Beet curly top virus, Bean golden yellow mosaic virus, common bacterial blight, halo bacterial blight, rust, root rots, and white mold is reviewed in detail. Cumulative mapping of disease resistance traits has revealed new resistance gene clusters while adding to others, and reinforces the co-location of QTL conditioning resistance with specific resistance genes and defense-related genes. Breeding for resistance to insect pests is updated for bean pod <b>weevil</b> (Apion), bruchid <b>seed</b> <b>weevils,</b> leafhopper, thrips, bean fly, and whitefly, including the use of arcelin proteins as selectable markers for resistance to bruchid <b>seed</b> <b>weevils.</b> Breeding for resistance to abiotic stresses concentrates on drought, low soil phosphorus, and improved symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

50|$|Larval {{development}} of the weevil Derelomus chamaeropsis occurs within rachises of inflorescences of male plants during autumn and winter. At {{the beginning of the}} next flowering period, adult weevils emerge from the dry and brittle stems of old inflorescences of the previous year of male plants only. Those that hatch in female plants die without concluding their development. This is because the palmettos are adapted to prevent the pollinating weevils from destroying the female inflorescences with their burden of <b>seed.</b> <b>Weevils</b> have been shown to lay eggs within female inflorescences, but as soon as seeds start to develop, eggs or larvae fail to continue their life cycle. On the other hand, male inflorescences have completed their function after pollination, so it is advantageous to the plant's reproduction for the weevils to complete their life cycles and shelter in the male inflorescences, thereby remaining available for pollination when they emerge in the following season.|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} landscape {{has gone through}} large changes to meet increasing demands for food. This has led to major biodiversity declines, while effects on ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity, such as pollination and pest control, remain less studied. This thesis examines temporal trends, impacts, and management for functionally important insects in agriculture using red clover seed production as a model system. Red clover is pollinated by bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and honey bees. Major yield losses are caused by <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> (Apion spp.), which in turn are attacked by natural enemy parasitoids. Field studies, where sites previously sampled in the 1930 s- 1960 s were revisited 2008 - 2011, showed a shift towards more species poor bumble bee communities in red clover fields dominated by a few species which are less effective pollinators. Moreover, crop pest damage by <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> had more than doubled, while parasitism rates provided by natural enemies had decreased. In parallel to these changes, seed yields have declined and become more variable in recent decades. We performed an experiment which showed that the gain in seed set obtained when simultaneously increasing pollination and pest control outweighed the sum of seed set gains obtained when increasing each service separately. With the field data collected we also developed integrated pest management by validating a pest sampling method, developing a threshold for insecticide treatment, and suggesting minimum effective chemical pest control. We further found that pest damage was higher in landscapes with {{a high proportion of}} agricultural land, and that maximising the distance to a clover field in the previous year could function as a proactive method to decrease pest abundance. In summary, this thesis shows that agricultural intensification can jeopardise the supply of crop pollination and pest control services, and that such changes may translate into crop yield effects. It further highlights that interactions between pollination and pest control can alter the benefits obtained from serviceproviding organisms, and this needs to be considered to properly manage multiple ecosystem services. Simultaneous enhancement of beneficial organisms which contribute to crop productivity and integrated management of pests that pose a threat to production can contribute to sustainable food production in agriculture...|$|R

50|$|The colour varies {{and they}} may be covered with black, greyish, reddish or {{yellowish}} scales. In Australia adult weevils are dark brown to black with grey markings. When disturbed, adults press their legs to the body, and fit their beak into a ventral groove. Females have an elevated ridge at the pygidial apex while it is rounded in the male. The adults are not strong fliers and are not found far from fallen fruit. New areas are infested by human transport of infested fruit. Eggs are elongated and creamy white and covered by a protective brown coating with two tiny tails at one end. It is widespread and occurs in most countries especially where mangoes are grown. The adult female lays eggs {{on the surface of the}} mango fruit.

40|$|The clover <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> Apion fulvipes Geoffroy, 1785 and Apion trifolii L., 1768 (Coleoptera: Apionidae) cause major {{losses to}} seed {{production}} of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), respectively. Clover is important as animal forage and {{an alternative to}} inorganic fertilizers. Because clover is mainly pollinated by bees, the use of insecticides in management of these weevils is discouraged. To gain basic knowledge for development of alternative management strategies, we investigated weevil field abundance over two growing seasons, as well as feeding and olfactory host preferences by A. fulvipes and A. trifolii. Field trap catches in southern Sweden revealed that white clover was dominated by A. fulvipes and red clover by A. trifolii. For both weevil species, female catches were positively correlated {{to the number of}} clover buds and flowers in the field. In feeding and olfactory bioassays, females of A. fulvipes and A. trifolii showed a preference for T. repens and T. pratense, respectively. However, the feeding preference was lost when the antennae were removed, indicating a significant role of olfaction in host choice. Male weevils of both species did not show clear olfactory or feeding preferences for host plant species. The field study and laboratory bioassays demonstrate that, at least for female weevils, olfaction is important for selection of host plants. We discuss these novel results in the context of managing these important pests of clover by exploiting olfaction and behavioral attraction to host plant volatiles...|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} staple food crops cultivated over 200 mha in the range of environment throughout the world. Wheat production must continue to increase by 2 % annually, more particularly in developing world including south-east Asia. Besides increasing the inherent productivity of wheat, it is important to minimize the losses caused to production by various abiotic and biotic factors. Alpha&#x 2013;amylase inhibitors are attractive candidates for the control of <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> as these insects are highly dependent on starch as the energy source. They play an important role in the carbohydrate metabolism of many heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms. In this study, we aimed to make sequence comparison and phylogenetic relationship among dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes. These genes were clustered into two major groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Multiple alignments show at least 24 candidates single nucleotide polymorphisms in inhibitor genes, which could further be exploited for SNPs based haplotype diversity among Indian released wheat genotype. We have detected dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes in cultivated and wild ancestors of wheat using genome specific primers. Genes encoding dimeric alpha-amylase belong to the family of 24 kDa alpha-amylase inhibitors. In this study, specific primer pairs were designed based on SNPs of these genes and chromosome locations of inhibitor genes confirmed by amplification in accession of T. urartu, A. tauschii, and A. speltoides. Results obtained under this study support that inhibitor genes amplified with primer PSWDAIAF 1 /PSWDAIAF 2 and PSWDAIBF 1 /PSWDAIBF 2 is present on genome B. These results further support evidence at molecular level that dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor in cultivated wheat is encoded by a multigene family. |$|R
