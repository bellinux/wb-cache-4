50|$|The {{genesis of}} the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics, where an {{important}} application was the <b>steam</b> engine. Low quality <b>steam</b> would contain a high moisture percentage and therefore damage components more easily.

The quality of <b>steam</b> can be quantitatively described by <b>steam</b> quality (<b>steam</b> dryness), the proportion of saturated <b>steam</b> in a saturated water/steam mixture.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the unit}} is under normal operating, the <b>steam</b> source of plant-steam is from the fourth <b>steam</b> {{extraction}} of turbine.

In this paper, {{in order to improve}} the economy when the turbine is operating under the low load, reheat cold section <b>steam</b> is used as high-pressure <b>steam</b> to extract the fourth <b>steam</b> by the <b>steam</b> technology, which turns the low-pressure <b>steam</b> into the medium-pressure <b>steam</b> for recycling.

2500|$|The {{spectacular}} {{scale of}} a Giant eruption, combined with relatively frequent activity in recent years, {{has caused the}} geyser to be the object of much study and much has been learned about its eruptive behavior. Giant <b>steams</b> and splashes even during inactive periods, but eruptions can happen only during so-called [...] "hot periods" [...] when there are changes in {{the activity of the}} other springs on the Giant Platform as well as more intense splashing in Giant itself. Hot periods typically last a few minutes, and most do not lead to an eruption. When the hot period ends, activity on the Platform returns to normal, and it may be tens of minutes to hours before the next hot period occurs. When Giant does erupt, the activity can be quite dramatic, lasting about an hour and sometimes reaching over 250 feet.|$|E
2500|$|The Act {{created the}} Nottingham Canal Company, who could raise £50,000 by issuing shares of £100, and could raise another £25,000 by obtaining a {{mortgage}} or by assigning the tolls, if required. The company were to build reservoirs which would feed into the Cromford Canal, in {{compensation for the}} water taken from that canal at Langley Mill. Jessop's original estimate {{for the cost of}} the works, excluding the Beeston Cut, had been £45,185 (£ in 2015 [...] ). Jessop was appointed engineer, with Green as superintendent, overseeing the day-to-day operation of the project, and work began at the Nottingham end on 30 July 1792. Benjamin Outram was given the task of calculating the water supply. He looked at the volumes of water flowing into the Erewash Canal and supplying mills on the Erewash, such as Langley Mill, and also at flows in the <b>steams</b> feeding the reservoirs. Measurements were taken in the summer of 1793, when flows were considerably less than in the winter, so that the amount of water that could be taken could be computed more accurately. Reservoirs were built at Greasley, which was sometimes called Moorgreen reservoir, and at Codnor Park, Butterley. Both fed water into the Cromford Canal, the first by a long feeder that entered the canal just above Langley Mill, while the second was a compensation reservoir, and was next to the canal, with only the towpath between them.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> {{generator}} irons, pressurised and non-pressurised.

A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the <b>steam</b> penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron will typically have a <b>steam</b> output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> generator iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the <b>steam</b> has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> generator irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R

40|$|<b>Steam</b> is an {{essential}} medium used in the industrial process. To ensure <b>steam</b> quality, small and middle scale boilers are often adopted. However, because a higher <b>steam</b> pressure (compared to the necessary <b>steam</b> pressure) is generated, the boiler’s <b>steam</b> pressure will be reduced via a pressure regulator before the <b>steam</b> is directed through the process. Unfortunately, pressure is somewhat wasted during the reducing process. Therefore, {{in order to promote}} energy efficiency, a pressure regulator is replaced by a <b>steam</b> expander. With this <b>steam</b> expander, the pressure will be transformed into mechanical energy and extracted during the expansion process. A new type of isothermal <b>steam</b> expander for an industrial <b>steam</b> supplying system will be presented in the paper. The isothermal <b>steam</b> expander will improve the energy efficiency of a traditional <b>steam</b> expander by replacing the isentropic process with an isothermal expansion process.
