25|$|The {{mission of}} the 20 SCS is to detect, track, identify, and report near earth and deep space objects in earth’s orbit, and provide <b>space</b> <b>object</b> {{identification}} data in support of United States Strategic Command’s space control mission. A unit of the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), {{the men and women}} of the 20th SCS operate and maintain the AN/FPS-85 radar, the Air Force’s only phased-array radar dedicated to tracking earth-orbiting objects.|$|E
25|$|Mission objective: To {{provide a}} satellite-based Resident <b>Space</b> <b>Object</b> (RSO) observing service {{that will provide}} {{accurate}} tracking data on deep space orbiting objects. Sapphire is the Canadian Department of National Defence's first dedicated operational military satellite. Its space-based electro-optical sensor will track man-made space objects in Earth orbits between 6000 and 40,000 km as part of Canada's continued support of Space Situational Awareness and the U.S. Space Surveillance Network by updating the U.S. Satellite Catalogue {{that is used by}} both NORAD and Canada.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> is {{increasing}} rapidly with {{the expansion of}} human's space exploration. So space debris has become a serious pollutant which poses a great threat to spacecraft. It is necessary for us to establish the <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> database management system to keep these objects under surveillance. The system structure, software and hardware environment, database structure and results of the <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> database management system are discussed in this paper. This database management system can provide some bases for efficiency use of <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> data, as well as excellent data service for <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> surveillance system and collisions avoidance analysis...|$|R
40|$|Asteroid-comet hazard {{problem is}} already {{realized}} by world community, {{in the world}} deployed several special services of potentially dangerous <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> (DSO) detecting in space. These services development {{will lead to the}} fact that threatening collision body approach to the Earth will be known in advance. However, humanity is still helpless before the space threat: not yet proposed effective ways to deflect dangerous <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> from collision trajectory or its destruction long before expected collision. Effectively countering dangerous <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> task even the largest sizes can be solved by described in this article shock effects on dangerous <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> method by managed mini comets. This method can be realized by existing space technologies...|$|R
50|$|About {{seven percent}} of the <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> are {{operational}} satellites, the rest are debris. The USSTRATCOM is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris. The SSN tracks <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> which are 10 centimeters in diameter (baseball size) or larger.|$|R
500|$|Activision made an {{enhanced}} version of Asteroids for PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Microsoft Windows, and the Game Boy Color in 1998. Doug Perry, writing for entertainment and video game journalism website IGN, praised the high-end graphics – with realistic <b>space</b> <b>object</b> models, backgrounds, and special effects – for making Asteroids [...] "a pleasure to look at" [...] while being a {{homage to the}} original arcade version. The Atari Flashback series of dedicated video game consoles have included both the 2600 the arcade versions of Asteroids.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} quarter of {{calendar}} 1963, the 1st Aero organization was changed to include a Central Computer & Display Facility (CC) separate from the SPACETRACK Center. [...] By this time, the SPACETRACK Center had six Divisions: Operations, <b>Space</b> <b>Object</b> Identification, Analysis, Research, Programming, and Intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{often made}} series of boxed assemblages [...] that {{reflected}} his various interests: the Soap Bubble Sets, the Medici Slot Machine series, the Pink Palace series, the Hotel series, the Observatory series, and the <b>Space</b> <b>Object</b> Boxes, among others. Also captivated with birds, Cornell created an Aviary series of boxes, in which colorful images of various birds were mounted on wood, cut out, and set against harsh white backgrounds.|$|E
50|$|The SSN {{has been}} {{tracking}} <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> since 1957 when the Soviet Union opened the space age with {{the launch of}} Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 39,000 <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> orbiting Earth. Of that number, the SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds (4.5 kg).|$|R

5000|$|The Satellite Detection and Reconnaissance Defense (the former {{designation}} of the NSSS) reached {{initial operating capability}} in 1961. The role of the [...] "fence" [...] grew. The system detected <b>space</b> <b>objects</b> from new launches, maneuvers of existing objects, breakups of existing objects, and provided data to users from its catalog of <b>space</b> <b>objects.</b> Orbital parameters of more than 10,000 objects were maintained in this catalog—which has now gained usage by NASA, weather agencies, and friendly foreign agencies. The information is essential to computing the collision avoidance information to de-conflict launch windows with known orbiting <b>space</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, {{although}} he was not formally a DSOIA, Ralph Schinnerer achieved an interesting object identification: The Gemini IV astronauts saw {{what appeared to be}} a nearby <b>space</b> <b>object.</b> [...] Ralph used the COMBO program, but it did not identify any nearby satellites. [...] Shortly thereafter, he was furnished a short movie clip of the mystery object taken by the astronauts. [...] Analysing its motion, he determined that it was probably something associated with the spacecraft, perhaps dangling from a tether.|$|E
2500|$|One major {{improvement}} in operations {{was the creation}} of a new career field, <b>Space</b> <b>Object</b> Identification Analyst (DSOIA)(AFSC 2025B). [...] This was made possible by some {{improvement in}} radar imaging, still primitive, but enabling better assessment of which objects were satellite payloads, which carrier rockets, and which debris. [...] The DSOIAs exchanged information with the NORAD Space Intelligence Division. Intelligence information about the mission of foreign satellites was also primitive. Public announcements by launching agencies and comparison with past launches were both useful. [...] At one point in time, DSOIA duties were also performed by officers at remote sites, including Diyarbakır, Turkey. [...] By the early 1970s, the work was consolidated at Colorado Springs, so that DSOIAs did not have to have remote duty tours. In later years, special telescopes were deployed to assist in identification.|$|E
2500|$|The Diyarbakir space {{surveillance}} site {{operated a}} detection radar (FPS-17) and a tracking radar (FPS-79) throughout the 1960s and 1970s. If a new <b>space</b> <b>object</b> was sensed by the detection radar's fans, then the tracking radar could be oriented to achieve lock-on and tracking. The orientation was governed by {{knowledge of the}} appropriate [...] "normal" [...] object's astrodynamic laws of motion, or by an assumption as to launch point. Thus, if an unknown was detected, and if it followed an unusual path, {{it was unlikely that}} it could, or would, be tracked. Furthermore, the director of the radar could make a decision that the unknown object detected is not of interest (because of the location of the FPS-17 fan penetration or {{because of the lack of}} prior information on a possible new launch). In the absence of detection fan penetration (the fan had a rather limited coverage), the FPS-79 tracking radar was tasked to follow other space objects on a schedule provided by the Space Defense Center, and again there was almost no likelihood that an anomalistic object could, or would, be tracked.|$|E
