40|$|This work is an {{an early}} stage of a larger project aiming at {{answering}} the question whether or not the Preisach map is really fingerprinting magnetic materials. More precisely, we are interested whether Preisach model of magnetic hysteresis indeed contains any physics or is just a convenient modeling tool. To this extent we study a very simple mechanical system, thus fully tractable, subjected to the external force. Despite of its simplicity, our model captures all the fundamental features of real magnetic materials, namely their hysteretic behavior, coercivity, remanent magnetization and saturation at high fields. Both the overall shape of major hysteresis loop as well as First Order Reversal Curves (FORC's) are reproduced quite correctly; they are very similar to those observed in magnetic materials. The model essentially consists of a single, <b>spring</b> <b>loaded,</b> <b>rigid</b> and rotative bar with non-zero friction torque. The length of a projection of this bar onto the direction of an external force is identified with magnetization. The friction torque and the spring constant are the only freely adjustable parameters of our model. Here we investigate, and present, their influence on the inferred Preisach maps.

However, the efficacy is strongly depending on weather and secondly on {{the exposure of}} rhizomes. The shorter the required period of cultivation stays the more compliance with the objective in organic farming where farmers aim at minimizing leaching of nutrients by keeping the soil plant-covered during autumn and winter. Effective technique and strategies for uprooting, exposing and destroying Elymus repens are needed. In a Danish organic research project {{the focus is on}} technological solutions for uprooting, exposing and destroying of the rhizomes within a short time span. Machines of standard type, modified machines and machines constructed for other purposes have been studied.

The device is composed of an identical pair of cylindrical hub assemblies connected at their inner faces by a <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> hinge; each hub assembly having a structural half column attached to its outer end. Each hub assembly has a <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> locking ring member movably attached adjacent to its inner face and includes a latch member for holding the locking ring in a rotated position subject to the force of its spring. Each hub assembly also has a hammer member for releasing the latch on the opposing hub assembly when the hub assemblies are rotated together.

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the <b>spring</b> <b>loaded</b> rack and pinion. This <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement consists of yoke nut, spring, and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the <b>spring</b> <b>loading</b> can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in <b>spring</b> <b>loading.</b> The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to statically balance a general treestructured,planar revolute-joint linkage <b>loaded</b> with linear <b>springs</b> or {{constant}} forces without using auxiliary links. The balancing methods currently documented in the literature use extra links; some do not apply when there are <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> and some are restricted to only two-link serial chains. In our method, we suitably combine any non-zero-free-length <b>load</b> <b>spring</b> with another spring to result in an effective zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> If a link has a single joint (with the parent link), we give a procedure to attach extra zero-free-length springs to it so that forces and moments are balanced for the link. Another consequence of this attachment is that the constraint force of the joint on the parent link becomes equivalent to a zero-free-length <b>spring</b> <b>load.</b> Hence, conceptually,for the parent link, the joint with its child is removed and replaced with the zero-free-length spring. This feature allows recursive application of this procedure from the end-branches of the tree down to the root, satisfying force and moment balance of all the links in the process. Furthermore, this method can easily be extended to the closed-loop revolute-joint linkages, which is also illustrated in the paper...|$|R

40|$|A linkage of rigid bodies under gravity loads can be statically counter-balanced by add-ing {{compensating}} gravity loads. Similarly, gravity <b>loads</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> can be counter-balanced {{by adding}} springs. In the current literature, among the techniques that add springs, some achieve perfect static balance while others achieve only approximate bal-ance. Further, {{all of them}} add auxiliary bodies to the linkage in addition to springs. We present a perfect static balancing technique that adds only springs but not auxiliary bodies, {{in contrast to the}} existing techniques. This technique can counter-balance both gravity <b>loads</b> and <b>spring</b> <b>loads.</b> The technique requires that every joint that connects two bodies in the linkage be either a revolute joint or a spherical joint. Apart from this, the linkage can have any number of bodies connected in any manner. In order to achieve perfect balance, this technique requires that all the <b>spring</b> <b>loads</b> have the feature of zero-free-length, {{as is the case with}} the existing techniques. This requirement is neither impractical nor restrictive since the feature can be practically incorporated into any normal spring either by modifying the spring or by adding another spring in parallel.
