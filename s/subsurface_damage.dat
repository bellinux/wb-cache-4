In this paper, ultra-precision grinding experiments were performed on Reaction-bonded Silicon Carbide (RB-SiC) ceramics to investigate surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages</b> characteristics and formation mechanisms in atomic scale. The surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages</b> were measured {{by a combination of}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. Ductile-regime removal mode is achieved below critical cutting depth, exhibiting with obvious plough stripes and pile-up. The brittle fracture behavior is noticeably influenced by the microstructures of RB-SiC such as impurities, phase boundary and grain boundary. It was found that <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages</b> in plastic zone mainly consist of stacking faults (SFs), twins and limited dislocations. No amorphous structure can be observed in both 6 H-SiC and Si particles in RB-SiC ceramics. Additionally, with the aid of high resolution TEM analysis, SFs and twins were found within the 6 H-SiC closed packed plane i. e. (0001). At last, based on the SiC structure characteristic, the formation mechanisms of SFs and twins was discussed, and a schematic model was proposed to clarify the relationship between plastic deformation induced defects and brittle fractures...|$|R

A trans-scale numerical framework is {{conducted with the}} purpose of revealing the underlying influence mechanism of tool structure parameters on subsurface dislocation configurations using a dislocation dynamics-based model, which considers both dislocation structural transformation and grain refining. Results showed that the developed framework not only captured the essential features of workpiece microstructure, but also predicted the <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages</b> layer states and their modifications. A series of defects were found in the material subsurface during the orthogonal cutting of titanium alloy, such as edge and screw dislocations, junctions, parallel slip lines, intersection dislocation bands, vacancy defects, and refinement grains. Particularly, in the process of micro-cutting, the depth of <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages</b> layer increased significantly with cutting length at the beginning, and then remained unchanged in the stable removal phase. Moreover, smaller edge radius and larger rake angle can greatly weaken the squeezing action and heat diffusion effect between the tool tip and workpiece, which further prevents the formation of subsurface defects and enhances finished surface quality. In addition, although increasing tool clearance angle could drastically lighten the thickness of <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages</b> layer, it is noteworthy that its performance would be decreased significantly when the clearance angle was {{greater than or equal to}} 5 °.

50|$|The main {{aspects of}} Contact {{mechanics}} and tribology {{are related to}} friction, wear and lubrication. When the two surfaces come in contact during motion i.e. rub against each other, friction, wear and lubrication effects {{are very important to}} analyze {{in order to determine the}} performance of the material. Biotribology is a study of friction, wear and lubrication of biological systems especially human joints such as hips and knees. For example, femoral and tibial components of knee implant routinely rub against each other during daily activity such as walking or stair climbing. If the performance of tibial component needs to be analyzed, the principles of biotribology are used to determine the wear performance of the implant and lubrication effects of synovial fluid. In addition, the theory of contact mechanics also becomes very important for wear analysis. Additional aspects of biotribology can also include analysis of <b>subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> resulting from two surfaces coming in contact during motion, i.e. rubbing against each other, such as in the evaluation of tissue engineered cartilage.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate and visualize the quantitative effect of diamond bur grit size on <b>subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> in dental adjusting of a feldspar prosthetic porcelain. Diamond burs with coarse (106 - 125 rm), medium (53 - 60 microm), and fine (10 - 20 microm) grit sizes were selected. Dental adjusting-induced <b>subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> was quantitatively investigated with the aid of finite element analysis (FEA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Significant differences in <b>subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> depth were found among the coarse, medium, and fine diamond burs (ANOVA, p < 0. 05). Coarse diamond burs induced approximately 6 - 8 times deeper <b>subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> than fine burs.

30|$|<b>Subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> {{is easily}} induced in {{machining}} of hard and brittle materials {{because of their}} particular mechanical and physical properties. It is detrimental to the strength, performance and lifetime of a machined part. To manufacture a high quality part, {{it is necessary to}} detect and remove the machining induced <b>subsurface</b> <b>damage</b> by the subsequent processes.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in a {{thin film}} deposited on a dissimilar substrate can bring about various interface or <b>subsurface</b> <b>damages,</b> such as delamination, dislocation, twinning and cracking. In high performance integrated circuits and MEMS, a too high residual stress can significantly alter their electronic properties. A proper residual stress characterization needs the description of full stress tensors and their variations with thickness. The problem is that film thickness measurement requires different means, and that direct measurement techniques to fulfill the tasks are not straightforward. This paper provides a simple method using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering for the measurement of residual stresses and their thickness dependence. Using the epitaxial silicon film on a sapphire substrate as an example, this paper demonstrates that the improved XRD technique can make use of multiple diffraction peaks to {{give rise to a}} highly accurate stress tensor. The co-existence of silicon and sapphire peaks in a Raman spectrum then allows a simultaneous measurement of film thickness from the peak intensity ratio and the residual stress from the peak shift.
