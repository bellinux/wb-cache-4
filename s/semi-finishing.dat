5000|$|This {{process begins}} with a roughed part that {{unevenly}} approximates the model and cuts to within a fixed offset distance from the model.

50|$|Raster passes are {{the most}} basic of all {{machining}} strategies for the finishing or <b>semi-finishing</b> of a part during computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). In raster passes machining the milling cutter moves along curves on the cutter location surface (CL surface) obtained by intersecting the CL surface with vertical, parallel planes.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that around 65 % {{of the cost of}} a die or mould is related to the machining processes. Moreover, the literature says that 70 % of the time spent in the machining processes of this kind of parts is used in finishing and <b>semi-finishing</b> operations. The high complexity of the machined surfaces makes mandatory the use of ball nose tools, with large overhang, what increases vibration in the process. These problems have to be minimized, since dies and moulds demand a very good surface finish and tight dimensional tolerances. A frequently used strategy to attenuate these problems is to carry out <b>semi-finishing</b> operations with cutters containing circular inserts, because these inserts produce smooth transitions among the passes and a smaller and more uniform stock material for the finishing operation.

Although most lightweight materials, such as aluminum, are {{more expensive than the}} conventional materials concrete and structural steel, savings result due to the comprehensive cost analysis over the lifetime of a building. For example cost advantages can be achieved during the transport to the building site and in the dimensioning of the basement. <b>Semi-finished</b> aluminum foams, especially sandwiches are excellent for lightweight constructions.
