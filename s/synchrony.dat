5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local <b>synchrony</b> but there is no significant association with population level <b>synchrony.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in <b>synchrony.</b> This requires {{the use of}} a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural <b>synchrony.</b> An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and <b>synchrony</b> can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in <b>synchrony</b> but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This <b>synchrony</b> is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, clouding the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E
5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting {{for up to}} 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced <b>synchrony</b> increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E
25|$|In mother–infant <b>synchrony,</b> {{the mother}} and infant's ability to change their own {{behaviour}} based on the other's response is taken into consideration. Infant affect (vocal and facial) and maternal stimulation (vocal and tactile) are good indicators of mother–infant <b>synchrony.</b> Zentall et al. found that infants' rhythm was stronger and interactions were led better at 5 months than at 3 months. According to the study, an infant's ability to send signals and a mother's ability to perceive them increase with <b>synchrony</b> over time. Studies have shown that mother–infant <b>synchrony</b> {{will result in the}} infant's development of self-control and other self-regulating behaviours later on in life.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of {{pacemaker}} implantation, AV <b>synchrony</b> should be optimized {{to prevent the occurrence}} of pacemaker syndrome. Where patients with optimized AV <b>synchrony</b> have shown great results of implantation and very low incidence of pacemaker syndrome than those with suboptimal AV synchronization.|$|E

25|$|Two related {{qualitative}} {{concepts that}} are correlated with maternal sensitivity are mother–infant <b>synchrony</b> and maternal mind-mindedness.|$|E
25|$|Synchronization of {{neuronal}} firing {{may serve}} as a means to group spatially segregated neurons that respond to the same stimulus in order to bind these responses for further joint processing, i.e. to exploit temporal <b>synchrony</b> to encode relations. Purely theoretical formulations of the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis were proposed first, but subsequently extensive experimental evidence has been reported supporting the potential role of <b>synchrony</b> as a relational code.|$|E
25|$|For some {{patients}} who are ventricularly paced, usually the addition of an atrial lead and optimizing the AV <b>synchrony</b> usually resolves symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Temporal <b>synchrony</b> is not {{necessary}} for the McGurk effect to be present. Subjects are still strongly influenced by auditory stimuli even when it lagged the visual stimuli by 180 milliseconds (point at which McGurk effect begins to weaken). There was less tolerance {{for the lack of}} <b>synchrony</b> if the auditory stimuli preceded the visual stimuli. In order to produce a significant weakening of the McGurk effect, the auditory stimuli had to precede the visual stimuli by 60 milliseconds, or lag by 240 milliseconds.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive <b>synchrony</b> {{can never}} be perfect. On the other hand, {{theoretical}} models predict that group-living species will tend to synchronise wherever females can benefit by maximising the number of males offered chances of paternity, minimising reproductive skew. The same models predict that female primates, including evolving humans, will tend to synchronise wherever fitness benefits can be gained by securing access to multiple males. Conversely, group-living females who need to restrict paternity to a single dominant harem-holder should assist him by avoiding <b>synchrony.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal atrioventricular (AV) <b>synchrony</b> or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the pacing mode, after pacemaker implantation.|$|E
25|$|The HKB model, {{which has}} also been elucidated by several complex {{mathematical}} descriptors, is still a relatively simple but powerful way to describe seemingly-independent systems that come to reach <b>synchrony</b> just before a state of self-organized criticality.|$|E

25|$|In rare instances, using {{hysteresis}} to {{help maintain}} AV <b>synchrony</b> can help alleviate symptoms in ventricularly inhibited paced (VVI) patients providing they have intact sinus node function. Hysteresis reduces {{the amount of time}} spent in pacing mode, which can relieve symptoms, particularly when the pacing mode is generating AV dyssynchrony.|$|E
25|$|In primates, {{reproductive}} <b>synchrony</b> {{usually takes}} the form of conception and birth seasonality. The regulatory 'clock', in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates—for example, owl monkeys— the periodicity of the moon may also come into play. <b>Synchrony</b> in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of 'paternity skew'—defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony—the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously—the harder it is for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. This is simply because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others at liberty to mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures a, b).|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} case, {{according}} to FCC, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens {{would have done}} best by resisting attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner who will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner. To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can {{be included in the}} breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better. By evolving concealed ovulation and continuous receptivity, females force males into longer periods of consortship if they are to {{have a good chance of}} achieving impregnation (figures c,d). Reproductive <b>synchrony</b> —whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—is a key strategy for reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and involving more males in investment in offspring. Greater reproductive <b>synchrony</b> owing to seasonality during glacial cycles may have differentiated Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of Homo sapiens ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Pursuit {{predation}} {{revolves around}} a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move {{to find new}} foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and <b>synchrony</b> of predator-prey relationships {{can be used as}} support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population <b>synchrony.</b> Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in <b>synchrony,</b> which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.|$|E
25|$|FCC proponents {{argue that}} {{menstruation}} became a key problem because it potentially creates {{conflicts between the}} females and conflicts between males. Menstruation has little social impact among chimpanzees or bonobos, since visible oestrus swellings {{are the focus of}} male attention. But once external signs of ovulation had been phased out in the human lineage, according to FCC, menstruation became salient as the one remaining external promise of fertility. Potentially, dominant males might exploit such information, repeatedly targeting newly cycling females at the expense of pregnant or nursing mothers (figure e). Those who might lose male investment needed to take control. According to FCC, older and more experienced females did this by initiating newly cycling females into their kin-based coalitions (figures f, g). Red ochre pigments allowed women to take conscious control over their signals, resisting any dominant male strategy of picking and choosing between them on biological grounds. It is argued that because precise, sustained menstrual <b>synchrony</b> is difficult to achieve, painting up with blood-red pigments was the next best thing, enabling the benefits of artificial, ritually constructed <b>synchrony.</b>|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of mastodon bone sites, it can be inferred that, as in modern proboscideans, the mastodon social group consisted of adult females and young, living in bonded groups called mixed herds. The males abandoned the mixed herds once reaching sexual maturity and lived either alone or in male bond groupings. As in modern elephants, there probably was no seasonal <b>synchrony</b> of mating activity, with both males and females seeking out each other for mating when sexually active.|$|E
25|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{was first}} described in 1969 by Mitsui et al. {{as a collection}} of symptoms associated with right ventricular pacing. The name pacemaker syndrome was first coined by Erbel in 1979. Since its first discovery, there have been many definitions of pacemaker syndrome, and the understanding of the cause of pacemaker syndrome is still under investigation. In a general sense, pacemaker syndrome can be defined as the symptoms associated with right ventricular pacing relieved with the return of A-V and V-V <b>synchrony.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Temporal Binding Hypothesis {{was first}} {{proposed}} {{as a way}} of addressing the combinatorial problem of neural binding, which emphasizes the impossibly large number of connections {{that would have to be}} made between neurons of overlapping function and association in order to achieve the degree of observable complexity in neural binding. Modern models that are currently being developed often retain the structure of temporal <b>synchrony</b> due to this significant advantage as well as the strong experimental support for the existence of global brain oscillations.|$|E
25|$|The bombe drums were {{arranged}} {{with the top}} {{one of the three}} simulating the left-hand rotor of the Enigma scrambler, the middle one the middle rotor, and the bottom one the right-hand rotor. The top drums were all driven in <b>synchrony</b> by an electric motor. For each full rotation of the top drums, the middle drums were incremented by one position, and likewise for the middle and bottom drums, giving the total of 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576 positions of the 3-rotor Enigma scrambler.|$|E
25|$|While {{the content}} of the film {{reflected}} the audience's focus on his appearance, it made use of the unique capacities of the new medium. Film theorists have attributed the appeal being the striking image of a detailed image moving in <b>synchrony,</b> much like the example of the Lumière brothers' Repas de bébé where audiences were reportedly more impressed by the movement of trees swaying in the background than the events taking place in the foreground. In 1894, Sandow also appeared in a short Kinetoscope film {{that was part of the}} first commercial motion picture exhibition in history.|$|E
25|$|CRT {{devices have}} at least two leads, one passing through the vena cava and the right atrium into the right {{ventricle}} to stimulate the septum, and another passing through the vena cava and the right atrium and inserted through the coronary sinus to pace the epicardial wall of the left ventricle. Often, for patients in normal sinus rhythm, there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate <b>synchrony</b> with the atrial contraction. Thus, timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions, as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|Statically typed {{languages}} {{that lack}} type inference (such as C and Java) require that programmers declare the types that a method or function must use. This {{can serve as}} added program documentation, that is active and dynamic, instead of static. This allows a compiler {{to prevent it from}} drifting out of <b>synchrony,</b> and from being ignored by programmers. However, a language can be statically typed without requiring type declarations (examples include Haskell, Scala, OCaml, F#, {{and to a lesser extent}} C# and C++), so explicit type declaration is not a necessary requirement for static typing in all languages.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Emlen and Oring {{created a}} mating systems model {{that shows how}} {{resource}} distribution affects female living patterns and subsequently, mating systems. In a mating system, the limiting sex (usually females) {{is the one that}} the limited sex (usually males) tries to monopolize. The combination of resource distribution, parental care, and female breeding <b>synchrony</b> determines what mating strategies the limited sex will employ. Polygyny will occur when resources are localized and females form clusters, making it easier for males to control them. The various types of polygyny result because of the differential access individuals have to resources.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} 2016 article, {{an entirely new}} {{communication}} device and non-EEG-based human-computer interface was developed, requiring no visual fixation or ability to move eyes at all, {{that is based on}} covert interest in (i.e. without fixing eyes on) chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own (background) circle that is micro-oscillating in brightness in different time transitions, where the letter selection is based on best fit between, on one hand, unintentional pupil-size oscillation pattern, and, on the other hand, the circle-in-background's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by user's mental rehearsing the words 'bright' and 'dark' in <b>synchrony</b> with the brightness transitions of the circle/letter.|$|E
25|$|In their {{reply to}} Tegmark's paper, also {{published}} in Physical Review E, the physicists Scott Hagan, Jack Tuszyński and Hameroff claimed that Tegmark {{did not address}} the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40Hz gamma <b>synchrony,</b> as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.|$|E
25|$|Although neural {{oscillations}} {{in human}} brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, {{they are also}} observed using more invasive recording techniques such as single-unit recordings. Neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of action potentials or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called resonators. Bursting is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for information coding in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed {{in the form of}} subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (i.e. in the absence of action potentials). If numerous neurons spike in <b>synchrony,</b> they can give rise to oscillations in local field potentials. Quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data.|$|E
25|$|The hippocampal neocortical dialog {{refers to}} the very {{structured}} interactions during SWS between groups of neurons called ensembles in the hippocampus and neocortex. Sharp wave patterns (SPW) dominate the hippocampus during SWS and neuron populations in the hippocampus participate in organized bursts during this phase. This is done in <b>synchrony</b> with state changes in the cortex (DOWN/UP state) and coordinated by the slow oscillations in cortex. These observations, coupled {{with the knowledge that}} the hippocampus plays a role in short to medium term memory whereas the cortex plays a role in long term memory, have led to the hypothesis that the hippocampal neocortical dialog might be a mechanism through which the hippocampus transfers information to the cortex. Thus, the hippocampal neocortical dialog is said {{to play a role in}} memory consolidation.|$|E
