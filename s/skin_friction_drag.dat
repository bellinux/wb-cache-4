40|$|SUMMARY. By {{means of}} the {{principles}} and assumptions {{used to calculate the}} profile drag of aerofoils a method is developed for calculating the total and <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drags</b> of bodies of revolution at zero incidence. The method is applied to three bodies of different fineness ratio for three Reynolds numbers and three transition points. From the results curves are drawn showing the variation of total drag for a ra. nge of fineness ratio (00 to 3 : 1), Reynolds number (106 to 108) and transition point position (0 to o · Sl). Comparison with experimental results sho,vs satisfactory agreement. Interesting deductions are: form drag (a) ttl d = = O · 4 djl, approx. o a rag (b) Given the volume and transition point position the fineness ratio for which the drag is least is about 5 : 1. (c) Given the frontal area and transition point position the fineness ratio for which the drag is least is about 3 : 1. x...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> is a {{component}} of profile drag that acts on a body in a fluid flow. [...] "Skin friction drag" [...] applies {{not only to the}} [...] "skins" [...] of an aircraft but also to flow of fluids within and about any body subjected to a fluid flow. Friction drag begins as laminar drag but may become turbulent drag at some point along the body in the fluid flow direction. <b>Skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> is calculated or measured and is additive with other forms of drag acting on a body.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>{{friction}}</b> <b>drag</b> {{arises from}} the friction of the fluid against the [...] "skin" [...] of the object that is moving through it. Skin friction {{arises from the}} interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and {{is directly related to the}} wetted surface, the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Air in contact with a body will stick to the body's surface and that layer will tend to stick to the next layer of air and that in turn to further layers, hence the body is dragging some amount of air with it. The force required to drag an [...] "attached" [...] layer of air with the body is called <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag.</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> imparts some momentum to a mass of air as it passes through it and that air applies a retarding force on the body. As with other components of parasitic drag, skin friction follows the drag equation and rises with the square of the velocity.|$|E
5000|$|The total <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag</b> force {{acting on}} a body, in units of force can be calculated:where [...] is the fluid density, [...] is the fluid {{velocity}} and [...] is the total surface area that is {{in contact with the}} fluid.|$|E

In contrast to the thin plates used in previous experiments, these airfoils are more than 1000 time stiffer and hence {{have the potential to}} withstand the real flight environment (dynamic pressure 36 times larger than in low-speed wing tunnels). In addition, the higher Reynolds numbers of the present tests indicate drag reduction performance is at least as good (or better) as at lower Reynolds numbers...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} areas of research in aerodynamics is the reduction of <b>skin</b> <b>friction,</b> especially for turbulent flow. Reduced <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> means less <b>drag.</b> For aircraft, less drag can lead to less fuel burned or to a greater flight range for a fixed amount of fuel. Many techniques and methods have been tried; however, none of them has significantly reduced <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> in the flight environment. An innovative skin-friction reduction technique, the Microblowing Technique (MBT), was invented in 1993. This is a unique concept in which an extremely small amount of air is blown vertically at a surface through very small holes. It can be used for aircraft or marine vehicles, such as submarines (where water is blown through the holes instead of air). As shown in the figure, the outer layer, which controls vertical flow, is a plate with high-vertical holes. The inner layer, which produces evenly distributed flow, is a low-permeability porous plate. Microblowing reduces the surface roughness and changes the flow velocity profile on the surface, thereby reducing <b>skin</b> <b>friction...</b>|$|R
50|$|Parasitic drag is {{constituted}} by form drag and <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag,</b> and grows with {{the square of}} the speed in the drag equation. The form drag is minimised by having the lowest frontal area and by streamlining the aircraft for a low drag coefficient, and skin friction is proportional to the body's surface and can be reduced by maximising laminar flow.|$|E
50|$|Parasitic drag is drag {{caused by}} moving a solid object through a fluid. Parasitic drag {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} components including viscous pressure drag (form drag), and drag due to surface roughness (<b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> <b>drag).</b> Additionally, the presence of multiple bodies in relative proximity may incur so called interference drag, which is sometimes described as a component of parasitic drag.|$|E

This permits a computationally efficient search of the design parameter space for the hull form which optimizes some performance indicator. Here, hulls of low wave resistance are sought subject to certain imposed design constraints. The wave resistance is calculated using a panel method similar to that developed by Dawson.

40|$|Although flow {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the oldest problems in fluid mechanics, it is still far from being fully understood and resolved. One of the examples is the determination of velocity profiles and friction factor of vegetated channel flows. The effects of instream vegetation on velocity and {{flow resistance}} remain almost unpredictable although their significance for channel flows is widely recognized by hydraulic and ecological engineers. In this paper, we redefine the hydraulic radius and roughness height, and the flow resistance is broadly divided into the <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> and the form drag, which are proportional to the contact area and wake volume, respectively. The estimation of <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> and form <b>drag</b> is obtained theoretically, and the momentum equation is solved to obtain, based on it, the velocity distribution is obtained.

40|$|The {{multiphase}} flow mechanism in miscible displacement through porous media {{is an important}} topic in various applications, such as petroleum engineering, low Reynolds number suspension flows, dusty gas dynamics, and fluidized beds. To simulate such flows, volume averaging spatial operators are considered to incorporate pressure <b>drag</b> and <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> experienced by a porous medium. In this work, a streamline-based Lagrangian methodology is extended for an efficient numerical approach to handle dispersion and diffusion of solvent saturation during a miscible flow. Overall pressure drag on the diffusion and dispersion of solvent saturation is investigated. Numerical results show excellent agreement with the results obtained from asymptotic analysis. The present numerical simulations indicate that the nonlinear effects due to <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> and pressure <b>drag</b> cannot be accurately captured by Darcy's method if {{the contribution of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>friction</b> dominates over that of the pressure drag. Moreover, mass conservation law is investigated, which is an important feature for enhanced oil recovery, and the results help to guide a good agreement with theory.
