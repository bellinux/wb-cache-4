Johnson did not have an official White House Chief of Staff. Initially, his long-time administrative assistant Walter Jenkins presided over the day-to-day operations at the White House. George Reedy, another long-serving aide, assumed the post of White House Press Secretary when Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964. Horace Busby, a valued aide to Johnson at various points in his political career, served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst. He was also a deputy to National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, as well as the liaison between the executive departments and the White House. Bill Moyers was the youngest member of Johnson's staff; hired {{at the outset of the}} Johnson presidency, first as <b>scheduling</b> <b>coordinator</b> and part-time speech writer, he quickly rose into the front ranks of the president's aides. He played a key role in organizing and supervising the 1964 Great Society legislative task forces and was a principal architect of Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Moyers acted as the President's informal chief of staff from October 1964 (following Jenkins's resignation) until 1966. From July 1965 to February 1967, he also served as press secretary. Johnson referred to these aides as his [...] "triple-threat men" [...] because of their loyalty and versatility.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the electricity market has made the energy industry an attractive investment for many businesses. In recent years, the electricity market has been going {{through the process of}} liberalization, which has contributed to the provision of new services for investors interested in the {{development of}} the energy industry. Recently, one of the most rapidly growing sources of electricity has been wind farms. Few investors are aware of the consequences of connecting wind farms to the national power grid, as well as of the subsequent exploitation of these resources. After the Electricity Sales Contract has been concluded, investors agree to predict electrical capacity generation within the span of 24 hours with a daily advance. The specific nature of wind farm functioning makes the prediction of electrical capacity generation difficult and, consequently, the owners bear the costs of deviations on the electricity balancing market. The resulting costs may result in the lack of liquidity of the project owner and, ultimately, in bankruptcy. In such a case, the <b>Scheduling</b> <b>Coordinator’s</b> flat rate service is a solution for the owner of a wind farm.

Most importantly the author describes several examples of unequal treatment for the PX. Second, he discusses the ambiguities introduced by zonal pricing. WEPEX`s zonal system is based on a view of congestion that largely ignores loop flow and consequently has not been well defined. Third, WEPEX appears to have invented a new definition of the transmission congestion contract (TCC) that is based on actual instead of pre-specified flows. The author shows that this ruins the incentive properties of TCCs, but that this problem is partially rectified by the market in TCCs. Lastly, he discusses losses. The WEPEX proposal intentionally avoids marginal-cost pricing of losses. What has not been recognized is that it significantly increases use of the power grid.

40|$|Several {{regions of}} the U. S. have sought to restructure the {{electric}} power industry by separating the potentially competitive generation sector from the natural monopoly functions of electricity transmission and distribution. Under this restructuring scheme, a central authority, which we will {{refer to as the}} independent system operator (ISO), is given control over both the transmission system and the spot market for electricity. The ISO’s role in managing the spot market is relatively uncontroversial. This is because the spot market takes place in real time and requires continuous physical adjustments to electricity supply and demand subject to complex constraints, such as the need to maintain voltage and frequency within tight bands. Although the ISO’s role in managing the spot market is generally accepted, its role in scheduling and pricing generators prior to actual dispatch was hotly debated during the development of California’s market and remains a contentious issue. 1 Like other restructured electricity markets, the California market requires generators to be scheduled for operation on a day-ahead basis and allows for adjustments in these day-ahead schedules up to an hour ahead of actual dispatch. However, the California ISO has a minimal role in this scheduling process; almost all scheduling is carried out by a number of competing <b>scheduling</b> <b>coordinators,</b> referred to as SCs. In contrast, the ISO in the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland market (PJM) schedules all generators that do not elect to schedule themselves. This paper discusses the California and PJM approaches to shed light on the controversy over the ISO’s role in pre-dispatch phases of the market. Section I describes the California market while Section II briefly reviews PJM.

40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach to hemodialysis access: Prospective evaluation. Dialysis access procedures and complications represent {{a major cause}} of morbidity, hospitalization and cost for chronic dialysis patients. To improve outcomes and reduce the cost of hemodialysis access procedures we developed a {{multidisciplinary approach}}, involving nephrologists, access surgeons, and radiologists. A full-time dialysis access <b>coordinator</b> <b>scheduled</b> all access procedures with the surgeons and radiologists, and tracked outcomes. A computerized database was developed for prospective documentation of procedures and complications. Confidential, detailed analyses and recommendations for improvements were provided periodically to the surgeons and radiologists. The major changes arising from the multidisciplinary approach were as follows: (1) The approach to clotted grafts evolved from an inpatient surgical procedure to an outpatient radiologic procedure. The immediate technical success rate of graft declots increased from 48 % to 69 %. (2) Elective placement of arteriovenous (A-V) grafts evolved from a three-day inpatient hospitalization to a largely outpatient procedure. The proportion of A-V grafts placed as same day surgery or outpatient surgery increased from 16 % to 81 %. (3) Surgical complications of new A-V graft surgery decreased from 25 % to 11 %. (4) Aggressive detection and correction of graft stenosis decreased the incidence of graft thrombosis by 60 %, from 0. 70 to 0. 28 events per patient-year. (5) The proportion of native A-V fistula construction in new dialysis patients increased from 33 % to 69 %.

40|$|Internet {{of thing}} (IoT) is {{regarded}} as a new communicating paradigm with Internet connectivity enabling embedded devices to interact with each other on a global scale. IoT has the potential to become the largest producer of information because of a massive number of connected devices with diverse applications ranging from environmental monitoring, home, and building automation. This ubiquitous connectivity requires reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of access to information. As an enabling technology, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have opened new opportunity with recent technological developments in making miniaturized smart connected devices. With an increase in the activity of these smart devices, there are challenges in maintaining their limited energy, lifetime, and reliability required for IoT applications. The reason is that these devices are mostly battery powered. In this respect, an insight into the activities of sensing devices produced by different vendors with interoperability based on industrial standards is needed. As an enhancement of IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC sublayer, the ratification of IEEE 802. 15. 4 e standard makes a step towards IoT medium access control (MAC) for industrial applications. One of the significant enhancements in IEEE 802. 15. 4 e is different MAC modes. However, IEEE 802. 15. 4 e does not specify standardized scheduling policy for network building and data transmission maintenance. It is basically application specific. In general, activities performed at the MAC sublayer contribute to sensor energy consumption. Therefore, an efficient MAC scheme is needed to utilize network resources more efficiently, minimize energy consumption level {{and at the same time}} improve data transmission of the network. In this thesis work, we focus on proposing transmission schemes for improving energy consumption for data transmission in IoT networks and as well as increasing average packet delivery ratio (PDR). Our target is to improve time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) mode that enables deterministic access and robust network. The focus is on dedicated and shared slots in TSCH. More specifically, we propose two MAC schemes; relevance- and aggregation-based scheduling for data transmission in IEEE 802. 15. 4 e IoT networks. With relevance-based <b>scheduling,</b> the <b>coordinator</b> node builds and maintains communication in the network based on a historical data value of member nodes. On the other hand, aggregation-based scheduling iii enables the coordinator node to build and maintain communication by integrating multiple data inside a single frame payload at the source node before transmission. Further, the proposed schemes are implemented using network simulator version 3 (ns- 3). We use Ubuntu 16. 04. 2 as the operating system for our implementation and performance evaluation. Numerical results for a few performance metrics including PDR, collision probability, delay, and energy consumption are obtained through extensive simulations. The superiority of the proposed schemes is demonstrated by comparing the simulation results with that of IEEE 802. 15. 4 e TSCH standard under varies network scenario...|$|R
30|$|In {{the same}} context, other {{synchronization}} algorithms as (Koubâa et al. 2008; Ganeriwal et al. 2003) {{have been tested}} and validated in a hierarchical/cluster-tree topology. In this configuration, source and destination nodes can be separated by long distances; thanks to a dedicated path of sensor nodes forming parent–child links. This solution may result in communication bottlenecks when a sensor node fails. Koubâa et al. (Koubâa et al. 2008) describe how the Task Group 15.4 b specifies two different synchronization algorithms for IEEE 802.15. 4 networks: (i) the time division approach and the (ii) beacon-only period approach. In the first case, each parent of the cluster (denoted as <b>coordinator)</b> <b>schedules</b> the transmission of its synchronization message to avoid collisions during its ON state with the one of any neighbor or neighbor’s parent in its area of coverage. In the second scheme, a specific interval is reserved only for the synchronization tasks {{in such a way}} that each parent sends its synchronization message in a contention-free manner. Zigbee (ZigBeeTM Alliance) is a well-known implementation of cluster-tree topologies over IEEE 802.15. 4, which carries out the modification of algorithm (i). In Zigbee, a node continuously scans the physical medium to learn about the time taken by the synchronization messages of the neighborhood. Thereby, if this node becomes a parent, it can select the time interval to transmit its synchronization messages, so that its ON state does not overlap with any other ON state of any neighboring device/parent. However, this operation exhibits two disadvantages: (i) deficient synchronization precision, because a new parent is only aware of a single synchronization message for each neighbor device, just adjusting the deviation between clocks but no other parameters as the drift and (ii) the reduction of the network lifetime motivated by the continuous scanning of the physical medium. The latter aspect is dealt and enhanced in the studies in (Lopez-Gomez & Tejero-Calado 2009; Li et al. 2012). On the other hand, Ganeriwal et al. (Ganeriwal et al. 2003) present a sender–receiver scheme denoted as Timing-sync Protocol for Sensor Networks (TPSN). The TPSN is a simple/light protocol regarding computational complexity where the sender node calculates the offset between two nodes and the delays due to the transmission of the messages across the physical medium, obtaining a highly accurate synchronization with the receiver node (average error of 16.9 [*]μs). The authors in (Ganeriwal et al. 2003) remark its low number of synchronization messages, because synchronization is only carried out when both nodes need to exchange data (which also impacts positively on power consumption). Additionally, the synchronization error can be estimated because its value is bounded. These favorable results are obtained owing to the adjustment of the sender–receiver scheme to the tree topology operation where a child node can only send information to its parent. Therefore, a child is always synchronized to its unique parent. Unfortunately, its performance is not evaluated for a mesh topology where a node must be synchronized with all their neighbors to dynamically route a data message.|$|R
