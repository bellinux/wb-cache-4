5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – {{decided to do}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> absence of peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
5|$|The Seal of Dartmouth College is the {{official}} insignia of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League university located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually {{in the form of}} a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, but it can also express <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> institution's history or mission. Dartmouth College is one such chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.|$|E
5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E

5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

25|$|Many mass spectrometers work {{in either}} {{negative}} ion mode or positive ion mode. It {{is very important}} to know whether the observed ions are negatively or positively charged. This is often important in determining the neutral mass but it also indicates <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of the molecules.|$|E
25|$|The atheistic {{conclusion}} is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient {{reason to believe that}} any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has {{no reason to believe that}} a god exists.|$|E
25|$|Corry was {{associated}} with {{what came to be}} called the Tory Party after the death of William Pitt the younger in 1806. Up until the extension of the franchise in 1832, the borough was strongly Tory in representation. The fact that no Tory or Conservative was elected after 1832 may say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unrepresentative nature of the old franchise.|$|E

25|$|Structures in {{sedimentary}} rocks {{can be divided}} into 'primary' structures (formed during deposition) and 'secondary' structures (formed after deposition). Unlike textures, structures are always large-scale features that can easily be studied in the field. Sedimentary structures can indicate <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sedimentary environment or can serve to tell which side originally faced up where tectonics have tilted or overturned sedimentary layers.|$|E
25|$|The Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} the complex web of fields around the village, {{but it does}} not reveal that many of the fields have local names. Sometimes a name is simply those of the owner, but {{sometimes}} it says <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of the ground or the use to which it has been put. The Field names therefore represent a valuable repository of social history.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of the transit method is {{that the size of}} the planet can be determined from the lightcurve. When combined with the radial-velocity method (which determines the planet's mass) one can determine the density of the planet, and hence learn <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> planet's physical structure. The planets that have been studied by both methods are by far the best-characterized of all known exoplanets.|$|E

25|$|To {{conservative}} elements this protest {{seemed to}} flout {{the law and}} as a result the government found itself under increasing pressure to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation. Private groups of concerned citizens began to form also, many of them formed from returned servicemen, from organisations such as the Returned Soldiers and Citizens Political Federation and the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA). As the tension mounted, another demonstration was planned for March.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli, king Henry of Cyprus sent the senechal Jean de Grailly to Europe to warn European monarchs about the {{critical}} situation in the Levant. Jean met with Pope Nicholas IV who shared his worries and {{wrote a letter to}} European potentates to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land. Most however were too preoccupied by the Sicilian question to organize a Crusade, as was king Edward I too entangled in troubles at home.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the object can be {{increased}} by {{the way in which}} it is given and several authors have pointed to the fact that organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to say <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> moral character of the people who give them. Furthermore, the giving of organs without any form of compensation erases the possibility that the giver will have any form of vested interest in the transaction.|$|E

25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer to know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access}} to the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the manuscripts {{from the}} Umayyad Dynasty, {{many of the}} early Abbasid manuscripts were copied {{in a number of}} volumes. This is evident from the large scripts used and the smaller number of lines per page. Early Qur'anic manuscripts provide {{evidence}} for the history of the Qur'anic text and their formal features tell us <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way art and its deeper meaning were perceived in the classical age of Islam. Both its script and layout turned out to be constructed according to elaborate geometrical and proportional rules.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 90's, {{linguists}} Heidi Harley, Samuel Jay Keyser, and Kenneth Hale addressed some of {{the implications}} posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a Verb Phrase, acted as a lexical semantic template. Predicates are verbs and state or affirm <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> subject of the sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates went and is here below affirm the argument of the subject {{and the state of}} the subject respectively.|$|E
