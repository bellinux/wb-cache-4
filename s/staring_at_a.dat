5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> crumpled piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E
25|$|Opting to bat first, India {{got off to}} a poor start losing Virender Sehwag in {{the third}} over, after he scored three fours off Farveez Maharoof and Dilhara Lokuhettige. The other opener Mahendra Singh Dhoni soon {{followed}} him to the pavilion, and Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh were to rebuild, from the score at 22/2. They played cautiously, yet the former gave away his wicket, pulling to substitute fielder Upul Tharanga at mid-on. More wickets followed in the form of debutante, Suresh Raina, who was trapped leg before wicket in his first ball in senior international cricket, by Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra, as India crumbled to 64/5. Dravid, however, played a reliable knock, and together with another debutante, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, added 58 in thirteen overs. However, it came to an end too early to help India significantly in the late overs, with leg-spinner Upul Chandana sneaking a ball past his bat and pads and having him bowled for 54, and India were <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> very low score – 123/6 after 33 overs. Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan added 20 each, however, which coupled with Irfan Pathan's slow but steady 21, lifted India to a somewhat competitive score of 205/9 at the end of 50 overs.|$|E

500|$|Wohlwend {{originally}} built Hundreds as a Flash game. As an artist, {{he wanted}} to experiment with game programming following his release of Solipskier with programmer Mike Boxleiter. He developed the game from an idea he had while <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> ceiling, where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing. He found {{this to be a}} good core game concept and based the game around [...] "patience and persistence". The game's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school, where Wohlwend composed in black, white, and red so as to focus on composition rather than color. The Flash version was released in 2010 and is available online at Newgrounds. The Flash version was much simpler in design, and added circles onscreen as the game progressed. This gameplay evolved into what became the iOS release.|$|E

500|$|Creator Arthur Miller {{described}} the role as {{one for a}} large character in a small physical body and noted he had difficulty finding the right actor at first.

In 1950, Miller described Loman as a man who upon hearing society's [...] "thundering command to succeed" [...] found himself <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> failure in the mirror. The Amazon.com editorial review by Ali Davis states that [...] "Willy Loman is a salesman desperately hustling for a living even as he slides into old age." [...] Rovi Corporation's Matthew Tobey describes him as an everyman who has to cope with the sudden realization that he is over the hill and does so with a fantasy world in which he remains important. The Huffington Posts theater critic, Wilborn Hampton, describes the role as [...] "one of the most complicated characters in dramatic literature", making it a draw for the great actors.|$|E

His parents take him to a respected doctor ("There's a Doctor"), who determines that the boy's disabilities are psychosomatic rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to [...] "Go to the Mirror!", and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration ("Smash the Mirror"). This removes Tommy's mental block, and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader ("Sensation"). He starts a religious movement ("I'm Free"), which generates fervor among its adherents ("Sally Simpson") and expands into a holiday camp ("Welcome" [...] / [...] "Tommy's Holiday Camp"). However, Tommy's followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp ("We're Not Gonna Take It"). Tommy retreats inward again ("See Me, Feel Me") with his [...] "continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{finishing}} {{his role as}} artist on Solipskier, Wohlwend wanted to experiment with game programming by designing his own game. He developed Hundreds from an idea he had while <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> ceiling, where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing. He found {{this to be a}} good core game concept and based the game around [...] "patience and persistence". The game's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school, where Wohlwend composed in black, white, and red so as to focus on composition rather than color. While Wohlwend's design style is [...] "simple and elegant", the game's minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming. The code was [...] "" [...] and written in a single file. He finished Hundreds as a Flash game in 2010, but when Flash sites were not interested in purchasing it, Wohlwend chose to open source the code (partly with the intent to spur [...] "non-coders" [...] to try coding, as he had).

Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the recording of the show, and commented that when [...] "it's just GaGa [...] on the piano, you can't help but be impressed." [...] Cynthia Robinson from The Huffington Post theorized that Gaga pretending to be bald was not a [...] "fashion statement", instead she was [...] "saying something about shedding that skin, that costume, that barrier that she created with all of her vaunted costumes—at least so that people know what she is inside before putting it back on." ...|$|E
500|$|The scene wherein Peppermint Butler teaches Finn and Jake {{to enter}} {{the land of the}} dead by {{crossing}} their eyes and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> corner was inspired by a story that Moynihan's father told him when he was younger. According to the artist, his father told him that if you [...] "concentrate really hard enough", you would [...] "walk into another dimension". Moynihan recalled the story when he was storyboarding, and worked it into the episode. The climax featuring Death and Finn engaging in a musical competition was specifically written so as to not be [...] "corny". According to Ward, scenes featuring contests were often avoided because they were [...] "the easiest traps to fall into when you're writing an outline". For [...] "Death in Bloom", the writing staff realized that a contest would work towards the story's strengths. In original drafts of the episode, Finn and Jake were guided through the Land of the Dead by a mysterious rabbit. Sanchez continually felt that the rabbit was misplaced in the episode. When it came time to revise the story, the rabbit was inevitably cut because it was agreed by the writers and series staff that the character did not fit within the story. The rabbit's role was later partially replaced by an ominous talking skull that tries to get Jake to drink from the [...] "River of Forgetfulness". According to storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar, a rough draft for the original ending featured Princess Bubblegum becoming a man without the Princess Plant. Moynihan later noted that the writers were being a [...] "little reckless" [...] when it was pitched, and Ward joked that he had to step in and be [...] "quality control" [...] to prevent the idea from making it into the final episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E
