Of the latter grain {{as many as}} eight or ten varieties are cultivated, but seldom irrigated, which, owing to the dampness of the climate, is not necessary: the produce is often eighty-fold, but the grain is large, coarse, reddish, and rather gelatinous when boiled. After burning the timber, the top soil is very fertile for several seasons, abounding in humus, below which is a stratum of <b>stiff</b> <b>clay,</b> often of great thickness, produced by the disintegration of the rocks;* [An analysis of the soil will be found in the Appendix.] the clay makes excellent bricks, and often contains nearly 30 per cent. of alumina.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA new hollow {{cylinder}} triaxial cell (60 mm internal diameter and 100 mm external diameter) {{has been designed}} to study the behavior of low permeability saturated geo-materials such as <b>stiff</b> <b>clays</b> or argillites under controlled temperature and pore pressure conditions. The main advantage of this device is the short drainage path allowed by the {{hollow cylinder}} geometry that is reduced to half the thickness of the sample (10 mm) [...] four times less than that of standard full cylinder samples of 78 mm height. The reduced drainage path allows a significantly faster resaturation procedure of initially unsaturated samples compared to conventional full cylindrical samples. It also permits the achievement of drained conditions (i. e. negligible excess pore pressure during testing) with a higher loading rate. A numerical simulation of the saturation process demonstrates that the resaturation of the hollow cylinder clay sample can be achieved almost 30 times faster than in standard full samples that are drained at one end, and about seven times faster than in samples drained at both ends. Appropriate loading rates to be used in drained tests on <b>stiff</b> <b>clays</b> and argillites are also discussed based on a numerical simulation of the isotropic compression test. The effect of the deformability of the drainage system on the measured parameters during undrained tests is also analyzed. A correction method is proposed, {{based on the work of}} Bishop, by considering the deformability of the porous elements and of the drainage system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stiff</b> intact <b>clays</b> exhibit rapid loss of {{strength}} after failure, with {{the formation of}} slip surfaces {{and the development of a}} well-defined 'post-rupture' strength envelope. This paper describes an experimental study of the influence of a number of factors on the post-rupture strength of initially intact samples of Vallericca Clay. These include changes in confining pressure after the formation of a slip surface, the magnitude of the relative displacement across the surface, comparison between the post-rupture strength envelopes in triaxial compression and extension, and the influence of existing slip surfaces on the formation and strength of subsequent rupture planes formed by rotation of the principal stresses. The results show that the post-rupture strength envelope is well defined, repeatable, and not very sensitive to stress history or the rotation of the principal stresses. Little reduction in shearing resistance takes place for relative displacements up to about 10 mm. The results are believed to be of significance in understanding the formation of fissures in <b>stiff</b> <b>clays,</b> and in evaluating their operational strength...|$|R

60|$|The Hadleigh Colony, {{of which}} Lieut.-Colonel Laurie is the Officer in charge, is an estate of about 3,000 acres which was {{purchased}} by the Salvation Army in the year 1891 {{at a cost of}} about £20 the acre, the land being <b>stiff</b> <b>clay</b> of the usual Essex type. As it has chanced, owing to the amount of building which is going on in the neighbourhood of Southend, and to its proximity to London, that is within forty miles, the investment has proved a very good one. I imagine that if ever it should come to the hammer the Hadleigh Colony would fetch a great deal more than £20 the acre, independently of its cultural improvements. These, of course, are very great. For instance, more than 100 acres are now planted with fruit-trees in full bearing. Also, there are brickfields which are furnished with the best machinery and plant, ranges of tomato and salad houses, and a large French garden where early vegetables are grown for market. A portion of the land, however, still remains in the hands of tenants, with whom the Army does not like to interfere.|$|E
60|$|From this point, turning {{abruptly}} {{from north}} to west, we took the steep narrow path which climbs the Akankon ridge, rising 78 feet above the river. A few paces led us to the prospecting shaft, a native pit squared and timbered by Mr. Cornish. He was assisted by Mr. James B. Ross, 'practical miner, working manager, and mine-owner for {{the last twenty years}} in Queensland, Australia.' He thus describes himself in the very able report which he sent to his company; and I am glad to hear that he has returned to the Gold Coast. The shaft, 40 feet from 'the outcrop,' and 50 from the hill-base, is bottomed at the depth of 52 feet. Unfortunately it is only box-timbered, and much of the woodwork was shaken down by the blasts. The sinking through <b>stiff</b> <b>clay,</b> stained with iron, cobalt, manganese, and cinnabar, was reported easy. But where the hanging and foot walls should have been, fragments of clay, iron, and mica-slate showed that the former lie still deeper. My companion proposed a descent into the shaft by bucket and windlass. I declined, greatly distrusting such deserted pits, especially in this region, where they appear unusually liable to foul. Two days afterwards a Kruboy went down and was brought to grass almost insensible from the choke-damp; his hands clenched the rope so tightly that their grip was hard to loose.|$|E

6000|$|The lagoons {{of all the}} atolls in the {{southern}} part of the Archipelago are from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part. This is well exemplified in the case of Addoo, {{the southern}}most atoll in the group, for although only nine miles in its longest diameter, it has a depth of thirty-nine fathoms, whereas all the other small atolls have comparatively shallow lagoons; I can assign no adequate cause for this difference in depth. In the central and deepest part of the lagoons, the bottom consists, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, of <b>stiff</b> <b>clay</b> (probably a calcareous mud); nearer the border it consists of sand, and in the channels through the reef, of hard sand-banks, sandstone, conglomerate rubble, and a little live coral. Close outside the reef and the line joining its detached portions (where intersected by many channels), the bottom is sandy, and it slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths. In most lagoons the depth is considerably greater in the centre than in the channels; but in Tilla-dou-Matte, where the marginal ring-formed reefs stand far apart, the same depth is carried across the entire atoll, from the deep-water line on one side to that on the other. I cannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these atolls,--a great sandy and generally concave disc rises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded and its border symmetrically fringed with oval basins of coral-rock, just lipping the surface of the sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and each containing a little lake of clear water! ...|$|E

I ventured to whisper [...] "Utopia," [...] which, however, was unanimously scouted down, and the proposer very harshly maltreated, as if he had intended a latent satire.

60|$|The {{effect of}} this ingenious {{arrangement}} was to give its owner a house that could be approached only by water, the sides of which were composed of logs closely wedged together, which were two feet thick in their thinnest parts, and which could be separated only by a deliberate and laborious use of human hands, or by the slow operation of time. The outer surface of the building was rude and uneven, the logs being of unequal sizes; but the squared surfaces within gave both the sides and door as uniform an appearance as was desired, either for use or show. The chimney was not the least singular portion of the castle, as Hurry made his companion observe, while he explained {{the process by which}} it had been made. The material was a <b>stiff</b> <b>clay,</b> properly worked, which had been put together in a mould of sticks, and suffered to harden, a foot or two at a time, commencing at the bottom. When the entire chimney had thus been raised, and had been properly bound in with outward props, a brisk fire was kindled, and kept going until it was burned to something like a brick-red. This had not been an easy operation, nor had it succeeded entirely; but by dint of filling the cracks with fresh clay, a safe fireplace and chimney had been obtained in the end. This part of the work stood on the log-door, secured beneath by an extra pile. There were a few other peculiarities about this dwelling, which will better appear {{in the course of the}} narrative.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} results from {{laboratory}} tests on London Clay and artificially cemented kaolin are presented {{and used to}} develop a preliminary framework for the time-dependent behaviour of soils, applicable to <b>stiff</b> <b>clays</b> and other soils. In {{the same way that}} the natural structure of clays has been shown to influence their monotonic behaviour, it is shown that it can also alter their response to changes in strain rate. The relative influence of the two main components of post-sedimentation structure - over-consolidation and diagenesis - on the time-dependent behaviour of London Clay was investigated in triaxial compression tests. The study was carried out in two steps, comparing first the behaviours of normally and overconsolidated reconstituted samples of London Clay subjected to stepwise changes in strain rate, and then the behaviours of overconsolidated reconstituted and undisturbed London Clay samples. The test results show that overconsolidation does not seem to affect the response of reconstituted London Clay to strain rate changes, which is consistent with published data on other <b>stiff</b> <b>clays.</b> However, intact and reconstituted overconsolidated samples show different behaviours, highlighting that it is the elements of structure resulting from diagenesis that influence the time-dependent behaviour of London Clay. Effects of cementing on strain rate sensitivity were investigated in triaxial compression of artificially cemented kaolin. The results obtained were different from the results for London Clay, suggesting that the difference in strain rate effects in the intact and reconstituted London Clay cannot be simply associated with cementing. A preliminary framework is proposed, where the time-dependent behaviour of soil depends on its participate or continuum nature. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Gidi Mavunga, wearing pagne and fetish-bag, and handling a thin stick {{in which two}} bulges had been cut, led us out of Banza Nokki, and took a S.S.W. direction. The uneven ground {{was covered with a}} bitter tomato (nenga) and with the shrub which, according to Herodotus, bears wool instead of fruit. I sent home specimens of this gossypium arboreum, which everywhere grows wild and which is chiefly used for wicks. There is scant hope of cotton-culture amongst a people whose industry barely suffices for ground-nuts. The <b>stiff</b> <b>clay</b> soil everywhere showed traces of iron, and the guide pointed out a palm-tree which had been split by the electric fluid, and a broad, deep furrow, several feet long, ending in a hole. The Nzazhi (lightning) is as dangerous and as much dreaded on these hills as in Uganda: the south-west trade meets the land wind from the north-east; strata of clouds in different states of electricity combine, says the popular theory, to produce the thunder and lightning which accompany rain like the storms upon the mountains of Yemen. After 30' (- 1.50 miles) we reached our destination, Banza Chinguvu, the head-quarters of Gidi Mavunga. As we entered it he pointed to a pot full of greasy stuff under a dwarf shed, saying, [...] "Isso è meu Deus:" [...] it was in fact his Baka chya Mazinga.

After an hour's march we reached the base of Koralay, upon whose lower slopes appeared a pair of the antelopes called Alakud [33]: they are tame, easily shot, and eagerly eaten by the Bedouins. Another hour of slow travelling brought us to a broad Fiumara with high banks of <b>stiff</b> <b>clay</b> thickly wooded and showing a water-mark eighteen feet above the sand. The guides named these wells Agjogsi, probably a generic term signifying that water is standing close by. Crossing the Fiumara we ascended a hill, and found upon the summit a large kraal alive with heads of kine. The inhabitants flocked out to stare at us and the women uttered cries of wonder. I advanced towards the prettiest, and fired my rifle by way of salute over her head. The people delighted, exclaimed, Mod!

An hour's march brought us to an open space surrounded by thin thorn forest: in the centre is an ancient grave, about which are performed the equestrian games when the turban of the Ugaz has been bound under the Holy Tree. Shepherds issued from the bush to stare at us as we passed, and stretched forth the hand for [...] "Bori:" [...] the maidens tripped forwards exclaiming, [...] "Come, girls, {{let us look at}} this prodigy!" [...] and they never withheld an answer if civilly addressed. Many of them were grown up, and not a few were old maids, the result of the tribe's isolation; for here, as in Somaliland generally, the union of cousins is abhorred. The ground of the valley is a <b>stiff</b> <b>clay,</b> sprinkled with pebbles of primitive formation: the hills are mere rocks, and the torrent banks with strata of small stones, showed a watermark varying from ten to fifteen feet in height: in these Fiumaras we saw frequent traces of the Edler-game, deer and hog. At 1 P.M. our camels and mules were watered at wells in a broad wady called Jannah-Gaban or the Little Garden; its course, I was told, lies northwards through the Harawwah Valley to the Odla and Waruf, two depressions in the Wayma country near Tajurrah. About half an hour afterwards we arrived at a deserted sheepfold distant six miles from our last station. After unloading we repaired to a neighbouring well, and found the water so hard that it raised lumps like nettle stings in the bather's skin. The only remedy for the evil is an unguent of oil or butter, a precaution which should never be neglected by the African traveller.
