For example, the RuelleTakens scenario describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a <b>strange</b> <b>attractor.</b> In another example, Feigenbaum period-doubling describes how a stable periodic orbit goes {{through a series of}} period-doubling bifurcations.|$|E

In recent times Waddington's {{notion of the}} epigenetic landscape has been rigorously formalized {{in the context of}} the systems dynamics state approach to the study of cell-fate. Cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or <b>strange</b> <b>attractor)</b> or oscillatory.|$|E

2500|$|Discrete chaotic systems, {{such as the}} {{logistic}} map, can exhibit strange attractors {{whatever their}} dimensionality. In contrast, for continuous dynamical systems, the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a <b>strange</b> <b>attractor</b> can only arise in three or more dimensions. [...] Finite-dimensional linear systems are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either nonlinear or infinite-dimensional.|$|E
2500|$|A Lyapunov {{function}} {{is a function}} of the system f = f(x) whose existence in a system demonstrates stability. [...] It is often useful to imagine a Lyapunov function as the energy of the system. [...] If the derivative of the {{function is}} equal to zero for some orbit not including the equilibrium point, then that orbit is a stable attractor, but it must be either a limit cycle or n-torus - but not a <b>strange</b> <b>attractor</b> (this is because the largest Lyapunov exponent of a limit cycle and n-torus are zero while that of a <b>strange</b> <b>attractor</b> is positive). [...] If the derivative is less than zero everywhere except the equilibrium point, then the equilibrium point is a stable fixed point attractor. [...] When searching a dynamical system for non-fixed point attractors, the existence of a Lyapunov function can help eliminate regions of parameter space where these dynamics are impossible.|$|E

2500|$|Example: Let α2 = 0.451, α1 = 0.5, and α2 = 0.237. [...] If α1 = 0.5 {{then all}} {{eigenvalues}} are negative {{and the only}} attractor is a fixed point. [...] If α1 = 0.852 then the real {{part of one of}} the complex eigenvalue pair becomes positive and there is a <b>strange</b> <b>attractor.</b> [...] The disappearance of this Lyapunov function coincides with a Hopf bifurcation.|$|E
2500|$|Reynolds number {{interpretation}} {{has been}} extended into the area of arbitrary complex systems. Such as financial flows, nonlinear networks, etc. In the latter case an artificial viscosity is reduced to nonlinear mechanism of energy distribution in complex network media. Reynolds number then represents a basic control parameter which expresses a balance between injected and dissipated energy flows for open boundary system. It has been shown [...] that Reynolds critical regime separates two types of phase space motion: accelerator (attractor) and decelerator. High Reynolds number leads to a chaotic regime transition only in frame of <b>strange</b> <b>attractor</b> model.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike fixed-point attractors {{and limit}} cycles, the attractors {{that arise from}} chaotic systems, known as <b>strange</b> <b>attractors,</b> have great detail and complexity. [...] <b>Strange</b> <b>attractors</b> occur in both {{continuous}} dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some discrete systems (such as the Hénon map). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a Julia set, which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points.

Both <b>strange</b> <b>attractors</b> and Julia sets typically have a fractal structure, and the fractal dimension can be calculated for them.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of the physical and <b>strange</b> <b>attractors</b> is inherently associated with the boundedness of fluctuations. The idea behind the boundedness is that a stable long-term evolution of any natural and engineered system is possible {{if and only if}} the fluctuations that the system exerts are bounded so that the system permanently stays within its thresholds of stability. It has been established that the asymptotic {{structure of}} the physical and <b>strange</b> <b>attractors</b> is identical. Now it is found out that though the non-asymptotic behavior is universal it can be very different, namely: on coarse-graining the physical attractors can exhibit a variety of behavior while the <b>strange</b> <b>attractors</b> always have hyperuniversal properties. Yet, under certain levels of coarse-graining both physical and <b>strange</b> <b>attractors</b> match non-asymptotically a variety of noise type behavior. Comment: 7 pages, presented at 5 -th Int.
