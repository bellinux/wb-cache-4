"Silver Bells" [...] was {{composed}} by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans, introduced by Bob Hope and Marilyn Maxwell in the film, The Lemon Drop Kid and recorded by Bing Crosby and Carol Richards in 1952. The song {{was inspired by}} Salvation Army bellringers {{and is one of}} the very few songs about Christmas in the city. The song was originally called [...] "Tinkle Bell", but Livingston's wife reminded him that [...] "tinkle" [...] had another association. [...] "It was <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> in the bathroom," [...] Evans recalled years after the song's composition, [...] "but that's a woman's word and I'd never thought of it." [...] "Silver Bells" [...] ranks #13 on ASCAP's list of most-played holiday songs.|$|E
2500|$|In a Rolling Stone {{interview}} in 2000, Rose mentioned {{that part of}} the delay of the album was him [...] "educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock", stating, [...] "It's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to be <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> on a computer." [...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process because you have to get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on infinitely, which is what they've done." [...] Geffen A Tom Zutaut stated the record [...] "could have been out by September 2002".|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone in February 2000, Rose played several songs of the upcoming album to reporters, including [...] "Chinese Democracy", [...] "Catcher in the Rye", [...] "I.R.S.", [...] "The Blues", [...] "There was a Time" [...] and [...] "Oklahoma". Rose mentioned {{that part of the}} delay of the new album was him 'educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock', stating that [...] "it's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to be <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> on a computer." [...] Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti remixed by Beck and Trent Reznor. Rose mentioned that the expense of the record would be negated by the recording sessions yielding multiple albums, including a record that is [...] "more industrial and electronica-influenced than Chinese Democracy". At that point, the album had gone through multiple producers, including Youth, Moby, Mike Clink, Roy Thomas Baker, Eric Caudieux. At the time, Sean Beavan was producing, but Caram Costanzo and Axl Rose became the final credited producers on the album. The album had been completely re-recorded several times with varying musicians and producers. In a 2001 interview, Rose described the album as having [...] "all kinds of styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs" [...] and said that it was [...] "not industrial".|$|E

5000|$|During this period, Cope {{discovered}} the book Guitar Army: Rock and Revolution with The MC5 and the White Panther Party by John Sinclair. He later {{described it as}} his [...] "Holy Book" [...] and enthusiastically embraced its one-take approach to making and recording music (as well as its message of rock- and-roll being a weapon of cultural revolution). This method typified Cope's musical approach from then on, as he forever left behind the more measured and constructed approach of Saint Julian and The Teardrop Explodes in favour of more spontaneous expression. [...] "Nothing I do is ironic. I am post-Ironic. Irony is the ultimate cop-out way of turning <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not mean into <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Like bands that put big tits on their album sleeves and say it's an ironic comment about sexism. Like bands that put car shit on their album sleeves and say it's anti-car. Bollocks. If it glorifies then it's bollocks. Irony is the last refuge of the scoundrel." [...] Julian Cope Having repaired his relationship with Island Records, Cope began recording his next record {{against the background of}} the civil demonstrations which became the Poll Tax Riots. Cope joined the demonstrations and took a prominent role in them. Wearing a huge theatrical costume throughout the march, he was later featured on the BBC's Poll Tax documentary, a lone protester walking down Whitehall surrounded by seven lines of mounted police.|$|E

There were no high-street shops where you could buy cheap clothes, so you {{would go to the}} market, buy some fabric and knock up your own". She was a pupil at Northfleet School for Girls, later attending Medway College of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts).

For my neighbour (and not a few priests), theology was <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> in seminary to prepare you for ministry and, to the end, was deemed to be perfectly sufficient for life. In Maynooth jargon, there was â€˜stuff /bullâ€™ to be learned; once you got through whatever had to be done for your exams (bull), you retained the basic knowledge (stuff) for working in a parish!
