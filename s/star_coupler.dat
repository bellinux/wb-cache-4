40|$|A new {{multihop}} wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) {{optical network}} designed for uniform traffic with two wavelengths per node {{that can give}} the maximum throughput and minimum delay is proposed. It is called a 'Simple Star' multihop optical network. This network has good characteristics in traffic balance and small average number of hops. Moreover, Simple Star can be used together with multiple <b>star</b> <b>couplers</b> {{to reduce the number}} of wavelength used. Furthermore, unlike most existing networks, this network does not impose an upper limit to the number of nodes. Another interesting pattern is Simple Star with Center Node (Simple Star CN) particularly for prime numbers of nodes. It can be shown that the average number of hops of Simple Star (normal plus CN) is in between those of Shufflenet and Kautz, but the throughput and delay are better. An associated network called Simple Star Shared Channel (Simple Star SC) for two transceivers per node is also presented and it can be used together with multiple <b>star</b> <b>couplers</b> {{to reduce the number of}} wavelengths.

5000|$|Versions of STANAG 3910 using {{optical media}} for the HS channel {{component}} require an additional passive component, {{in the form}} of an optical <b>star</b> <b>coupler</b> either reflective or transmissive, to interconnect the remote terminals. This limits the number of remote terminals that may be connected to the HS media, through the effect of the optical star on the optical power (determined by the number of [...] "ways" [...] of the star). Therefore, it may not be possible for all the (up to) 31 RTs (and 1 BC) that may be connected to the LS channel to have HS channel connections.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of optical}} media for the HS buses, e.g. in EFABus, has a {{significant}} effect on the physical architectures: it is not practical to implement linier T coupled bus architectures, where the bus is run around the platform (e.g. the aircraft), and each line replaceable item (LRI) connects, though a stub, at the nearest convenient point in its path. Rather, each LRI has an optical physical media connection to a common <b>star</b> <b>coupler,</b> which passively connects it to all the other LRIs connected to the same star. In the case of a reflective star, the bus connection from the RT will be a single fibre cable, over which the RT both transmits and receives (half duplex). With a transmissive star, each RT is connected through two fibres, one for it to transmit and one for it to receive data over.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{networks}} {{based on}} passive <b>star</b> <b>couplers</b> and employing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) {{have been proposed}} for deployment in local and metropolitan areas.

Due to the high cost of amplifiers, it is desirable to minimize their total number in the network. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus, optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem.
