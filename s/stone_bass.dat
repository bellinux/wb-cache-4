The band had trouble adapting to playing with Carman who {{was not used to}} playing with other musicians. Carman's unwillingness to stay to a steady beat or regular chord changes left band members scrambling {{to keep track of the}} songs. These problems were exacerbated by Carman's heavy drinking and lack of rehearsals some which shows in the quality of some of the singles. Carman's drinking was in turn exacerbated by his nervousness about recording and some sessions had to be cancelled. There were five recording sessions between 1951 and 1953 resulting in twenty singles, of which five were not released.|$|E

They were managed at this time by BBC presenter St.John Howell and an appearance on the TV soap The Newcomers followed. A highlight of 1967 was a gig on 2 July at the Savile Theatre, London appearing with Cream, John Mayall, and Jeff Beck/Rod Stewart group. However, according to Bruce Eder at Allmusic, [...] "their singles failed to register with the public despite a high-energy sound strongly reminiscent of the early Stones, solid attack on their instruments... and a good feel for the blues." [...] Powell continued to record, at first on the short-lived Strike label set up by writer and producer Miki Dallon and, from 1967, back at Decca where he released three singles in 1967-68.|$|E

5|$|By 1982 16 {{per cent}} of Yorkshire's public houses {{were tied to}} <b>Stones.</b> <b>Bass</b> closed the Cannon Brewery in April 1999 {{with the loss of}} 57 jobs. Bass blamed the closure on the steep decline in sales of cask {{conditioned}} beers (nationally there had been a 14 per cent decline in sales of cask beer over the previous 12 months) which the brewery produced. The brewer realised £1 million in efficiency savings by closing the brewery. The Campaign for Real Ale blamed the brewery's closure on Bass' failure to promote their cask conditioned products. As well as Stones Bitter, the Cannon brewed the small scale Bass Special, Bass Light and Bass Mild brands from the mid-1990s as declining Stones volumes left the brewery with spare capacity. Bass Light and Bass Mild had been sold in the Sheffield area as Stones Mild and Stones Dark Mild respectively.|$|R
