25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have or might be buying and therefore what it might be worth.|$|E

According to Yip, Perez Hilton {{was the one who}} recommended the song for Bieber, and after that the producers agreed. Yip said that Usher's label, Jive Records [...] "wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to do with the record for Usher", so they contacted Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun, and Bieber was able to record the track. On the remix, Jonathan Yip commented, [...] "Usher's now back on the record, on the remix, so we can't really complain." [...] A variation of the track with slightly different production, featuring Usher as lead vocalist and Bieber as the guest vocalist, is included on a follow-up release to his sixth studio album, titled Versus. The Versus version of the song was produced by Benny Blanco.|publisher=Ryan Seacrest|date=May 20, 2010|accessdate=May 22, 2010}} ...|$|E

The butler appeared only with the wine, which he served, and quietly withdrew.

A murmur of conversation continually flowed between them, but he was never very <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were talking about.

60|$|The general {{character}} {{of all these}} novels may be described, in the author's own term, as psychologic realism. This means that George Eliot sought to do in her novels what Browning attempted in his poetry; that is, to represent the inner struggle of a soul, and to reveal the motives, impulses, and hereditary influences which govern human action. Browning generally stops when he tells his story, and either lets you draw your own conclusion or else gives you his in a few striking lines. But George Eliot is not content until she has minutely explained the motives of her characters and the moral {{lesson to be learned}} from them. Moreover, it is the development of a soul, the slow growth or decline of moral power, which chiefly interests her. Her heroes and heroines differ radically from those of Dickens and Thackeray in this respect,--that when we meet {{the men and women of}} the latter novelists, their characters are already formed, and we are reasonably <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will do under given circumstances. In George Eliot's novels the characters develop gradually as we come to know them. They go from weakness to strength, or from strength to weakness, according to the works that they do and the thoughts that they cherish. In Romola, for instance, Tito, as we first meet him, may be either good or bad, and we know not whether he will finally turn to the right hand or to the left. As time passes, we see him degenerate steadily because he follows his selfish impulses, while Romola, whose character is at first only faintly indicated, grows into beauty and strength with every act of self-renunciation.|$|E
