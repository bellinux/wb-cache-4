40|$|This curatorial project {{examines}} {{the notion of}} survoyeurism, my neologism for the intersection <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> and voyeurism in contemporary society. Survoyeurism: Reconsidering Surveillance explores two trends in the current information age: the growing ubiquity and invasiveness <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> against public will, and people’s willingness to provide their information to whomever requests it. By bringing together various iterations <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> and voyeurism through works of installation, monoprint and video, this exhibition demonstrates how acts of oversharing contribute to a spectacle <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The ubiquity <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> in technology and contemporary society has brought forth a dual response in the general public: those who vehemently battle the rising invasiveness and seek to maintain privacy, and those who actively give over their private information for others' consumption and use. Survoyeurism addresses the social implications <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> practices to investigate how contemporary artists have addressed this dichotomy, and what they propose as a response...|$|R
5000|$|Inverse {{surveillance}} is {{a subset}} of sousveillance with a particular emphasis on the [...] "watchful vigilance from underneath" [...] and a form <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> inquiry or legal protection involving the recording, monitoring, study, or analysis <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems, proponents <b>of</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and possibly also recordings of authority figures and their actions. Inverse surveillance is typically an activity undertaken {{by those who are}} generally the subject <b>of</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and may thus {{be thought of as a}} form of ethnography or ethnomethodology study (i.e. an analysis of the surveilled from the perspective of a participant in a society under surveillance).|$|R

The paper identifies 12 negative effects <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> including, among others, privacy intrusion, the chilling effect and social exclusion, and classifies them into three groups. It further illustrates the different ways in which perceptions and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> interact with each other, distinguishing between perceived security and perceived effectiveness. Finally, the paper advances a methodology to take into account perception issues when designing new surveillance technologies. By doing so, it rejects manipulative measures aiming at improving perceptions only and suggests measures that address the background conditions affecting perceptions...|$|R
