5000|$|Some moldmakers {{distinguish}} <b>the</b> <b>sprue,</b> <b>the</b> gate, and <b>the</b> runner. <b>The</b> <b>sprue</b> is a large-diameter channel {{through which}} plastic flows, usually {{around the edges}} of the part or along straight lines. The runner is a smaller channel from <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> to <b>the</b> individual part. An analogy may be found in a water system that employs a water main (sprue) and smaller pipes (runners) to individual houses. The gate is the location at which the molten plastic enters the mold cavity and is often evidenced by a small nub or projection (the [...] "gate mark") on the molded piece. [...] Many scale-model kits are made from injection-molded plastic. Hobbyists typically remove the parts of a model kit from the runner using a sharp craft knife or razor saw. <b>The</b> <b>sprues</b> usually form a rectangle with the runners and parts inside which makes them easier to box.|$|R
50|$|Jewelers prepare cuttlebone {{for use as}} a mold {{by cutting}} it in half and rubbing the two sides {{together}} until they fit flush against one another. Then the casting can be done by carving a design into the cuttlebone, adding <b>the</b> necessary <b>sprue,</b> melting <b>the</b> metal in a separate pouring crucible, and pouring the molten metal into the mold through <b>the</b> <b>sprue.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> is sawed off and the finished piece is polished.|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} sprue {{designs were}} investigated visually and radiographically to determine <b>the</b> influence of <b>spruing</b> arrangement on <b>the</b> soundness of RPD castings. <b>The</b> first <b>sprue</b> design was a tree sprue design consisted of four wax formers, 3 mm in diameter each, {{going directly to}} four different spots on the major connector. <b>The</b> second <b>sprue</b> design was a circular <b>sprue</b> design. <b>The</b> circular feeder was made from a 3 mm diameter wax. <b>The</b> auxiliary <b>sprues</b> emanating from <b>the</b> circular feeder were six in number, 2 mm in diameter each, and were attached directly to the major connector. The circular feeder was attached to <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> button by four formers, 3 mm in diameter each. <b>The</b> third <b>sprue</b> design was designated as <b>the</b> bali <b>sprue</b> design. <b>The</b> ball design consisted of four feeders, 3 mm in diameter each, as with the tree design except that a 5 mm ball reservoir was placed on each feeder, 5 mm away from the wax pattern. Five frameworks of the same dental cast were prepared using each <b>sprue</b> design. <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> three <b>sprue</b> designs {{used in this study}} are suitabie for producing sound RPD frame castings.

50|$|The flask is {{then put}} back together, and metal can be {{poured into the}} mold. The metal will flow down <b>the</b> <b>sprue,</b> into <b>the</b> mold cavity, and back up the riser (of which there may be several). Once the metal has cooled enough to solidify, the flask can then be {{separated}} again, and the sand removed to reveal the rough casting.

5000|$|<b>Spruing.</b> <b>The</b> wax copy is sprued with a treelike {{structure}} of wax {{that will eventually}} provide paths for the molten casting material to flow and for air to escape. <b>The</b> carefully planned <b>spruing</b> usually begins at the top with a wax [...] "cup," [...] which is attached by wax cylinders to various points on the wax copy. <b>The</b> <b>spruing</b> {{does not have to}} be hollow, as it will be melted out later in the process.|$|R

50|$|Sprues {{can serve}} as filters, as heat sinks, and as feeders. Bronze, in particular, has a high {{shrinkage}} rate as it is cooling; a sprue can continue to provide molten metal to the casting, provided that it {{is large enough to}} retain enough heat to stay liquid, as metal in the main casting cools and shrinks. The design of <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> and runner system can be also used to prevent dross and sand from continuing into the main cavity; this may include adding porous material to the runners or using cyclonic separation to move the dross to the side of <b>the</b> <b>sprue.</b>|$|R

40|$|Casting {{removable}} partial dentures (RPDs) without completely filling <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> {{channels and}} generating casting buttons {{would result in}} saving metal and making more defect-free castings. This investigation tested whether a complete and sound RPD casting can be obtained when a minimal amount of metal is used, A factorial experimental design, three spruing methods, two metal feeding directions, and two different weights of metal were used to cast 60 Kennedy class II, modification 1 RPDs. The metal used to cast each framework was either enough {{to result in a}} full button or in no button. Visual and radiographic examinations and counting of defects were made by two independent operators who were unaware of <b>the</b> <b>spruing</b> method, feeding direction, or amount of metal used to make the framework. The completeness of the casting and the presence of porosities were evaluated for clasps, major connectors, and meshworks. The use of minimal metal to cast RPDs was equally as successful as using enough for a full button, provided that <b>the</b> appropriate <b>spruing</b> arrangement and metal feeding direction were chosen. Indirect metal feeding for maxillary RPDs was successful with <b>the</b> proper <b>spruing</b> arrangement. King Saud Universit...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is made for the process equipment which includes a temperature sensor. Preferred Features: The pressure rise occurs when the melt reaches a wall of the tool close to the temperature sensor which can be close to <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> and at a ponit remote from <b>the</b> <b>sprue.</b> Both sensors have a rapid response to temperature change. USE - For determining the {{point at which}} the injection pressure is changed to follow up pressure in an injection molding cycle.

50|$|Metal-chasing. Just as the wax copies were chased, {{the casting}} is worked until the {{telltale}} {{signs of the}} casting process are removed, so that the casting now looks like the original model.

500|$|The mould {{consists}} of two primary components, the injection mould (A plate) and the ejector mould (B plate). These components are {{also referred to as}} moulder and mouldmaker. Plastic resin enters the mould through a sprue or gate in the injection mould; <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> bushing is to seal tightly against the nozzle of the injection barrel of the moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow from the barrel into the mould, also known as <b>the</b> [...] <b>The</b> <b>sprue</b> bushing directs <b>the</b> molten plastic to the cavity images through channels that are machined into the faces of the A and B plates. These channels allow plastic to run along them, so they are referred to as runners. [...] The molten plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into the cavity geometry to form the desired part.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sprue</b> is <b>the</b> {{passage through}} which liquid {{material}} is introduced into a mold. In many cases it controls {{the flow of}} metal into the mold. During casting or molding, the material in <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> will solidify {{and need to be}} removed from the finished part. This excess material is also called a sprue.|$|R
50|$|Directional {{solidification}} (DS) {{and progressive}} solidification are types of solidification within castings. Directional solidification is solidification that occurs from farthest {{end of the}} casting and works its way towards <b>the</b> <b>sprue.</b> Progressive solidification, also known as parallel solidification, is solidification that starts at {{the walls of the}} casting and progresses perpendicularly from that surface.|$|R
5000|$|Then, the cope {{is placed}} on the drag, and dowels (or pins) are put in the sand to make holes for <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> and one or more risers. Talcum powder and sand are again sifted over the pattern, and rammed to fill the cope. The pins are then {{carefully}} pulled out of the sand. The critical part of the operation is to separate the cope and drag to remove the pattern. The pattern may be vibrated with a powered vibrator, or the pattern, and maybe the cope and drag flask, will be lightly tapped with a small hammer. The pattern is lifted from the sand, leaving a molding cavity. A passageway for metal to enter the mold, called a [...] "gate", is then cut from <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> hole to <b>the</b> void left by the pattern, and a runner is cut from the sand to allow metal to flow into the riser.|$|R

500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While using {{water cooled}} mold to produce steel ingot, an air gap is {{generated}} between the ingot and the mold, {{which has an}} important influence on the ingot quality. The air gap formation law and its influence on the solidification process were calculated by used FE software Procast. It is shown that, air gap occurs {{in a few minutes}} after the solidification begins. In 75 - 100 s later the gap reaches 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm and starts to influent the heat transport significantly, the rate of the temperature decrease becomes slower. When the solidification is finished, there is a lager gap on the two narrow surfaces than it on the other wide surfaces; and the gap on the two narrow surfaces is different. The air gap on the narrow surface close to <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> has a width of 12 - 20 mm; on the other narrow surface away from <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> has a width of 4 - 13 mm. The biggest gap on the two wide surfaces has a size about 6. 5 mm. For the air gap is formatted between the ingot shell and the ingot mold, the solidification time is 50 % longer than that of without air gap...|$|R
50|$|The {{gating system}} may be {{designed}} to minimize turbulence, depending on the material being cast. For example, steel, cast iron, and most copper alloys are turbulent insensitive, but aluminium and magnesium alloys are turbulent sensitive. The turbulent insensitive materials usually have a short and open gating system to fill the mold as quickly as possible. However, for turbulent sensitive materials short sprues are used to minimize the distance the material must fall when entering the mold. Rectangular pouring cups and tapered sprues are used to prevent {{the formation of a}} vortex as the material flows into the mold; these vortices tend to suck gas and oxides into the mold. A large sprue well is used to dissipate the kinetic energy of the liquid material as it falls down <b>the</b> <b>sprue,</b> decreasing turbulence. <b>The</b> choke, which is the smallest cross-sectional area in the gating system used to control flow, can be placed near <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> well to slow down and smooth out the flow. Note that on some molds the choke is still placed on the gates to make separation of the part easier, but induces extreme turbulence. The gates are usually attached {{to the bottom of the}} casting to minimize turbulence and splashing.|$|R
50|$|The {{variation}} on the gravity pouring technique is to fill the mold using a vacuum. A common form of {{this is called the}} Hitchiner process after the Hitchiner Manufacturing Company that invented the technique. In this technique, the mold has a downward fill pipe that is lowered into the melt. A vacuum draws the melt into the cavity; when the important parts have solidified, the vacuum is released, and the unused material leaves the mold. The technique can use substantially less material than gravity pouring because <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> and some gating need not solidify.|$|R
5000|$|The {{methods used}} for small parts and {{jewellery}} vary somewhat from those used for sculpture. A wax model is obtained either from injection into a rubber mould or by being custom-made by carving. The wax or waxes are sprued and fused onto a rubber base, called a [...] "sprue base". Then a metal flask, which resembles a short length of steel pipe that ranges roughly from 1.5 to six {{inches tall and}} wide, is put over <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> base and <b>the</b> waxes. Most <b>sprue</b> bases have a circular rim which grips the standard-sized flask, holding it in place. Investment (refractory plaster) is mixed and poured into the flask, filling it. It hardens, then is burned out as outlined above. Casting is usually done straight from the kiln either by centrifugal casting or vacuum casting.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the in vitro {{corrosion}} resistance in artificial saliva of two palladiumsilver alloys (a PdAg (Pors on 4) and an AgPd (Palliag LTG)), with and without casting defects; 1 nickelchrome alloy and 1 high-gold alloy, cast under recommended conditions, served as controls. For each of the palladium-based alloys, three specimens corresponding to three different casting conditions were used: under recommended conditions, with the use of a graphite-containing investment and crucible, and by reusing <b>the</b> <b>sprues</b> and <b>sprue</b> button. <b>The</b> electrochemical tests were run in Fusayama&# 150 Meyer artificial saliva. The open-circuit potential was recorded in mV/SCE at t = 24 h. Then, potentiodynamic polarization was performed to measure the polarization resistance (R p) in kΩ cm 2 and the corrosion current (i corr) in μA cm  2. Data were evaluated with one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparisons test (α = 0. 05). In addition, each specimen was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Compared to the control alloys, the electrochemical experiments in artificial saliva indicated satisfactory corrosion resistance for the PdAg and AgPd alloys; these results are related to their high noble metal content and stable substructure. The PdAg alloy displayed superior electrochemical properties to those of the AgPd alloy regardless of the casting condition. The use of the graphite-containing crucible and investment during the cast process did not dramatically reduce the corrosion resistance values, but <b>the</b> reuse of <b>sprues</b> and <b>the</b> <b>sprue</b> button did. <b>The</b> optimal corrosion resistance values were obtained for the alloys cast according to the recommended conditions...|$|R
