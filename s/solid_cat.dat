40|$|The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to analyze the aflatoxins (AF i. e. AFB 1, AFB 2, AFG 1 AFG 2) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in imported pet food. A total of five hundred and ten commercially available imported pet food samples of cat (solid = 240, semi-solid = 90) and dog (solid = 150, semi-solid = 30) were collected from retailers and analyzed by chromatographic technique i. e. HPTLC. Results revealed 45. 83 % (mean, 3. 90 ppb) and 18 % (mean, 4. 83 ppb) of AFB 1 incidence in solid pet foods of cats and dogs, respectively. However, lower levels i. e. 8. 88 % (mean, 4. 60 ppb) and 6. 66 % (mean, 2. 80 ppb) of AFB 1 were observed for semi-solid food samples of cat and dog, respectively. Aflatoxin B 2 was found in <b>solid</b> <b>cat</b> food only with an incidence of 12. 5 % (mean, 0. 89 ppb). About 35. 33 % (mean, 4. 5 ppb) and 26. 66 % (mean, 2 ppb) of OTA were observed in solid and semi-solid dog foods respectively. Similarly, the trend of OTA in cat foods was 15 % (mean, 3. 87 ppb) and 13. 13 % (mean, 1. 0 ppb) for solid and semi-solid foods. Furthermore, co-contamination of AF and OTA were observed in 33. 33 % and 41. 60 % samples of dog and cat foods, respectively. It was concluded that natural incidence of mean contaminations was below than European Commission (EC) legislation i. e. 20 ppb and 10 ppb for AF and OTA, respectively. However, co-occurrence of mycotoxins in pet food may exert synergistic deleterious effects even at levels far below the regulatory limits...|$|E
50|$|Regardless of breed, any <b>cat</b> with <b>solid</b> gray {{coloration}} has {{two pairs}} of double-recessive genes for the non-agouti and color-dilution traits, and so an exclusive mating between two <b>solid</b> gray <b>cats</b> should always produce solid gray kittens.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Honeydripper" [...] by Joe Liggins, {{recorded}} on April 20, 1945, synthesized boogie-woogie piano, jazz, and the riff from the folk chestnut [...] "Shortnin' Bread", into an exciting dance performance that topped the R&B [...] "race" [...] charts for 18 weeks (a record later shared with Jordan's [...] "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie") and {{also made the}} pop charts. The lyrics proclaimed urban arrogance and were sexually suggestive - [...] "He's a <b>solid</b> gold <b>cat,</b> the honeydripper ... he's a killer, a Harlem diller ...".|$|R
5000|$|Any cat whose fur is {{a single}} color, {{including}} black, {{is known as a}} [...] "solid" [...] or [...] "self". A [...] "solid black" [...] cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a <b>solid</b> black <b>cat.</b> A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a [...] "black smoke." ...|$|R
50|$|Victoria {{is known}} for her {{distinct}} white coat, which stands out amongst the multi-colored markings of the other cats. Although her costume is designed {{to give the impression}} of a pure-white cat, due to the limitations of stage lighting (a pure white costume would wash out all costume details under stage lighting), she has light gold, tan, or grey markings on her costume. Her memorable visage is individual in comparison to the other Jellicles, as the only <b>solid</b> white <b>cat</b> in the junkyard. Her singular appearance also makes her a frequent subject for advertising for the musical. She has a pink bejeweled collar around her neck.|$|R
5000|$|Liggins {{claimed to}} have written the tune around 1942, when playing piano in Los Angeles with {{a group called the}} California Rhythm Rascals. The tune was based around the {{traditional}} song [...] "Shortnin' Bread". It was adopted by dancers performing a dance called the Texas Hop, and Liggins wrote words to fit the tune - [...] "The honeydripper, he's a killer, the honeydripper ... he's a <b>solid</b> gold <b>cat,</b> he's the height of jive ... he's a riffer, the honeydripper." [...] The term [...] "honeydripper" [...] was black slang for a [...] "sweet" [...] guy, and had already been adopted as a nickname by blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Solid</b> color bicolor <b>cats</b> {{occur because}} there is a white {{spotting}} gene present along with a recessive allele of the agouti gene, which evens out the usual striped pattern of the colors of the coat. In contrast, tabby cats have an agouti gene that produces striping of the coat. The Abyssinian has agouti (ticked tabby) fur, giving the appearance of even color with color-banded hairs.|$|R
5000|$|Korats first {{appeared}} in Britain under the name [...] "Blue Siamese" [...] in 1889 and 1896, but these <b>solid</b> blue <b>cats</b> did not conform to the cat show judges' perception of a Siamese cat, and they disappeared by 1901. One early import, [...] "Dwina", owned by Russian Blue breeder Mrs. Constance Carew-Cox and mentioned in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903), reputedly produced {{a large number of}} [...] "Siamese" [...] kittens; the other, Mrs. B. Spearman's Blue Siamese male, [...] "Nam Noi", was disqualified as a Siamese, but accepted in the Russian or Any Other Blue class in which he placed first (WR Hawkins, [...] "Around the Pens" [...] July 1896). Spearman tried unsuccessfully to import more of these [...] "Blue Siamese".|$|R
5000|$|Blue {{eyes are}} rare in mammals; {{one example is}} the {{recently}} discovered marsupial, the blue-eyed spotted cuscus (Spilocuscus wilsoni). The trait is hitherto known only from a single primate other than humans - Sclater's lemur (Eulemur flavifrons) of Madagascar. While some cats and dogs have blue eyes, this is usually due to another mutation that is associated with deafness. But in cats alone, there are four identified gene mutations that produce blue eyes, some of which are associated with congenital neurological disorders. The mutation found in the Siamese cats is associated with strabismus (crossed eyes). The mutation found in blue-eyed <b>solid</b> white <b>cats</b> (where the coat color is caused by the gene for [...] "epistatic white") is linked with deafness. However, there are phenotypically identical, but genotypically different, blue-eyed white cats (where the coat color is caused by the gene for white spotting) where the coat color is not strongly associated with deafness. In the blue-eyed Ojos Azules breed, there may be other neurological defects. Blue-eyed non-white cats of unknown genotype also occur at random in the cat population.|$|R
5000|$|According to the CFA breed profile, [...] "Orientals {{represent}} {{a diverse group}} of cats that have their foundation in the Siamese breed." [...] The Siamese, in both pointed and solid colors, was imported to the UK from Siam (today, Thailand) in the later half of the 1800s, and from there spread widely, becoming {{one of the most popular}} breeds. The gene that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (<b>solid).</b> When the <b>cats</b> from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as [...] "non-blue eyed Siamese" [...] or [...] "foreign shorthair". Other breeds that were developed from the landrace cats of Thailand include the Havana Brown (which some breed registries classify as simply an Oriental Shorthair variant) and the Korat.|$|R
40|$|The APS Survey and Alignment team uses LEICA laser {{trackers}} for {{the majority}} of their alignment tasks. These instruments utilize several different retroreflectors for tracking the path of the laser interferometer. Currently in use are open-air corner cubes with an acceptance angle of {+-} 20 {degree}, corner cube prisms with an acceptance angle of {+-} 50 {degree}, and a Cat's eye with an acceptance angle of {+-} 60 {degree}. Best measurement results can be achieved by using an open-air corner cube that eliminates the need for the laser beam to travel through a different medium before it returns to the instrument detector. However, the trade off is a small acceptance angle. In order to overcome the limitations of the small acceptance angles, Takatsuji et al. has proposed the creation of a full-viewing-angle retroreflector. Based on the notion that the radius R{sub 1 } of a common Cat's eye is proportional to R{sub 2 }, one can write: R{sub 1 } = (n {minus} 1) R{sub 2 }. In the case that n, the refractive index of glass, equals 2, the radii R{sub 1 } and R{sub 2 } are identical, and one can create a <b>solid</b> sphere <b>Cat's</b> eye. This design has the advantages that no adhesives are used to bond the two hemispheres together, misalignments between the hemispheres are not an issue, and most importantly, larger acceptance angles are possible. This paper shows the results of their ray tracing calculations characterizing the geometrical optics...|$|R
5000|$|Spike, however, is {{not without}} a softer and {{sympathetic}} side: in the episode Pet Peeve, after believing that Tom is willing {{to leave the house}} in Spike's favour, Spike feels sorry for him to the point that he offers to leave instead, which Spike does until he realises that Tom is only using reverse psychology to trick him into leaving. In The Truce Hurts, Spike is portrayed as a very intelligent and equilibrated character when he convinces Tom and Jerry to stop the fighting among the three of them and sign a Peace Treaty, but their newfound friendship comes to an end when they argue over how to share a big steak, symbolised when Spike tears the truce contract to shreds and they go back to fighting again after Tom accidentally threw the steak into the sewer drain. From the 1944 cartoon The Bodyguard to 1948 cartoon Heavenly Puss he was voiced by Billy Bletcher. His first name is Bulldog in Dog Trouble, His name also varies in some shorts: in Puttin' On The Dog, <b>Solid</b> Serenade and <b>Cat</b> Fishin' he is named [...] "Killer", and in The Truce Hurts he signs his name [...] "Butch" [...] on the treaty peace paper and his name were Butch or Killer in The Invisible Mouse, He is also a Devil Dog in Heavenly Puss.|$|R
40|$|Hair {{ingested}} by licking during cat grooming {{can eventually}} coalesce into <b>solid</b> masses in <b>cat</b> gastrointestinal tract. It {{is believed that}} dietary fibre might reduce formation of these trichobezoars (hairballs). The effects of two insoluble fibre sources added to kibble diets were evaluated with respect to tricho-bezoar faecal excretion. Thirty-two cats and four diets were used in a randomised block design: a control diet without additional fibre, 10 % added sugar-cane fibre, 20 % added sugarcane fibre or 10 % added cellulose. Animals were fed for 42 d and during three separate periods (days 15 – 17, 25 – 27 and 40 – 42), the cats were housed individually in metabolic cages and their faeces were totally collected. The faeces were evaluated and the trichobezoars were isolated and classified into small ( 2 · 1 cm). Means were evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA and contrasts (P< 0 · 05). Cats fed sugarcane fibre shown a linear reduction of small and medium trichobezoar excretion (number per cat per day; P = 0 · 004) {{as well as a}} reduction in trichobezoar mass excretion (mg per cat per day; P< 0 · 01). The control group showed increased faecal excretion of large trichobezoars (P = 0 · 003), which were not present in the high sugarcane fibre group (P< 0 · 006). No effect of cellulose was observed for any evaluated trait. Therefore, long fibres (sugarcane fibre) may cause greater peristaltic stimulation, increasing the propulsion of hair through the gut, but {{further research is needed to}} validate this mechanism. In conclusion, sugarcane fibre reduced faecal hairball elimination in cats, which may have clinical applications for the prevention of healt...|$|R
