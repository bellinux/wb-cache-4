5000|$|The Nokia N76 is a {{multimedia}} 3G Smartphone made by Nokia. It was introduced at the Las Vegas CES 2007 in January 2007 and was launched on 5 May 2007 with a <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> of 390 <b>EUR.</b> It is advertised as [...] "The computer done beautifully" [...] {{and as a}} [...] "multimedia computer". It is also the slimmest Nseries phone to date, following many trends such as mirrored exterior screen and Motorola RAZR metal keypad. Hardware-wise the N76 bases off a platform by Freescale, being a first of kind in the family of “cheap” 3G smartphones. In fact {{the difference between the}} OMAP2420 and this Freescale CPU, is the lack of a graphics accelerator.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sales</b> <b>Price</b> Variance: The <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> {{variance}} {{reveals the}} difference in total revenue caused by charging a different selling price from the planned or standard <b>price.</b> The <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> variance is calculated as: Actual quantity sold * (actual selling price - planned selling price). In the example, the <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> variance was 6*($2-$3)= -$6 (U)nfavourable or minus $6, since the <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> was less than planned.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> and its proximity to different open spaces types is explored using a data set comprised of single-family home sales {{in the city of}} Portland, within Multnomah County, between 1990 and 1992. Homes located within 1, 500 feet of a natural area park, where more than 50 % of the park is preserved in native and/or natural vegetation, are found to experience, on average, the largest increase in <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> The open space size that maximizes a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> is calculated for each open space type. Natural area parks require the largest acreage to maximize <b>sale</b> <b>price,</b> and specialty parks are found to have the largest potential effect on a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> A zonal approach is used to examine the {{relationship between}} a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> and its distance to an open space. Natural area parks and specialty parks are found to have a positive and statistically significant effect on a home's <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> for each zone studied. Homes located adjacent to golf courses (within 200 feet) are estimated to experience the largest increase in <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> due to open space proximity although the effect drops off quickly as distance from the golf course increases.

50|$|Some {{retailers}} use markups {{because it}} is easier to calculate a <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> from a cost using markups.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{forecast}} demand for existing single-family {{housing in the}} United States. We first find that sales volume (sales) and median <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> (price) have unit roots. We then find that <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> are cointegrated. We develop a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with error correction to further examine the causality between <b>sales</b> and <b>price.</b> We find that there exists a bidirectional causality relationship between <b>sales</b> and <b>price.</b> <b>Price</b> affects <b>sales</b> significantly and <b>sales</b> affects <b>price</b> weakly. With the VAR model we then forecast <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> for existing single-family housing during the period 1991 to 1994 by using a recursive method. We find that our predictions for <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> fit the actual data well...|$|R
40|$|Drawing upon {{an updated}} and {{expanded}} dataset of Energy Star and LEED labeled commercial offices, this paper investigates {{the effect of}} eco-labeling on rental rates, <b>sale</b> <b>prices</b> and occupancy rates. Using OLS and robust regression procedures, hedonic modeling is used to test whether {{the presence of an}} eco-label has a significant positive effect on rental rates, <b>sale</b> <b>prices</b> and occupancy rates. The study suggests that estimated coefficients can be sensitive to outlier treatment. For <b>sale</b> <b>prices</b> and occupancy rates, there are notable differences between estimated coefficients for OLS and robust regressions. The results suggest that both Energy Star and LEED offices obtain rental premiums of approximately 3 %. A 17 % <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> premium is estimated for Energy Star labeled offices but no significant <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> premium is estimated for LEED labeled offices. Surprisingly, no significant occupancy premium is estimated for Energy Star labeled offices and a negative occupancy premium is estimated for LEED labeled offices. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{voluntary}} eco-certification on the rental and <b>sale</b> <b>prices</b> of US commercial office properties. Hedonic and logistic regressions are used to test whether there are rental and <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> premiums for LEED and Energy Star certified buildings. The results of the hedonic analysis {{suggest that there is}} a rental premium of approximately 6 % for LEED and Energy Star certification. A <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> premium of approximately 35 % was found for 127 price observations involving LEED rated buildings and 31 % for 662 buildings involving Energy Star rated buildings. When compared to samples of similar buildings identified by a binomial logistic regression for LEED-certified buildings, the existence of a rent and <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> premium is confirmed albeit with differences regarding the magnitude of the premium. Overall, {{the results of this study}} confirm that LEED and Energy Star buildings exhibit higher rental rates and <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> per square foot controlling for a large number of location- and property-specific factors. ...|$|R
