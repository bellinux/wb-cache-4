6000|$|Let us begin {{then with}} the simple open blue of the sky. This is of course {{the color of the}} pure {{atmospheric}} air, not the aqueous vapor, but the pure azote and oxygen, and it is the total color of the whole mass of that air between us and the void of space. It is modified by the varying quantity of aqueous vapor suspended in it, whose color, in its most imperfect, and therefore most visible, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solution,</b> is pure white, (as in steam,) which receives, like any other white, the warm hues of the rays of the sun, and, according to its quantity and imperfect solution, makes the sky paler, {{and at the same time}} more or less gray, by mixing warm tones with its blue. This gray aqueous vapor, when very decided, becomes mist, and when local, cloud. Hence the sky is to be considered as a transparent blue liquid, in which, at various elevations, clouds are suspended, those clouds being themselves only particular visible spaces of a substance with which the whole mass of this liquid is more or less impregnated. Now, we all know this perfectly well, and yet we so far forget it in practice, that we little notice the constant connection kept up by nature between her blue and her clouds, and we are not offended by the constant habit of the old masters, of considering the blue sky as totally distinct in its nature, and far separated from the vapors which float in it. With them, cloud is cloud, and blue is blue, and no kind of connection between them is ever hinted at. The sky is thought of as a clear, high material dome, the clouds as separate bodies, suspended beneath it, and in consequence, however delicate and exquisitely removed in tone their skies may be, you always look at them, not through them. Now, if there be one characteristic of the sky more valuable or necessary to be rendered than another, it is that which Wordsworth has given in the second book of the Excursion:-- ...|$|E

March refused to explore his conscience; he allowed {{that it might be}} so; but he said he liked now and then to feel his personality in that <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solution.</b> They went and sat a good deal in the softening evenings among the infants and dotards of Latin extraction in Washington Square, safe from all who ever knew them, and enjoyed the advancing season, which thickened the foliage of the trees and flattered out of sight the church warden's Gothic of the University Building. The infants were sometimes cross, and cried in their weary mothers' or little sisters' arms; but they did not disturb the dotards, who slept, some with their heads fallen forward, and some with their heads fallen back; March arbitrarily distinguished those with the drooping faces as tipsy and ashamed to confront the public. The small Italian children raced up and down the asphalt paths, playing American games of tag and hide and-whoop; larger boys passed ball, in training for potential championships. The Marches sat and mused, or quarrelled fitfully about where they should spend the summer, like sparrows, he once said, till the electric lights began to show distinctly among the leaves, and they looked round and found the infants and dotards gone and the benches filled with lovers. That was the signal for the Marches to go home. He said that the spectacle of so much courtship as the eye might take in there at a glance was not, perhaps, oppressive, but the thought that at the same hour the same thing was going on all over the country, wherever two young fools could get together, was more than he could bear; he did not deny that it was natural, and, in a measureuthorized, but he declared that it was hackneyed; {{and the fact that it}} must go on forever, as long as the race lasted, made him tired.|$|E

40|$|Details {{of crystal}} {{growth in the}} calcitostracum of Crassostrea virginica have been studied {{with the purpose of}} {{analyzing}} the formation of the overlapping rows of oriented tabular crystals characteristic of this part of the shell. Crystal elongation, orientation, and dendritic growth suggest the presence of strong concentration gradients in a thin layer of solution in which crystallization occurs. Formation of the overlapping rows can be explained by three processes observed in the shell: a two-dimensional tree-like dendritic growth in which one set of crystal branchings creeps over an adjacent set of branchings; three-dimensional dendritic growth; and growth by dislocation of crystal surfaces. Muhilayers of crystals may thus be formed at one time. This is favored by infrequent secretion of a covering organic matrix which would inhibit crystal growth. The transitional zone covering the outer part of the calcitostracum and the inner part of the prismatic region is generally characterized by aggregates of small crystals with definite orientation. Growth in this zone appears to take place in a relatively homogeneous <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solution</b> without strong concentration gradients.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{synthesis}} of starch macroinitiators for cationic polymer grafted starches that: W are free of cationic homopolymer, and (ii) display {{a high degree of}} conversion of the cationic monomer. We show that this can be achieved by a free-radical polymerization reaction using the cationic monomer N-methaeryloyloxyethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-benzylammonium chloride (XLADAM-BQ) and a new starch-based macroazoinitiator. For this purpose, the acid chloride of 4 -tert-butylazo- 4 -cyanovaleric acid was synthesized and bound covalently to starch (predominantly in the C 6 position) to form a nonsymmetrically substituted macroinitiator that was used to polymerize MADAM-BQ in aqueous media. Essentially no MADAM-BQ homopolymer was formed. The initiator decomposes thermally to starch radicals of high reactivity and low-molar mass radicals that do not initiate polymerization. The reason for the different reactivities of the radicals is presumably due to the nonsymmetric constitution of the starch-bound azo groups. The graft polymerization of MADAM-BQ in aqueous solution performs according to an ideal overall kinetic. The structure of the synthesized starch-graft-poly(MADAM-BQ) products {{is similar to that of}} block copolymers because of the low radical efficiency of the starch initiators in aqueous solution. Especially, starch substrates with a higher content of azo groups did not lead to graft products with shorter graft distances because the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>solution</b> of these macroinitiators becomes worse and aggregation occurs with an increasing degree of substitution...|$|E
