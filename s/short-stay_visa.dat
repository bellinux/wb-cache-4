Subject to a review in 2015, it is proposed to extend the system to all countries by the end of that year. The system will replace the Irish visa waiver programme which currently waives the visa requirement for the nationals of 18 countries if they hold valid UK <b>short-stay</b> <b>visas</b> and enter Ireland directly from the UK.|$|R
50|$|A {{substantial}} and repeated criticism in Poland of US approach to Poland revolves about US refusal to allow Poles a visa-free entry to United States, {{despite the fact}} that most European Union countries - often much less supportive of US on the international scene - have no visa requirements. USA remains the last non-Arab developed country in the World to require <b>short-stay</b> <b>visas</b> from Polish citizens. Polish passport basically allows free movement or easily obtaining a visa for every country in the World, except for the USA - see Visa requirements for Polish citizens. This may have also been a factor in the recent decrease of highly skilled Polish immigrants to the United States.|$|R

40|$|At the EU-Russia St. Petersburg Summit in 2003 {{both parties}} agreed to start {{negotiations}} on agreements {{to simplify the}} procedure for issuing <b>short-stay</b> <b>visas</b> between the EU and Russia with visa-free travel as the ultimate goal. In December 2013, Russia declared all requirements and conditions outlined in the Common Steps to be fulfilled {{and that it is}} ready to move to the next phase, which is the preparing of a draft Visa Waiver Agreement. The EU, on the other hand, doesn’t consider all conditions to be fulfilled and insists on fulfilling all technical requirements before moving to the next phase. Therefore the main question that was posed: are the respective benefits and constraints of the EU and Russia related to visa liberalization mutually exclusive? From this research it became evident that Russia is only willing to fulfil technical requirements set out in the Common Steps document. Russia is less eager to carry out organizational reforms, including reforms in home affairs and law enforcement agencies. For Russia {{it is important not to}} converge to EU’s level of liberal and democratic standards, as Russia does not want to give up its sovereignty and secure its status as a great power...|$|R
40|$|An Irish visa {{is a form}} of {{pre-entry}} clearance {{to travel}} to a point of entry to the State only. Whether or not the visa carries any legitimate expectation of entering the State has been debated in the courts. Ireland and the UK lie outside the Schengen zone and the issuing of both short and long-term visas is a national competence. Within the Schengen zone, the regulation of short-term visas falls within the competence of the EU, while long-term visa policy is set by the Member State. The Schengen <b>short-stay</b> regime concerns <b>visas,</b> issued by a Member State, which allow Third Country Nationals to enter that Member State, or several Member States, for stays not exceeding three months per six-month period. The Irish system is essentially discretionary, whereby the Minister for Justice and Equality 1 decides whether or not to grant applications for visas; exceptions relate to beneficiaries of EU Treaty free movement rights...|$|R

5000|$|Within the European Union, {{residents}} are guaranteed {{the right to}} freely move within the EU's internal borders by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004. Union {{residents are}} given the right to enter any member state {{for up to three}} months with a valid passport or identity card. If the citizen does not have a travel document, the member state must afford them every facility in obtaining the documents. Under no circumstances can an entry or exit visa be required. There are some security limitations and public policy restrictions on extended stays by EU residents. For instance, a member state may require that persons register their presence in the country [...] "within a reasonable and non-discriminatory period of time". In general, however, the burden of notification and justification lies with the state. EU citizens also earn a right to permanent residence in member states they have maintained an uninterrupted five-year period of legal residence. This residency cannot be subject to any conditions, and is lost only by two successive years absence from the host nation. Family members of EU residents, in general, also acquire the same freedom of travel rights as the resident they accompany, though they may be subject to a <b>short-stay</b> <b>visa</b> requirement. Furthermore, no EU citizen may be declared permanently persona non grata within the European Union, or permanently excluded from entry by any member state.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project investigates the governing of Europe’s external border. It analyses how the common Schengen <b>short-stay</b> <b>visa</b> {{policy has been}} applied in practice by member states in the period from 2005 to 2010. So far, little systematic theoretical and empirical research {{has been carried out}} on the implementation of Schengen. The contributions of the thesis are two-fold. Firstly, it makes available a comprehensive and easily accessible database on the visa requirements, issuing-practices and consular representation of EU states in all third countries. It enables researchers to map out and compare how restrictively the visa policy is implemented by different member states and across sending countries. Secondly, the project provides three separate papers that in different ways make use of the database to explore and explain the varying openness of Europe’s border and dynamics of cooperation among member states. The three papers are tied together by a framework conceptualising Schengen as a border regime with two key dimensions: restrictiveness and integration. The first paper asks to what extent, and why, Europe’s border is more open to visitors of some nationalities rather than others. The second paper investigates to what extent, and why, EU states cooperate on sharing consular facilities in the visa-issuing process. The third paper examines to what extent, and why, Schengen participation has a restrictive impact on the visa-issuing practices of member countries. The analyses test existing theories and develop new concepts and models. The three papers engage with rationalist and constructivist theories and seek to assess their relative explanatory power. In doing so, the project makes use of different quantitative comparative approaches. It employs regression analysis, social network analytical tools and quasi-experimental design. Overall, the thesis concludes that Schengen is characterized by extensive cooperation and restrictive practices towards especially visitors from poor, Muslim-majority and refugeeproducing countries...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the European Union has {{struggled}} to increase integration in the sovereignty sensitive areas of justice and home affairs and foreign policy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to enhance our understanding of what patterns of cooperation have been established between the member states, and why. I do so by analysing the case of <b>short-stay</b> <b>visa</b> policy. Visas are a corner stone of EU’s border control, regulating access to the Union’s area of freedom, security and justice. It is moreover an instrument used in foreign and diplomatic relations. As a field where the member states’ cooperation is particularly intense it is an ‘extreme case’ well-suited for drawing out empirical patterns and developing theoretical concepts. The paper is based on a network analytical approach and a new dataset of all the EU/Schengen member states’ mutual consular visa assistance agreements. This I use to document the extent and pattern of cooperation from 2005 to 2010. I show that the member states rely intensively on each other’s consular services. They mainly share sovereignty in four distinct regional clusters – a Nordic, Benelux, Southern European and an emerging Central Eastern. France and Germany are at the centre of the network. To explain this structure of cooperation I discuss the relative merits of realist, liberal intergovernmentalist and constructivist approaches. I show how they each identify important dynamics but emphasise the relative merits of a constructivist perspective. I put forward a new concept of ‘regional imagined communities’ which explains cooperation by the existence of shared identities owing to regional commonalities in language and state-building histories. I argue that the concept improves our understanding of European integration in visa policy, and suggest it might hold wider potential for explaining dynamics of collaboration in other sovereignty sensitive policy areas.
