Rules of succession in western Europe {{at the time were}} uncertain; in some parts of France, male primogeniture, in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was becoming more popular. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor whilst he himself was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear, but {{this was not the case}} in England. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands—usually considered to be the most valuable—and younger sons being given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman <b>successions</b> over the previous sixty years—William the Conqueror had gained England by force, William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested <b>successions.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the tales}} of heroic Greece, royal {{succession}} often passed from father-in-law to son-in-law, and some historians have seen in this an early example of the epikleros pattern. Some examples include Pelops, Bellerophon, Melampus, Peleus, Telamon, and Diomedes. Not all such heroic era royal <b>successions</b> followed the epikleros pattern however, {{as in the case}} of Menelaus, who married Helen of Troy and succeeded Helen's father Tyndareus, even though Tyndareus had living sons, Kastor and Polydeukes.

5|$|The {{ideology}} {{surrounding the}} living king was also {{affected by the}} Osiris myth. The Egyptians envisioned {{the events of the}} Osiris myth as taking place sometime in Egypt's dim prehistory, and Osiris, Horus, and their divine predecessors were included in Egyptian lists of past kings such as the Turin Royal Canon. Horus, as a primeval king and as the personification of kingship, was regarded as the predecessor and exemplar for all Egyptian rulers. His assumption of his father's throne and pious actions to sustain his spirit in the afterlife were the model for all pharaonic <b>successions</b> to emulate. Each new king was believed to renew maat after the death of the preceding king, just as Horus had done. In royal coronations, rituals alluded to Osiris's burial, and hymns celebrated the new king's accession as the equivalent of Horus's own.|$|E
5|$|Norman rule, however, proved unstable; <b>successions</b> to {{the throne}} were contested, leading to violent {{conflicts}} between the claimants and their noble supporters. William II inherited the throne but faced revolts attempting to replace him with his older brother Robert or his cousin Stephen of Aumale. In 1100, William II died while hunting. Despite Robert's rival claims, his younger brother Henry I immediately seized power. War broke out, ending in Robert's defeat at Tinchebrai and his subsequent life imprisonment. Robert's son Clito remained free, however, and formed the focus for fresh revolts {{until his death in}} 1128. Henry's only legitimate son, William, died aboard the White Ship disaster of 1120, sparking a fresh succession crisis: Henry's nephew, Stephen of Blois, claimed the throne in 1135, but this was disputed by the Empress Matilda, Henry's daughter. Civil war broke out across England and Normandy, resulting in a long period of warfare later termed the Anarchy. Matilda's son, Henry, finally agreed to a peace settlement at Winchester and succeeded as king in 1154.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse two Estonian {{databases}} – the <b>Succession</b> Register and the notices of <b>succession</b> proceedings (Pärimisteated) in the public electronic publication Official Announcements – and compare the goals set for the Estonian <b>Succession</b> Register to those set for other registers of wills in EU member states in order to suggest some proposals for future development. The Estonian register of wills (the <b>Succession</b> Register) was established on 1 October 1996 under the first Estonian <b>Succession</b> Law Act, which also provided for the publishing of notices of <b>succession</b> proceedings, an operation that started on 1 January 1997. <b>Succession</b> proceedings conducted by Estonian notaries are readily accessible and observable by all interested persons through the <b>Succession</b> Register and the electronic database of notices of <b>succession</b> proceedings published in Official Announcements. From the data available in the <b>Succession</b> Register, {{it is possible to}} obtain complete information about the <b>succession</b> proceedings: not only data about the testaments and <b>succession</b> contracts entered in it but also information about which notary is conducting the <b>succession</b> proceedings for any given deceased person, information about estate-management measures, and <b>succession</b> certificates.

The Estonian <b>Succession</b> Register belongs to the European Network of Registers of Wills (ENRW or RERT).

5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the oath of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future <b>successions</b> and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing {{that the president should}} set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler was the first to see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E

40|$|Leadership <b>succession,</b> and {{especially}} {{that of the}} CEO, has attracted considerable interest amongst management and social researchers. Most of the {{research has been conducted}} in Western organisations and from specific vantage points such as understanding the financial impact of CEO <b>succession</b> and successor origins. However, there is currently little research on the actual process of leadership <b>succession,</b> {{and especially}} so in the Malaysian context. This research uses qualitative research methods to investigate leadership <b>succession</b> (which in this thesis means both CEO and upper-echelon managerial <b>succession)</b> in Malaysian organisations. The research reveals that most Malaysian companies are not engaged in leadership <b>succession</b> planning and implementation and the few that have such processes report low success rates. The research shows that leadership <b>succession</b> planning and implementation is in its infancy among Malaysian companies. Where upper-echelon manager <b>succession</b> is concerned, companies commonly practise leadership replacement rather than <b>succession.</b> However, with family-controlled publicly listed companies – and such companies constitute the majority of publicly listed companies in Malaysia and in most of Asia – dynastic <b>succession</b> is the predominant form of CEO <b>succession</b> and the CEO’s position is the preserve of members of the founding family. In investigating the factors that either enhance or inhibit leadership <b>succession</b> processes, a form of inhibitor that this thesis calls organisationally generated entrenchment was identified. Organisationally generated entrenchment appears to be common in Malaysian companies and has the effect of stifling smooth leadership <b>succession.</b> This research also shows that leadership <b>succession</b> processes are greatly influenced by cultural factors and that leadership <b>succession</b> models must take into account cultural effects. This thesis offers the <b>Succession</b> Development Pathway model as a means of facilitating leadership <b>succession</b> in organisations in Malaysia...|$|R
