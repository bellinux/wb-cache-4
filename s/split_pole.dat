50|$|It is even {{possible}} {{to arrange the}} inputs so that no pair of poles meets the port condition. However, {{it is possible to}} deal with such a circuit by splitting one or more poles into a number of separate poles joined to the same node. If only one external generator terminal is connected to each pole (whether a <b>split</b> <b>pole</b> or otherwise) then the circuit can again be analysed in terms of ports. The most common arrangement of this type is to designate one pole of an n-pole circuit as the common and split it into n&minus;1 poles. This latter form is especially useful for unbalanced circuit topologies and the resulting circuit has n&minus;1 ports.|$|E

At temperatures where fluorine formation takes place in most astrophysical models, the narrow resonance associated with the 4. 378 MeV level of 19 F is expected to dominate the reaction rate, but its strength is not known. We used a 15 N confined gas target to study this level by means of the transfer reaction 15 N(7 Li,t) 19 F at 28 MeV. Reaction products were analysed with a <b>split</b> <b>pole</b> magnetic spectrometer and the angular distributions for the first 16 levels of 19 F were extracted. These distributions are fairly well reproduced by FR-DWBA calculations in the framework of an γ-cluster transfer model with a compound-nucleus contribution obtained by Hauser-Feshbach calculations. α-spectroscopic factors were deduced and, for unbound levels, the α-widths were determined and compared with the existing direct measurements. The α-width of the level of astrophysical interest (Ex = 4. 378 MeV) was found to be Γα = 1. 5 × 10 - 9 eV, a value 60 times smaller than the commonly used one.

During the report period, the ECR-K 500 Cyclotron Combination operated 4, 377 hours. Of this time, 832 hours was used for beam development, 942 hours was used for tuning and optics, and the beam was available for experiments 2, 603 hours.
