50|$|The {{pedosphere}} lies {{below the}} vegetative {{cover of the}} biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin {{without the aid of}} biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds (dominantly fulvic acids) that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses and seed bearing plants but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once weathering and decomposition products accumulate, a coherent <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile causing ion exchange between solid, fluid and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk geochemistry of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into a new technique for upheaving <b>soil</b> <b>bodies.</b> An example of where this technique can be applied is a road embankment that has settled at a different rate from a bridge because of the weight and properties of the subsoil. The conventional technique for remedying the situation involves closing the road, removing the asphalt and supplementing the underlying material. All this is expensive, time consuming and causes additional traffic jams. The new method under investigation involves upheaving the road embankment by means of expanding tubes. In this technique, tubes of woven material are thrust horizontally into the road embankment, starting at the slope, by means of steel tubes. The steel tubes are then withdrawn while injecting a filling material to expand the woven tubes to a diameter of approximately 800 mm. In the interests of gaining {{a better understanding of the}} upheave mechanism, small scale tests were carried out in the geotechnical centrifuge of the University of Delft. The investigation looked into the magnitude of the upheave relative to the expansion volume and any differences in effect between applying the tubes singly or in groups.

It has been discovered that the distribution of stresses between bottom and side sections of a pile depends on elastic and plastic properties of soils and the pile length-to-diameter ratio. Optimal geometric parameters of a pile can be derived by means of the optimal stress distribution between side and bottom sections of a pile. The problem of interaction between a long pile and the <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> (the half-space) may be reduced to the problem of interaction between the <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> and the cylinder that has limited dimensions, namely, the diameter of and the height of where is the length of a pile.

The analytical contents include the displacement and acceleration of supporting slope, {{as well as the}} time history responses of the axial forces of anchors. In the establishment of finite element model, the interaction between <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> and supporting structure is considered. The elastic-plastic M-C model with nonlinear static and dynamic behavior is used to simulate the <b>soil</b> <b>body,</b> and the dual linear strengthen model is adopted to simulate the supporting structure, then the interaction between <b>soil</b> <b>body</b> and supporting structure is simulated with contact element. The results show that the composite soil nailing slope supporting structure has better seismic performance than the general soil nailing slope supporting structure. The maximum horizontal displacement of the latter occurs at the slope top, but that of the former occurs at the slope upper. Especially after the imposition of the prestress, the slope displacement under earthquake reduces significantly, and the axial forces of anchors under earthquake enlarge significantly. Moreover, the axial forces of anchors reach maximum values near the slipping surface. The displacement and the acceleration of slope increase along the slope height. The conclusions obtained provide basis for the seismic design of permanent supporting slope and reference for similar projects...|$|E
