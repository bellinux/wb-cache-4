5|$|After {{defeating}} Sicumba, Alvarado led {{his army}} to the Indian village of Choloma, {{in the general}} region of Puerto de Caballos. On 27 June 1536, Pedro de Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement, {{with the name of}} Villa de Señor <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> de Puerto Caballos (modern <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into outlying regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish domination, and commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of <b>San</b> <b>Pedro.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1530, {{the colonists}} became the arbiters of power, {{installing}} and deposing governors. Spanish government in Honduras was riven by factionalism. As {{a response to}} the growing anarchy, the colonists requested that Pedro de Alvarado intervene. Alvarado arrived in 1536, {{put an end to the}} political infighting, and gained an important victory over Sicumba, a Maya leader in the Ulúa valley. Alvarado founded two towns that later became important, <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> de Puerto Caballos (later to become <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> Sula) and Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|In 1539, {{the fledgling}} colonial town of Villa de Señor <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> de Puerto Caballos was moved three leagues {{to the south}} and was given the new name of <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> de Puerto Caballos. At this time it {{consisted}} of just twelve palm-thatched houses imitating the native style of construction; in 1541 it had 35 Spanish residents. Montejo also moved Santa María de Comayagua to a more suitable location and assigned 35 conquistadors as its citizens. Rich silver deposits were soon found there.|$|E

5|$|The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors {{decided in}} mid-1916, {{at the urging}} of the Harbor Truck Highway Association (formed mid-1914), to build a Harbor Truck Boulevard {{stretching}} about 10 miles (15km) between Los Angeles and Compton, intended to be used by trucks to the Port of Los Angeles at <b>San</b> <b>Pedro.</b> After that portion was completed, an extension to Wilmington was opened on February 2, 1924, resulting in a completely independent truck route to the port. This roadway, which lay about halfway between Wilmington Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard, extended the existing Alameda Street, which ran alongto Slauson Avenueand then west of the Southern Pacific Railroad's <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> Branch to Oris Street, the north limit of Compton. The truck boulevard continued along the west side to Dominguez Street (lying between the SP's <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> Branch and Pacific Electric Railway's Dominguez Line beyond Dominguez Junction), and crossed there to the east side {{for the rest of the}} route to Anaheim Street in Wilmington. There trucks could turn east and south to Terminal Island via Henry Ford Avenue, or continue southwest through Wilmington to <b>San</b> <b>Pedro.</b> The highway soon came to be known as Alameda Street all the way to Wilmington. It did not become a state highway; instead the state took over Figueroa Street (SR 11) to the west and Atlantic Avenue (SR 15) to the east.|$|E

By November Tzuktok' was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month García once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Ursúa was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the despatch of reinforcements along the Camino Real to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers. An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers met up with García at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the Camino Real towards the <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.|$|E

5|$|Montejo {{then set}} out to pacify the north coast, leaving Xuárez de Ávila {{commanding}} Gracias a Dios. He first went to <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> to present his formal documents of governorship. He was recognised as governor on 16 April, and the following day he annulled all encomiendas issued by Pedro de Alvarado in both the district of <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> and in that of Gracias a Dios; he then re-partitioned the province to his own soldiers and supporters. Montejo then sent Alonso de Reinoso with about a hundred soldiers into the mountains around <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> to put down native resistance. Montejo marched to Naco, where previous campaigns by Cerezeda and Alvarado had left a large indigenous population dispersed from their settlements and hostile to the encroaching Spanish. Victory was rapid, and many native rulers came to swear allegiance to Montejo. They implored him to protect the trade route to Yucatán, and offered their loyalty in return. Montejo accepted their supplications, and considered a large stretch of the north coast to be at last conquered, and under effective Spanish control. He applied the same moderate treatment to the natives that had been so successful around Gracias a Dios, with similar results; many returned to their villages and the encomienda system began to function.|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in <b>San</b> <b>Pedro</b> Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
