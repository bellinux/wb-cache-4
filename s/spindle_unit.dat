40|$|Currently, in Russia ultra-precision {{processing}} of various details (including details with difficult form) is demanded to manufacture innovative products in different spheres of industry. This processing {{can be performed}} using a special high-precision multi-axes machining center. However, such centers are very expensive and their supply to Russia is limited. Therefore, creating a modular principle-based special machine or stand with the minimal number of controlled axes to perform a specific processing is more efficient in many cases. The fewer number of movable components enhances a natural frequency of the machine, and its total stiffness and accuracy as well. The spindle units are used to perform the rotation in machines. The <b>spindle</b> <b>unit</b> characteristics have predominant influence on the machining accuracy and quality. This paper presents {{a model of the}} <b>spindle</b> <b>unit</b> “RTSH 020 ” (made in JSC «VNIIINSTRUMENT») which has two angular contact spherical aerostatic bearings. Design features of that type of <b>spindle</b> <b>unit</b> in comparison with the other aerostatic <b>spindle</b> <b>unit</b> designs allow creation of aerostatic bearings with a smaller gap and air consumption, as well as with a higher stiffness and damping characteristic. An impact-test was executed to determine the frequency, stiffness and coefficient of damping by different forms of a spindle oscillation. The impact impulses were applied to the outer flange of the spindle in different directions with its displacements measured by the high-precision capacitive sensors. It was revealed that an increase of feed pressure increased the stiffness and the oscillation frequency, but a damping coefficient and a decrement were decreased. PC with an analog-to-digital converter performed data records. Data calculations were performed using a fast Fourier transformation and a Prony filtration method. Tests were repeated after changing the air feed pressure to show its effect on the <b>spindle</b> <b>unit</b> characteristics. The test series showed that with increasing feed pressure the spindle stiffness and oscillation frequency increased too, but the damping coefficient and the logarithmic decrement as well decreased. Within the studied range the curves of all these characteristics versus the feed pressure were close to the linear ones. The certain characteristics depending on the feed pressure allow a selection of optimal operation conditions of the <b>spindle</b> <b>unit</b> for various applications.

When the bearing preload was slightly deviated from a standard value, the modal frequency and damping ability also vary to different extent, which further enable the spindle to perform with different compliance. For the spindle used in this study, a standard preload value set on bearings would enable the spindle to behave a higher stiffness as compared with others with a preload variation. This characteristic can be served as a reference to examine the variation of bearing preload of spindle in assemblage or operation. Keywords—Dynamic compliance, Bearing preload, Modal damping...|$|R

Since bearings in high speed <b>spindle</b> <b>units</b> are {{the main source of}} heat generation. Friction in bearings causes an increase of the temperature inside the bearing. If the heat produced cannot be adequately removed from the bearing, the temperature might exceed a certain limit, and as a result the bearing would fail. To analyse the heat flow in a bearing system, a typical ball bearing and its environment has been modelled and analysed using the finite element method. The maximum temperature in the bearing has been calculated as a function of heat generation with the rotational speed as a parameter. The goal of this analysis was to see how fast the temperature changes in the bearing system with respect to rotational speed. and if a given maximum temperature (e. g. maximum temperature of the lubricant or bearing metal) is reached.

The jaw-closer muscle group with all the skeletal attachments intact was fixed in a modified Carnoy solution, decalcified and processed through to wax. Complete series of sections were cut transverse, sagittal and perpendicular to the anterior temporalis muscle. At regular intervals, serial sections were stained by the Weigert-van Gieson method or immunostained for myosin isoforms. Spindle counts were made only from muscle areas where fibres were cut in transverse section, and the spindles were followed individually. The extrafusal fibres were identified by indirect immunoperoxidase staining with antibodies specific for the slow (type I) and fast (type IIM) isoforms of myosin found in jaw-closer muscles. The mean numbers and locations of spindles found were 13 in medial pterygoid (close to inferior border), 123 (one count only) in the deep anterior portion of the temporalis muscle (between the coronoid process of the mandible and the cranium), 50. 5 in a small deep zone of superficial masseter anterior to the temporomandibular joint, and 50 in zygomaticomandibularis (the deepest portion of masseter).

When doing this, we have found that the spindle rotation accuracy can vary drastically with rotational speed. The influence of bearing preload has a secondary importance. Comparison of the results of these studies has demonstrated adequacy of the models developed to the real spindle units...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis is focused on summarisation of {{commonly}} used conceptions of automatic tool change systems, especially focused on milling machines. Special attention is given to the issue of single tool change systems using storage tool magazines. Considering the following construction theme of the thesis, most commonly used <b>spindle</b> clamping <b>units</b> were described. With use of the gathered information was then created the construction draft of the ATC system suitable to be used with a numerically controled milling machine. Solution of the issue consists of the static structural analysis of the clamping unit using the finite element method and design of the belleville springs set. Final output of the draft comprises of drawing documentation of the main parts of the system...|$|R
40|$|A finite {{elements}} method (FEM) -analysis {{has been carried}} out with the purpose to study dynamics of carrying system in a machine tool of unique height. This is a one-off machine with high traveling column and a support with horizontal slide can move vertically along the column. Spindle milling and boring units are mounted telescopically at slide butt end. The FEM-analysis of the machine tool has been made due to its renovation. Machine resonances, responses to cutting force, static and dynamic rigidity in spindles have been estimated in the paper. The machine carrying system is subtle, heavy and structurally complicated. Its structural chain includes a carriage, a column, a support, a slide, <b>spindle</b> <b>units</b> interconnected with the help of hydro-static guides. While varying main parameters their influence on rigidity has been investigated in the paper. Height of  support lifting, column material and rigidity of longitudinal drive have been changed during the investigations. Static, modal and harmonic MEF-analyses have been executed in the paper. Frequency-response characteristic of the machine has been constructed in the process of the investigations. Two support bending resonances have been detected in the column at low frequency. Such Due to this there are limits for usage of the machine in sub-resonance and static frequency range. The most powerful resonance has been observed at frequency of 27. 8 Hz. The resonance has manifested itself as torsional oscillations of the column together with the support and the slide. Slide bending resonances have been revealed at higher frequencies 65 – 105 Hz. Three intervals which are fit for machine operation have been determined between resonance ranges. There is a prospective usage of the machine in inter-resonance (32 – 65 Hz) and super-resonance (more than 105 Hz) intervals. It has been shown that rigidity in spindle is a sequence higher in dynamic intervals than in a static interval. Machine subtility can be compensated by its transition to high-speed machining. </p...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} cutting speeds and depths of modern milling {{machines}} vibrations are generated within the whole machine structure. These vibrations lead to a poor machined surface and an additional load for all machine components. Within the collaborative research centre 368 “Autonomous Production Cells”, IFAS {{is involved in the}} development of an active <b>spindle</b> bearing <b>unit</b> which is capable of damping vibration without reducing milling efficiency [7]. The special layout of the “three cavity ring ” results in a high dynamic and stiffness, little need for space and a possible displacement of five tenth of a millimetre. A zero-leakage design is very important for the performance of the actuator. Reducing the leakage of the actuator will increase the dynamic and stiffness of the drive. Using a micro controller for controlling the bearing unit leads to a decentralised system with local intelligence, that can be integrated into a milling machine...|$|R
