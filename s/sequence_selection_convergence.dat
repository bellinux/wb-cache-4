We show the following: (1) for the closed unit interval I, Cp(I) {{does not have the}} weak <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> property; (2) if X is a QN-space, then Cp(X) is an α 1 -space. These results answer problems posed by M. Scheepers. Also we give characterizations of the α 1 -property, the α 2 -property (i. e. the <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> property) and the weak <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> property of Cp(X) in terms of covering properties of X...|$|R

40|$|A new (to our knowledge) de novo design {{framework}} with {{a ranking}} metric based on approximate binding affinity calculations is introduced {{and applied to}} the discovery of what we believe are novel HIV- 1 entry inhibitors. The framework consists of two stages: a <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> stage and a validation stage. The <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> stage produces a rank-ordered list of amino-acid sequences by solving an integer programming <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> model. The validation stage consists of fold specificity and approximate binding affinity calculations. The designed peptidic inhibitors are 12 -amino-acids-long and target the hydrophobic core of gp 41. A number of the best-predicted sequences were synthesized and their inhibition of HIV- 1 was tested in cell culture. All peptides examined showed inhibitory activity when compared with no drug present, and the novel peptide sequences outperformed the native template sequence used for the design. The best sequence showed micromolar inhibition, which is a 3 – 15 -fold improvement over the native sequence, depending on the donor. In addition, the best sequence equally inhibited wild-type and Enfuvirtide-resistant virus strains...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Various {{multiple}} sequence alignment-based {{methods have}} been proposed to detect functional surfaces in proteins, such as active sites or protein interfaces. The effect that the choice of sequences has on the conclusions of such analysis has seldom been discussed. In particular, no method has been {{discussed in terms of}} its ability to optimize the <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> for the reliable detection of functional surfaces. Results: Here we propose, for the case of proteins with known struc-ture, a heuristic Metropolis Monte Carlo strategy to select sequences from a large set of homologues, in order to improve detection of func-tional surfaces. The quantity guiding the optimization is the clustering of residueswhichareunder increasedevolutionarypressure, according to the sample of sequences under consideration.

40|$|Backgound: Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of the cubic lattice protein model with engineered sequences were performed {{in order to}} address the issue of potential accuracy required for folding. The potential used for <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> played the role of the ‘real’ potential and different levels of inaccuracy were introduced by addition of noise. ResultsThe dependence of successful folding probability on potential noise was found to be sigmoidal and sequence-specific and can be described by an expression analytically derived from a simple theoretical model in which the density of states of the system contains a continuous region approximated by a Gaussian distribution separated from the unique native conformation by a large energy gap. ConclusionThe decrease in folding probability with potential inaccuracy results from an average decrease in the energy gap. Sequences with large energy gaps support larger inaccuracies while retaining the ability to fold properly. As the energy gap is known to correlate with thermal stability, we suggest a simple criterion for specific real <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> in order to maximize success probability in realistic folding simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{computing}} optimal routes poses new challenges when extending it to larger multi-domain network scenarios, as {{the quality of}} these computed endto-end inter-domain routes depends on {{the selection of the}} domain sequence to be traversed. In the scope of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Path Computation Element (PCE) Working Group has not provided definitive solutions to address the domain <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> problem, being still a work in progress. To this goal, the Path Computation Flooding (PCF) approach appears as a possible extension to Backward Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) to calculate optimal end-to-end inter-domain paths without requiring a pre-configured domain sequence. Nonetheless, PCF presents major scalability issues in terms of network control overhead and path computation complexity, thus pleading for more accurate domain <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> techniques. This paper describes two novel mechanisms to establish inter-domain paths calculating the sequence of domains to be crossed when it is not known in advance. Both procedures make a good trade-off between the control overhead introduced and the accuracy of the computed end-to-end route. The obtained simulation results show the benefits of the proposed contributions, drastically reducing the control overhead while keeping the connection blocking probability close to the optimal values.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of Monte Carlo estimation, practitioners are turning to biased Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures that trade off asymptotic exactness for computational speed. The reasoning is sound: a reduction in variance due to more rapid sampling can outweigh the bias introduced. However, the inexactness creates new challenges for sampler and parameter selection, since standard mea-sures of sample quality like effective sample size do not account for asymptotic bias. To address these challenges, we introduce a new computable quality measure based on Stein’s method that bounds the discrepancy between sample and target expectations over a large class of test functions. We use our tool to compare exact, biased, and deterministic sample sequences and illustrate applications to hyper-parameter <b>selection,</b> <b>convergence</b> rate assessment, and quantifying bias-variance tradeoffs in posterior inference. ...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{functional}} sites control most {{biological processes}} and are important targets for drug design and protein engineering. To characterize them, the evolutionary trace (ET) ranks {{the relative importance}} of residues according to their evolutionary variations. Generally, top-ranked residues cluster spatially to define evolutionary hotspots that predict functional sites in structures. Here, various functions that measure the physical continuity of ET ranks among neighboring residues in the structure, or in the sequence, are shown to inform <b>sequence</b> <b>selection</b> and to improve functional site resolution. This is shown first, in 110 proteins, for which the overlap between top-ranked residues and actual functional sites rose by 8 % in significance. Then, on a structural proteomic scale, optimized ET led to better 3 D structure-function motifs (3 D templates) and, in turn, to enzyme function prediction by the Evolutionary Trace Annotation (ETA) method with better sensitivity of (40 % to 53 %) and positive predictive value (93 % to 94 %). This suggests that the similarity of evolutionary importance among neighboring residues in the sequence and in the structure is a universal feature of protein evolution. In practice, this yields a tool for optimizing <b>sequence</b> <b>selections</b> for comparative analysis and, via ET, for better predictions of functional site and function. This should prove useful for the efficient mutational redesign of protein function and for pharmaceutical targeting...|$|R
