5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. <b>She</b> <b>speaks</b> of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
