40|$|AbstractFailure in anisotropic/isotropic bi-materials {{starts at}} the interface, and the {{interfacial}} failure is of interest to some engineering fields. However, since the procedure for evaluating <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> at the interface corner is very complicated and time-consuming, few researchers have used it to calculate singular stress fields and <b>stress</b> <b>intensities,</b> though doing so would allow prediction of the failure strength of a structure. In this paper, a simple procedure for obtaining <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> is introduced in the estimation of the failure strength of anisotropic/isotropic bi-materials. The expanded Stroh formalism is used to obtain asymptotic stress and displacement fields near the anisotropic/isotropic bi-material interface corner. The procedure {{makes it possible to}} calculate singular stress fields more easily than before. To evaluate <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> at the interface corner, a path-independent conservative line integral derived from Betti’s reciprocal principle is used. To present {{a detailed description of the}} procedure, we describe the procedure of calculating singular stress fields and <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> of co-cured double lap joints with a wedge that consists of carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite and steel adherends. We found two singular terms in describing stress and displacement fields near the wedge tip, and each of them referred to a different deformation mode: mode I and II. Therefore, we needed both mode I and II <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> to predict the joint failure. Failure surfaces and interfaces of double lap joints were investigated, and a fracture criterion on the KIn-KIIn plane is presented...|$|R

One-year old plants displayed contrasting physiological strategies {{to cope with}} water stress. Algeria exhibited a higher decrease in osmotic potential (psi s) in relation to stress-induced proline accumulation. Glycinebetaine accumulated in response to drought in response to permanent stress (Algeria) or cyclic stress (Tunisia). The two populations had similar net photosynthesis (A) but Algeria exhibited higher water use efficiency (WUE) than Tunisia. A drought-induced increase in the apoplastic water content (AWC) was noticed in response to mild <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> (S 1 and S 11) in Tunisia {{and in response to}} higher <b>stress</b> <b>intensities</b> (S 2 and S 22) in Algeria in relation to a stress-induced accumulation of pectin and proportion of arabinose within the pectic fraction. Bulk modulus of elasticity (E) increased in Tunisia in response to permanent drought and in Algeria in response to cyclic stress, {{as a result of a}} stress-induced increase in cellulose (Algeria) or hemicellulose (Tunisia). It is concluded that water stress tolerance could be achieved by both osmotic and elastic adjustment in the coastal population which did not exhibit a prodigal water use comparatively to the inland population.
