50|$|Those {{who have}} loose ligaments {{in the legs}} and feet often mistakenly assume that they have flat feet. While their feet have an arch when not <b>supporting</b> <b>weight,</b> when stood upon, the arch will flatten. This is because the loose ligaments cannot support the arch {{in the way that}} they should. This can make walking and {{standing}} painful and tiring.Pain will usually occur in the feet and lower legs, but can also spread to the back due to abnormal standing and walking habits. Wearing shoes that have good arch support can help minimize the discomfort. The underlying problem, however, is not solved by wearing shoes with arch supports or worsened by wearing shoes without arch support. There is currently no cure for the condition.|$|E

40|$|Algorithms {{based on}} the {{adaptive}} <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> strategy currently represent the state-of-the-art in local stereo matching. Unfortunately, their good-quality results come {{at the price of}} high computation times: As opposed to standard local algorithms, incremental computation via sliding windows is not applicable for adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> windows. This paper presents a method for considerably speeding up computation times of these methods. The key idea is to exploit the adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> windows for generating an explicit over-segmentation of the reference image in a fast way. Having this explicit segmentation, we can take advantage of a modified “segmentation-based ” sliding window technique, which makes run time independent of the window size. In particular, we demonstrate our transformation scheme for the geodesic stereo matcher of [11] that has recently produced excellent results. Our unoptimized GPU-based implementation processes 320 × 240 pixel images with 26 allowed disparities at 10 frames per second and achieves rank 32 out of 74 methods in the Middlebury online benchmark. 1...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> {{algorithms}} {{represent the}} state-ofthe-art in local stereo matching. Their limitation {{is a high}} computational demand, which makes them unattractive for many (real-time) applications. To our knowledge, the algorithm proposed in this paper is the first local method which is both fast (real-time) and produces results comparable to global algorithms. A key insight is that the aggregation step of adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> algorithms is equivalent to smoothing the stereo cost volume with an edge-preserving filter. From this perspective, the original adaptive <b>support</b> <b>weight</b> algorithm [1] applies bilateral filtering on cost volume slices, {{and the reason for}} its poor computational behavior is that bilateral filtering is a relatively slow process. We suggest to use the recently proposed guided filter [2] to overcome this limitation. Analogously to the bilateral filter, this filter has edgepreserving properties, but can be implemented in a very fast way, which makes our stereo algorithm independent {{of the size of the}} match window. The GPU implementation of our stereo algorithm can process stereo images with a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels and a disparity range of 26 pixels at 25 fps. According to the Middlebury on-line ranking, our algorithm achieves rank 14 out of over 100 submissions and is not only the best performing local stereo matching method, but also the best performing real-time method.

40|$|<b>Supporting</b> <b>weight</b> on {{the upper}} support of {{crutches}} is not recommended because {{it can lead to}} axillary nerve damage. Despite this warning, improper axillary loadings may still occur {{because of a lack of}} arm strength or fatigue. It is generally accepted that improper use of conventional axillary crutches contributes to axillary nerve damage, but surprisingly there are no studies characterizing axillary support/underarm configurations. In this study, we compared traditional and horizontal axillary support designs by measuring various biomechanical parameters on the axillary support during a swing-through gait while <b>supporting</b> <b>weight</b> on the axillary support. Subjects found the axillary support that remains horizontal to be more comfortable than the axillary support of axillary crutches. The higher perceived comfort may be attributed to the lower force and contact area, both average and maximum, developed on the horizontal axillary support and/or shorter excursion of the position of the center of force during a stride. These findings suggest that avoiding all weight bearing on the axillary support may be an overly conservative recommendation for supports that remain horizontal. Individuals with insufficient arm strength may benefit by considering this type of support, but because further study is needed, a physical therapist should be consulted...|$|E

40|$|Local stereo {{matching}} has recently experienced large progress by {{the introduction of}} new support aggregation schemes. These approaches estimate a pixel’s support region via color segmentation. Our contribution lies in an improved method for accomplishing this segmentation. Inside a square support window, we compute the geodesic distance from all pixels to the window’s center pixel. Pixels of low geodesic distance are given high <b>support</b> <b>weights</b> and therefore large influence in the matching process. In contrast to previous work, we enforce connectivity by using the geodesic distance transform. For obtaining a high <b>support</b> <b>weight,</b> a pixel must have a path to the center point along which the color does not change significantly. This connectivity property leads to improved segmentation results and consequently to improved disparity maps. The success of our geodesic approach is demonstrated on the Middlebury images. According to the Middlebury benchmark, the proposed algorithm is the top performer among local stereo methods at the current state-of-the-art.

40|$|Diabesity’, the comorbid {{occurrence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 DM) with obesity, is increasing rapidly in the UK, and becoming more prevalent in younger age groups. The onset of diabetes increases risk of macro- and microvascular complications, reduced life expectancy, and decreased economic productivity and quality of life.

Management of obesity can improve diabetes control, but weight loss is often slower than in those without diabetes.

To {{develop a}} program to support {{behaviour}} changes for women {{with a history of}} Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and a Body Mass Index (BMI) > 25 [*]kg/m 2 to delay or prevent Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Methods. Women diagnosed with GDM in the previous 6 to 24 months and BMI > 25 kg/m 2 were randomized to an intervention (I) (n= 16) or a control (C) (n= 15) group. The intervention was a pedometer program combined with nutrition coaching, with the primary outcome increased weight loss in the intervention group. Secondary outcomes included decreased waist and hip measurements, improved insulin sensitivity and body composition, increased physical activity, and improved self-efficacy in eating behaviours.

40|$|Objectives: The {{conditions}} under which planning for behaviour change is most effective are not fully understood. In {{the context of a}} weight management intervention, we examined the interrelationship between plan specificity, type of behaviour planned (diet vs. exercise) and weight loss goals.   Design: Prospective design and content analysis of plans formed by participants of a 10 -week weight management programme.   Methods: Participants (n= 239) formulated two plans, for dietary and exercise behaviours respectively. Plans were rated for specificity by examining the number of plan components. Weight loss goals were assessed by asking how much weight participants intend to lose. Weight was measured objectively each of the 10 weeks. Changes in BMI over time and the interactions between plan specificity, and weight loss goals, for all plans and separately for diet and exercise, were estimated using linear mixed models.   Results: Plan specificity was unrelated to weight loss, but interacted with weight loss goals in predicting linear change in BMI (t= - 2. 48) : More specific plans were associated with higher decreases in weight in participants with high weight loss goals. Separate interaction tests for plans formulated for diet and exercise change showed that more specific dietary plans, but not exercise ones, were associated with higher decreases in weight in participants with high weight loss goals (t= - 2. 21).   Conclusions: Within a population that is highly motivated to lose weight, the combination of high weight loss goals and formulating detailed plans for changing dietary behaviours may be most effective in <b>supporting</b> <b>weight</b> loss...|$|E

Although {{families}} {{play a critical role}} in psychiatric illness management among adults with SMI, their contributions to improving health outcomes in this population has received little attention. This study explored family involvement in medical care for older adults with SMI. METHODS: This mixed methods study involved analysis of quantitative data collected from older adults with SMI and cardiovascular risk (n = 28) participating in a pilot study of an intervention designed to improve patient-centered primary care augmented by qualitative interviews with their relatives (n = 13) to explore family involvement in medical care. RESULTS: Approximately 89 % of older adults with SMI reported family involvement in at least one aspect of their medical care (e. g., medication reminders, medical decision making). However, many family members reported that they were rarely involved in their relative's medical visits, and most did not perceive a need to be involved during routine care. Family members identified obesity as their relative's primary health concern and many wanted guidance from providers on effective strategies for <b>supporting</b> <b>weight</b> loss. CONCLUSIONS: Although many family members did not perceive a need to be involved in their relative's routine medical visits, they expressed interest in talking with providers about how to help their relative change unhealthy behaviors.
