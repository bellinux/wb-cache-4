40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of a Modelling and Simulation (M&S) Testbed Framework that has been proposed to facilitate research activities in sensor technology, fusion and decision support. The framework facilitates research activities through the creation and sharing of common resources like scenario generators, simulation engines, sensor/target models and visualisation tools. With this framework, common resources can be reused in a “plug and play ” manner and to facilitate the development of larger demonstrators. Two research institutes collaborated in the development of this framework, which consists of a suite of modular components and a <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> between them. The simulation testbed was successfully tested using a common scenario and fusion federates for tracking and classification of targets. The fusion federates consist of ground sensor networks (or network of fusion nodes using ground sensors) built independently from the two research institutes...|$|E
40|$|Input {{and output}} (I/O) of {{simulation}} data {{is an important}} aspect in high performance computing (HPC). Especially in high resolution numerical simulations over large domains {{with a high degree}} of distributed memory parallelisation I/O becomes a limiting factor. In the last years computational throughput of HPC systems increased, opening the ability to operate numerical weather and climate models with increasingly finer resolutions. This results in increasing amounts of data output from the model system. From the user's perspective the problems arise, where to store and archive these data, and which tools to use for subsequent post-processing. Transferring large data between different systems and subsequent processing require additional I/O operations, repeatedly hitting the I/O bottleneck and also memory limits of the computing system, if postprocessing is performed serially. One way to deal with I/O limitations is reducing the amount of output data by coarse-graining, although this may abandon advantages previously gained through the finer resolved simulations in subsequent processing. In contrast, on-line diagnostic tools use the fully resolved data, perform data reduction, and enable advanced diagnostics, which are not applicable off-line. We introduce a general and <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> to include sophisticated on-line diagnostic tools into the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) modelling framework based on the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). We present results of a novel complex on-line diagnostic tool calculating joint-PDFs on a coarse regular grid from high-resolution simulations. This also includes runtime analyses to evaluate additional computational costs from the on-line diagnostic and from the diagnostic interface itself. Furthermore, we give an overview of diagnostic tools, which were implemented or are currently under development using the diagnostic interface. We also present an outlook of future projects with enhanced on-line diagnostics. The presented work helps to overcome some of the limitations, which occur when going to even higher resolutions. The <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> and the on-line diagnostics will provide helpful and sophisticated tools for process oriented analyses of high resolution simulations, and will help to reduce the user's burden of handling large data from high resolution simulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{standardisation}} of interfaces {{in product}} architectures helps complementary products develop when network externalities are present.

In this paper, we analyse different types and levels of knowledge that underpin a product. We apply this analysis to understanding how Nokia and Ericsson maintained their competitive positions during the Global System for Mobile (GSM) -dominated phase of the industry, even though they were instrumental in developing GSM as an entirely open standard.

40|$|Abstract. Research in the RoboCup domain {{has grown}} {{considerably}} {{since the beginning}} of this initiative more than ten years ago. Much of this growth is due to the existence of different leagues, that allow the focussing of research in specific and heterogeneous issues. This specialisation of research has, though, proven to have some drawbacks: research subjects become very specific, and one loses the ability of properly generalising, and sharing, the obtained results. This paper presents an architecture that aims at being open, enabling the development of independent components that can easily be ported between application environments. This architecture, called Common Framework, relies on <b>standardised</b> <b>interfaces,</b> protocols and communication channels between components. Besides allowing the free association of heterogeneous components, like real and simulated back-ends, it also considerably eases the introduction of principles of redundancy and fault tolerance. ...|$|R

Like other middleware, some JMS {{implementations}} use clustering techniques {{to provide some}} level of performance and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyse the efficiency of various clustering policies in a real-life cluster and the key parameters impacting the performances of MOMs. We show that the resource efficiency of the clustering methods can be very poor due to local instabilities and/or global load variations. To solve these issues, we describe the rules that control these parameters for optimal performances and propose a solution based on autonomic computing to (1) dynamically adapt the load distribution among the servers (load-balancing aspect) and (2) dynamically adapt the replication level (provisioning aspect). We present an evaluation that shows {{the impact of these}} rules on the performances and behaviour of the dynamic provisioning of replicated queues...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Classic {{building}} automation systems have shown that networks of seamlessly integrated devices add true user value to commercial as well as residential building environ-ments. They may positively influence factors such as energy efficiency, flexibility, security and comfort. But these benefits are not convincing enough, if the handling of such networks is complex and acquisition and engineering costs are high. Ideally, the integration of a new device happens without any effort spent on commissioning. Once integrated, devices and services must be easy to use for different users.

It offers plug and play capabilities and comes up with a <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> to control devices.

40|$|The use of web {{technology}} within organisational Intranets is increasing. The {{combination of}} a <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> and the security features provided by TLS have made web technology very attractive. The TLS technology however has some limitations, especially in its lack of access control functionality. This paper focusses on alternatives to provide improved security services to web based applications. The SESAME security architecture is shown to provide all of the TLS security services, {{with the addition of}} other services such as the access control service. Also because SESAME uses the connection based GSS-API which is the same paradigm used by TLS, it is shown to be a suitable replacement. Unfortunately because web servers and web browsers do not provide hooks for replacing the TLS security technology, SESAME is not easily used. Two alternatives are therefore considered that overcome this limitation: a new proposal before the IETF of extending TLS to carry attribute certificates and [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Reconfigurable {{logic is}} known to have the {{potential}} to provide better solutions than direct ASIC implementations or processors in some situations. A necessary prerequisite for area advantages compared to ASICs or a better energy efficiency than processors is an application specific design of the reconfigurable unit. Adapting it to the specific requirements of an application helps to compensate for the area and speed penalty introduced by reconfigurability. The data paths of reconfigurable units are best suited for data flow oriented tasks, but for many applications, both control flow and data flow must be handled, so a integration of the reconfigurable unit into a processor environment is an appropriate choice. By analysing the existing design flow and integration possibilities for reconfigurable units, a basis for discussing possible automation schemes and a <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> is defined. Possible future research could investigate an automated design support for the building blocks of reconfigurable units and the definition of a standard processor interface for some classes of reconfigurable units...|$|E
40|$|The {{heart of}} the control system {{implementation}} of the light source ANKA is an object model of devices. It is the Accelerator Control Interface (ACI), a language independent collection of interfaces based on network distributed objects using the CORBA standard. All common accelerator components such as power supplies, vacuum, RF, position and current monitors are defined by means of functions and parameters. The devices are described according to CORBA with the Interface Definition Language (IDL), which presents a language-independent way of defining object interfaces. Each controlled parameter, called device property, is an object by itself, implementing atomic actions such as get/set, increment/decrement, etc. All constants related to a property such as min/max, name, description, etc. are obtained from the property directly by means of remote methods- no direct database access is necessary. Values of the properties are updated asynchronously by means of monitor objects. The ACI {{is meant to be}} a <b>standardised</b> <b>interface</b> so that applications and pieces of control systems can be hooked to it from either side. The ACI does not replace existing control system architectures and frameworks but rather tries to use their features in order to be as compatible as possible to those systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{consistency}} {{between a}} specification and its implementation {{is an important}} part of software development In previous work, we have presented a method and tool support for testing a formal specification using animation and then verifying an implementation of that specification. The method is based on a testgraph, which provides a partial model of the application under test. The testgraph is used in combination with an animator to generate test sequences for testing the formal specification. The same testgraph is used during testing to execute those same sequences on the implementation and to ensure that the implementation conforms to the specification. So far, the method and its tool support have been applied to software components that can be accessed through an application programmer interface (API). In this paper, we use an industrially-based case study to discuss the problems associated with applying the method to a software system with a graphical user interface (GUI). In particular, the lack of a <b>standardised</b> <b>interface,</b> as well as controllability and observability problems, make it difficult to automate the testing of the implementation. The method can still be applied, but the amount of testing that can be carried on the implementation is limited by the manual effort involved...|$|E
