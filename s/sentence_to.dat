5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a narrator, {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene.

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 1997–98 season, he had become a regular in the Manchester United reserve team and made his senior debut on 25 October 1997, when he came on as a 64th-minute {{substitute}} for Gary Pallister in the 7–0 home win against Barnsley. Later that season, Wallwork was loaned out twice: firstly to Carlisle United, where he scored his first goal in professional football, and then to Stockport County. He joined Royal Antwerp on loan during the following season and helped them to reach the play-offs, but their hopes of promotion to the First Division were ended by a defeat to La Louvière. After the match, Wallwork grabbed referee Amand Ancion by the throat, for which he was banned from football for life. Another Manchester United loanee, Danny Higginbotham, was banned for a year for his part in the attack. A Belgian court reduced Wallwork's <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> a three-year suspension, of which two years were probational, while Higginbotham's ban was reduced to four months. The remaining twelve months of Wallwork's ban applied only in Belgium, rather than the worldwide ban given under the initial ruling.|$|E

Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he thought {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life <b>sentence</b> <b>to</b> make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
