5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, <b>stationary</b> <b>target.</b> However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral Spiridov {{class were}} {{a pair of}} {{monitors}} built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s. The sister ships {{were assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for their entire careers. Aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding, their careers were uneventful. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900. The Admiral Spiridovs were stricken from the Navy List in 1907; one ship became a <b>stationary</b> <b>target</b> and the other a coal-storage barge. Their ultimate fates are unknown.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the oldest}} archaeological {{examples}} of guns in Europe, {{there are two}} pieces from Sweden, the Loshult gun, and lesser known Morko gun. Possibly Europe's oldest extant firearm, the Loshult gun is a cast-bronze gun {{in the shape of}} a vase discovered in 1861 and named after the Swedish parish where the farmer dug it up. It is generally dated to around the mid 14th century and measures 31cm overall, at a weight of 9 kilograms; the bore at the muzzle is 36mm narrowing down to 31mm on its way to the rear. A replica made by scholars has performed well shooting both arrows and other projectiles such as lead balls, grapeshot, and pieces of flint. The arrows and lead balls proved capable of penetrating late medieval plate armor as well as hitting a <b>stationary</b> <b>target</b> 200 meters away. However scholars believe the gun was primarily used for short range engagements because of the deep ruts and scratches in the barrel, which suggests that it carried shrapnel, an inaccurate but deadly projectile. It is now preserved in the Statens Historiska Museet Stockholm, inv.-no. 2891. The Morko gun was found by a fisherman in the Baltic Sea at the coast of Södermansland near Nynäs before 1828 and dates to around the same period as the Loshult gun, ca. 1390. In Germany the oldest gun is the Tannenberg handgonne discovered in 1849 at the bottom of a water well of the 1399 destroyed Tannenberg castle in Hessen. It was found with a lead ball still loaded, and its wooden staff nearby, which started decaying after being exposed to air. The gun was aimed using the wooden staff, which fit into the back socket of the gun. References to gunnis cum telar (guns with handles) were recorded in 1350 and by 1411 it was recorded that John the Good, Duke of Burgundy, had 4000 handguns stored in his armory.|$|E

500|$|After Zieten entered {{service in}} June 1877, Diederichs was {{replaced}} by Alfred von Tirpitz, who took over torpedo testing while {{he was assigned to}} the Torpedo School at Kiel. Diederichs meanwhile readied the old gunboat [...] as a tender for Zieten. On 18 September, Zieten and Scorpion participated in the first major test of the new Whitehead torpedoes in the German navy. During the exercises, Zieten scored three hits on a <b>stationary</b> <b>target,</b> which was deemed a great success. After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Zieten was placed in reserve on 2 October for the winter. The analysis of the testing showed that the bow-mounted torpedo tube was not satisfactory, and so Diederichs was tasked with redesigning her armament in January 1878. Diederichs moved the bow tube to a swivel mount on her deck, and added two 12cm guns to improve her defense against small warships.|$|E

500|$|Tegetthoff {{took his}} fleet {{through the gap}} between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. San Martino {{initially}} engaged the unarmored ships of the Austrian 2nd Division, but as Re d'Italia became embroiled in the ensuing melee, San Martinos captain attempted {{to come to her}} aid, though the ship was unable to prevent the Austrian flagship, , from ramming and sinking her. Tegetthoff immediately ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the men in the water, but with San Martino fast approaching, he could not leave his ship a <b>stationary</b> <b>target.</b> He instead ordered the small aviso [...] to pick up the Italian survivors, but she too came under fire and was forced to abandon the effort.|$|E
500|$|From a {{meteorological}} {{and safety}} standpoint, the tornado also brought {{the use of}} highway overpasses as shelters into question. Prior to the events on May 3, 1999, videos of people taking shelter in overpasses during tornadoes in the past (most notably one filmed near Wichita, Kansas, during the April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak involving a television news crew from Wichita NBC affiliate KSNW and other bystanders) gave the public misunderstanding that overpasses provided shelter from tornadoes. For nearly 20 years, meteorologists had questioned the safety of these structures; they lacked incidents involving loss of life, however. During the May 3 outbreak, three overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, with a fatality taking place at each one. Two of these were from the F5 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado while the third was from a small F2, which struck a rural area in Payne County, north-northeast of Oklahoma City. According {{to a study by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking shelter in an overpass [...] "is to become a <b>stationary</b> <b>target</b> for flying debris." ...|$|E
500|$|While he was forming up his ships, Persano {{transferred}} from his flagship, [...] to the turret ship [...] This created {{a gap in}} the Italian line, and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt. During the second attempt, Austrian gunfire had disabled Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her incapable of maneuvering. Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to ram the Italian vessel, and ordered his ship to maximum speed. After two collisions that occurred at angles too oblique to inflict serious damage, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max struck the ship more directly. The Austrian ship's ram tore a gaping hole in Re d'Italias hull on the port side, though Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sustained no significant damage herself. Tegetthoff reversed course, allowing the Italian ironclad to lurch back to port and quickly sink. Tegetthoff initially ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the Italians struggling in the water, but the Italian ironclad [...] was approaching, and he could not allow his ship to become a <b>stationary</b> <b>target.</b> Instead, he ordered the aviso [...] to remain behind and pick up the survivors while Erzherzog Ferdinand Max engaged San Martino. The other Italian ships, however, did not realize Kaiserin Elizabeth was attempting to pick up the Italian survivors, and so opened fire on her, driving her away from the men in the water.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major threat}} to the Il-2 was German ground fire. In postwar interviews, Il-2 pilots {{reported}} 20mm (0.79in) and 37mm (1.46in) artillery as the primary threat. [...] While the fabled 88mm (3.46in) calibre gun was formidable, low-flying Il-2s presented too fast-moving a target for the 88's relatively low rate of fire, only occasional hits were scored. Similarly the attempts in Finland during summer '44 to augment the small numbers of 20/40mm AA in the field army by heavier 76mm guns drawn from homeland defence proved also relatively ineffective and few Il-2s were downed despite attempting different tactics with time-fused fragmentation, contact-fused, and shrapnel ammunition: the heavy guns simply lacked the reaction times {{to take advantage of}} the brief firing opportunities presented by the low-altitude Il-2 attacks. [...] Single-barrel 20mm anti-aircraft guns were also found somewhat inadequate due to limited firepower: one or two shells were often not enough to destroy the Il-2, and unless the Il-2 was attacking the gun itself, thus presenting effectively a <b>stationary</b> <b>target,</b> scoring more hits during a firing opportunity was rare. [...] However, a single hit from a 37mm AA gun was usually enough to bring down an Il-2. Soviet anti-aircraft artillery also frequently mistook it for German aircraft, often with lethal consequences.|$|E

2500|$|T-72M4 CZ: the Czech T72M4 CZ is a {{comprehensive}} upgrade of {{every aspect of the}} T-72M1 resulting in a tank that only superficially resembles the precursor. The automotive performance was enhanced with a Perkins CV12-1000 1,000hp (740kW) water-cooled diesel engine coupled to an Allison XTG-411-6 automatic transmission. All drive train work was done by the Israeli firm NIMDA and involved extensive modification of the tank's hull and the driver's compartment. The upgrade added new Czech-manufactured Dyna-72 ERA for protection against HEAT and kinetic rounds impacting the frontal aspects of the turret and hull, and against top-attack ATGMs and sub-munitions with ERA tiles covering the turret roof. Survivability is enhanced with the Polish-made Obra laser warning system integrated with a series of DGO-1 smoke grenade dischargers on each side of turret, a Deugra fire suppression system, REDA NBC suite and electromagnetic mine plow. The most important improvement in firepower comes from the use of the Galileo Avionica TURMS-T computerized FCS (it is similar to that used in C1 Ariete) which enables a [...] "hunter-killer" [...] mode of operation; the commander has a panoramic day/night sight with built-in laser rangefinder and Attila thermal camera and can engage targets independently, while the gunner has his own primary sight with thermal channel. The FCS has sensors that correct for thermal distortion of the barrel, the temperature of the ammunition propellant, meteorological conditions, totaling 22 sensor clusters installed at several points on the turret. A new 125/EPpSV-97 APFSDS round was developed for use with the new tank which can defeat 540mm of RHA at 2,000 m. The Czech tanks were also equipped with a rear-view camera, a new intercom, navigational system, the DITA 72/97B auto-diagnostic system and improvements to the suspension due to the increase in the weight of the T-72M4 CZ by 4 tonnes. Curiously, the obsolete 2A46 main gun was retained as was the original 2E28M stabilization system, which was modestly upgraded with new hydraulic drives and gyroscopic sensors, resulting in only marginal improvements in first-hit probability despite the sophisticated and expensive TURMS-T FCS. The published probability of hitting a <b>stationary</b> <b>target</b> on the move is said to be between 65-75% with the first fired round. In comparison, the Leopard 2A4 from the mid-1980s can achieve a first round hit probability on the move of 75-85% at 2,000 m and as high as 90% with a skilled crew. The original tender called for an order of 350 tanks, which was downgraded to 140 in the face of dwindling defense budgets and finally amounted to a commitment for only 35 tanks to be upgraded to the T-72M4 CZ standard. One of the reasons for this drastic reduction was due to the escalating unit cost of the upgrade—from an initial estimate of 3.7M—and closing on a final cost of US$5.2M per tank. The reliance on foreign components and labour has also taken the original Czech contractor to the verge of bankruptcy, and the program is considered a failure by analysts according to cost-effectiveness metrics.|$|E

30|$|In this work, we {{show that}} by using a {{recursive}} random forest together with an alpha beta filter classifier, {{it is possible to}} classify radar tracks from the tracks’ kinematic data. The kinematic data is from a 2 D scanning radar without Doppler or height information. We use random forest as this classifier implicitly handles the uncertainty in the position measurements. As <b>stationary</b> <b>targets</b> can have an apparently high speed because of the measurement uncertainty, we use an alpha beta filter classifier to classify <b>stationary</b> <b>targets</b> from moving targets. We show an overall classification rate from simulated data at 82.6 % and from real-world data at 79.7 %. Additional to the confusion matrix, we also show recordings of real-world data.|$|R
