The program {{was sponsored by the}} Associated Students of Oregon State University and paid for by university technology funds, and was {{due in part to the}} closure of some computer labs that had been 24-hour study areas.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency.

Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E

25|$|Evans {{continued}} to use his Ojibwe orthography in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the orthography called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was polysynthetic but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had {{a large number of}} syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought might be less awkward for his <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

He encouraged <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> photography as an aid to understanding anatomy and the study of motion, and disallowed prize competitions.
