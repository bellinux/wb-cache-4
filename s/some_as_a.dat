5|$|Early {{comic strips}} also avoided overt {{treatment}} of gay issues, though examples of homosexual subtext have been identified. The 1938–1939 edition of Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates features a primary villain, Sanjak, {{who has been}} interpreted by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lesbian with designs on the hero's girlfriend.|$|E

5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> turning point in the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} {{the kind of}} courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during {{the first months of}} the Black Hawk War. Her actions, in part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended than had been anticipated.|$|E

5|$|In the inter-war years (1918–39) Jesus {{was seen}} by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small college and {{something}} of a backwater; it attracted relatively few pupils from the public schools traditionally seen as the most prestigious. The college did, however, attract many academically able entrants from the grammar schools (particularly those in northern England and Scotland). Among these grammar-school boys was Harold Wilson, who would later become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. During the Second World War, many of the fellows served {{in the armed forces}} or carried out war work in Oxford. The college remained full of students, though, as it provided lodgings for students from other colleges whose buildings had been requisitioned, and also housed officers on military courses.|$|E
5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, {{said she had a}} female gender identity since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy. Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|Operation Clambake {{was founded}} in 1996 by Andreas Heldal-Lund, an {{information}} technology manager in Stavanger, Norway, who administers the site at www.xenu.net.

5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} {{was seen by}} <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others {{as the result of}} magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment.

The Vlaams Blok also pointed at the problem of political nomination of judges, and again claimed that the lawsuit had been a political process coordinated with the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.|$|E

5|$|Andayya, {{taking a}} non-conformist path {{that was never}} {{repeated}} in Kannada literature, wrote Madana Vijaya ("Triumph of cupid", 1217–1235) using only pure Kannada words (desya) and naturalised Sanskrit words (tadbhava) and totally avoiding assimilated Sanskrit words (tatsamas). This is seen by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rebuttal meant to prove that writing Kannada literature without borrowed Sanskrit words was possible. The poem narrates {{the story of the}} moon being imprisoned by the god Shiva in his abode in the Himalayas. In his anger, Kama (Cupid, the god of love, also called Manmata) assailed Shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by Shiva and separated from his beloved. Kama then contrived to rid himself of Shiva's curse. The work also goes by other names such as Sobagina Suggi ("Harvest of Beauty"), Kavane Gella ("Cupid's Conquest") and Kabbigara-kava ("Poets defender"). Kama has an important place in Jain writings even before Andayya. The possibility that this writing was yet another subtle weapon in the intensifying conflict between the dominant Jains and the Veerashaivas, whose popularity was on the rise, is not lost on historians.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a {{dinner at a}} conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he was seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to an article in the New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E
5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt) is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance. It {{is one of}} {{the best}} known Arthurian stories, with its plot {{combining}} two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. The Green Knight is interpreted by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important poem in the romance genre, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.|$|E

5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were seen by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the {{shift away from}} {{outright}} sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama {{was seen as a}} move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E
5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} Kinyarwanda, which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence. The influx of former refugees from Uganda and elsewhere during the late 20th century has created a linguistic divide between the English-speaking population and the French-speaking remainder of the country. Kinyarwanda, English, and French are all official languages. Kinyarwanda {{is the language of}} government and English is the primary educational medium. Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, is also spoken by <b>some</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language, particularly returned refugees from Kenya and Tanzania. In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools. Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Amashi, a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.|$|E
