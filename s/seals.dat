5|$|The {{coasts of}} the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Barents Sea are {{important}} breeding grounds for bearded <b>seals</b> and ringed <b>seals.</b> Gray <b>seals</b> are rare and endemic to the Barents Sea. Greenland <b>seals,</b> or harp <b>seals,</b> {{also can be}} seen from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey <b>seals.</b> The harbour <b>seals</b> have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey <b>seals</b> breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey <b>seals</b> colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour <b>seals</b> off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the <b>seals.</b> The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour <b>seals</b> were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E

5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard <b>seals</b> typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater <b>seals</b> commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic <b>seals.</b> They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor <b>seals,</b> northern fur <b>seals</b> and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur <b>seals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur <b>seals,</b> New Zealand sea lions and harbor <b>seals.</b> In some species, including elephant <b>seals</b> and grey <b>seals,</b> males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp <b>seals,</b> crabeater <b>seals</b> and hooded <b>seals</b> follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic <b>Seals</b> allows limited hunting of crabeater <b>seals,</b> leopard <b>seals</b> and Weddell <b>seals.</b> However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant <b>seals,</b> Ross <b>seals</b> and Antarctic fur <b>seals.</b> The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp <b>seals.</b> This has been met with controversy and debate.

5|$|United States Navy <b>SEALs</b> have {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force.

5|$|An apex {{predator}} affects {{prey population}} dynamics and defense tactics (such as camouflage). The polar bear is the apex predator within its range. Several animal species, particularly Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), routinely scavenge polar bear kills. The relationship between ringed <b>seals</b> and polar bears {{is so close}} that the abundance of ringed <b>seals</b> in some areas appears to regulate the density of polar bears, while polar bear predation in turn regulates density and reproductive success of ringed <b>seals.</b> The evolutionary pressure of polar bear predation on <b>seals</b> probably accounts for some significant differences between Arctic and Antarctic <b>seals.</b> Compared to the Antarctic, {{where there is no}} major surface predator, Arctic <b>seals</b> use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out on the ice, and rarely defecate on the ice. The fur of Arctic pups is white, presumably to provide camouflage from predators, whereas Antarctic pups all have dark fur.|$|E

5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling.

Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur <b>seals</b> may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
