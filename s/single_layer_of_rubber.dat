50|$|Belts are {{calendered}} sheets consisting <b>of</b> a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber,</b> a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> closely spaced steel cords, and {{a second}} <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber.</b> Belts give the tire strength and dent resistance while allowing it to remain flexible. Passenger tires are usually made {{with two or three}} belts.|$|R
50|$|The {{body ply}} is a {{calendered}} sheet consisting <b>of</b> one <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber,</b> one <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> reinforcing fabric, {{and a second}} <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber.</b> The earliest textile used was cotton; later materials include rayon, nylon, polyester, and Kevlar. Passenger tires typically {{have one or two}} body plies. Body plies give the tire structure strength. Truck tires, off-road tires, and aircraft tires have progressively more plies. The fabric cords are highly flexible but relatively inelastic.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "rubber pads" [...] seen in {{the trucks}} in place of leaf springs are {{actually}} springs themselves. They're constructed <b>of</b> laminated <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> cushioning material and steel plates and they do provide suspension and cushioning effect.|$|R

50|$|Later, entirely black tires became {{available}} with white sidewalls being {{covered with a}} somewhat thin, black colored <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber.</b> By compressing the white rubber through the letter cutouts in the black outer layer, it gave the effect of raised white letter tires.|$|R

50|$|Phosphorene is a {{two-dimensional}} material and allotrope of phosphorus. Phosphorene {{can be viewed}} as a <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> black phosphorus, much in the same way that graphene is a <b>single</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> graphite. Phosphorene is predicted to be a strong competitor to graphene because, in contrast to graphene, phosphorene has a band gap. Phosphorene was first isolated in 2014 by mechanical exfoliation.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{self-sealing}} tanks {{have multiple}} <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> and reinforcing fabric, one <b>of</b> vulcanized <b>rubber</b> and one <b>of</b> untreated natural <b>rubber,</b> which can absorb fuel, swell and expand {{when it comes}} {{into contact with the}} fuel. When a fuel tank is punctured, the fuel seeps into the layers, causing the untreated layer to swell and thus seal the puncture.|$|R
5000|$|Lower-end bumper {{plates are}} {{generally}} made <b>of</b> solid <b>rubber</b> with a steel or brass hub. Competition-grade bumper plates are more compact, with a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> surrounding a steel core.

40|$|An {{attachment}} principally for {{the palm}} of an astronaut glove to enhance the gripping area of the palm without detracting from the flexibility and utility of the glove is presented. The attachment is a composite construction formed from a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> having an outer surface with a friction configuration and another <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> in which a Nomex Aramid mesh fabric is embedded prior to curing. The method of construction {{involves the use of}} a mold with a friction configuration surface. A first <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> or sealant is disposed in the mold and allowed to set for an hour. A second <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> or sealant is layered over the first layer and leveled. A Nomex Aramid mesh fabric is embedded into the second layer and the composite is permitted to cure. When cured, a configured area of the composite construction is glued or stitched to the palm area of the glove...|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} plies of cord {{reinforces}} a tire. Without this, a tire would be flexible and weak. The network of cords {{that gives the}} tire strength and shape is called the carcass.

50|$|HMCS Warrior {{returned}} to the United Kingdom and was recommissioned as HMS Warrior on 23 March 1948. Warrior was then refitted in Devonport and equipped with a flexible flight deck (<b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber)</b> to test the feasibility of receiving undercarriage-less aircraft; the Sea Vampire {{was used to test}} the concept, which was successful but not introduced into service.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, tires {{actually}} have more traction {{when they are}} bald, because there is more surface area making contact with the road. The reason regular tires have treads is to avoid hydroplaning when {{the surface of the}} road is wet. Stock cars driven on professionally maintained NASCAR tracks use tires without treads, and with a thicker <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber.</b>|$|R
