2500|$|The use of {{methyl iodide}} as a {{fumigant}} has drawn concern. For example, 54 chemists and physicians contacted the U.S. EPA in a letter, saying [...] "We are skeptical of U.S. EPA’s {{conclusion that the}} high levels of exposure to methyl iodide that are likely to result from broadcast applications are 'acceptable' risks. U.S. EPA has made many assumptions about toxicology and exposure in the risk assessment that have not been examined by independent scientific peer reviewers for adequacy or accuracy. Additionally, none of U.S. EPA’s calculations account for the extra vulnerability of the unborn fetus and children to toxic insults." [...] EPA Assistant Administrator Jim Gulliford replied saying, [...] "We are confident that by conducting such a rigorous analysis and developing highly restrictive provisions governing its use, there will be no risks of concern," [...] and in October the EPA approved the use of methyl iodide as a <b>soil</b> <b>fumigant</b> in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of July 14, 1991, a Southern Pacific train derailed into the upper Sacramento River at a sharp bend of track known as the Cantara Loop, {{upstream}} from Dunsmuir, California, in Siskiyou County. Several cars made contact with the water, including a tank car. Early {{in the morning of}} 15 July, it became apparent that the tank car had ruptured and spilled its entire contents into the river – approximately 19,000 gallons of a <b>soil</b> <b>fumigant</b> – metam sodium. Ultimately, over a million fish, {{and tens of thousands of}} amphibians and crayfish were killed. Millions of aquatic invertebrates, including insects and mollusks, which form the basis of the river's ecosystem, were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of willows, alders, and cottonwoods eventually died. Many more were severely injured. The chemical plume left a 41-mile wake of destruction, from the spill site to the entry point of the river into Shasta Lake. The accident still ranks as the largest hazardous chemical spill in California history. This substance was not classified as a hazardous material at the time of the incident.|$|E

Applying the former two techniques, urinary mercapturic acids could still be quantified following 5 micrograms doses of each of the dichloropropene isomers. With gas chromatography-negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry, only mercapturic acid metabolites arising from 25 micrograms doses and higher could be quantified because of interference from endogenous compounds.
