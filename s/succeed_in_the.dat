5|$|Despite those players' {{performance}}s, {{the game}} was decided in the running game {{and the performance of}} the two teams' offensive and defensive lines. Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh was praised for adjusting his team's strategy at halftime, allowing it to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half. Stanford's rushing offense accounted for 247 yards, while its defensive line limited Virginia Tech to just 67 yards rushing. The Stanford defense also sacked Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor eight times, denying him time to pass the ball accurately.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{all four}} of Khan's {{releases}} failed critically and commercially, but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination. Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai's diasporic-themed social drama Pardes, portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites {{it as one of}} the first major Bollywood pictures to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} the minors, Crozier adopted the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, which he would later use during his NHL career. This technique was popularized by Glenn Hall and was improved upon by Crozier. Initially, his minor league coaches tried to convince him to abandon this style, thinking {{that it would never}} <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NHL. Crozier also added an element of acrobacy in his game.|$|E
50|$|Sir Edward Elias Sassoon, 2nd Baronet (6 January 1853 - 2 December 1924). Sassoon was {{the younger}} son of Elias David Sassoon and <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baronetcy {{on the death}} of his brother. He was a businessman. Sassoon was <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baronetcy by his son Victor.|$|R

5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but {{he turned his back}} on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Mau {{took part}} in the Nā ʻOhana Holo Moana voyage of Hōkūle‘a to Ra‘iātea. Sailing with his son Sesario Sewralur, and Nainoa as sailing master, Mau watched as Nainoa's {{students}} Kaʻau McKenney and Keahi Omai served as navigators. Mau had seen Nainoa <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 and 19851987 voyages; finally, in this 1995 voyage, Mau saw proof that the knowledge was carried forward to the next generation. The canoe landed successfully at Rarotonga, and the voyage resulted in the lifting of a six-centuries-old taboo on voyaging from Ra‘iātea. Hōkūle‘a had sailed from Hawaii with sisterships Hawaiiloa and Makalii; the canoes rendez-voused at Taputapuatea with other voyaging canoes from across Oceania.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio {{and played}} football, {{baseball}} and basketball at his local high school. After graduating, he enrolled at Ohio State University, where he played {{only a handful of}} games before he was drafted for service in the U.S. Army during World War II. Returning in 1945 after serving in Europe, he joined the Browns in the team's first-ever season in the AAFC. Helped by Lavelli's play, the Browns won each of the AAFC's championships before the league dissolved in 1949 and the team was absorbed by the NFL. Cleveland continued to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL, winning championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955. Lavelli, who helped found the National Football League Players Association {{toward the end of his}} career, retired after the 1956 season.|$|E

5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson was dealt, along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E
5|$|Specialized bulk {{carriers}} {{began to appear}} as steam-powered ships became more popular. The first steam ship recognized as a bulk carrier was the British coal carrier SS John Bowes in 1852. She featured a metal hull, a steam engine, and a ballasting system which used seawater instead of sandbags. These features helped her <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competitive British coal market. The first self-unloader was the lake freighter Hennepin in 1902 on the Great Lakes. This greatly decreased the unloading time of bulkers by using conveyor belt to move the cargo. The first bulkers with diesel propulsion {{began to appear in}} 1911.|$|E
5|$|Adamle {{grew up in}} Cleveland, Ohio and was a star fullback on his Collinwood High School {{football}} team. He attended Ohio State University in 1942, but {{his college}} career was cut short by World War II. After {{a stint in the}} U.S. Air Force, Adamle returned to finish his education at Ohio State in 1946. He soon dropped out of school, however, and joined the Browns. Cleveland won AAFC championships in each of Adamle's first three years, after which the league folded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland continued to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL, winning the 1950 championship and advancing to the 1951 championship but losing to the Los Angeles Rams. Adamle left the Browns after the 1951 season to pursue a medical degree, but he came out of retirement briefly in 1954 as the Browns won another NFL championship.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient number of shares from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E
5|$|Julius Delius {{assumed that}} his son would {{play a part in}} the family wool business, and {{for the next three years}} he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's {{representative}} in Stroud in Gloucestershire, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to Chemnitz, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with Hans Sitt. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists Henrik Ibsen and Gunnar Heiberg. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the French Riviera. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect {{that his son}} would <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.|$|E

5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was founded}} in March 1839 as the {{flagship}} school of what later became the Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore City College was charged with providing a unique classics- and liberal arts-based course of study and with holding all members of its school community to the highest standards of academic achievement and personal development. The school's mission is to prepare its students to <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best colleges In the United States.
