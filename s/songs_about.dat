5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> how romances dissolve. In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records {{changed its}} name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville No Depression, was {{recorded}} over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> wanting to avoid factory work and <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft.

[...] "Vise om løgna" [...] <b>song</b> <b>about</b> the lie is a <b>song</b> <b>about</b> being {{consumed}} by secrets, while [...] "Mannen på holdeplassen" [...] man at the tram stop could {{be read as a}} <b>song</b> <b>about</b> love at first sight between men.|$|R

5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners. Its songs eschew the personal and societal themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of upbeat <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal {{wanted to make the}} album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Slayer {{released}} Divine Intervention, the band's {{first record}} with drummer Bostaph. The album featured <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> Reinhard Heydrich, an {{architect of the}} Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments will go to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much {{of the content of}} the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Morrison {{abandoned}} the abstract folk jazz compositions of Astral Weeks {{in favor of}} more formally composed songs on Moondance, which he wrote and produced entirely himself. Its lively rhythm and blues/rock music was the style he would become most known for in his career.

This live performance was released {{later in the year}} as Horses/Horses.|$|E
5|$|Saadiq and Brungardt disregarded their {{previous}} experience in recording production while making The Way I See It. Instead, they experimented with older recording techniques {{in an attempt}} to recreate the Motown music aesthetic of the 1960s, producing a traditional soul album draws on the Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul styles. Saadiq, whose lyrics mostly deal with romantic subject matter, described it as a series of love <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> music and remaining faithful to it despite trends.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the song [...] "Lo-Fi Tennessee Mountain Angel (for Kathy Poindexter)" [...] came from a {{conversation}} Adams had with Kathy Poindexter, who fronted a local Raleigh punk band named Picasso Trigger. Poindexter had recently written a <b>song</b> <b>about</b> Dolly Parton called [...] "Lo-Fi Tennessee Mountain Angel". Adams loved the idea of someone writing a punk <b>song</b> <b>about</b> Parton {{so much that he}} wrote his own <b>song</b> <b>about</b> Poindexter.|$|R

5|$|The statue {{that sits}} atop the Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In the tradition of the Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how the boy and the turtle are portrayed. Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes dress the statue in festive clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{advertising}} {{included the}} parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại {{through the streets}} of Saigon, depicted with bags of money on his shoulders, a deck of cards in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of cognac in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> Bảo Đại.|$|E

Lennon had Irish roots, as did his songwriting partner Paul McCartney, who also wrote a <b>song</b> <b>about</b> British imperialism in Ireland ('Give Ireland Back to the Irish').|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Usher {{began dating}} TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their {{relationship}} lasted for two years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher. They broke up in December 2003.|$|E
5|$|Newton often openly mocked {{the captain}} by {{creating}} obscene poems and <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> him that became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several colleagues {{that resulted in}} his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced {{to work on a}} plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.|$|E
5|$|Arjona's primary musical {{style is}} Latin pop. He usually sings {{without the help}} of {{featured}} or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona took risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden Déjame Decir Que Te Amo, on the following two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. Animal Nocturno intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums. On Historias, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings. On Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate <b>songs</b> <b>about</b> love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.|$|E
