When cleansing flights are few, bees will often be forced out at times when the temperature is barely adequate for their wing muscles to function, and large quantities of bees may be seen dead in the snow around the hives.

2500|$|Hawkins made {{important}} {{improvements in}} ship construction and rigging. He is {{less well known}} for his inventiveness as a shipwright than for his management. His innovations included sheathing the underside of his ships with a skin of nailed elm planks sealed {{with a combination of}} pitch and hair <b>smeared</b> <b>over</b> the bottom timbers, as a protection against the worms which attacked the wooden hulls in tropical seas. Hawkins also introduced detachable topmasts; they could be hoisted and used in good weather and stowed in heavy seas. Masts were stepped further forward, and sails were cut flatter. His ships were [...] "race-built", being longer and with forecastle and aftcastle (or poop) greatly reduced in size.|$|E

2500|$|After murdering Perkins, Belcher {{drove his}} 2007 Bentley Continental GT {{about five miles}} to a {{parking lot at the}} Chiefs' {{practice}} facility next to Arrowhead Stadium. He stepped out of the car with a gun pointed to his head when he encountered Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli. Belcher told Pioli that he murdered his girlfriend, and thanked him before asking for Pioli and Chiefs owner Clark Hunt {{to take care of his}} daughter. Pioli tried to persuade Belcher to drop the gun. Then Chiefs Head Coach Romeo Crennel, along with linebackers coach Gary Gibbs, arrived and joined the effort. Police had been dispatched to the scene at 8:01 A.M. As the sound of sirens approached, Belcher told the men that he had to kill himself and [...] "can't be here." [...] He knelt down by a car, made a sign of the cross, and shot himself in the head. A photograph from the scene showed Perkins' blood <b>smeared</b> <b>over</b> the chrome gearshift of Belcher's vehicle, as well as broken glass on the dashboard.|$|E

He sighed, and looked again over the hills where the moonlight was condensing in mist ethereal, frail, and yet substantial, reminding him of the way the manna must have condensed out of the white moonlit mists of Arabian deserts.|$|E

In those dark ages, writers even ventured to describe the method of imitating the composition of such terrific monsters! A number of large hollow reeds were to be bound together, then sheathed completely in skin, and <b>smeared</b> <b>over</b> with pitch and other inflammable matters.

After being hung up till it is dry, it is turned; and the other side, being a second time well wetted, is at once painted over with the tar and grease, just as the first side had been before. The sailors say that [...] "the tar dries in, as the water dries out;" [...] a saying which I confess I cannot understand.|$|E
40|$|Angle-resolved photoemission {{spectra of}} a {{monolayer}} of Yb on W(110) reveal energy splittings and dispersion of the Yb 4 f {{states that are}} obviously due to their hybridization with W-derived valence bands. These effects occur at well defined points of the surface Brillouin zone although a <b>smearing</b> <b>over</b> reciprocal space is expected from the structural incoherence of the Yb and W lattices. We conclude therefore that dispersion {{is not related to}} the periodic arrangement of the $ 4 f$ states but reflects the k-dependent interaction of a single Yb 4 f impurity with W bands.

60|$|It was {{an amusing}} sight to see {{three or four}} hundred sheep driven into an enclosure, and then dragged out by the shearers.

Each man had a pot of tar by his side, with which he <b>smeared</b> <b>over</b> any wound. A certain sum was stopped from their pay for each sheep upon which they made a cut of over a certain length; but although this made them careful to a certain extent, they still wounded a great many of the poor creatures.|$|E

The animal appeared to suffer very little pain from the wound; he was kept for a fortnight, and then died, but not apparently from any cause connected with the wound. In fact he was previously diseased. Unfortunately {{the seat of the}} wound was not then examined, but a few days previously it appeared to have healed of itself. In the rabbit of the former experiment, three days after the insertion of the poison in the wound, the latter was closed with a dry coagulum and presented no marks of inflammation around it.|$|E

There was one peculiarity I could not but remark in this singular town. It was this:--all the houses were <b>smeared</b> <b>over</b> with some colored earth, and then, after all this pains had been taken to cover the material, an artist was employed to make white marks around every separate particle of the fabric (and they were in millions), which ingenious particularity gives the dwellings a most agreeable air of detail, imparting to the architecture, in general, a sublimity {{that is based on}} the multiplication table. If to this be added the black of the chevaux-de-frise, the white of the entrance-ladders, and a sort of standing-collar to the whole, immediately under the eves, of some very dazzling hue, the effect is not unlike that of a platoon of drummers, in scarlet coats, cotton lace, and cuffs and capes of white. What renders the similitude more striking, is the fact that no two of the same plantoon appear to be exactly of a size, as is very apt to be the case with your votaries in military music.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a very}} {{different}} meal from a Victorian breakfast. The rude masses of bread needing to be carved and <b>smeared</b> <b>over</b> with animal fat before they could be made palatable, the still recognisable fragments of recently killed animals, hideously charred and hacked, the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath some protesting hen,--such things as these, though they constituted the ordinary fare of Victorian times, would have awakened only horror and disgust in the refined minds of the people of these latter days. Instead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and variegated design, without any suggestion in colour or form of the unfortunate animals from which their substance and juices were derived. They appeared on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little box at one side of the table. The surface of the table, to judge by touch and eye, would have appeared to a nineteenth-century person to be covered with fine white damask, but this was really an oxidised metallic surface, and could be cleaned instantly after a meal. There were hundreds of such little tables in the hall, and at most of them were other latter-day citizens singly or in groups. And as Mwres seated himself before his elegant repast, the invisible orchestra, which had been resting during an interval, resumed and filled the air with music.|$|E

I went around to the front of the hut, which seemed larger and better made than others I had seen.
