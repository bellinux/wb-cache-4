40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} an analytical model {{to account for}} the effects of creep and shrinkage on the response of composite steel-concrete beams with partial shear connection stiffened by means of longitudinal plates bolted to the bottom flange of the steel member. The particularity of this model is that the partial interaction behaviour is assumed to exist between the top slab and the joist as well as between the joist and the bolted longitudinal <b>stiffening</b> <b>plate,</b> leading to a three-layered structural representation. The weak formulation of the problem is obtained and used to derive a 13 degrees-of-freedom element whose freedoms include the axial displacements of each layer, the rotations and vertical displacements at the end nodes. A parametric study has then been carried out for the case of a simply supported beam to investigate the effects of the time-dependent behaviour of the concrete for different levels of shear connection stiffness...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method of stiffening CHS L-joints and compares it against current stiffened and unstiffened moment connections.

Stiffing plates placed across the joint can increase the moment capacity of the section by preventing ovalisation of the section but is architecturally unsightly. An alternative approach, where a <b>stiffening</b> <b>plate</b> welded vertically inside both the column and beam, outperformed the unstiffened frame plate in terms of reduced ovalisation and increased load capacity.

40|$|As a bus developer, Scania {{focus to}} {{construct}} a safe vehicle for the passengers, i. e. high strength of the bus structure and good comfort, which is also profitable for the operator, i. e. high passenger capacity and low fuel consumption. The trade-off when developing a bus body structure is to get both high stiffness and low weight. The bus body including exterior panels plays together with the chassis an important role for the stiffness of the bus. By gathering knowledge about how various exterior panels affects the stiffness of the bus body, {{the design of the}} panels can be optimized with respect to high stiffness and low weight. Also from a calculation point of view is it of interest to know how important different panels are for the stiffness of the bus body, in order to make conscious simplifications in the calculation model. The aim with this master thesis was to investigate how the <b>stiffening</b> <b>plate,</b> side windows and roof sheet influence the strength of the bus body. How the thickness of the side windows affects the stiffness of the bus body is also investigated. The investigations were made as a relative comparison between a complete bus and comparison models.   The results showed that exterior panels participate in distributing load. By distributing the load, the load uptake gets more efficient since a bigger part of the bus structure is used to take up the load. The side windows affect the stiffness for all tested load cases, with increased importance for the load case where a gravity field is applied in the longitudinal direction, for the torsion load case and when a load is applied to the power train in vertical direction. The roof sheet has a high impact on the stiffness in the torsion load case, but has negligible influence on the stiffness of the bus body for the other tested load cases. The <b>stiffening</b> <b>plate</b> has little influence on the stiffness of the bus body in general and is negligible for all tested load cases except for when a lateral load is applied as either a gravity field or locally to the power train.   Thinner side windows are shown to have a positive influence on the stiffness of the bus body...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new type of splice joint, named flange bolted-welded hybrid joint, which is {{designed}} to splice I-shape beam to facilitate the construction of industrialized buildings. The flange, welded with the bottom beam flange as well as the web close to bottom flange, are jointed by high strength bolts. <b>Stiffening</b> <b>plate</b> is welded at top of the flange while downhand welding and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top beam flange and the beam web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates. The experimental studies enabled improvement of the design of the connection to be used in moment-resisting steel frame structures.

30|$|<b>Stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> are {{extensively}} used {{in various}} engineering structures. The technique of <b>stiffening</b> a <b>plate</b> by providing beams is rather common {{and it also}} gives higher value of strength to weight ratio of the structure. This has also made the structure more attractive in practice. Further, these structures are frequently subjected to dynamic loading in their service life. Hence, the dynamic behaviour of <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> is of much interest to the structural engineers. The resonance may occur due to undesirable vibrations due to which the stiffened structure may have sudden failure. It is, therefore, important to know the natural frequencies of these structures accurately. Hence, an in-depth study of free vibration behaviour of these <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> is required to exploit their use. On the other hand, the designers have limited scope and also face difficulty in obtaining the natural frequencies of <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> with conventional techniques. It is also tedious for designers to obtain natural frequencies of the <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> employing numerical tools like finite element method (FEM)/finite difference method (FDM)/other approximate methods.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{suitability}} of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design. The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C 350 and Grade C 450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames. A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams. The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS {{can be used in}} plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required. Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised. Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design. The major conclusions of the beam tests were: (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design. (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate. An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS. Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame. The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted plate knee joints, and welded and bolted internal sleeve knee joints, for use in RHS portal frames. The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated. The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the <b>stiffening</b> <b>plate,</b> to carry the majority of the load. The internal sleeve connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design. Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed. There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads. Two grades of steel were used for comparison. The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames. In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism. An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames. The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects. A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections. While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed. This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required. A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation. To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed. The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear. The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity. Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results. There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Blade-stiffened {{composite}} plates {{have been}} analysed for transverse loads using the finite element method. An eight-noded isoparametric quadratic <b>stiffened</b> <b>plate</b> bending element has been employed for the analysis. The element can incorporate trans-verse shear deformation. First order shear deformation {{has been considered}} in the for-mulation; the stiffener can be placed anywhere within the plate element and need not necessarily follow nodal lines. Therefore, mesh divisions are independent of the stiffener location within the plate. The stiffness matrix of the stiffener element can be appropriately modified to include stiffness properties {{for all types of}} open-section stiffeners. The deflec-tions and bending moments have been presented for simply supported square laminated plates with one central stiffener and for <b>stiffened</b> skew <b>plates.</b> The results are compared with those obtained by modeling the <b>stiffened</b> <b>plate</b> by an assemblage of eight-noded isoparametric flat shell elements.

A large number of problems of isotropic and composite bare and <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> have been analyzed to validate the formulation and some new results have been put forward for future reference...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} review of code provisions and other proposals concerning {{the requirements for}} torsional rigidities of flat stiffeners to compression flanges is made. The relevant rules are investigated by means of 65 tests on compressed, <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> with various loading and supporting conditions. A new design rule for {{the determination of the}} dimensions of flat stiffeners, based on their ultimate stress and the ultimate stress of the <b>stiffened</b> <b>plate,</b> is proposed and relevant design charts are given. © 1992...|$|R
30|$|Figures  4, 5 and 6 {{reveal that}} the {{eccentric}} stiffeners in any orientation are showing superior performance in increasing the values of ϖ of clamped <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> in comparison {{to that of the}} concentric ones. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the first and second moments of area of the stiffeners of <b>plates</b> <b>stiffened</b> with eccentric stiffeners are more than those with concentric stiffeners because of eccentricity of the stiffeners. Therefore, the stiffness of the <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> increases without increase of eccentricity. The eccentric at top and bottom stiffeners has yielded the same result ofϖ.|$|R
40|$|A Rayleigh-Ritz {{solution}} {{approach for}} generally restrained multilayered variable angle tow <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> in postbuckling regime is presented. The plate model {{is based on}} the first order shear deformation theory and accounts for geometrical nonlinearity through the von Kármán's assumptions. <b>Stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> are modelled as assembly of plate-like elements and penalty techniques are used to join the elements in the assembled structure and to apply the kinematical boundary conditions. General symmetric and unsymmetric stacking sequences are considered and Legendre orthogonal polynomials are employed to build the trial functions. A computer code was developed to implement the proposed approach and to establish its applicability and its features for investigating variable angle tow structures. The proposed solution is validated by comparison with literature and finite elements results. Original results are presented for postbuckling of variable angle tow <b>stiffened</b> <b>plates</b> showing the potentialities of the method...|$|R
