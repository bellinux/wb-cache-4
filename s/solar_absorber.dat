In industrial cases a parabolic mirror can concentrate sunlight on the tube. Heat is stored in a hot water storage tank. The volume of this tank needs to be larger with solar heating systems to compensate for bad weather and because the optimum final temperature for the solar collector is lower than a typical immersion or combustion heater. The heat transfer fluid (HTF) for the absorber may be water, but more commonly (at least in active systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing anti-freeze and a corrosion inhibitor delivers heat to the tank through a heat exchanger (commonly a coil of copper heat exchanger tubing within the tank). Copper {{is an important component}} in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of its high heat conductivity, atmospheric and water corrosion resistance, sealing and joining by soldering and mechanical strength.

The targeted operating temperature is 500 – 600 °C. A detrimental change in the morphology, phase, and optical properties is observed if the cermet layers are deposited on a stainless steel substrate with a thin nickel adhesion layer, which is due to the diffusion of iron atoms from the stainless steel into the cermet layer forming a FeWO[subscript 4] phase. In order to improve thermal stability and reduce the infrared emittance, tungsten is found to be a good candidate for the infrared reflector layer due to its excellent thermal stability and low infrared emittance.

Normal absorptance of the fabricated <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> is characterized {{to be higher}} than 0. 9 in the UV, visible and, near infrared (IR) regime, while the mid-IR emittance is around 0. 2. The high broadband absorption in the solar spectrum is realized by the excitation of surface plasmon and magnetic polariton resonances, while the low mid-IR emittance is due to the highly reflective nature of the metallic components. Further directional and polarized reflectance measurements show wide-angle and polarization-insensitive high absorption within solar spectrum.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe limited {{supply of}} fossil {{hydrocarbon}} {{resources and the}} negative impact of CO 2 emission on the global environment dictate the increasing usage of renewable energy sources. Concentrating solar power (CSP) systems are the most likely candidate for providing the majority of the renewable energy. For efficient photo-thermal conversion, these systems require spectrally selective <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> surfaces with high solar absorbance in the solar spectrum region and low thermal emittance in the infrared region. In this thesis, a spectrally selective AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy multilayer <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> was designed and deposited onto copper substrate using electron beam evaporation at room temperature. The employment of ellipsometric measurements and optical simulation was proposed as an effective method to optimize and deposit the multilayer <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> coatings. The optical constants measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry, showed that both AlxOy layers, which used in the coatings, were dielectric in nature and the Pt layer was semi-transparent. The optimized multilayer coatings exhibited high solar absorptance ~ 0. 94 ± 0. 01 and low thermal emittance ~ 0. 06 ± 0. 01 at 82 oC. The structural and optical properties of the coatings were investigated. It was found that the stratification of the coatings consists of a semitransparent middle Pt layer sandwiched between two layers of AlxOy. The top and bottom AlxOy layers were nonstoichiometric with no crystalline phases present. The Pt layer is in the fcc crystalline phase with a broad size distribution and spheroidal shape in and between the rims of AlxOy. The surface roughness of the stack was found to be comparable to the inter-particle distance. To study the thermal stability of the multilayer <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> coatings, the samples were annealed at different temperatures for different duration in air. The results showed changes in morphology, structure, composition, and optical properties depend on both temperature and duration of annealing. The XRD pattern showed that the intensity of Pt decreased with increasing annealing temperature and therefore, disappeared at high temperature. With increasing annealing temperature, an increase in the size of Pt particles was observed from SEM. The AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy multilayer <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> coatings deposited onto Cu substrate were found to be thermally stable up to 500 oC in air for 2 h with good spectral selectivity of 0. 951 / 0. 09. At 600 oC and 700 oC, the spectral selectivity decreased to 0. 92 / 0. 10 and 0. 846 / 0. 11 respectively, which is attributed to the diffusion of Cu and formation of CuO and Cu 2 O phases. Long term thermal stability study showed that the coatings were thermally stable in air up to 450 oC for 24 h. To elucidate the degradation mechanism beyond 500 oC, HI-ERDA has been used to study depth-dependent atomic concentration profiles. These measurements revealed outward diffusion of the copper substrate towards the surface and therefore, the decrease in the constituents of the coating. Hence, to prevent copper from diffusing towards the coatings, a thin Tantalum (Ta) layer was deposited between the base AlxOy layer and the copper substrate. The effect of a thin Ta layer on the thermal stability of AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy multilayer <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> coatings was investigated. The Cu/Ta/AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy multilayer <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> coatings were found to be thermally stable up to 700 oC in air for 2 h with good spectral selectivity of 0. 937 / 0. 10. At 800 oC, the spectral selectivity decreased to 0. 870 / 0. 12, which is attributed to the diffusion of Cu and formation of CuO phase. The formation of CuO phase was confirmed by XRD, EDS and Raman spectroscopy. Long term thermal stability study showed that the coatings were thermally stable in air up to 550 oC for 24 h. Therefore, the Cu/Ta/AlxOy/Pt/AlxOy spectrally selective <b>solar</b> <b>absorber</b> coatings can be used for high temperature solar-thermal applications...|$|E
