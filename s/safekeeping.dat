5|$|In 1976, Tech {{students}} took the Wreck to Athens {{for the annual}} football game with UGA. After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car. The vehicle appeared relatively unprotected and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it. The Tech students responsible for the car's <b>safekeeping</b> frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed 9 mm pistol.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{launched}} a biography titled Andrew Fisher, written by David Day. In turn, Rudd {{was presented with}} an item that once belonged to Fisher - a slightly battered gold pen engraved with Fisher's signature, which had been held in <b>safekeeping</b> for 80 years.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War the family fled Paris; Döblin's manuscripts were able to be brought into <b>safekeeping</b> in the {{basement}} of the Sorbonne. Between {{the start of}} the war in 1939 and the German occupation of France in 1940, Döblin worked for the French ministry of information, writing counter-propaganda texts against Nazi Germany with a group of French Germanists and journalists, as well as artists like Frans Masereel.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, White {{served as}} a Sergeant Major and Captain in the Confederate States Army and headed a bureau of the Confederate States Department of the Treasury. White served under the {{commands}} of Stonewall Jackson and Jubal Early and {{was responsible for the}} <b>safekeeping</b> of Hampshire County's land registration records from destruction by Union Army forces. From 1864 to 1865, White was in command of Company C of the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil War, White was {{concerned}} {{for the safety}} of the county's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for <b>safekeeping.</b> Because of White's efforts, Hampshire County land records survived the war, while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed. White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies. White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury.|$|E
5|$|James Broun-Ramsay, the Marquess of Dalhousie became Lord Warden; on his death, the Prime Minister Henry Temple, the Viscount Palmerston, {{took over}} the castle in 1861. Palmerston {{initially}} declined to buy {{the contents of the}} castle from his predecessor's estate on taking up the post, a practice which had become traditional for the Lords Warden, complaining about the high price being proposed. This raised the risk that the historical contents of the castle might be sold off at open auction; and some of Wellington's former belongings were therefore removed by his family for <b>safekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kalpavriksha (Devanagari: कल्पवृक्ष), {{also known}} as kalpataru, kalpadruma or kalpapādapa, is a wish-fulfilling divine tree in Hindu mythology. It is {{mentioned}} in Sanskrit literature from the earliest sources. It is also a popular theme in Jain cosmology and Buddhism. Sage Durvasa and Adi Shankaracharya, meditated under the Kalpavriksha. The birth of Ashokasundari, the daughter of Shiva and Parvati, is attributed to the Kalpavriksha tree. Another daughter Aranyani was also gifted to Kalpavriksha for <b>safekeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen hold a {{videoconference}} {{with their}} corrupt accountant, Lau, {{who has taken}} their funds for <b>safekeeping</b> and fled to Hong Kong. The Joker interrupts, warns them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money, but Gambol puts a bounty on the Joker instead after he insults him. After escaping and smuggling himself as a corpse, the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1851, a French {{cargo ship}} {{carrying}} 98 tons of goods from Gibraltar to Rabat capsized near {{the coast of}} Salé. A few tons of goods were rescued, and were stored {{in the city for}} <b>safekeeping.</b> Salé turned out to be less than safe, however; by the next day, hundreds of townspeople were scavenging and stealing the goods. The thieves were thwarted by , but only temporarily. By the end of the raids, the French had lost 11,391 franc germinals worth of goods.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1996 {{at around}} 10:30pm local time (UTC+7), Udin {{received}} two visitors outside {{his home in}} Bantul, off Parangtritis Road. The visitors claimed to want to leave a motorcycle with him for <b>safekeeping,</b> and reportedly had come the day before as well. While his wife Marsiyem was preparing tea, the men attacked him with a metal rod, striking {{him in the head}} and stomach. The assailants then escaped on a motorcycle they had parked in front of his home. Marsiyem found Udin unconscious on the ground, bleeding from his ears.|$|E
5|$|The Aggies {{broke the}} losing streak in 1910 with a stalemate, 11–11. In {{the final minutes}} of the game, Hopkins was on the Maryland eight-yard line, second down with two yards to go. A Johns Hopkins guard named Schrieber then ran from the field to their bench to leave a knocked-out tooth for <b>safekeeping.</b> The referee penalized the Blue and Black ten yards, and when their field goal attempt was blocked, the game ended in a tie.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{remained}} in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell's cavalry was quartered {{in the church}} at Kells, and {{the governor of the}} town sent the book to Dublin for <b>safekeeping.</b> Henry Jones, who later became bishop of Meath after the Restoration, presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, and it has remained there ever since, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums. It has been on display to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was no longer}} regarded as being adequate {{to function as a}} courthouse by 1840, during the Government of Sir Henry Bouverie, and that year the Civil Courts were moved to Auberge d'Auvergne. The courts of criminal jurisdiction and the office of the police were moved to the auberge in 1853. Court archives and documents of registrations of the Castellania were relocated for <b>safekeeping</b> in the auberge.|$|E
5|$|The dugouts {{were created}} by Algonquian peoples who were {{seasonal}} visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowing burning out {{the center of the}} log and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes {{to the bottom of the}} lake for <b>safekeeping</b> until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The ship's silver {{service was}} {{commissioned}} {{by the state of}} South Carolina and was presented on 11 April 1910. After South Carolina was withdrawn from service in 1922, the service was given to the South Carolina chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution for display at the Old Exchange. Following the outbreak of World War II, the service was hidden {{in the basement of the}} Old Exchange for <b>safekeeping.</b> In 1947, they were retrieved and sent to the South Carolina Governor's Mansion, where they are currently on display.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the <b>safekeeping</b> of the English king.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, only two of the ships had been commissioned, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their only significant pre-war task was undertaken by Beograd in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's gold reserve to the United Kingdom for <b>safekeeping.</b> On 24 January 1940, Ljubljana ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, it sank close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Franck found a {{position}} at the Polytekniske Læreanstalt in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for <b>safekeeping.</b> When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the gold medal, along with that of Max von Laue in aqua regia to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, aliens {{known as}} Mondoshawans {{arrive at an}} ancient Egyptian temple to collect, for <b>safekeeping</b> {{concerning}} World War I, the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos {{has met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as <b>safekeeping</b> for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Nikki Finn is a {{carefree}} young woman, who {{is always}} dressed in a leather jacket and skirt, with fire-red lips, platinum bob hair and speaking in a high-pitched voice. One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts the pictures in a safety deposit box and gives Nikki the key for <b>safekeeping.</b> The thieves catch Johnny and murder him, then frame Nikki by putting his body {{into the trunk of}} her car. Nikki is sentenced to seven years in prison. This is seen during the animated opening credits of the film.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II in 1939, SBC, {{like other}} Swiss banks, was the {{recipient}} of large influxes of foreign funds for <b>safekeeping.</b> Just prior to {{the outbreak of the}} war, SBC made the timely decision to open an office in New York City. The office, located in the Equitable Building, was able to begin operations {{a few weeks after the}} outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in the case of an invasion. During the war, the banks' traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest client.|$|E
5|$|White's father, Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White, {{learned of}} the {{advancement}} of Union Army forces on Romney, and became concerned {{for the safety of}} the county's records. His father proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester, Virginia for <b>safekeeping.</b> In 1863, when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County's land records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal. When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces, White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months. In fall 1864, the county's record books were rescued by White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them. White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White's father John Baker White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for <b>safekeeping,</b> Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|William Legrand has {{relocated}} from New Orleans to Sullivan's Island in South Carolina {{after losing}} his family fortune, and has brought his African-American servant Jupiter with him. The story's narrator, {{a friend of}} Legrand, visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab-like bug he has found. The bug's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold. Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort, but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator, with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull. As they discuss the bug, Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for <b>safekeeping.</b> Confused, the narrator takes his leave for the night.|$|E
5|$|A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted {{from around}} the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote {{of his life and}} martyrdom. The saint's remains were {{temporarily}} moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for <b>safekeeping</b> in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible for rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. Medieval manuscripts and works of art relating to Edmund include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{gave his}} {{mistress}} vast {{sums of money}} by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit. He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death. Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless {{of the contents of}} his will. However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for <b>safekeeping</b> was in foreign investments or in the shape of paintings, bric-a-brac, and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash. Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune in Congo securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her. Princess Louise soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1478, Catherine {{made her}} last will, {{recorded}} by a Dalmatian priest, {{in the presence}} of seven witnesses, six of whom were Franciscans of Ara Coeli. She expressed a wish to be buried before the main altar of Ara Coeli. Considering herself entitled to dispose of the Bosnian crown, she named Pope Sixtus IV and his successors guardians of the kingdom, obligating them to enthrone her son should he convert back to Christianity or else her daughter should she reconvert. Most of her personal belongings were inherited by her courtiers. Her chapel inventory was left to Saint Jerome's Church for the Slavic Nation, while the saint's relics were to be passed to Saint Mary's Church in Jajce. She decreed that, if her son never returned to the Christian faith, King Thomas's silver sword left in Dubrovnik for <b>safekeeping</b> should be handed to her nephew by Vladislav, Balša Hercegović. The Queen died five days after composing the will, which was immediately taken to the Pope along with her husband's sword and spurs.|$|E
5|$|Personnel paraded through Uxbridge {{town centre}} on 28 November 2007, exercising {{the freedom of}} the borough granted to the station in 1960. RAF Uxbridge became a {{satellite}} station of RAF Northolt on 1 April 2008, in preparation for the eventual closure. In the final years of RAF ownership, the Service Prosecuting Authority and Civil Aviation Authority's UK Airprox Board (investigating air proximity incidents) was based in Hillingdon House. The final of the national Carnegie Champions schools rugby tournament was held at the station in August 2008. The link between RAF Uxbridge and the Royal Observer Corps was renewed in 2008 with the closure of RAF Bentley Priory and the relocation to Uxbridge of ROC memorabilia from the Priory Officers' Mess for <b>safekeeping</b> and display. The Royal Observer Corps had been stood down from operational duties in December 1995.|$|E
5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for <b>safekeeping</b> and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E
5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for <b>safekeeping.</b> A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1905–06, the Armenian-Tatar massacres {{broke out}} {{during which the}} ARF became {{involved}} in armed activities. Some sources claim that the Russian government incited the massacres in order to reinforce its authority during the revolutionary turmoil of 1905. The first outbreak of violence occurred in Baku, in February 1905. The ARF held the Russian authorities responsible for inaction and instigation of massacres {{that were part of}} a larger anti-Armenian policy. On May 11, 1905, Dashnak revolutionary Drastamat Kanayan assassinated Russian governor general Nakashidze, who was considered by the Armenian population as the main instigator of hate and confrontation between the Armenians and the Tatars. Unreliable protection from government is attributed to the Armenian bourgeoisie to turned to the ARF for protection. The Dashnak leaders argued that, given employment discrimination against Armenian workers in non-Armenian concerns, the defence provided to the Armenian bourgeoisie was essential to the <b>safekeeping</b> of employment opportunities for Armenian laborers. The Russian Tsar's envoy in the Caucasus, Vorontsov-Dashkov, reported that the ARF bore a major portion of responsibilities for perpetrating the massacres. The ARF, however, argued that it helped to organize the defence of the Armenian population against Muslim attacks. The blows suffered {{at the hands of the}} Dashnakist fighting squads proved a catalyst for the consolidation of the Muslim community of the Caucasus. During that period, the ARF regarded armed activity, including terror, as necessary for the achievement of political goals.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Indy recovers {{the cross}} {{off the coast}} of Portugal and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum. Later, Indy is {{introduced}} to Walter Donovan, who informs him that Indy's father, Henry Jones Sr., has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription as his guide. Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover the tomb of a First Crusade knight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, this one revealing the location of the Grail. They flee, however, when the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, and Indy tells him that his goal is only to find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail. Kazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Marcus later reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the pages containing the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for <b>safekeeping</b> and sends Marcus to İskenderun, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah, and he and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1775, Abu al-Dhahab, {{having been}} {{encouraged}} by the Porte to eradicate Zahir's influence, captured Jaffa and slaughtered its male inhabitants. News of the massacre spurred the people of Acre into a mass panic, with its residents fleeing and storing their goods in the city's Khan al-Ifranj (the French Caravanserai) for <b>safekeeping.</b> On 24 May, Zahir also departed the city, leaving for Sidon. Ali al-Zahir, subsequently entered it and declared himself governor. However, Ali's Maghrebi troops abandoned him and looted the city as Abu al-Dhahab's troops approached it a few days later. They proceeded to conquer Sidon by sea, prompting Zahir to seek shelter with Shia allies in Jabal Amil. Some of Zahir's sons attempted to secure their own peace with Abu al-Dhahab, but the latter became ill and died on 10 June, causing the collapse and chaotic withdrawal of his Egyptian troops from Acre. Zahir re-entered the city two days later and reestablished order {{with the assistance of}} Ahmad Agha al-Dinkizli. However, the setback of Abu al-Dhahab's death did not preclude the Sublime Porte from attempting to check Zahir's power and Sidon remained in Ottoman hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for <b>safekeeping</b> during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E
