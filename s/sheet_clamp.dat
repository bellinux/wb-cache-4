This classical setup has received considerable attention lately, being used by various experimental groups as a probe to measure the surface properties and stretching modulus of thin solid films. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, the geometric nonlinearity inherent in the mechanical response of thin solid objects renders the analysis of the resulting data a nontrivial task. Importantly, the essence of this difficulty is in the geometric coupling between in-plane stress and out-of-plane deformations, and hence is present in the behaviour of Hookean solids even when the slope of the deformed membrane remains small. Here we take a systematic approach to address this problem, using the membrane limit of the Föppl-von-Kármán equations.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{metal welding}} (USMW) for battery tabs must be {{performed}} with 100 % reliability in battery pack manufacturing as {{the failure of}} a single weld essentially results in a battery that is inoperative or cannot deliver the required power due to the electrical short caused by the failed weld. In ultrasonic metal welding processes, high-frequency ultrasonic energy is used to generate an oscillating shear force (sonotrode force) at the interface between a sonotrode and few metal sheets to produce solid-state bonds between the <b>sheets</b> <b>clamped</b> under a normal force. These forces, which influence the power needed to produce the weld and the weld quality, strongly depend on the mechanical and structural properties of the weld parts and fixtures in addition to various welding process parameters, such as weld frequencies and amplitudes. In this work, the effect of structural vibration of the battery tab on the required sonotrode force during ultrasonic welding is studied by applying a longitudinal vibration model for the battery tab. It is found that the sonotrode force is greatly influenced by the kinetic properties, quantified by the equivalent mass, equivalent stiffness, and equivalent viscous damping, of the battery tab and cell pouch interface. This study provides a fundamental understanding of battery tab dynamics during ultrasonic welding and its effect on weld quality, and thus provides a guideline for design and welding of battery tabs from tab dynamics point of view. © 2014 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA thin <b>sheet</b> <b>clamped</b> at {{opposite}} ends and stretched develops wrinkles parallel to {{the direction of the}} applied tensile strain due to the hindered Poisson lateral contraction at the clamps. To study this phenomenon, a variational model recently proposed by Puntel, Deseri and Fried is adopted. The relevant energy functional includes bending and membranal contributions and is minimized subject to a constraint on the area of the mid-surface of the sheet. A fourth order partial-differential equation is henceforth obtained and numerically implemented using B-splines. Predictions are obtained concerning the number of wrinkles, critical applied stretches, and scaling relationships for wrinkle amplitude and wavelength. Both a linearized version of the boundary-value problem based on the small-slope approximation and a fully nonlinear one are considered: their results are found to be in good agreement for the whole range of applied stretches taken into account. Comparisons with previous analytical results by Puntel, Deseri and Fried, who used different boundary conditions and an Ansatz on the deflection function are also provided. The numerical results substantially confirm the validity of the analytical predictions. The present work provides then an alternative numerical method for the study of wrinkling in thin sheets and supports the use of analytical and semi-analytical solutions as viable options for specific geometries. Though further investigation, particularly experimental, is still needed, extensive comparisons of the results with other studies available in the literature provide confirmation for the scaling laws and signal that predicted values of the critical stretches may only be accurate for higher length-to-width aspect ratios...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Incremental Sheet Forming is a {{flexible}} process characterized by low costs and higher process times {{with respect to}} traditional forming technologies. It is therefore suitable for prototypes, small series or custom mass productions. Its flexibility derives {{from the use of}} a hemispherical punch that is moved by a CNC machine and gradually deforms the sheet in presence, or not, of a counter die. As a consequence, the <b>sheet</b> <b>clamping</b> is reduced and the part accuracy is lower than traditional sheet forming process as stamping. Therefore, the improvement of the part accuracy in Incremental Sheet Forming is a relevant research topic and solutions for error reduction are required for improving the process quality. The present paper describes the use of an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm for compensating the ISF part geometrical error. In particular, it iteratively corrects the part geometry {{on the basis of the}} error map obtained as the difference between formed and target part geometries. The ILC uses the target geometry to form a first trial part, it measures the obtained geometry and estimates the geometrical error map. Then the error map is used to modify the target geometry and another part is formed. This procedure gets iterated until the desired geometrical tolerance is achieved. The correction algorithm was experimentally tested in forming both axisymmetric and not axisymmetric parts using aluminum sheets. Results showed that in few iteration steps it was possible to significantly improve the part accuracy and to achieve geometrical tolerances comparable with the traditional sheet forming processes...|$|R

40|$|Superficial {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used in industrial applications {{in order to improve}} the superficial properties of metallic components. In particular, in the aeronautic field, all the components are coated in order to prevent both corrosion and wear. In this field, heat treatable aluminum alloys, in age hardened condition, are used; consequently, superficial coatings must be carried out through “cold” processes, i. e. coating processes in which the component to be coated remains at low temperatures, below 100 °C. Cold gas dynamic spray technique (CGDS) is a process of deposition that consists in the realization of surface coatings with high-velocity metal particles sprayed on the substrate at temperature significantly lower than the melting one of the substrate itself and at relatively low temperatures if compared to other spray techniques. When processing conditions are optimized, the process can produce near fully dense coatings. This technique could be particularly useful in the coating of rolled sheets, needing of successive cold plastic deformations. One of the cold plastic processes is incremental forming, a high flexible process for rapid manufacturing of complex sheet metal part shapes; it presents the potential to be easy to automate and particularly attractive for small batches and customized parts.

For a fixed weld pitch of 0. 48, the effect of gap, i. e. the spacing between two sheets at the butt joint interface, on the joint quality of AA 6061 was evaluated in terms of the welding defects, microstructure, hardness and bend performance. Fully penetrated welds without metallurgical defects such as wormholes were obtained up to a joint gap of 0. 5 mm. Though the overall microhardness and bend performance of the welds remained unaffected until a joint gap of 0. 8 mm, the decrease in the forge force during FSW beyond a joint gap value of 0. 5 mm may represent a more critical limit in regards to the industrial application of the process; this is especially important when applying force control during processing to ensure a constant shoulder penetration in the material for addressing practical considerations, such as thickness variations in the assembly, clamping distortions and tool wear.

With a favorable strength-to-weight ratio and a high specific internal surface area, sandwich panels with metal foam cores are proposed for actively cooled load-bearing components in aerospace thermal protection system applications. First, inconel foam sandwich panels are subjected, via experimental means, to through-the-thickness thermal gradients, defined by fixed temperature conditions on opposite face <b>sheets.</b> With <b>clamped</b> boundary conditions, provided through a test fixture designed to minimize the common conflict of thermal and mechanical boundary conditions in experimental apparatus, the metal foam sandwich panels exhibit out-of-plane bending deformation.

The ice <b>sheet</b> is <b>clamped</b> {{to the walls}} of the channel. The thickness of the ice plate is constant. Deflections of the ice sheet are described by the linear elastic plate equation. The hydroelastic waves in the channel are combinations of waves propagating along the channel and sloshing waves. The problem is formulated with respect to the wave profiles across the channel. The problem is solved by the normal mode method for a channel of finite depth and by using the shallow water approximation for a channel of small depth. The dispersion relations of the hydroelastic waves and the characteristics of these waves are determined. It is shown that the shallow water approximation predicts well the dispersion relations for long waves. The dispersion relation for the wave, which does not oscillate across the channel, is well approximated by the corresponding dispersion relation of one-dimensional hydroelastic waves in an unbounded ice sheet. The wave profiles across the channel and the distributions of strains in the ice sheet are investigated. It is shown that the strains are maximum at the walls for long waves and at the centreline of the channel for short waves. The bending stresses across the channel are higher than the stresses along the channel for the conditions of the present study. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Shearing is {{the process}} where sheet metal is {{mechanically}} cut between two tools. Various shearing technologies are commonly used in the sheet metal industry, for example, in cut to length lines, slitting lines, end cropping etc. Shearing has speed and cost advantages over competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment and large strains in the sheet material. The constant development of sheet metals toward higher strength and formability leads to increased forces on the shearing equipment and tools. Shearing of new sheet materials imply new suitable shearing parameters. Investigations of the shearing parameters through live tests in the production are expensive and separate experiments are time consuming and requires specialized equipment. Studies involving {{a large number of}} parameters and coupled effects are therefore preferably performed by finite element based simulations. Accurate experimental data is still a prerequisite to validate such simulations. There is, however, a shortage of accurate experimental data to validate such simulations. In industrial shearing processes, measured forces are always larger than the actual forces acting on the sheet, due to friction losses. Shearing also generates a force that attempts to separate the two tools with changed shearing conditions through increased clearance between the tools as result. Tool clearance is also the most common shearing parameter to adjust, depending on material grade and sheet thickness, to moderate the required force and to control the final sheared edge geometry. In this work, an experimental procedure that provides a stable tool clearance together with accurate measurements of tool forces and tool displacements, was designed, built and evaluated. Important shearing parameters and demands on the experimental set-up were identified in a sensitivity analysis performed with finite element simulations under the assumption of plane strain. With respect to large tool clearance stability and accurate force measurements, a symmetric experiment with two simultaneous shears and internal balancing of forces attempting to separate the tools was constructed. Steel sheets of different strength levels were sheared using the above mentioned experimental set-up, with various tool clearances, <b>sheet</b> <b>clamping</b> and rake angles. Results showed that tool penetration before fracture decreased with increased material strength. When one side of the sheet was left unclamped and free to move, the required shearing force decreased but instead the force attempting to separate the two tools increased. Further, the maximum shearing force decreased and the rollover increased with increased tool clearance. Digital image correlation was applied to measure strains on the sheet surface. The obtained strain fields, together with a material model, were used to compute the stress state in the sheet. A comparison, up to crack initiation, of these experimental results with corresponding results from finite element simulations in three dimensions and at a plane strain approximation showed that effective strains on the surface are representative also for the bulk material. A simple model was successfully applied to calculate the tool forces in shearing with angled tools from forces measured with parallel tools. These results suggest that, with respect to tool forces, a plane strain approximation is valid also at angled tools, at least for small rake angles. In general terms, this study provide a stable symmetric experimental set-up with internal balancing of lateral forces, for accurate measurements of tool forces, tool displacements, and sheet deformations, to study the effects of important shearing parameters. The results give further insight to the strain and stress conditions at crack initiation during shearing, and {{can also be used to}} validate models of the shearing process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableDue to {{the rising}} number of {{explosion}} attacks, the need for blast resistant structures has increased greatly. Many materials have been tested for blast retrofit design but have shown to have limitation. The focus {{of this research is}} on the analysis of using steel sheets as a method for retrofit design. These sheets are thin and take up little space, have a large amount of energy absorption capability, and the installation process is quick and easy to perform in the field. For optimum blast retrofit design, the development of the sheathing's full capacity is controlled by its connection capacity. Structures, such as CMU walls, with low resistance to blast loading and that fail under external pressure of approximately 0. 30 psi can benefit from these retrofit sheathings that increase the wall system's ductility and energy absorption. A CMU wall retrofitted with such method can resist blast loads as high as 40 psi. The tests results are used to develop design recommendation for improved performance. The axial tension that the samples will be subjected to is meant to simulate how steel sheets would react when resisting a blast load on a structure. The energy absorbed from the tests is found after plotting the pressure-displacement graphs of each sample, and then calculating the area under the curve. The parameters that are varied in these tests include two different clamping plate thicknesses, and alterations to the steel <b>sheets.</b> The <b>clamping</b> plate design is also varied to prevent premature failure at the sharp edges and corners. This project presents the experimental evaluation of steel sheet retrofit of CMU walls to resist blast loading. College of Engineering Undergraduate Research Optio...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry stretch forming {{is often used to}} produce skin parts. During stretch forming a <b>sheet</b> is <b>clamped</b> at two sides and stretched over a die, such that the sheet gets the shape of the die. However for complex shapes it is necessary to use expensive intermediate heat-treatments in between, in order to avoid Lüders lines and still achieve large deformations. To optimize this process FEM simulations are performed. The accuracy of finite element analysis depends largely on the material models that describe the work hardening during stretching and residual stresses and work hardening reduction during heat treatments due to recovery and particle coarsening. In this paper, a physically based material modeling approach used to simulate the stretch forming with intermediate heat treatments and its predictive capabilities is verified. The work hardening effect during stretching is calculated using the dislocation density based Nes model and the particle coarsening and static recovery effects are modeled with simple expressions based on physical observations. For comparison the simulations are also performed with a phenomenological approach of work hardening using a power law. The Vegter yield function is used to account for the anisotropic and biaxial behavior of the aluminum sheet. A leading edge skin part, made of AA 2024 has been chosen for the study. The strains in the part have been measured and are used for validation of the simulations. From the used FEM model and the experimental results, satisfactory results are obtained for the simulation of stretching of aircraft skins with intermediate heat treatments and it is concluded that the physics based material modeling gives better results...|$|R
40|$|Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is a forming {{technique}} of sheet material based on layered manufacturing principles. The sheet part is locally deformed through horizontal slices. The moving locus of forming tool (called as toolpath) in these slices constructed to the finished part {{was performed by}} the CNC technology. The toolpath was created directly from CAD model of final product. The forming tool is a Ball-end forming tool, which was moved along the toolpath while the edges of <b>sheet</b> material were <b>clamped</b> rigidly on fixture. This paper presented an investigation study of thinning distribution of a conical shapes carried out by incremental forming and the validation of finite element method to evaluate {{the limits of the}} process as regards to the geometry of the final product. Three conical products have been carried out during this study with different forming angles and depth. The process was simulated using FEM program (ANSYS 11. 0) and the results showed that the deviations between simulated and real values did not exceed of 6 %...|$|R
