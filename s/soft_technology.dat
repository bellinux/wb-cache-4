According to Albertson (1992) [...] "It is {{the structure and}} process of social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations, making choices, and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change. As with hard technology, the appropriate <b>soft</b> <b>technology</b> {{is related to the}} villages being able to organize, operate, and maintain the technology with a minimum of outside technical assistance (e.g., from professional social workers).

These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> into their designs. The {{goal is to}} endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied animals. Incorporating <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural environments.

40|$|Past {{empirical}} studies {{have investigated the}} effect of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> on different measures of performance in the operations area. The term ‘hard technologies’ refers to hardware and the associated software consisting of technologies such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines, flexible manufacturing systems, robotics, etc., whilst ‘soft technologies’ refers to manufacturing techniques and know-how and includes Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing and Total Quality Management (TQM). Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) conceptualization of the firm as a bundle of resources, this study argues {{that the relationship between}} hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> and competitive performance can be additive and interactive. Hence it seeks to advance previous studies in two main ways. Firstly, differing from previous studies that generally consider the effects of either hard or <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> on manufacturing performance, this study brings the two types of resources (hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies)</b> into one study and examines their additive effects. As suggested by the RBV, {{it is important to understand}} the unique roles of the different types of resources on improving different types of performance. Investigating these unique effects is important in guiding managers to align the types of resources and the competitive goals pursued by firms. Secondly, this study investigates the interaction between hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> in predicting different types of manufacturing performance. Drawing on the RBV, the concept of complementarity, and Socio-Technical System (STS) Theory, this study examines how the interaction between these two types of resources can be synergistic; this occurs when one resource magnifies the impact of another, multiplying the common effect. However, to date there have been very few {{empirical studies}} examining the effects of synergistic relationships between hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> on multiple types of manufacturing performance. In addition, this study investigates the effects of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> on different types of performance in the context of an emerging economy, Thailand. Most research has been conducted in the context of advanced economies. There have been very few studies aimed at understanding operations management issues in emerging economies. Hence research is needed to examine whether findings from studies conducted in advanced economies also apply in emerging economies such as Thailand’s. A two-phase design was implemented in this research. The first phase comprised a quantitative, self-administered mail survey, completed by managers from 186 manufacturing plants in Thailand. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test 12 hypotheses about the effects of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> on cost, product quality, lead time and flexibility performance. In the second phase, qualitative interviews were conducted with eight senior/middle managers from four plants to explore and further integrate the quantitative findings in greater depth. There are two major findings from this study relating to the drivers of high performance that have implications for the operations management discipline and practitioners. Firstly, hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> are shown as significantly and positively related to the four types of manufacturing performance (cost, product quality, lead time and flexibility performance), hence emphasizing the importance of both hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> and confirming their additive relationship. The results also suggest that hard technologies have a relatively stronger relationship with flexibility, cost, and lead time, whilst <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> have a stronger relationship with product quality. This study therefore highlights the importance of understanding the unique roles of resources in improving different types of performance as suggested by the RBV. It also offers useful insight into firms’ technology justification. Secondly, the significant, positive interaction between hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> in predicting the four types of manufacturing performance represents the synergistic relationships between these two types of technologies. This study has found that development of either hard or <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> may be sufficient for incrementally improving performance. Akin to the RBV, the concept of complementarity and the STS, consideration of the synergistic relationship between hard and <b>soft</b> <b>technologies</b> offers an opportunity for multiplying their common effect. Because many manufacturing firms have invested enormous capital in manufacturing technologies over the last three decades, it is important for decision makers to understand costs and benefits from the usage and applicability of these technologies to their companies. Additionally, the results also confirm that the RBV, the concept of complementarity and the STS, originally developed in advanced economies, are applicable in an emerging economy such as Thailand...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the empirical {{evidence for the}} transferability of Japanese <b>soft</b> <b>technology</b> (JST) or Japanese work organisation within two government-initiated, Malaysian-Japanese strategic alliances: PROTON and PERNEC. The government, through its Look East Policy (LEP) began in 1982, taking Japan (and South Korea) as models and partners in Malaysian economic and industrial development process, and expected these alliances to learn the good aspects of Japanese work organisations and management styles {{in order for them}} to become independent companies, both technologically and economically. The thesis found that the alliances have been successfully taking and utilising Japanese parts, components, tools, robots and machines; i. e. the 'ready-made hard technology'. [Whereas the important element of <b>soft</b> <b>technology</b> has been ignored]. The <b>soft</b> <b>technology</b> has been slowly and marginally transferred because neither local parties nor their Japanese counterparts within the alliances consider the acquisition or transfer of <b>soft</b> <b>technology</b> to be the main concern or a part of business plan. Although many factors influence management transfer, the thesis has focused on the eagerness and the capability of Malaysian managerial teams to acquire and, to a lesser extent, the readiness of the Japanese to transfer the technology. It was found that there is a lack of demand on technology acquisition by Malaysian managers and lack of responsibility to transfer the technology among Japanese experts. However, the political and social pressures on these alliances, the industrial climate and labour market, leaderships and management system of alliances, and Japanese MNCs regional and global corporate strategies have contributed to the high level of transfer of JST at PROTON compared to PERNEC. The research also found that Malaysian industrial and investment policies have favoured foreign investment but there is a lack of strategies for nurturing indigenous technological development. On the other hand the Japanese MNCs and public agencies have been operating in Malaysia and guided by their regional and global corporate strategies and less concerned with Malaysian technological development. In conclusion, empirically, the JST transfer is minimal. The transfer has been influenced by internal contingency factors of organisation; external industrial, political and cultural environmental factors; and last but not least the Japanese MNCs' global and regional corporate strategies. The transfer of Japanese management in this research is inclined towards core-periphery transfer model, it is also related to organisational and national technological capability...|$|E
