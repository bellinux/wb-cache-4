5|$|She went on {{to appear}} in Peter Pan, a 1951 Broadway revival adapted from the 1904 J.M. Barrie play. She starred {{in the title role}} in a touring company {{production}} in 1951, succeeding Jean Arthur. The play was not a musical, and was different from the <b>subsequent</b> <b>version</b> starring Mary Martin a few years later, but had five songs by Leonard Bernstein. Captain Hook was played by Boris Karloff. Her performance in Peter Pan was praised by critics, and it was her favorite acting role.|$|E
5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the <b>subsequent</b> <b>version</b> 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no {{intervening}} version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{looking for}} ways to further improve its {{electronic}} forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, with the intention of incorporating OCR functionality into its forms products. The acquisition deal fell through, though by Fall 1992 Delrina had made a deal with Caere Corporation to include its AnyFax OCR software within its products. This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the <b>subsequent</b> <b>version</b> of WinFax used Xerox's TextBridge OCR engine instead.|$|E

25|$|Some {{incompatibilities}} {{have been}} removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard (C99), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (//), and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced {{a number of new}} features that C++ did not support, were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as variable-length arrays, native complex-number types (however, the std::complex class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers, compound literals, and the restrict keyword. Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the <b>subsequent</b> <b>version</b> of the C++ standard, C++11 (out of those which were not redundant). However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C.|$|E
500|$|HDMI {{devices are}} {{manufactured}} {{to adhere to}} various versions of the specification, in which each version is given a number or letter, such as 1.0, 1.2, or 1.4b. Each <b>subsequent</b> <b>version</b> of the specification uses {{the same kind of}} cable but increases the bandwidth or capabilities of what can be transmitted over the cable. A product listed as having an HDMI version {{does not necessarily mean that}} it will have all of the features that are listed for that version, since some HDMI features are optional, such as deep color and xvYCC (which is branded by Sony as [...] "x.v.Color"). [...] Note that with the release of the version 1.4 cable, the HDMI Licensing LLC group (which oversees the HDMI standard) will require that any reference to version numbers be removed from all packaging and advertising for the cable. Non-cable HDMI products starting on January 1, 2012 will no longer be allowed to reference the HDMI number and will be required to state which features of the HDMI specification the product implements.|$|E
500|$|Gabriel {{wanted the}} album to [...] "crash {{open at the}} front" [...] and despite disliking [...] "metal" [...] {{percussion}} instruments, he was persuaded by Lanois to allow The Police's Stewart Copeland to play cymbals and hi-hat on its opener, [...] "Red Rain". The track sees Gabriel sing in his upper register with a throaty, gravely texture, of a destructive world with social problems such as torture and kidnapping. Its concept originated from a dream in which he envisaged the parting of a vast, red sea and human-like glass bottles filling up with blood. It was also intended to continue the story of Mozo, a recurring character in Gabriel's first and second albums. The second track, [...] "Sledgehammer", was the final track to be conceived of. Although most of Gabriel's band had packed away their equipment and were ready to leave the studio, Gabriel asked them to reassemble to quickly run through a song he had an idea for. [...] "Sledgehammer" [...] was partially inspired by the music of Otis Redding, and Gabriel sought out Wayne Jackson, whom Gabriel had seen on tour with Redding in the 1960s, to record horns for the track. Opened by a shakuhachi bamboo flute, its beat is dominated by brass instruments, particularly Jackson's horn, and features lyrics abundant with sexual euphemisms. Manu Katché's drums were recorded in one take as he believed any <b>subsequent</b> <b>version</b> would be inferior to his original interpretation of the music.|$|E
