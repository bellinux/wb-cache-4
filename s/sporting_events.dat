40|$|Abstract: Although <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> are {{considered}} a new field for urban and economic development, besides certain advantages that are obtained by hosting <b>sports</b> <b>events,</b> there are also many dangers. Upon considering the effects of <b>sports</b> <b>events,</b> studies on low-accuracy <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> are heavily relied on. These analyses often exaggerate advantages, underestimate costs and make an improper use of statistics. It appears that there positive effects and especially, financial advantages of <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> have often been exaggerated so that financial profits are often estimated too high, and costs are understated. By considering existing evidences and literature, this study aims to find an answer for this question: How much true are the topics propounded as to {{the positive effects of}} <b>sports</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Sports</b> <b>events</b> {{represent}} a major category of event revenue contributing economic benefits to cities and regions. Attendance at <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> is recognised {{as an important}} activity (Shamir and Ruskin 1984), {{but over the past}} 20 years <b>sports</b> <b>event</b> attendance expenditure has declined (Ross 2006). Consequently, understanding the factors that influence <b>sports</b> <b>event</b> attendance is crucial to the sustainability of these events. This study identifies the antecedents of <b>sports</b> <b>event</b> attendance among 460 respondents who were surveyed in Melbourne, Australia.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} {{suggests that there is}} a relationship between the image of a destination and its <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> and that their common image associations lead to an image fit. This study aims to empirically explore the destination image, <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> image and the image fit, dividing them in cognitive and affective components, among spectators of <b>sport</b> <b>events.</b> Also, the interrelationships between these images are studied to fully grasp the dynamic relationship between event image and destination image. For this purpose, a survey was conducted among spectators (n= 140) of three running events held in three different cities in the Netherlands. The findings indicate that there is a moderate strong interrelationship between the images of a destination and its <b>sport</b> <b>event,</b> which leads to a positive cognitive and affective image fit. Policymakers should, therefore, focus on organizing <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> that match the positive characteristics of the destination in order to create more positive <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> images, as destination images and <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> images are not formed separately from each other...|$|R

40|$|Outside the {{high-profile}} mega types, the ubiquity {{and breadth of}} <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> can paradoxically make them less obvious choices for research. In addition, the overwhelming studies in <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> tend to involve economic impact analyses and consequently miss the many issues and additional impacts that such events engender. In reviewing the literature related {{to the study of}} <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> it become apparent {{that there has been a}} notable lack of critical commentary exploring the problems associated with applying traditional <b>event</b> categories to <b>sport</b> <b>events.</b> Moreover there is a deficiency of information concerning particular event types such as those associated with smaller events, along with those connected to parades and festivals. Therefore the aims of this chapter are twofold: first to introduce and evaluate current <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> typologies, and second to present an argument for <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> to be treated separately because of their complexity and nature. It will be contended that are two elements of distinction – a taxonomical distinction related to the specific criteria adopted for <b>sport</b> <b>events,</b> as well as an innate distinctiveness that aims to illustrate the special nature of <b>sport</b> <b>events.</b> For the sake of simplicity and clarity these two themes will be explored separately though it is acknowledged there will be some obvious overlaps...|$|R

40|$|Sport {{has become}} a highly {{valuable}} “product” that is typically commercialized via <b>sports</b> <b>events.</b> Diverse types of income generated from <b>sports</b> <b>events,</b> especially from the international ones, raise stimulating income tax issues. These issues constitute {{the subject of the}} Thesis, which is divided into two main parts: (I) income deriving from an international <b>sports</b> <b>event</b> and (II) taxation of the income concerned. The main purpose of the first Part is to identify the main income sources, of both individuals and enterprises, which may derive from an international <b>sports</b> <b>event.</b> The second Part relates to the taxation modalities mainly based on the OECD Model of the income sources identified in the Part I. The analysis made throughout the Thesis demonstrates the uncertainty prevailing in this particular area of international tax law. As a remedy, the adoption of “International <b>Sports</b> <b>Events</b> Tax Exemptions Acts”, “International <b>Sports</b> <b>Events</b> Taxation Acts” and/or detailed general explanatory reports on the relevant tax law rules (all on a domestic law level) is suggested...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} to examine the {{influence}} of the popularity of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> (high vs low) on college students’ perception of sponsorship (authenticity of sponsorship and attitude on sponsorship), sponsor image, sponsor attitude and job preference to the sponsor. Also, this study analyzes the relations among perception of sponsorship, sponsor image, sponsor attitude and job preference through structural equation model and examine if the popularity of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> has significant effect on causal path among them. The subjects were college students and 382 copies of questionnaire which included sponsorship scenario of popular <b>sport</b> <b>event,</b> basketball, and non-popular <b>sport</b> <b>event,</b> curling, were selected as final valid samples out of 400 copies collected by convenience sampling. The collected data were analyzed by using Window SPSS ver. 15. 0 and AMOS 7. 0. The results are as follows. First, there is significant differences between popular <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> sponsorship and non-popular <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> sponsorship on sponsorship attitude, sponsor image, sponsor attitude and job preference : Sponsorship for non-popular <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> gets the more positive response than popular <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> sponsorship. Second, sponsorship perception has positive influences on sponsor image and sponsor attitude. Also, both of sponsor image and sponsor attitude have positive influence on job preference. However, sponsorship perception has no significant effect on job preference. Third, the popularity of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> has no significant effect on the causal path between perception of sponsorship and sponsor image, between perception of sponsorship and sponsor attitude, and between sponsor image and job preference.
