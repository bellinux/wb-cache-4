5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

40|$|The {{solidification}} of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> is a crosslinking reaction called vulcanization. It {{follows that}} the physical and mechanical properties of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> increase significantly due {{to the growth of}} molecular weight and were affected strongly by the vulcanization process, such as the temperatures and times for curing. In this study, the kinetics of the crosslinking reaction of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> was investigated by two current techniques: differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and oscillating disk rheometry (ODR). From the kinetic experimental data, different kinetic analysis methods were used to determine the activation energy of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers,</b> such as the Kissinger, the Ozawa, the Friedman, the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and the integral methods. The results show the influence of the chemical composition of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers,</b> the current technique used and the applied kinetic analysis methods on the activation energy and the evolution of activation energy during the crosslinking reaction...|$|R

25|$|The Cronin–Gerow Implant, {{prosthesis}} model 1963, was a <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> envelope-sac, {{shaped like}} a teardrop, which was filled with viscous silicone-gel.

25|$|PCBs {{intended}} for extreme environments {{often have a}} conformal coating, which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were wax; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber,</b> polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be sputtered onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> dildos {{became more}} popular, {{a trend that}} has {{continued}} as the prices have lowered.

Silicone holds body heat well, and is an excellent conductor of vibrations, allowing users to hold a vibrator at one end. Silicone is also a robust material (especially when compared to the cheap, unsafe jelly rubber that many dildos are made of) that can be sterilized by boiling or bleaching (using a bleach solution, diluted: 10% bleach 90% water).|$|E
25|$|The cup is etched and pitted due to {{the effect}} of {{corrosive}} cleaning deposits; however, remnants of silver chloride and black silver sulphide survive in crevices. A crack runs from the rim, around the figure of the boy on one side. The base is distorted and broken with the pedestal having been pushed up, denting the cup and causing the cup to lean at an angle. The damage to the base was in modern times, thought to have occurred when the cup was cleaned in the 20th century. The foot was soldered back on to the cup in modern times. It is thought that the cup was moulded twice in modern times due to remains of plaster and <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> found in crevices.|$|E

These dyes were characterized by UV-Vis, 1 H-NMR, FT-IR, and MS. The obtained reactive disperse silicon-containing dyes were used to color <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> and the color fastness of the dyes were evaluated. The dry/wet rubbing and washing fastnesses of these dyes all reached 4 – 5 grade and the sublimation fastness was also above 4 grade, indicating outstanding performance in terms of color fastness.

50|$|Silicone resins {{represent}} {{a broad range}} of products. Materials of molecular weight in the range of 1000-10,000 are very useful in pressure-sensitive adhesives, <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers,</b> coatings and additives. Polysiloxane polymers with reactive side group functionality such as vinyl, acrylate, epoxy, mercaptan or amine, are used to create thermoset polymer matrix composites, coatings and adhesives.|$|R
25|$|Most dry {{materials}} in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, {{can have a}} coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always < 1, {{but this is not}} true. While in most relevant applications µ < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.|$|E
25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} the wrists and neck. The seals are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, but are also available in <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber.</b> Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{made from}} latex rubber, most modern endotracheal tubes today are {{constructed}} of polyvinyl chloride. Tubes constructed of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber,</b> wire-reinforced <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> or stainless steel {{are also available}} for special applications. For human use, tubes {{range in size from}} [...] in internal diameter. The size is chosen based on the patient's body size, with the smaller sizes being used for infants and children. Most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to children (in small children, the cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion of the airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation).|$|E

40|$|Rubber molding is a {{critical}} step in the investment casting process.

The introduction of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> was a breakthrough in the traditional natural rubber molding technique, improving mold life cycle and, most of all, providing the opportunity to choose different material properties {{as a consequence of the}} pattern geometry. In this study, different <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> with modified thermal behavior (and more specifically thermal conductivity) were produced and developed. In doing so, it was possible to get better performing silicone molds that were less affected by thermal aging.

500|$|Main {{character}} {{heads were}} initially sculpted in either Plasticine or clay. Once the general aspect had been finalised, this {{served as the}} template for a <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> mould. This was coated with Bondaglass (fibreglass mixed with resin) and enhanced with Bondapaste, a putty-like substance, to accentuate contours. The Bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid, leather mouth parts and plastic eyes, as well as incisor teeth– a first for a Supermarionation production. Puppets known as [...] "revamps", which had plastic heads, portrayed the supporting characters. These marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes; their faces were remoulded from one episode to the next. Particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and, as their numbers increased, photographed to compile an internal casting directory.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "armored" [...] endotracheal {{tubes are}} cuffed, wire-reinforced <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> tubes. They {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, {{which can be used}} for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway.|$|E
500|$|After test-sculpting in Plasticine, {{the puppet}} heads were moulded on a <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> base and made using fibreglass. At heights ranging from 20 to 24inches (approximately one-third life-size) the {{next-generation}} puppets were no shorter than their predecessors. For previous series, puppet eyes had been sized {{out of proportion}} to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in Captain Scarlet, the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets. As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including [...] "smilers", [...] "frowners" [...] and [...] "blinkers". Since episodes of Captain Scarlet were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the Century 21 Studios, duplicates were made of the [...] "expressionless" [...] template of each main character. For the pilot episode, an [...] "agony" [...] head was specially sculpted for the Captain Scarlet puppet for a brief reaction shot of Scarlet's Mysteron double being shot by Captain Blue.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "silicone" [...] is {{actually}} a misnomer. The suffix -one is used by chemists to denote a substance with a double-bonded atom of oxygen in its backbone.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design, produce and {{evaluate}} a demonstrator to visualize the magneto-induced damping behaviour of materials. In contrast to standard materials, the damping coefficient of iron particle filled <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> can be controlled by a semi-active magnetic field. This field effect should be characterized in order to evaluate the suitability of these magnetorheological silicone elastomers for the use in different configurations and applications...|$|R
2500|$|Tone {{holes are}} stopped by pads {{constructed}} of fish skin (gold-beater's skin) over felt or <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> on some very low-cost or “ruggedized” flutes. Accurate shimming of pads on professional flutes to ensure pad sealing is very demanding of technician time. In the time-honored method, pads are seated on paper shims sealed with shellac. A recent development is [...] "precision" [...] pads fitted by a factory-trained technician. Student flutes {{are more likely}} to have pads bedded in thicker materials like wax or hot melt glue. Larger-sized closed-hole pads are also held in with screws and washers. Synthetic pads appear more water-resistant but may be susceptible to mechanical failure (cracking).|$|E
2500|$|A port (often {{referred}} to by brand names such as Port-a-Cath or MediPort) is a central venous line {{that does not have}} an external connector; instead, it has a small reservoir that is covered with <b>silicone</b> <b>rubber</b> and is implanted under the skin. Medication is administered intermittently by placing a small needle through the skin, piercing the silicone, into the reservoir. [...] When the needle is withdrawn the reservoir cover reseals itself. [...] The cover can accept hundreds of needle sticks during its lifetime. [...] It is possible to leave the ports in the patient's body for years; if this is done however, the port must be accessed monthly and flushed with an anti-coagulant, or the patient risks it getting plugged up. [...] If it is plugged it becomes a hazard as a thrombus will eventually form with an accompanying risk of embolisation. [...] Removal of a port is usually a simple outpatient procedure; however, installation is more complex and a good implant is fairly dependent on the skill of the radiologist. Ports cause less inconvenience and have a lower risk of infection than PICCs, and are therefore commonly used for patients on long-term intermittent treatment.|$|E

40|$|A {{range of}} <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> were created based on {{existing}} commercially available materials. These silicones {{were designed to}} be visually {{different from one another}} and have distinct material properties, in particular, ultimate tensile strengths and tear strengths. In total, eleven <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> were manufactured, with the materials designed to have a range of increasing tensile strengths from approximately 2 to 4 MPa, and increasing tear strengths from approximately 0. 45 to 0. 7 N/mm. The variations in silicones were detected using a standard colour analysis technique. Calibration curves were then created relating colour intensity to individual material properties. All eleven materials were characterised and a 1 st order Ogden strain energy function applied. Material coefficients were determined and examined for effectiveness. Six idealised abdominal aortic aneurysm models were also created using the two base materials of the study, with a further model created using a new mixing technique to create a rubber model with randomly assigned material properties. These models were then examined using videoextensometry and compared to numerical results. Colour analysis revealed a statistically significant linear relationship (p< 0. 0009) with both tensile strength and tear strength, allowing material strength to be determined using a non-destructive experimental technique. The effectiveness of this technique was assessed by comparing predicted material properties to experimentally measured methods, with good agreement in the results. Videoextensometry and numerical modelling revealed minor percentage differences, with all results achieving significance (p< 0. 0009). This study has successfully designed and developed a range of <b>silicone</b> <b>rubbers</b> that have unique colour intensities and material strengths. Strengths can be readily determined using a non-destructive analysis technique with proven effectiveness. These silicones may further aid towards an improved understanding of the biomechanical behaviour of aneurysms using experimental techniques...|$|R
