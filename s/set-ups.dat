40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} prostate <b>set-up</b> accuracy and <b>set-up</b> margins with off-line bony anatomy-based imaging protocols, compared with online implanted fiducial marker-based imaging with daily corrections. Eleven patients were treated with implanted prostate fiducial markers and online <b>set-up</b> corrections. Pretreatment orthogonal electronic portal images were acquired to determine couch shifts and verification images were acquired during treatment to measure residual <b>set-up</b> error. The prostate <b>set-up</b> errors that would result from skin marker <b>set-up,</b> off-line bony anatomy-based protocols and online fiducial marker-based corrections were determined. <b>Set-up</b> margins were calculated for each <b>set-up</b> technique using the percentage of encompassed isocentres and a margin recipe. The prostate systematic <b>set-up</b> errors in the medial–lateral, superior–inferior and anterior–posterior directions for skin marker <b>set-up</b> were 2. 2, 3. 6 and 4. 5 mm (1 standard deviation). For our bony anatomy-based off-line protocol the prostate systematic <b>set-up</b> errors were 1. 6, 2. 5 and 4. 4 mm. For the online fiducial based <b>set-up</b> the results were 0. 5, 1. 4 and 1. 4 mm. A prostate systematic error of 10. 2 mm was uncorrected by the off-line bone protocol in one patient. <b>Set-up</b> margins calculated to encompass 98 % of prostate <b>set-up</b> shifts were 11 – 14 mm with bone off-line <b>set-up</b> and 4 – 7 mm with online fiducial markers. Margins from the van Herk margin recipe were generally 1 – 2 mm smaller. Bony anatomy-based <b>set-up</b> protocols improve the group prostate <b>set-up</b> error compared with skin marks; however, large prostate systematic errors can remain undetected or systematic errors increased for individual patients. The margin required for <b>set-up</b> errors was found to be 10 – 15 mm unless implanted fiducial markers are available for treatment guidance...|$|R

This is done to meet the market demands nowadays. PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti is using mass production as the production system. Now, PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti is producing folding chairs. To meet the demand, PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti needs a finishing time that is suitable for the definite time. The problem that is faced by PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti is the lateness time for finishing the folding chairs {{so that it does}} not meet the scheduled plan. The lateness in many departments makes finishing time unsuitable with the definite schedule. Because of the problem, PT Naga Bhuana Aneka Piranti should reduce the <b>set-up</b> time {{to solve the problem of}} lateness in finishing the folding chairs. Reducing <b>set-up</b> time can be done by using Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) method. The SMED method separates <b>set-up</b> time activities to become two activities, which are internal <b>set-up</b> and external <b>set-up.</b> Internal <b>set-up</b> is an activity that is only done when the machines are not operated. External <b>set-up</b> is an activity that can only be done when the machine is being operated. By changing internal <b>set-up</b> to become external <b>set-up,</b> then the <b>set-up</b> activities that is done when the machine is stopped can be done when the machine is operated so the time for the <b>set-up</b> can be minimized. The result of data analysis shows that by the application of SMED method, the <b>set-up</b> time of the production of folding chairs for each station can be reduced up to 11. 23 minutes/ day. The <b>set-up</b> time for each station before SMED application was 67. 73 minutes/ day, and after SMED application, it can be reduced to 56. 5 minutes/ day.

By acquiring multiple <b>set-up</b> images the systematic <b>set-up</b> deviation was evaluated. The effect of the systematic <b>set-up</b> deviation on the absorbed dose distribution was evaluated by 1) simulation in the treatment planning system and 2) measurements with a biplanar diode array.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel measurement <b>set-up</b> {{dedicated to the}} characterization {{of the evolution of}} the high-frequency shielding-effectiveness of gaskets due to corrosion and ageing. The measurement <b>set-up</b> is based on the recently introduced stripline <b>set-up</b> which has been validated previously up to 40 GHz. Compared to the original stripline <b>set-up,</b> the adapted <b>set-up</b> has a removable “clamping module” which can be easily mounted and removed from the <b>set-up.</b> The clamping module allows to age the gasket inside e. g. a climate chamber while always keeping the gasket under the same compression rate. As the clamping module can be made out of different materials, it allows to study the influence of shielding-effectiveness of gaskets when applied to different materials. In order to avoid parallel leakage inside the measurement <b>set-up,</b> a high-performant gasket needs to be compressed below the module. Based on full-wave simulations, it is shown that the shielding-effectiveness given by this gasket underneath the clamping module is the main determining factor for the dynamic range of the <b>set-up.</b> In addition, a first set of measurements show the validity of the measurement <b>set-up</b> and approach. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} <b>set-up</b> improvement {{caused by}} applying a couch height-based patient <b>set-up</b> method {{in combination with}} a technologist-driven off-line correction protocol in nonimmobilized radiotherapy of prostate patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A three-dimensional shrinking action level correction protocol is applied in two consecutive patient cohorts with different <b>set-up</b> methods: the traditional "laser set-up" group (n = 43) and the "couch height set-up" group (n = 112). For all directions, left-right, ventro-dorsal, and cranio-caudal, random and systematic <b>set-up</b> deviations were measured. RESULTS: The couch height <b>set-up</b> method improves the patient positioning compared to the laser <b>set-up</b> method. Without application of the correction protocol, both systematic and random errors reduced to 2. 2 - 2. 4 mm (1 SD) and 1. 7 - 2. 2 mm (1 SD), respectively. By using the correction protocol, systematic errors reduced further to 1. 3 - 1. 6 mm (1 SD). One-dimensional deviations were within 5 mm for > 90 % of the measured fractions. The required number of corrections per patient in the off-line correction protocol was reduced significantly {{during the course of}} treatment from 1. 1 to 0. 6 by the couch height <b>set-up</b> method. The treatment time was not prolonged by application of the correction protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The couch height <b>set-up</b> method improves the <b>set-up</b> significantly, especially in the ventro-dorsal direction.

30|$|Several {{previous}} researchers {{observed the}} <b>set-up</b> within 30  days after the pile installation day, and after that, {{the rate of}} change was very slow (e.g., [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]). The <b>set-up</b> value is related to soil characteristics, pile type and the installation technique. Pile <b>set-up</b> occurs in almost all types of soils including organic and inorganic clays, loose to medium dense silts, sandy silts, and fine sands [16, 17]. The <b>set-up</b> in granular soils typically depends on the depth of the ground water table (GWT). Svinkin [18] stated that the rate of <b>set-up</b> is linear with time above GWT, while the <b>set-up</b> with respect to the time is a power function below GWT. The increase in capacity was reported at approximately 100 % over 3  months in non-cohesive soils. In clay soils, the <b>set-up</b> is mainly related to reconsolidation of the disturbed soil around the pile, and aging [2]. Alternatively, pile <b>set-up</b> is also dependent on the driven pile types. The <b>set-up</b> was shown to be affected by the composition of piles (i.e., timber, concrete, steel, and composite piles) and the level of soil displacement induced during pile installation process which can be a function of pile size and type (e.g., H-piles, open-ended pipe piles, and closed-end pipe piles).|$|R

In the past, there has been very little guidance for incorporating pile <b>set-up</b> capacity in design. This may be due to large uncertainties involved in predicting the pile <b>set-up.</b> A comprehensive statistical database is developed to describe the <b>set-up</b> for piles driven into sand. Based on the collected pile testing data, pile <b>set-up</b> is significant and continues to develop for a long time after pile installation. The mechanisms of pile <b>set-up</b> in sand are discussed in detail. The statistical database shows that lognormal distribution can be used to properly describe the probabilistic characteristics of the predicted <b>set-up</b> capacity using Skov and Denver’s equation.
